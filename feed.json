      "Superstar singer Rihanna made her first appearance at the trial of her partner, rapper A$AP Rocky, and may have outshined key testimony in the case",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The most important testimony at the trial of rapper A$AP Rocky got second billing as the defendant\u2019s partner and the mother of their children sat quietly but shined bright like a diamond in the audience.",
      "Rihanna showed up at his Los Angeles trial \u2014 where he\u2019s charged with two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm \u2014 for the first time on Wednesday, sitting between his sister and mother as his former friend testified about the moment he alleges Rocky fired at him.",
      "The singing superstar was escorted in and out of the courtroom surreptitiously, and was already sitting in Rocky\u2019s section before the jurors and the media entered. It\u2019s not clear if the jurors noticed she was there, but all other eyes in the room shifted to her.",
      "Wearing a long black dress with buttons that resembled an overcoat, she watched the proceedings calmly and periodically moved oversized, tortoiseshell glasses from atop her head to her eyes.",
      "The witness, who goes by A$AP Relli and was born Terell Ephron, described the night in November of 2021 when he and Rocky, their relationship straining, had a confrontation and scuffled on a Hollywood street, and Rocky pointed a gun at him before walking away.",
      "He testified Wednesday that he was shouting at Rocky as he walked after him, then Rocky pulled the gun again and held it in the air.",
      "\u201cHe turned around and then it was like BOOM!\u201d he told the jury. \u201cThe whole thing was like a movie, he kind of like pointed down and he shot the first shot.\u201d",
      "He said he felt a burning on his hand where a bullet grazed it.",
      "Rocky, whose legal name is Rakim Athelston Mayers, could get up to 24 years in prison. Wearing a tan sport coat and patterned tie, Rocky watched intently as Relli testified about the moment Rocky allegedly fired a gun at him on a Hollywood street in 2021.",
      "Rocky fired another shot that he didn't see because had hidden behind a mutual friend who was there with the rapper, who ran away after that.",
      "He said, \u201cI felt my hand hot,\u201d and later added, \u201cI was hit. Or I was grazed. I didn\u2019t have a hole or nothing.\u201d",
      "Rocky\u2019s lawyer, who will get to cross-examine Relli on Thursday, says the shots he fired were not even from a real gun \u2014 they were blanks from a starter pistol that he carried as a prop. The lawyer said Relli knew this, and that was why he was so fearless walking after him.",
      "\u201cOh it was a real gun,\u201d Relli testified under prosecution questioning, saying he knew because of his scraped hand.",
      "Since the shooting, and his decision to go to police and testify, he has gotten death threats and has been shunned as a snitch, he said, and the modest music management career he built fell apart.",
      "\u201cIt's been a living hell,\u201d Relli said.",
      "About an hour after the shooting, Relli returned to the scene and said he photographed and recovered two shell casings. Earlier, while responding to a report of a shooting, police did not find any.",
      "He sent a text to Rocky that was shown in court saying \u201cU try killing me.\u201d",
      "Rocky denied it in his reply.",
      "\u201cBro wtf is u talkin bout why u tell ppl I shot at u.\u201d",
      "He sent Rocky photos of the shell casings and his grazed hand.",
      "Rocky said he was making stuff up and speaking \u201call type of nonsense\u201d and was trying to \u201cextort\u201d him.",
      "Rocky and Rihanna, both 36, have two sons together: 2-year-old RZA Athelston Mayers and 1-year-old Riot Rose Mayers. Rihanna revealed she was pregnant with the younger boy after headlining the Super Bowl halftime show in 2023 with a visible baby bump.",
      "The singer and the rapper, who are both fashion moguls, first became close when he provided a verse to her 2012 song \u201cCockiness (Love It)\u201d and they performed it at the MTV Video Music Awards. They became a couple in 2020."

      "PARK CITY, Utah -- Incarcerated men in the Alabama prison system risked their safety to feed shocking footage of their horrifying living conditions to a pair of documentary filmmakers. The result is \u201cThe Alabama Solution,\u201d which premiered this week at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City.",
      "Filmmakers Andrew Jarecki and Charlotte Kaufman became interested in Alabama prisons in 2019. Jarecki, the filmmaker behind \u201cThe Jinx\u201d and \u201cCapturing the Friedmans,\u201d and Kaufman first gained access to the restricted grounds through a visit with a chaplain during a revival meeting held in the prison yards. There men pulled them aside and whispered shocking stories about the reality of life inside: forced labor, drugs, violence, intimidation, retaliation and the undisclosed truths behind many prisoner deaths.",
      "The Associated Press has written extensively about the problems in the state\u2019s prison system, including high rates of violence, low staffing, a plummeting parole rate and the use of pandemic funds to build a new supersized prison.",
      "This process eventually led them to incarcerated activists Melvin Ray and Robert Earl Council (also known as \u201cKinetik Justice\u201d) who had for years been trying to expose the horrifying conditions and deep- seated corruption across the system. They helped feed dispatches to the filmmakers with contraband cellphones.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re deeply concerned for their safety, and we have been since the first time we met them,\u201d said Kaufman. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing this work for decades and as you see in the film, they\u2019ve been retaliated against in very extreme ways. But there are lawyers who are ready to do wellness checks and visit them and respond to any sort of retaliation that may come.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday at the first showing of the film, she had Council on the phone listening in. They put the microphone up to the cellphone so that Council could speak.",
      "\u201cWe thank you all for listening, for being interested,\u201d Council said. \u201cOn behalf of the brothers of Alabama, I thank you all.\u201d",
      "Several family members of their incarcerated subjects were also in the audience, including Sandy Ray, the mother of Steven Davis, who died in 2019 at William E. Donaldson Correctional Facility, his face beaten beyond recognition. Prison officials said Davis was killed in self-defense because he didn\u2019t put down his weapons. The prisoners tell a vastly different story.",
      "Alelur \u201cAlex\u201d Duran, who spent 12 years in prison in New York, also helped produce the film. Jarecki said they wouldn't have taken on the subject without the expertise of someone who had been incarcerated.",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing in this film is going on all over the nation,\u201d Duran said.",
      "Also embedded in the story is Alabama\u2019s long history of contracting prisoners to do work at private companies from Burger King to Best Western, an issue that the AP investigated for over two years. The cheap, reliable labor force has generated more than $250 million for the state since 2000 \u2014 money garnished from prisoners\u2019 paychecks, the AP wrote in December. Parole numbers have also plummeted in recent years.",
      "\u201cWe want to show viewers the truth about a system that has been cloaked in secrecy,\u201d Jarecki said. \u201cWe hope the film sparks an effort to allow access for journalists and others so the public can have transparency into how incarcerated citizens are treated and how our tax dollars are being spent. We hope to inspire Alabama\u2019s leadership to acknowledge the crisis and to overhaul its prison system and its use of forced labor.\u201d",
      "The film will have a theatrical release before it debuts on HBO sometime this year, but the specific dates and details are still being worked out. And while it is in its early days, the impact, Jarecki said, has already been seen, including in a class action labor lawsuit.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 16:02:29 -0500",
    "summary": "William E",
    "story": [
      "William E",
      "NEW YORK -- William E. Leuchtenburg, a prize-winning historian widely admired for his authoritative writings on the U.S. presidency and as the reigning scholar on Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal, has died at 102.",
      "Leuchtenburg died Tuesday at his home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, according to his son, Joshua A. Leuchtenburg, who cited no specific cause of death.",
      "A professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina and a published author for more than 70 years, William E. Leuchtenburg was praised for his encyclopedic knowledge and rigorous, but accessible style. He received some of the top awards given to historians, including the Parkman and Bancroft prizes, was a political analyst for CBS and NBC and consulted on several of Ken Burns' PBS documentaries. In 2008, he was given the Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. Award for \"Distinguished Writing\" of American history.",
      "Leuchtenburg's notable books include \"Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal\" and \"The Perils of Prosperity,\" a history of the U.S. from World War I to the peak of the Great Depression. Although politically liberal, his expertise called upon by aides to Lyndon Johnson and other Democratic politicians, he was as willing to point out the New Deal\u2019s disappointments as its successes: His scholarship was closely studied by younger FDR historians, from Jonathan Alter to Burns collaborator Geoffrey Ward, who dedicated the 2014 book \u201cThe Roosevelts\u201d to Leuchtenburg. And he was otherwise known for his generosity with Ward and others who sought his expertise.",
      "His most influential work was likely the Bancroft-winning \u201cFranklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal,\u201d published in 1963. Leuchtenburg found that the impact of FDR's vast and unprecedented response to the Depression was limited by political calculation, especially the president's reluctance to challenge racial segregation in the South, and that \u201cIt never demonstrated that it could achieve prosperity\" until the U.S. entered World War II. But he also credited the New Deal with transforming the role of federal government and Roosevelt with reinventing the presidency, using the young medium of radio to convince millions that he knew them personally.",
      "\u201cNothing is glossed over at all,\u201d The New York Times\u2019 Charles Poore wrote upon the book\u2019s release. \u201cYou live here through years of tumult and disaster, triumph and ineptitude and daring.\u201d",
      "Leuchtenburg's books on Roosevelt covered his presidency and beyond. \"In the Shadow of FDR,\" published in 1983 and periodically updated, demonstrated how presidents from Truman to George W. Bush attempted to shun and/or embrace Roosevelt's legacy. Leuchtenburg wrote of Roosevelt's immediate successor, Harry Truman, gesturing in the White House to a portrait of FDR and admitting, \"I'm trying to do what he would like.\" He noted the frustration of Republican Dwight Eisenhower and Democrat John F. Kennedy in being compared, unfavorably, to Roosevelt, and how Jimmy Carter began his 1976 presidential run with a speech in Warm Springs, Georgia, where FDR often stayed. At the time of his death, Leuchtenburg was working on an edition that would have included the administration of Joe Biden, who kept a portrait of Roosevelt in the Oval Office.",
      "The 2005 book \"The White House Looks South\" featured sections on Roosevelt, Truman and Lyndon Johnson and told of how each embraced or distanced themselves from the South. Roosevelt, a native of New York, spent so much time in Warm Springs that the state's governor referred to him as our \"fellow-Georgian.\" Johnson, a Texan, alternately identified himself as a Southerner or a Westerner, depending on the intended audience.",
      "In the prologue, Leuchtenburg fondly noted his own journey, remembering visits to baseball spring training camps in Florida, marching with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in Montgomery, Alabama, and never failing on New Year's Day to partake of black-eyed peas and collard greens, \"even if they are eaten with a grimace.\"",
      "\"In sum, I am in, but not of, the South,\" he concluded.",
      "He was a popular and rigorous educator \u2014 sometimes referred to as \u201cThe Big L\u201d \u2014 who taught at Smith College, Harvard University and Columbia University before settling at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the early 1980s. A former president of the American Historical Association and the Organization of American Historians, he held such stature that he contributed to later editions of \"The Growth of the American Republic,\" a standard college textbook originally written by Henry Steele Commager and Samuel Eliot Morison. Historians studying under him ranged from Allan Brandt to Howard Zinn.",
      "Leuchtenburg was married twice, most recently to Jean Anne Leuchtenburg, and had three children.",
      "A postal clerk's son born in New York City in 1922, William Edward Leuchtenburg was so fascinated by politics that at age 12, he raised money tutoring neighborhood kids to fund a nine-hour bus ride to Washington, where he would recall his \"wide-eyed\" tour of the White House and the \"brand-new marble palace of the U.S. Supreme Court.\"",
      "His affinity for Roosevelt was lifelong and personal. When he was 10, he sat by the radio and counted delegates as FDR was elected to his first term as president. He was able to afford college with help from a job found through a New Deal program, the National Youth Administration.",
      "Leuchtenburg graduated from Cornell University, received a master's degree and a doctorate from Columbia and worked for a civil rights lobby and other political organizations before deciding to focus on history. His first book, \u201cFlood Control Politics,\u201d came out in 1953, followed five years later by \u201cThe Perils of Prosperity.\u201d",
      "In recent years, Leuchtenburg wrote a short, critical biography of FDR\u2019s predecessor, Herbert Hoover, and the 900-page \u201cThe American President: From Teddy Roosevelt to Bill Clinton.\u201d He continued to work every morning and, at age 101, completed \u201cPatriot Presidents,\u201d the first of a planned multi-volume history that he acknowledged in the book's preface \u201cmay be too ambitious.\u201d"

      "Superstar singer Rihanna has made her first appearance at the trial of her partner, rapper A$AP Rocky",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Rihanna appeared for the first time at the trial of her longtime partner A$AP Rocky, on the day of its most important testimony \u2014 the description by a former friend of the moment Rocky allegedly fired a gun at him.",
      "The singer superstar, who has two toddler sons with the rapper Rocky, sat out of view of the courtroom\u2019s cameras, between Rocky\u2019s mother and sister, in the downtown Los Angeles criminal courthouse. Security brought her in surreptitiously to avoid crowds Wednesday morning.",
      "Rocky, whose legal name is Rakim Athelston Mayers, has been standing trial on two felony charges that he fired a handgun at the former friend, who is known by the name A$AP Relli and was born Terell Ephron. If convicted, Rocky could get up to 24 years in prison.",
      "Rihanna watched Wednesday as Relli testified about the moment Rocky allegedly fired a gun at him on a Hollywood street in 2021.",
      "He had been shouting angrily at Rocky, who was walking away after an initial confrontation and scuffle, when Rocky pulled a gun from his waistband and held it in the air, Relli testified.",
      "\u201cHe turned around and then it was like BOOM!\u201d he told the jury. \u201cThe whole thing was like a movie, he kind of like pointed down and he shot the first shot.\"",
      "He said \u201cI felt my hand hot\u201d and later added, \u201cI was hit. Or I was grazed. I didn\u2019t have a hole or nothing.\u201d",
      "The trial's key witness said he grabbed one of their mutual friends who were with Rocky after the first shot was fired and stood behind him for protection. He said he did not see Rocky fire the second shot, and Rocky ran away moments later.",
      "When jurors were being selected, prosecutors asked them whether Rihanna\u2019s connection to the case, especially if she appeared in court, would affect their ability to deliver a guilty verdict.",
      "Nearly all those questioned had heard of her \u2014 far more than had heard of Rocky \u2014 and some described themselves as fans, but all said they felt it would not affect their decisions.",
      "It was not clear whether they could see Rihanna or were aware of her presence as they watched the testimony. She wore a long black dress with buttons on the front that resembled a winter overcoat, and had a pair of glasses on her head that she put on during the prosecution's questioning.",
      "Earlier in the trial, which began on Jan. 21, Relli said he and Rocky, members of A$AP, a crew of creators at a New York high school, had been close but their relationship eroded after Rocky became famous.",
      "He said their relationship had been strained for years and was getting worse in the days leading up to the incident, but he was still \u201cfurious\u201d when Rocky pulled a gun on him after a scuffle that began the moment the two met up near the W Hotel. He dared him to use it.",
      "When Rocky walked away, he testified that he followed and shouted after him, until the shots were fired.",
      "Rocky\u2019s lawyer says the shots he fired were not even from a real gun \u2014 they were blanks from a starter pistol that he carried as a prop. The lawyer said Relli knew this, and that was why he was so fearless walking after him.",
      "\u201cOh it was a real gun,\u201d Relli testified Wednesday, saying he knew because of his scraped hand.",
      "He said he felt free to follow and shout at Rocky because \u201cI felt like because he put it away and we\u2019re on a busy street in Hollywood. He\u2019s definitely not gonna shoot it.\u201d",
      "Since the shooting, and his decision to go to police and testify, he has gotten death threats and has been shunned as a snitch, he said, and the modest music management career he built fell apart.",
      "\u201cIt's been a living hell,\u201d Relli said.",
      "About an hour after the shooting, Relli returned to the scene and said he photographed and recovered two shell casings. Earlier, while responding to a report of a shooting, police did not find any.",
      "He sent a text to Rocky that was shown in court saying \"U try killing me.\"",
      "Rocky denied it in his reply.",
      "\u201cBro wtf is u talkin bout why u tell ppl I shot at u.\u201d",
      "He sent Rocky photos of the shell casings and his grazed hand.",
      "Rocky said he was making stuff up and speaking \u201call type of nonsense\u201d and was trying to \u201cextort\u201d him.",
      "The court day ended after just a few hours of testimony because of scheduling issues. Rihanna was shuffled out through a restricted exit by deputies, and Rocky left separately through the main courthouse doors.",
      "The defense will begin their cross-examination of Relli on Thursday.",
      "Raised in Harlem, Rocky\u2019s rap songs became a phenomenon in New York in 2011. He had his mainstream breakthrough when his first studio album went to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in 2013. The second one, in 2015, did the same.",
      "He\u2019s set to have his biggest career year as a multimedia star. This Sunday, he\u2019s nominated for a Grammy Award for best music video for his song \u201cTailor Swif,\u201d at the ceremony at Crypto.com Arena just two miles (3 kilometers) from the Los Angeles courthouse where his trial\u2019s being held.",
      "He\u2019s also set to headline the Rolling Loud Music Festival, to star opposite Denzel Washington in a film directed by Spike Lee, and to co-chair the Met Gala in May.",
      "But the prospect of a conviction and the possibility of a lengthy prison sentence casts a shadow over all of it.",
      "Rocky and Rihanna, both 36, have two sons together: 2-year-old RZA Athelston Mayers and 1-year-old Riot Rose Mayers. She revealed she was pregnant with the younger boy after headlining the Super Bowl halftime show in 2023 with a visible baby bump.",
      "The singer and the rapper, who are both fashion moguls, first became close when he provided a verse to her 2012 song \u201cCockiness (Love It)\u201d and they performed it at the MTV Video Music Awards. They became a couple in 2020.",

      "PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron announced Tuesday that the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d will get its own dedicated room inside the Louvre museum under a major renovation and expansion of the Paris landmark that will take up to 10 years.",
      "The renovation project, branded \u201cLouvre New Renaissance,\u201d will include a new entrance near the River Seine, to be opened by 2031, and the creation of underground rooms, Macron said in a speech from the Louvre room where Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece is displayed.",

That will make the visit simpler for those who want to see the painting and ease the life of other visitors in the rest of the museum, he said.",

That makes some other paintings in the room by the greatest Venetian painters like Titian and Veronese go unnoticed by many.",
      "The museum\u2019s latest big renovation in the 1980s was designed to receive 4 million annual visitors.",
      "Last year, the Louvre received 8.7 million visitors, over three-quarters being foreigners mostly from the United States, China and neighboring countries Italy, the UK, Germany and Spain.",
      "Macron said a new entrance for the Louvre will be created near the River Seine by 2031, to be financed by ticket sales, patronage and licensing money from the museum's Abu Dhabi branch.",
      "A design competition is to be staged in the coming months, he said. In addition, some new underground rooms will be created to expand the museum.",
      "A French top official said the cost of the renovation is estimated at 700 to 800 million euros ($730 to 834 million) over the next ten years, including half for the creation of the new entrance. The official could not be named in line with the French presidency\u2019s customary practices.",
      "Macron said ticket prices will be raised for foreign visitors from outside the European Union, up from 22 euros ($23) now. He promised the museum will be safer and more comfortable for both the public and the staff.",
      "Half the Louvre's budget is currently being financed by the French state, including the wages of the 2,200 employees.",
      "The other half is provided by private funds including ticket sales, earnings from restaurants, shops and bookings for special events, as well as patrons and other partners.",
      "The renovation announcement comes after Louvre Director Laurence des Cars expressed her concerns in a note to Culture Minister Rachida Dati earlier this month saying the museum is threatened by \u201cobsolescence.\u201d",
      "According to the document first released by French newspaper Le Parisien, she warned about the gradual degradation of the building due to water leaks, temperature variations and other issues \u201cendangering the preservation of artworks.\u201d",
      "The pyramid that serves at the museum\u2019s entrance, unveiled in 1989 as part of late President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\u2019s project, now appears outdated. The place is not properly insulated from the cold and the heat and tends to amplify noise, making the space uncomfortable for both the public and the staff, des Cars stressed.",

      "The Grammys will look a little bit different this year",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Grammy Awards will look a little bit different this week.",
      "Each year, the Recording Academy hosts a multitude of events to welcome the music industry during Grammy week and record labels do the same. However, many institutions have canceled their plans \u2014 Universal Music Group, Sony, Spotify, BMG and Warner Music Group among them \u2014 and instead are allocating resources to help those affected by the devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires.",
      "The Grammys will still take place on Sunday at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles but now will focus its attention on helping wildfire victims.",
      "Within days of fires ravaging the Pacific Palisades and Altadena neighborhoods, the Recording Academy and its affiliated MusiCares charity launched the Los Angeles Fire Relief Effort with a $1 million dollar donation. According to a letter sent to members on Jan. 13, thanks to additional contributions, they\u2019ve already distributed $2 million in emergency aid.",
      "Once the fund was set up, Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason jr. said they began focusing on reformatting what Grammy week would look like \u2014 many conversations conducted \u201con the road, mobile-y, virtually\u201d as staffers had evacuated their homes.",
      "\u201cThat process has really consisted of reaching out to just listen and learn from a lot of people \u2014 state officials, local officials, the governor\u2019s office, the mayor\u2019s office, the fire department. We talked to hotel managers, just really trying to get a grasp on what was happening currently. What did they project was going to happen in the next week to 10 days? Would be safe to have a show?\"",
      "Ultimately, the Recording Academy decided to condense its pre-Grammy week plans to just four events, each featuring a fundraising element.",
      "On Friday, MusiCares, an organization that helps music professionals who need financial, personal or medical assistance, will hold its annual Persons of the Year benefit gala\u2009celebrating the Grateful Dead.",
      "On Saturday, the Special Merit Awards Ceremony and Grammy nominees' reception will still take place, followed by Clive Davis' pre-Grammy fundraising event.",
      "Then the Grammys take the stage on Sunday.",
      "Events like the annual pre-Grammy Black Music Collective event, Grammy advocacy brunch, and others scheduled to take place at the immersive pop-up Grammy house have been canceled.",
      "\u201cWe thought consolidating the events would allow us to have more impact,\u201d Mason explains. \u201cAnd we just don\u2019t feel it was the right time to have social gatherings or places to party or schmooze and just hang out. We wanted to have our events be places that could be purposeful and impactful. Some of the party settings, we decided to fold down into our fundraising efforts.\u201d",
      "\u201cObviously, we can\u2019t have a normal show in the midst of people\u2019s belongings being burned or loss of life or other things like that. At the same time, canceling would not have helped,\u201d Mason says.",
      "\u201cWe needed to raise money. We needed to show unity and come together around music. We need to support the city of L.A. (Over) 6,500 people work on our shows and ancillary gatherings. So, once we decided to move forward, it was really a conversation with (Grammy producers) Ben Winston, Raj Kapoor and Jesse Collins and myself. And we started to think about, \u2018How do we make the show have the greatest impact?\u2019\u201d",
      "They decided the path forward was to still give out awards and host performances to give viewers and attendees a bespoke concert experience. But most importantly, the show could raise awareness, drive donations and resources to funds that benefit people in need.",
      "And the conversations are ongoing. \u201cWe have some great things in the show that will definitely help to raise funds,\" he assures. \"It will honor some of the heroes that have been protecting our lives and our homes. It will hopefully shine a light on some people that need more help and more services.\u201d",
      "Don't expect a traditional telethon, but he says the show will feature announcements and activations in the arena.",
      "\u201cHopefully we\u2019ll be talking about things that have been pledged from the sponsors or from the community,\u201d he adds.",
      "\u201cWe know right off the bat that we\u2019ve got almost 3,000 requests for help from our members or people in the music community,\u201d Mason says. \u201cSo that was just in the first few days.\u201d",
      "The immediate needs have been \u201cthe basics,\u201d as he explains. \u201cFood, water, shelter, the bare necessities to live.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe next phase will involve, you know, where they\u2019re going to live, how are they going to replace maybe damaged or destroyed instruments, studios. How will they make a living? I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be some mental health component that people may need assistance with. But it\u2019s really across the board. But the early, immediate relief is around just the bare necessities.\u201d",
      "There's no shortage of natural disasters, and they affect the music community too. Mason brings up the COVID-19 pandemic as a recent example. With MusiCares, they were able to contribute \u201cover $40 million to people who needed help.\u201d They have the infrastructure to provide assistance quickly.",
      "However, he notes, the Grammys are the first major award show taking place after the wildfires, which means \u201cthere's no playbook for this.\"",
      "\u201cBut I\u2019ve always said it all changes if the fires were to continue, or possibly got worse, or the winds changed. So, I always want to reserve that right. We\u2019re not going to go blindly forward if things are unsafe or if it feels inappropriate,\" he says.",
      "But consider the fundraising, the economic and financial impacts, and the possibility of unity, \u201cIt all makes sense for us to move forward.\u201d",

      "A federal judge has set a March 2026 trial date for actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni to resolve their claims stemming from their work on the movie \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- A New York judge set a March 2026 trial date on Monday and moved an initial conference from mid-February to next week as the public feud between Blake Lively and her \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d costar and director Justin Baldoni continued to grow and accelerate.",
      "And in a new and separate front in the series of legal battles surrounding the film that became a surprise hit last summer, Lively in a Texas court filed a request for a deposition of a man she says was central to turning online sentiment against her during its release and promotion.",
      "The New York federal judge, Lewis J. Liman, told both sides in an order late Monday to prepare for a March 9, 2026, trial.",
      "He also moved an initial conference from mid-February to next week and told lawyers to be prepared to address complaints about pretrial publicity and attorney conduct.",
      "Liman took the actions after Lively\u2019s lawyers claimed in a filing on Monday that an attorney for Baldoni was trying to taint potential jurors over lawsuits the actors have filed against each other.",
      "The lawyers said Baldoni\u2019s attorney was trying to wreck Lively\u2019s career and turn potential New York jurors against her by creating a website to release selected documents and communications between Lively and Baldoni.",
      "The lawyers said attorney Bryan Freedman, representing Baldoni, was \u201cengaging in this extrajudicial campaign to influence these proceedings and the public perception of legal filings to this Court, and there already is a serious risk that his misconduct is tainting the jury pool.\u201d",
      "They added: \u201cThe endless stream of defamatory and extrajudicial media statements must end.\u201d",
      "Freedman said in a statement in response to Monday's assertions that the \u201cirony is not lost on anyone that Ms. Lively is so petrified of the truth that she has moved to gag it.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will always respect the court; however, we will never be bullied by those suggesting we cannot defend our clients with pure, unedited facts,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cAll we want is for people to see the actual text messages that directly contradict her allegations, video footage that clearly shows there was no sexual harassment and all the other powerful evidence that directly contradicts any false allegations.\u201d",
      "In a letter to the judge on Thursday, Baldoni attorney Kevin Fritz accused Lively of a publicity campaign that left Baldoni and other defendants the \u201cobjects of public scorn and contempt.\u201d",
      "He said the actions had damaged those she sued so that they were \u201cexiled from polite society and suffered damages totaling hundreds of millions of dollars due to Ms. Lively\u2019s scorched-earth media campaign.\u201d",
      "In the separate filing in Hays County, Texas, a precursor to another potential lawsuit, Lively asks for an order for a deposition from Jed Wallace, a crisis management specialist she alleges was behind much of the social media manipulation surrounding the film that turned public sentiment against her through posts on Reddit and TikTok.",
      "Wallace and his Texas-based firm Street Relations were brought on as subcontractors by publicists working with Baldoni and his production company, the filing said.",
      "\u201cHe weaponized a digital army around the country, including in New York and Los Angeles, to create, seed, manipulate, and advance disparaging content that appeared to be authentic on social media platforms and internet chat forums,\u201d the filing alleges.",
      "Wallace is identified in Lively's federal lawsuit, but he is not a defendant.",
      "Freedman, who the filing says is Wallace's lawyer, did not respond to a request for comment on the issue.",
      "Lively sued Baldoni, his production company and others in New York in late December for sexual harassment and attacks on her reputation and asked for unspecified damages. Baldoni sued earlier this month, accusing Lively and her husband, \u201cDeadpool\u201d actor Ryan Reynolds, of defamation and extortion and seeking at least $400 million in damages.",
      "The judge said Monday that he'll likely combine the lawsuits for trial.",
      "\u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d an adaptation of Colleen Hoover\u2019s bestselling 2016 novel that begins as a romance but takes a dark turn into domestic violence, was released in August, exceeding box office expectations with a $50 million debut. But the movie\u2019s release was shrouded by speculation over discord between Lively and Baldoni.",
      "Lively came to fame through the 2005 film \u201cThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,\u201d and bolstered her stardom on the TV series \u201cGossip Girl\u201d from 2007 to 2012. She has since starred in films including \u201cThe Town\u201d and \u201cThe Shallows.\u201d",
      "Baldoni starred in the TV comedy \u201cJane the Virgin,\u201d directed the 2019 film \u201cFive Feet Apart\u201d and wrote \u201cMan Enough,\u201d a book pushing back against traditional notions of masculinity.",

      "Taylor Swift is likely headed to her second straight Super Bowl",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- You could say that Taylor Swift's championship era is in its second consecutive season.",
      "The 14-time Grammy Award-winning superstar returned to Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday and watched her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and the rest of the Kansas City Chiefs beat the Buffalo Bills 32-29 for a spot in their third consecutive Super Bowl.",
      "Swift walked down the tunnel to her usual suite about 90 minutes before kickoff. And while she was decked out in Chanel for the divisional round against Houston, she opted for a sleek black-and-gold Louis Vuitton look for the AFC title game, including a jacquard knit jacket that retails for $5,000 and a stocking cap with a list price of $830.",
      "Modest fare compared to what suite prices for the Super Bowl will probably run.",
      "Swift will almost certainly be in New Orleans with her celebrity friends when the Chiefs go for an unprecedented third straight Lombardi Trophy against the Philadelphia Eagles on Feb. 9. They got a big game from Patrick Mahomes \u2014 no surprise there \u2014 and some key stops from their defense to get past the Bills.",
      "Swift began her high-profile romance with Kelce last season, when he invited the \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d singer to watch him in a September matchup with the Bears. And their relationship only seemed to blossom into the new year, with Swift eventually celebrating on the field with Kelce after the Chiefs had beaten the Ravens in Baltimore for the AFC championship.",
      "Then came the Super Bowl, and Swift's much-watched dash from a concert in Tokyo for kickoff of the big game in Las Vegas.",
      "She made it with plenty of time to spare, of course. And Swift became the focus of attention in her own right, winning what appeared to be a beer-chugging contest, partying with celebrity suite mates such as Blake Lively, Ice Spice and Lana Del Rey, and standing next to Kelce's mother, Donna, while he held aloft the Lombardi Trophy following the 25-22 win over the 49ers.",
      "The couple eventually locked lips again on the field at Allegiant Stadium.",
      "As confetti flew on the field, they kissed again in celebration at Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday night. Swift gave Chiefs coach Andy Reid a big hug, and she celebrated with Donna Kelce and the rest of some 80,000 fans.",

      "On a quiet weekend, even for the typically frigid movie-going month of January, the top spot went to the Lionsgate thriller starring Mark Wahlberg as a pilot flying an Air Marshal (Michelle Dockery) and fugitive (Topher Grace) across Alaska. But it wasn\u2019t a particularly triumphant result for Gibson\u2019s directorial follow-up to 2016\u2019s \u201cHacksaw Ridge.\u201d Reviews (21% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and audience scores (a \u201cC\u201d CinemaScore) were terrible.",

      "The weekend was also a small test as to whether the once more common Oscar \u201cbump\u201d that can sometimes follow nominations still exists. Most contenders have by now completed the bulk of their theatrical runs and are more likely to see an uptick on VOD or streaming.",
      "But the weekend\u2019s most daring gambit was A24 pushing Brady Corbet\u2019s \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d a three\u2013and-a-half-hour epic nominated for 10 Academy Awards, into wide release. Though some executives initially greeted \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d which is running with an intermission, as \u201cun-distributable,\u201d Corbet has said, A24 acquired the film out of the Venice Film Festival and it\u2019s managed solid business, collecting $6 million in limited release.",

      "Coming off one of the lowest Martin Luther King Jr. weekends in years, no new releases made a major impact.",
      "Steven Soderbergh\u2019s \u201cPresence,\u201d a well-reviewed horror film shot from the perspective of a ghost inside a suburban home, debuted with $3.4 million in 1,750 locations. The film, released by Neon and acquired out of last year\u2019s Sundance, was made for just $2 million.",
      "The top spots otherwise went to holdovers. The Walt Disney Co.\u2019s \u201cMufasa: The Lion King,\u201d in its sixth weekend of release, scored $8.7 million to hold second place. After starting slow, the Barry Jenkins-directed film has amassed $626.7 million globally.",

      "Hermes illuminated a gloomy Paris afternoon with its fall 2025 men\u2019s collection, as Veronique Nichanian turned to the racetrack for inspiration",
      "PARIS -- Hermes illuminated a gloomy Paris afternoon with its fall men\u2019s collection Saturday, as Veronique Nichanian turned to the racetrack for inspiration. Jockeys\u2019 vibrant racing silks became her muse, a dynamic counterpoint to the French maison\u2019s storied equestrian roots. \u201cI wanted this collection to be strong and energetic,\u201d Nichanian explained, her palette pivoting from deep browns and dark teals to flashes of tomato red and lemon yellow.",
      "The collection radiated warmth, both in spirit and texture. Fuzzy mohair coats, velvet varsity jackets and plush sheepskin outerwear wrapped models in an embrace that seemed designed to counter winter\u2019s chill. Layering was less pronounced this season, a deliberate move to retain sleek, streamlined silhouettes. Even gray pinstripe suits \u2014 pared back to essentials \u2014 eschewed bulk, echoing Nichanian\u2019s vision of men unencumbered as they race through life.",
      "Sweaters emerged as the collection\u2019s unsung heroes. Their bold chevrons and geometric patterns were lifted directly from the vibrant stripes of racing silks, a playful nod to Palais d\u2019I\u00e9na\u2019s soaring, angular architecture. A standout turtleneck, with its patchwork of triangles, rectangles, and squares in canary yellow, seemed to channel a nostalgic love for trigonometry. Elsewhere, a jacket with a shawl collar mirrored the same graphical bravado, rendered in cool tones of blue, black and white.",
      "Though grounded in classic tailoring, the collection celebrated irreverence. Nichanian\u2019s juxtaposition of tradition and innovation captured Herm\u00e8s\u2019 ethos with a quiet confidence. Here, functionality was imbued with a touch of whimsy, proving once again that the maison\u2019s refinement can still surprise and delight. In a season steeped in nostalgia and geometry, Herm\u00e8s delivered a collection that was, quite literally, off to the races."

      "PARK CITY, Utah -- PARK CITY, Utah (AP) \u2014 Rose Byrne plays a mother in the midst of a breakdown in the experiential psychological thriller \u201cIf I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You.\u201d",
      "Anticipation was high for the A24 film, which will be released sometime this year. Its premiere Friday at the Sundance Film Festival was easily the hottest ticket in town, with even ticketholders unable to get in. Those who did make it into the Library theater were treated to an intense, visceral, inventive story from filmmaker Mary Bronstein that has quickly become one of the festival\u2019s must-sees.",
      "Byrne plays Linda, who is barely hanging on while managing her daughter\u2019s mysterious illness. She\u2019s faced with crisis after crisis, big and small \u2014 from the massive, gaping hole in their apartment ceiling that forces them to move to a dingy motel, to an escalating showdown with a parking attendant at a care center. The cracks in her psychological, emotional and physical wellbeing are become too much to bear.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d never seen a movie before where a mother is going through a crisis with a child but our energy is not with the child\u2019s struggle, it\u2019s with the mother\u2019s,\u201d Bronstein said at the premiere. \u201cIf you\u2019re a caretaker, you shouldn\u2019t be bothering with yourself at all. It should all be about the person you\u2019re taking care of, right? And that is a particular kind of emotional burnout state that I was really interested in exploring.\u201d",
      "Byrne and Bronstein went deep in the preparation phase, having long discussions about Linda with the goal of making her as real as possible before the quick, 27-day shoot. Byrne said she was obsessed with figuring out who Linda was before the crisis. The film was in part inspired by Bronstein\u2019s experience with her own daughter, but she didn\u2019t want to elaborate on the specifics.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s her story to tell,\u201d Bronstein said.",
      "Part of Linda\u2019s story involves her therapist, played by Conan O\u2019Brien, who joked that he didn\u2019t realize he was in a movie.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not looking out for movie scripts or anything. But when I got a call from A24 that they wanted me to read something, I\u2019m not stupid,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cI showed it to my wife, who is one of the smartest people I know, and she read through it and she said, \u2018I didn\u2019t know they made movies like this anymore.\u2019\u201d",
      "He was particularly in awe of his director and co-star, saying he felt like a fraud standing beside them.",
      "\u201cIt was an amazing experience, one of the best experiences of my life, just to be with them and watch them work,\u201d O'Brien said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how (Byrne) did that and not check into a hospital afterwards, because I haven\u2019t seen any actor, man or woman, sustain that level for an entire movie.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like I have to go to a hospital now, because this was the first time I watched it,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m a mess.\u201d",
      "A$AP Rocky also co-stars, as a man Linda meets at the motel, but was not in Park City for the premiere. He is currently on trial, charged with firing a gun at a former friend.",
      "The film is full of ambiguity, metaphor and just plain artistic expression that Bronstein hesitated to explain, from the name itself to the hole in the ceiling, which takes on a somewhat supernatural quality.",
      "\u201cWhen we have nothing left to give, we have an emptiness inside of us,\u201d Bronstein said. \u201cAnd that emptiness is actually not empty: It\u2019s filled with all the darkness and self-hate and doubt and fear and dread and regret and everything. \u2026 That to me is what the hole is.\u201d",
      "Some of it, she said, she doesn\u2019t even fully understand. The point is the experience, and critics and Sundance audiences are already fully on board.",
      "Bronstein, a bit of a cult figure in the film world, made her directorial debut in 2008 at the SXSW festival with \u201cYeast,\u201d which featured a pre-fame Greta Gerwig and was hailed by by New Yorker critic Richard Brody as a \u201cmumblecore classic.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You\u201d is only her second feature.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time that anybody else has paid for me to make art,\u201d Bronstein said. \u201cI\u2019m proud to say that this is the film that came directly from my head to the screen.\u201d",

      "Prosecutors say they won\u2019t charge rocker Marilyn Manson after a years-long investigation into sexual assault and domestic violence allegations",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Prosecutors said Friday that they will not file charges against Marilyn Manson after a years-long investigation of allegations of sexual assault and domestic violence.",
      "Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said the allegations are too old under the law and the evidence is not sufficient to charge the 56-year-old shock rocker whose legal name is Brian Warner.",
      "\u201cWe have determined that allegations of domestic violence fall outside of the statute of limitations, and we cannot prove charges of sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d Hochman said. \u201cWe recognize and applaud the courage and resilience of the women who came forward to make reports and share their experiences, and we thank them for their cooperation and patience with the investigation.\u201d",
      "Nearly four years after the investigation began, then-District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said on Oct. 9 that his office was pursuing new leads that added to the \u201calready extensive\u201d file that authorities had amassed.",
      "LA County sheriff\u2019s detectives said early in 2021 that they were investigating Manson for incidents between 2009 and 2011 in West Hollywood, where Manson lived at the time. The probe included a search warrant that was served on his West Hollywood home. The case was initially turned over to prosecutors in September 2021, but the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office requested more evidence-gathering and the investigation resumed.",
      "\u201cWe are very pleased that, after a thorough and incredibly lengthy review of all of the actual evidence, the District Attorney has concluded what we knew and expressed from the start \u2014 Brian Warner is innocent,\u201d his attorney, Howard King, said in a statement.",
      "The identities of the women police and prosecutors spoke to were not revealed, but \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actor Esm\u00e9 Bianco \u2014 who sued Manson in a case that has been settled \u2014 said she was part of the criminal investigation. Before the decision not to prosecute, she criticized how long the process was taking at a rally for Hochman, who was elected soon after.",
      "\u201cAlmost four years ago, I did what victims of rape are supposed to do: I went to the police,\u201d she said on Oct. 10. \u201cI described to them in agonizing detail how the rock musician Brian Warner \u2014 better known by his stage name Marilyn Manson \u2014 had raped and abused me over the course of our relationship.\u201d",
      "Bianco said she gave investigators \u201chundreds of pieces of evidence, including photos of my body covered in bites, bruises and knife wounds, emails and text messages, threats to my immigration status.\u201d",
      "In her lawsuit, Bianco alleged sexual, physical and emotional abuse, and said that Manson violated human trafficking law by bringing her to California from England for non-existent roles in music videos and movies.",
      "\u201cWhilst I am deeply disappointed by the decision of the District Attorney to not bring charges in the case against Brian Warner, I am sadly not surprised,\u201d Bianco said in a statement released by her lawyer. \u201cOnce again, our justice system has failed survivors. Not the individual prosecutors and detectives who worked for years on this case, but the system that made them do so with one hand tied behind their collective backs.\u201d",
      "In 2021 Manson's former fianc\u00e9e, \u201cWestworld\u201d actor Evan Rachel Wood, named him as her abuser for the first time in an Instagram post.",
      "Wood and Manson\u2019s relationship became public in 2007 when he was 38 and she was 19, and they were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up.",
      "\u201cHe started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years,\u201d Wood said.",
      "Manson replied on Instagram that these were \u201chorrible distortions of reality.\u201d He sued Wood, saying she and another woman fabricated accusations against him and convinced others to do the same. A judge threw out significant sections of the suit, then in November, Manson agreed to drop it and pay Wood's attorney fees.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they\u2019ve been sexually abused, unless they come forward publicly as Bianco and Wood have done.",
      "Other women sued Manson in the months after Wood came forward. Wood's representative did not immedately return a message Friday.",
      "Manson emerged as a musical star in the mid-1990s, known as much for courting public controversy as for hit songs like \u201cThe Beautiful People\u201d and hit album\u2019s like 1996\u2019s \u201cAntichrist Superstar\u201d and 1998\u2019s \u201cMechanical Animals.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s famous name, populist stances and loyal following have earned him President Donald Trump's support, but will that get him the votes he needs from the Republican-controlled Senate to become the nation's top health official?",
      "If approved, Kennedy will control a $1.7 trillion agency that oversees food and hospital inspections, hundreds of health clinics, vaccine recommendations and health insurance for roughly half the country.",
      "His confirmation hearings are set before the Senate finance committee on Wednesday and the Health, Education, Labor and Pension committee on Thursday.",
      "Here's what to watch during his confirmation hearings:",
      "Over many years, Kennedy has been clear about his beliefs on vaccines in dozens of interviews, podcasts and social media posts.",
      "He's headed up a nonprofit that has sued the government over its authorizations of vaccines. He's said there is \u201c no vaccine that is safe and effective,\" and repeatedly called for further study of routine childhood vaccinations, despite decades of research and real-world use that proves they've safely prevented disease.",
      "But more recently, Kennedy has tried to downplay his past remarks and work, saying he's not anti-vaccine and promising not to \u201ctake away\u201d the shots.",
      "The health committee chairman, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., also has expressed concerns about Kennedy's anti-vaccine work. A physician, Cassidy said earlier this month he \u201chad a frank conversation\u201d and \u201cspoke about vaccines at length\u201d with Kennedy. On Tuesday, Cassidy told reporters that he is still unsure if he is backing Trump\u2019s nominee.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still working through it,\u201d Cassidy said during a press availability with Louisiana reporters on Tuesday. \u201cI look forward to the hearings and I will allow that to guide my decision.\u201d",
      "The intensity of the questioning on vaccines over the next two days could provide clues for how other Republicans \u2014 like Sen. Mitch McConnell, a polio survivor who represents Kentucky \u2014 might consider Kennedy\u2019s nomination.",
      "Some of the country's most conservative lawmakers have been worried about how Kennedy will handle abortion as health secretary.",
      "Republican Sen. James Lankford, who sits on the finance committee, is expected to grill Kennedy, a longtime Democrat, on the issue during Wednesday's hearing. Lankford is seen as a possible \u201cno\u201d vote over Kennedy's past comments supporting abortion. Last month, the Oklahoma senator said he had a \u201cgood conversation\u201d with Kennedy but stopped short of endorsing.",
      "HHS can influence abortion and reproductive health access in a number of ways, including with millions of dollars in grants it sends to Planned Parenthood and regulations around abortion pills. Under the Biden administration, the agency also said hospitals were required to provide emergency abortions for pregnant women in medical distress.",
      "On Monday, acting HHS Secretary Dorothy Fink signaled the agency is prepared to adopt a tougher stance on abortion under Kennedy. She ordered the agency to investigate all of its programs to make sure no taxpayer money is going toward elective abortions.",
      "Kennedy needs to earn support from nearly all Senate Republicans, but he may also try to pick up a vote or two from the Democratic Party. His closest supporters and advisers have urged followers to call the offices of Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada.",
      "Another Democratic senator may also be in play: John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who met with Kennedy and has said he's open to supporting Trump's nominees.",
      "An area where Kennedy is trying to find common ground with Democratic senators: food regulations and access to healthier foods. Kennedy has said he supports Medicare and Medicaid helping people pay for healthier foods and gym memberships, an idea Democrats have lobbied for as well. He's also called for a ban on some of the ingredients used in foods, like dyes and additives.",
      "In a letter sent to U.S. senators on Tuesday, Caroline Kennedy shared shocking personal details about her cousin, saying he is not qualified for the health secretary job.",
      "Caroline Kennedy said RFK Jr.'s views on vaccines are a problem, but she also brought up her experiences growing up with him.",
      "A copy obtained by The Associated Press notes that while she admired him for overcoming a drug addiction, she said he has gone on to \u201cmisrepresent, lie, and cheat his way through life.\u201d In an extreme anecdote, she accused him of hosting drug-fueled gatherings in his basement, dorm and garage where he \u201cenjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in the blender to feed his hawks.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, another cousin, former Rhode Island congressman and Democrat Patrick J. Kennedy, threw his support behind the health secretary nominee in an opinion piece for The Washington Post on Tuesday. RFK Jr. helped pull him out of addiction, Patrick J. Kennedy said.",
      "\u201cBobby was the first family member to call and offer his personal and public support, even at a time when some in my family criticized me for breaking the so-called family code of silence,\u201d he wrote.",

    "story": [
      "Around 70 people were killed in an attack on the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher in Sudan",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Around 70 people were killed in an attack on the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher in Sudan, the chief of the World Health Organization said Sunday, part of a series of attacks coming as the African nation's civil war escalated in recent days.",
      "The attack on the Saudi Teaching Maternal Hospital, which local officials blamed on the rebel Rapid Support Forces, came as the group was experiencing apparent battlefield losses to the Sudanese military and allied forces under the command of army chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan. That includes Burhan appearing near a burning oil refinery north of Khartoum on Saturday that his forces said they seized from the RSF.",
      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s Foreign Ministry denounced the attack as \u201ca violation of international law.\u201d",
      "International mediation attempts and pressure tactics, including a U.S. assessment that the RSF and its proxies are committing genocide, and sanctions targeting Burhan, haven't halted the fighting.",
      "WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus posted the death toll in the hospital attack in El Fasher on the social platform X.",
      "Officials and others in the capital of North Darfur province had cited a similar figure Saturday, but Tedros is the first international source to provide a casualty number. Reporting on Sudan is incredibly difficult given communication challenges, the indiscriminate violence faced by civilians and exaggerations by both the RSF and the Sudanese military. Sudan's Foreign Ministry accused the RSF of launching a drone attack targeting the hospital's emergency ward, describing the assault as a \u201cmassacre.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe appalling attack on Saudi Hospital in El Fasher, Sudan, led to 19 injuries and 70 deaths among patients and companions,\u201d Tedros wrote. \u201cAt the time of the attack, the hospital was packed with patients receiving care.\u201d",
      "Another health facility in Al Malha also was attacked Saturday, he added.",
      "\u201cWe continue to call for a cessation of all attacks on health care in Sudan, and to allow full access for the swift restoration of the facilities that have been damaged,\u201d Tedros said. \u201cAbove all, Sudan\u2019s people need peace. The best medicine is peace.\u201d",
      "Tedros didn't identify who launched the attack, though local officials had blamed the RSF for the assault. U.N. official Clementine Nkweta-Salami, who coordinates humanitarian efforts for the world body in Sudan, warned Thursday that the RSF earlier had given \u201ca 48-hour ultimatum to forces allied to the Sudanese Armed Forces to vacate the city and indicated a forthcoming offensive.\u201d",
      "\u201cSince May 2024, El Fasher has been under RSF siege,\u201d she said. \u201cCivilians in El Fasher have already endured months of suffering, violence and gross human rights abuses under the prolonged siege. Their lives now hang in the balance due to an increasingly precarious situation.\u201d",
      "The RSF didn't immediately acknowledge the attack in El Fasher, which is more than 800 kilometers (500 miles) southwest of Khartoum. The city is now estimated to be home to more than 1 million people, many of whom have been displaced by the war.",
      "The U.N. said in December that the RSF siege had killed 782 civilians and wounded more than 1,140 others, warning that the figures likely were higher.",
      "The Saudi hospital, just north of El Fasher's airport, sits near the front lines of the war and has been repeatedly hit by shelling. Still, its doctors continue surgeries, sometimes by the light of cellphones while the hospital is hit.",
      "However, the RSF appeared in recent days to have lost control of the Khartoum refinery, the biggest in Sudan and crucial to both its economy and that of South Sudan. Burhan's forces also say they broke another RSF besiegement of the Signal Corps headquarters in northern Khartoum. The rebels claimed they were \u201ctightening the noose\u201d around that base.",
      "Sudan has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019. A short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when Burhan and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo of the RSF joined forces to lead a military coup in October 2021.",
      "Al-Bashir faces charges at the International Criminal Court over carrying out a genocidal campaign in the early 2000s in the western Darfur region with the Janjaweed, the precursor to the RSF. Rights groups and the U.N. say the RSF and allied Arab militias are again attacking ethnic African groups in this war.",
      "The RSF and Sudan\u2019s military began fighting each other in April 2023. Their conflict has killed more than 28,000 people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country.",
      "Other estimates suggest a far higher death toll in the civil war.",
      "On Sunday, Burhan traveled to the military's General Command headquarters in Khartoum, a building he hadn't been to since the fighting broke out in 2023. The headquarters is near Khartoum International Airport, which has seen fierce fighting during the war.",
      "\u201cThe armed forces are in their best condition and we will move forward with the determination of our people to eliminate the rebellion in all of Sudan,\u201d Burhan said, according to the state-run SUNA news agency.",

      "Weeks after the worst of the deadly fires tore through Los Angeles suburbs, families are grappling with the reality that toxic ash from burned cars and homes could be a health issue for awhile, especially for children",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Kelli Ferrone wiped blinds and window sills inside her daughters\u2019 elementary school, just a half mile from the devastating Palisades Fire that scorched the coastal enclave in Los Angeles. The cotton swabs and wipes came up black.",
      "There is scattered ash and soot at her feet. Outside, it's on the ground next to a playground.",
      "Ferrone, who recorded videos and shared them with The Associated Press, wanted to see for herself this week if Canyon Charter Elementary School had been adequately cleaned before the school reopens. She wasn't impressed.",
      "Weeks after the most intense days of fire across the Los Angeles area, parents are grappling with the reality that toxic ash from burned homes and cars could be harmful to their children. It's a risk that is becoming more common as wildfires burn in cities.",
      "In the Pacific Palisades, Canyon Charter could reopen as soon as Monday. School officials say staff are working hard to make sure schools are clean and safe and they're confident in their decision. But some parents feel the school is rushing to open. They're urging officials to temporarily relocate, while others try to transfer their students elsewhere.",
      "\u201cThe (Los Angeles Unified School District) has never experienced a disaster like this in their history,\" said Ferrone, who has two daughters at the school, one with asthma. \"And I do think people are trying really hard, but our school needs a new temporary home with classrooms and teachers teaching in-person. That is the only thing that is going to make people feel comfortable.\u201d",
      "In a statement, LAUSD said staff \u201chas worked diligently to prepare schools for a return to in-person instruction.\u201d That includes inspecting ventilation systems, replacing filters and installing air purifiers in classrooms and offices, and cleaning inside and outdoors. An environmental consultant is inspecting campuses. Staff monitors air quality. The district has an Office of Environmental Health and Safety and is following its protocols.",
      "Some schools are within a \u201cdo not drink water\u201d advisory, including Canyon Charter. That means fountains are turned off and bottled water is provided, the district said.",
      "Dr. Lisa Patel, a pediatrician and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, said the school is taking all the right steps. Yet, she said, \u201cthere\u2019s no zero risk.\"",
      "The ash is a toxic soup of incinerated cars, electronics, batteries, building materials, paints, furniture and every other kind of personal belonging. It contains pesticides, asbestos, plastics and lead, all of which children are more vulnerable to.",
      "\u201cChildren often have more hand-to-mouth behavior and their bodies are rapidly growing in these first few years, and so they can be more sensitive to this type of pollution,\" said Patel. \"There will be a risk for a while to come in terms of exposure.\u201d",
      "Some materials form reactive chemical compounds when they burn.",
      "Scientists still don't know the long-term health impacts of exposure to massive urban fire like this year's in California or the one in Maui, Hawaii in 2023. Three schools in Lahaina didn't reopen for two months after that. But some chemicals have been linked to heart disease and lung issues, while exposure to minerals like magnetite, which can form when fire burns iron, has been associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
      "In Pasadena, Emily Stough is trying to minimize the risks for her 11- and 14-year-old who returned to Blair High School, which includes a middle school, this week. She made sure they took masks. In an email to parents last week, the Pasadena Unified School District said some 38 tons of outdoor debris have been hauled away from campuses, and they will only open \u201cafter rigorous cleaning and sanitizing and environmental tests.\"",
      "Stough said she trusts the district to do its due diligence, but she wants more information.",
      "\u201cDid they test air quality? Did they test ash samples? Were the ash samples from inside the school, in the hallways, from outside the schools?,\" she wonders. \"Air quality both inside and outside the schools? I\u2019d like to see that. I\u2019d like to know what cleaning was done.\u201d",
      "The PUSD did not respond to questions from the AP.",
      "It\u2019s hard to know how long these fire toxins will stay in the environment, said Patel, but it could be a few months. Strong winds like the Santa Anas could also blow them distances where they could enter soil and groundwater.",
      "Plastics in particular could last a long time, said Dr. Ilan Shapiro, medical affairs officer for AltaMed and a fellow with the American Academy of Pediatrics. \u201cAnd we need to remember that the fires are still going. That we still have burn materials coming out.\" As communities recover and clean up, that ash will be moved again, he said.",
      "Longfellow Elementary School in Pasadena is set to reopen next week, but Tanya Reyes doesn\u2019t plan to send her kids back just yet. The school is about two miles from where the Eaton Fire burned down the home they rented. Even with the school's safety measures, \u201cmy gut is saying \u2018no,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be around that area. It\u2019s too soon.\u201d",
      "Her family is staying in West Hollywood, and she\u2019s looking for schools there, somewhere the kids can attend for a little while. She's considering home schooling, too, but still figuring it all out.",
      "It's hard for parents because they understand all the ways kids need school.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been through this in so many different ways, whether it\u2019s been wildfire smoke or the pandemic,\u201d Patel said. \u201cWhen kids miss school, that is also a detriment to their health. It impacts their learning, it impacts their socioemotional development, their sense of connection and community during a time of crisis.\"",

      "Experts say Trump's moves to step away from global climate action, ramp up domestic oil and gas production and remove incentives for electric vehicles are worrisome as the planet continues to heat up. 2024 was Earth's hottest year on record, and climate scientists say the rising heat is contributing to extreme weather affecting millions.",

Trump's move means the federal government won't be trying to meet emissions reductions goals, nor any financial commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.",
      "\u201cWalking away from the Paris Agreement won\u2019t protect Americans from climate impacts, but it will hand China and the European Union a competitive edge in the booming clean energy economy and lead to fewer opportunities for American workers,\u201d said Ani Dasgupta, president and CEO of the World Resources Institute.",
      "Trump declared an energy emergency via executive order earlier this week amid a promise to \u201cdrill, baby, drill.\u201d",
      "The order urges oil and gas expansion including through federal use of eminent domain and the Defense Production Act, which allow the government to use private land and resources to produce goods deemed to be a national necessity.",
      "Experts dispute his description of an \u201cinadequate energy supply\u201d as part of the basis for the order.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that the United States is well-supplied with energy in all of its forms,\u201d said Gary Dirks, senior director of the Global Futures Laboratory at Arizona State University. Dirks said he thinks the move is actually more targeted at bringing down prices at the pump.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the United States right now is the largest producer of oil of any nation in history. And we got to that point under the Biden administration, not because of the Biden administration\u2019s policies necessarily, but because of policies that have been ongoing for four decades,\u201d he said.",
      "One section of the order declaring an energy emergency states that the Endangered Species Act cannot be an obstacle to energy development.",
      "The Endangered Species Act has been a hurdle for the development of fossil fuels in the U.S. for decades, and weakening it would accelerate the decline and potential extinction of numerous endangered species, including whales and sea turtles, said Gib Brogan, a campaign director with conservation group Oceana.",
      "Trump also opened up areas in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling. Biden had previously both restricted and approved drilling in other parts of the Arctic, part of a long process mired in litigation and complicated by political battles.",
      "\u201cI would begin by pointing out that there was an attempt to lease for oil drilling recently and nobody bid,\u201d Dirks said. \u201cI don\u2019t actually think that the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge is an exciting place for oil and gas exploration.\u201d",
      "But he expressed concern about preserving biodiversity, something other scientists and environmental groups have highlighted.",
      "\u201cThe Arctic is a very fragile system,\u201d said Peter Schlosser, vice president and vice provost of global futures at Arizona State. Schlosser added that drilling there would disrupt the land and sea, and that potential contamination or oil spills are more difficult to clean up there due to low temperatures.",
      "Trump promised to eliminate what he incorrectly calls Biden's \u201celectric vehicle mandate.\"",
      "What that means in practice is that the order will revoke a non-binding goal set by Biden to have EVs make up half of new cars sold by 2030. He will also likely seek repeal of a $7,500 tax credit for new EV purchases approved by Congress as part of Biden\u2019s landmark 2022 climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "All of that is likely frustrating for automakers, who have to make long-term decisions, said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at auto-buying research firm Edmunds. As the rest of the world moves to electric cars, automakers have to decide how to factor in the global direction the industry is headed alongside the sudden lack of federal support.",
      "\u201cWe do think that the long-term end goal here is going to be electrification. It\u2019s just the timeline it seems is uncertain right now,\u201d she said.",
      "When the government reviews new facilities that emit pollution, officials are no longer likely to consider a concept known as environmental justice, or how that new pollution will add to the emissions that have tended to fall more heavily on poor and minority communities.",
      "Those are sweeping moves that Rena Payan, chief program officer at nonprofit Justice Outside, called \u201crolling back decades of progress in addressing environmental discrimination.\u201d",
      "That means more of a burden for state and local groups to fight to protect those communities. Trump\u2019s decision to cut off support will hurt, but many of these organizations are used to operating without federal support \u2014 they have done so for years, according to Peggy Shepard, co-founder and executive director of WE ACT for Environmental Justice.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019m grappling right now with is both the grief of these losses, and the fact that we were on an upward swing, if you will, just weeks ago,\u201d said Jade Begay, an Indigenous rights and climate organizer.",

      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) \u2014 Vaccination bills are popping up in more than 15 states as lawmakers aim to potentially resurrect or create new religious exemptions from immunization mandates, establish state-level vaccine injury databases or dictate what providers must tell patients about the shots.",
      "Many see a political opportunity to rewrite policies in their states after President Donald Trump's return to the White House and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 's nomination as the next secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. The agency oversees virtually every aspect of vaccination efforts in the U.S., from funding their development to establishing recommendations for medical providers to distributing vaccines and covering them through federal programs.",
      "Childhood vaccination rates against dangerous infections like measles and polio continue to fall nationwide, and the number of parents claiming non-medical exemptions so their kids don't get required shots is rising.",
      "In 2024, whooping cough cases reached a decade-high and 16 measles outbreaks, the largest among them in Chicago and Minnesota, put health officials on edge. Most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "About half of Americans are \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d concerned that those declining childhood vaccination rates will lead to more outbreaks, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Yet only about 4 in 10 Americans oppose reconsidering the government\u2019s recommendations for widely used vaccines, while roughly 3 in 10 are in favor. The rest \u2014 about 3 in 10 \u2014 are neutral.",
      "Scott Burris, director of Temple University\u2019s Center for Public Health Law Research, has tracked public health legislation for years, and watched backlash against COVID-19 vaccines grow to include more routine vaccines as anti-vaccine activists take hold of powerful political pulpits.",
      "\u201cI think COVID and the politics gave standard vaccine denialists a lot of wind in their sails,\" he said.",
      "It's hard to predict what will pass into law in the states, Burris said, considering the vast majority of proposed bills in any state go nowhere. But the proposed legislation offers a glimpse into lawmakers\u2019 thoughts, and what else might follow.",
      "Religious exemptions for school vaccine requirements are among the most popular proposals so far. Lawmakers in New York, Virginia, Connecticut and Mississippi have introduced bills that would allow more people to waive routine shots. Indiana lawmakers will weigh religious exemptions for medical students.",
      "Earlier this month, West Virginia Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order on his first day in office that enabled families to receive religious exemptions from required school vaccinations.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a huge step,\" said Brian Festa, co-founder of the law firm We The Patriots USA, which works on vaccination-related cases throughout the country. \"That\u2019s a state that never had a religious exemption.\u201d",
      "Now, only four states allow just a medical exemption from childcare and K-12 immunization requirements: Connecticut, California, New York and Maine.",
      "Festa credited West Virginia's new religious exemption to Trump's nomination of Kennedy, as well as a 2023 federal court ruling that required Mississippi to allow residents to cite religious beliefs when seeking exemptions from state-mandated vaccinations for children.",
      "\u201cI think the writing\u2019s on the wall and they did feel the pressure,\u201d Festa said of West Virginia.",
      "In Connecticut, at least four Republican bills will try to revive the state's religious exemption for schools, colleges and daycares \u2014 something a contentious 2021 state law eliminated for students without an existing exemption.",
      "Connecticut health experts said at the time there was a slow but steady increase in the number of religious exemptions and declining vaccination rates in some schools. The state has historically maintained some of the highest childhood vaccination rates in the county, and in the 2023-2024 school year, more than 97% of kindergarteners protected against chickenpox, measles, tetanus, diphtheria, polio and more.",
      "Given that the U.S. Supreme Court last year rejected a challenge to the Connecticut law and the statehouse is controlled by Democrats, GOP state Sen. Eric Berthel said he\u2019s not optimistic legislative leaders will allow debate on his exemption bill, but does believe the broader cultural shift means \u201cmaybe there is a bit of an appetite to look at things like this again.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that we\u2019re not being fair to families who have a true faith-based reason to not vaccinate their child,\u201d he said.",
      "There's one outlier so far among statehouse trends on exemptions. Hawaii, where legislators are looking to move in the opposite direction with a bill to eliminate all non-medical waivers after struggling for years with high exemption rates.",
      "Other vaccine-related bills touch on some of the opposition that's been growing since the pandemic.",
      "Oklahoma and Alabama have proposals that would require parental consent for any vaccine given to minors. Bills in Wyoming, Oregon and Oklahoma would prohibit \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against people who aren\u2019t vaccinated against COVID-19 or other diseases.",
      "New York and Oklahoma have bills that would require providers to give people getting shots a full ingredient list, and Florida legislation would ban edible vaccines, though none are approved for use in the U.S. and research is still in early stages.",
      "Vaccine injury is also a popular topic, and bills in Indiana and North Dakota propose creating state versions of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System \u2014 a federal database that drew the attention of vaccine skeptics during the pandemic. Anyone can file a report about a potential issue after a vaccine, though the CDC\u2019s website notes a report doesn\u2019t prove the shot caused a health issue.",
      "North Dakota Republican state Sen. Dick Anderson said he's not against people getting vaccines \u2014 he got one COVID-19 shot himself \u2014 but proposed the bill because many people don't trust the CDC.",
      "\u201cWe have to do something to restore trust in the system,\" Anderson said.",
      "But experts note state databases are unnecessarily duplicative.",
      "\u201cA lot of these proposals, they're trying to fix something that's not broken and really working to counter the goal of preventing the spread of communicable disease,\u201d said Andy Baker-White, senior director of state health policy for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.",
      "Policy should be focused on getting rid of barriers to vaccination, not adding to them, said Dr. Susan Kressly, a pediatrician and president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Many families miss vaccinations not because of ideology, she said, but because of lack of transportation or not having primary care doctors or clinics nearby, among other things.",
      "But because most Americans are vaccinated, they haven't seen the effects of dangerous infections like bacterial meningitis that Kressly fielded calls about from fearful parents early in her career.",

Stone was among several people with long COVID who spoke at a workshop hosted by the NIH in September where patients, clinicians, and researchers discussed their priorities and frustrations around the agency's approach to long COVID research.",
      "",
      "Some doctors and researchers are also critical of the agency's research initiative, called RECOVER, or Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery. Without clinical trials, physicians specializing in treating long COVID must rely on hunches to guide their clinical decisions, said Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, chief of research and development with the VA St. Louis Healthcare System.",

      "Now the NIH is starting to determine how to allocate an additional $662 million of funding for long COVID research, $300 million of which is earmarked for clinical trials. These funds will be allocated over the next 4 years. At the end of October, RECOVER issued a request for clinical trial ideas that look at potential therapies, including medications, saying its goal is \"to work rapidly, collaboratively, and transparently to advance treatments for long COVID.\"",

She warns it's going to take a lot more money to help people like Hayes regain some degree of health. \"There really is a burden to make up this lost time now,\" Stone said.",
      "",
      "The NIH told KFF Health News and NPR via email that it recognizes the urgency in finding treatments. But to do that, there needs to be an understanding of the biological mechanisms that are making people sick, which is difficult to do with post-infectious conditions.",

      "According to RECOVER's website, it has funded eight clinical trials to test the safety and effectiveness of an experimental treatment or intervention. Just one of those trials has published results.",
      "",
      "On the other hand, RECOVER has supported more than 200 observational studies, such as research on how long COVID affects pulmonary function and on which symptoms are most common. And the initiative has funded more than 40 pathobiology studies, which focus on the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms of long COVID.",

      "",
      "Good science takes time, said Leora Horwitz, MD, the co-principal investigator for the RECOVER-Adult Observational Cohort at New York University (NYU). And long COVID is an \"exceedingly complicated\" illness that appears to affect nearly every organ system, she said.",

      "This makes it more difficult to study than many other diseases. Because long COVID harms the body in so many ways, with widely variable symptoms, it's harder to identify precise targets for treatment.",

Patients also say RECOVER leadership ignored their priorities and experiences when determining which studies to fund.",

      "The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that I want is to clear all the garbage from the path, clean the table and be able to speak with the United States and very frankly\u201d about issues including immigration, security and the fight against drug trafficking, Mulino said.",
      "Rubio is scheduled to meet with Mulino Sunday and visit the canal.",

      "ATHENS, Greece -- Increased volcanic activity in Greece\u2019s famed tourist hotspot of Santorini has prompted the country\u2019s civil protection minister to call a meeting with local and disaster response officials.",
      "In an announcement late Wednesday, the Climate Crisis and Civil Protection Ministry said monitoring sensors had picked up \u201cmild seismic-volcanic activity\u201d in Santorini\u2019s caldera. Similar volcanic activity had been recorded in the area in 2011, when it lasted for 14 months and ended without causing any issues.",
      "Scientists monitoring the Hellenic Volcanic Arc, which stretches from the Peloponnese in southern Greece through the Cycladic islands, have noted an increase in activity in a central fault line in the northern part of Santorini\u2019s caldera, the announcement said.",
      "\u201cAccording to the scientists, based on the currently available data there is no cause for particular concern,\u201d it added.",
      "The crescent-shaped island of Santorini is one of Greece\u2019s most popular tourist destinations, drawing visitors from across the world for its whitewashed houses and blue-domed churches clinging to the cliff edge of the flooded caldera.",
      "It was also the site of one of largest volcanic eruptions in human history, which took place in the Bronze Age around 1620 BC, destroying a large part of the island and giving Santorini its current shape. The eruption is believed to have contributed to the decline of the ancient Minoan civilization which had flourished in the region.",
      "Although it is still an active volcano, the last notable eruption occurred in 1950.",
      "\u201cWhat we must realize is that the Santorini volcano produces very large explosions every 20,000 years,\u201d Efthymios Lekkas, seismologist and head of the scientific monitoring committee for the Hellenic Volcanic Arc, said on Greece\u2019s ERT television Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s been 3,000 years since the last explosion, so we have a very long time ahead of us before we face a big explosion.\u201d",
      "In the intervening time, Lekkas said, volcanic activity increases and decreases, and can cause small earthquakes. \u201cThe volcano is a living organism,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe will not face a big explosion, but a mild procedure.\u201d",
      "Lekkas was among those who attended Wednesday's meeting called by Civil Protection Minister Vassilis Kikilias, along with the head of Greece's fire department, the deputy minister in charge of natural disaster recovery and several local and regional officials.",

      "A special mailbox for children to flag abuses has been set up at a Paris primary school, a first in the French capital as part of nationwide effort to encourage more victims of sexual violence to speak up",
      "PARIS -- A special mailbox for children to flag abuses was set up Thursday at a Paris primary school, a first in the French capital as part of nationwide effort to encourage more victims of sexual violence to speak up.",
      "Some 360 such mailboxes have already been deployed across France, where children can drop letters that will be assessed by experts. The program is supported by child protection association Les Papillons, or Butterflies, and runs under the motto: \u201cIf you can\u2019t say it, write it.\u201d",
      "It comes as activists are pushing to lift taboos that have long surrounded sexual abuse and make \u201cshame changes sides.\u201d That was highlighted recently during the trial that made Gis\u00e8le P\u00e9licot, who was drugged and raped by her now ex-husband, France\u2019s symbol of fight against sexual violence.",
      "In June 2022, on the first day a mailbox was set up in a school in eastern France, a 10-year-old girl left a message naming her grandfather and describing what appeared to have been instances of incestuous rape. A few days later, police officers said she and two other girls in her family had allegedly been victims of incest for years.",
      "In September the grandfather was found guilty and sentenced to a 12-year prison sentence.",
      "According to Les Papillons, about 2.4% of the messages lead to reports to local child protection officials in charge of taking necessary measures.",
      "1.4% of the messages are immediately reported to prosecutors, leading to a police investigation, in line with French law regarding \u201cserious and imminent danger\u201d to children. They include all alleged sexual abuses.",
      "\u201cThe main thing that has changed and I think it\u2019s great, is that victims are less and less reluctant to talk,\u201d Laurent Boyet, the police officer who founded Les Papillons, told The Associated Press. \u201cBut what still hasn\u2019t changed is that people still don\u2019t necessarily listen to them as they should... There\u2019s still a long way to go.\u201d",
      "Last year, more than 30,000 children put a message in the mailboxes, Boyet noted. This provided the association with a snapshot of the scale of child abuse in France.",
      "Most children reported situations that took place in the school environment, including harassment and physical abuse. About 10% reported issues at home, of which over half involved physical violence. Some involved sexual abuse within the family.",
      "Boyet wrote a book in 2017 to tell his own story. He said he was raped by his brother, who was 10 years older, when he was between the ages of 6 and 9.",
      "Children at the Paris primary school where the mailbox has been set up Thursday will get instructions about what it's for.",
      "The association proposes pieces of paper where children can tick the box \u201cI need help for me\u201d or \u201cfor one of my friends,\" fill the line \u201cmy abuser is named\u201d and write \u201cwhat's happening.\u201d",
      "\u201cGoing through writing help children,\" the director of the Blanche school, G\u00e9raldine Gythiel, said. \"They take the paper, they put it in their pocket and they\u2019ll write what they have to write at the right moment... Because talking to an adult isn\u2019t easy.\u201d",
      "Twice a week, local police officers will pick up the messages and email them to the association\u2019s experts, including three psychologists, for assessment.",
      "The most serious ones are immediately sent to police services so they can be used in investigations and as evidence in a potential trial, Boyet said.",
      "In some other cases like school bullying, the association will talk with teachers and educators to seek solutions.",
      "The association's psychologists may also get in touch with the child's parents to provide counselling, Boyet said."

      "Right Rev. John Perumbalath\u2019s departure came after Channel Four news reported earlier this week that one woman had accused the bishop of kissing her without consent and groping her, and another woman accused him of sexual harassment. The allegations had become a distraction, he said.",

      "The BBC has apologized to staff members who felt unable to complain about the conduct of actor and comedian Russell Brand because of his status after an internal review found that concerns about his behavior weren\u2019t handled appropriately",
      "LONDON -- The BBC has apologized to staff members who felt unable to complain about the conduct of actor and comedian Russell Brand because of his status after an internal review found that concerns about his behavior weren\u2019t handled appropriately.",
      "The investigation by Peter Johnston, the BBC\u2019s director of editorial complaints, identified eight complaints about Brand, including allegations that he had sex on BBC premises and exposed himself in the studio. Only one of those complaints was formally made to management at the time, Johnston found.",
      "\u201cI am grateful to those who have come forward to talk to me and my team and I have apologized on behalf of the BBC to those most directly affected by what I have documented here,\u2019\u2019 Johnston said in a report released Thursday. \u201cThe culture of the time undoubtedly influenced what was acceptable/tolerated, but I have found that a number of individuals had concerns about Russell Brand\u2019s behavior which they felt unable to raise then.\u2019\u2019",
      "The BBC launched its investigation after British media published claims by four women that they were sexually assaulted by Brand between 2006 and 2013, at the height of his fame. Brand had two weekly radio shows on the BBC from 2006 to 2008 and worked periodically on a number of short-term projects.",
      "Brand, 49, has more recently created podcasts and YouTube videos that have been criticized for spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories. He has denied accusations of rape, assault and emotional abuse, and previously said all his sexual relationships were \u201cabsolutely always consensual.\u2019\u2019",
      "Johnston said he contacted Brand so he could provide his perspective on the investigation, but he chose not to participate.",
      "The BBC acknowledged that it was \u201cclear that presenters have been able to abuse their positions\u201d in the past. But the broadcaster said there have been changes in procedures since Brand left the BBC, including the creation of a special process for the most serious allegations and an anti-bullying and harassment policy."

      "A traditionalist Catholic bishop whose denial of the Holocaust created a scandal when Pope Benedict XVI rehabilitated him has died",
      "ROME -- Richard Williamson, an ultra-traditionalist Catholic bishop whose denial of the Holocaust created a scandal in 2009 when Pope Benedict XVI rehabilitated him and other members of his breakaway society, has died. He was 84.",
      "Williamson suffered a cerebral hemorrhage in his native England on Jan. 24 and died Wednesday, the Society of St. Pius X said in a statement on Thursday.",
      "Williamson was among four men consecrated bishop in 1988 by the late Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, who formed the group in 1969 in opposition to the Second Vatican Council. Vatican II was the series of 1960s church meetings that modernized the Catholic Church by allowing Mass in the vernacular rather than Latin and revolutionizing the church's relations with Jews.",
      "In 1988, the Vatican excommunicated Lefebvre, Williamson and the other bishops, because they were consecrated without papal consent.",
      "First as cardinal and then as pope, Benedict worked to heal the schism and bring the group back under Rome\u2019s wing, fearing the spread of a parallel, pre-Vatican II church. The fear wasn't unfounded: The society, which is based in Menzingen, Switzerland, boasts six seminaries and dozens of chapels, schools and retreat centers around the globe.",
      "As part of his outreach, Benedict removed the excommunications of Williamson and the surviving bishops in 2009. But an uproar ensued after Williamson said in a television interview that aired on Swiss television just before the pope's decree was made public that he didn't believe Jews were killed in gas chambers during World War II.",
      "The scandal was an acute embarrassment for the German-born pope, who later acknowledged mistakes in the Williamson affair and said that a simple internet search would have turned up Williamson\u2019s views.",
      "Williamson later ran afoul of the society itself, which expelled him in 2012 for insubordination. He had ignored a deadline to \u201cdeclare his submission\u201d to its authority and had called for the society\u2019s superior to resign, the group said at the time.",
      "The following year, a German court fined him for having denied the Holocaust in the 2009 television interview. Holocaust denial is a crime in Germany.",
      "In announcing Williamson\u2019s death, the society said that Williamson had been ordained a priest by Lefebvre in 1976 and had taught in the society\u2019s seminaries in Europe, the U.S. and Argentina. He had also served in a leadership position as second assistant general from 1988-1994.",
      "\u201cSadly, his path and that of the Society separated many years ago,\u201d the statement said.",

      "Europe\u2019s economy stagnated at the end of last year as its former growth engine, Germany, finished a second straight year of shrinking output. Gross domestic product in the 20-country eurozone showed a zero increase in the final quarter of 2024, the EU statistics agency Eurostat said.",
      "The economy slowed from 0.4% growth in the third quarter as businesses were unsettled by possible trade disruptions under the new administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Consumers remained cautious about spending after being stung by inflation, even though inflation has come down from its peak of 10.6% in October 2022.",
      "Germany is laboring under multiple headwinds including the loss of cheap energy from Russia, choking bureaucracy and political paralysis in Berlin. Its economy contracted 0.2% in the fourth quarter.",
      "The German economy, Europe's largest, also contracted 0.2% for all of 2024, the second straight year of declining output. And the outlook for this year isn't much better. The government slashed its 2025 forecast on Wednesday to 0.3% from 1.1%.",
      "Leading European economies Germany and France are both unsettled by political turmoil that has left businesses and consumers uncertain about what the future holds in terms of government spending, regulation and taxes. Germany\u2019s political confusion could clear up after a national election on Feb. 23 following the collapse of Social Democratic Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019 governing coalition, which had been mired in months of bickering over what to do about the economy.",
      "France may take longer to emerge from paralysis, since the parliament is deeply divided and a new election can't be held until July at the earliest. Political forces are at odds over how to address the country\u2019s large budget deficit.",
      "Business prospects have been unsettled by the election of Trump, whose advocacy of new and higher import tariffs could hurt Europe's export-oriented economy. Slowing uptake of electric vehicles and Germany's cancellation of purchase subsidies for EVs has hurt demand for parts suppliers.",
      "Measures of consumer optimism such as the economic sentiment index compiled by the EU's executive commission indicate consumer are fretting over prices. It\u2019s unclear if they expect higher prices in the future, possibly due to the threat of tariffs from the new Trump administration, or if they are responding to recent price increases."

      "The binding judgement from the Strasbourg-based court confirmed that increased rates of cancer and groundwater pollution had been recorded in the area of 90 municipalities known as the Tierra dei Fuoci, or Land of Fires, where some 2.9 million people live.",

      "Residents have long complained about adverse health effects from the dumping, which poisoned underground wells used to irrigate the farmland that provides vegetables for much of Italy\u2019s center and south. Over the years, police have sequestered dozens of fields because their irrigation wells contained high levels of lead, arsenic and the industrial solvent tetrachloride.",

Camorra turncoats have revealed how the racket works, directing police to specific sites where toxic garbage was dumped.",

      "TOKYO -- A truck that fell into a sinkhole that suddenly opened on a road near Tokyo has captured national attention as attempts to rescue the elderly driver drag on. Residents near the hole have taken shelter at a local school, and there were worries Thursday about flooding and leaking sewage water. There's also been a renewed debate about Japan\u2019s aging infrastructure.",
      "Just after the sinkhole appeared in Yashio City, just northeast of Tokyo, on Tuesday morning a 3-ton truck fell into it. At first the sinkhole was roughly 10 meters (33 feet) wide and 5-meters (16-feet) deep, but it has since grown to twice that size.",
      "A 74-year-old man is believed to be trapped in the cabin of the flat-bed truck. He was conscious and communicating with rescue workers earlier but hasn't responded since Tuesday afternoon, according to Yashio fire department official Yoshifumi Hashiguchi.",
      "Saitama prefectural sewer system official Jun Uehara said corrosion, possibly because of strong acid constantly passing through the system, might have created a hole in the pipe, causing soil above to fall in and create a large hollow space between it and the road.",
      "No problem was found with the pipe during its last visual inspection, which is required every five years. The sewage water leaking out of the damaged pipe may also cause flooding.",
      "The unsteady ground, with a hollow space below it, is hampering the rescue. Television footage captured the asphalt road cracking and collapsing into the sinkhole, knocking down billboards. Authorities have tried to save the driver by lifting his truck with cranes, but they could only recover the loading platform, leaving behind the cabin where the driver is believed to be trapped. Officials have also tried without success to remove sediment and dig out the driver. They also flew a drone into the hole to see if rescue workers can climb down, but no progress has been made.",
      "Neighbors are being asked to cut back on water use. Parts of the road are closed. There's also uncertainty about how long the operations will last.",
      "About 20 residents within a 200-meter (656-feet) radius of the sinkhole have taken shelter at a local junior high school Thursday, according to the city.",
      "Over one million residents across the Saitama prefecture, especially in areas where sewage goes to the pipe, have been asked to cut back on laundry and bathing to prevent it from overflowing into the sinkhole. Prefectural officials have also started diverting sewage from an upstream pumping station and release it into a nearby river after treatment, Uehara said.",
      "When the driver is taken out, experts will enter the sinkhole and inspect the sewage system.",
      "The Land, Infrastructure and Transport Ministry has ordered a nationwide inspection of sewer systems. In one of the world\u2019s most disaster-prone countries, the sinkhole has raised worries about aging infrastructure.",
      "Most of Japan\u2019s main public infrastructure was built during the rapid economic growth of the 1960s and 1970s. The sewage pipe in Yashiro is about 40 years old."

      "GOMA, Congo -- Congo\u2019s leader called on young people to massively enlist in the army to help fight Rwanda-backed rebels who were attempting to seize more territory in the country's east as a crucial meeting of neighbors asked the Congolese government to talk with the rebels. Rwanda's leader also threatened to \u201cdeal\u201d with any confrontation from South Africa regarding the conflict.",
      "In his first public remarks since the M23 rebels advanced into eastern Congo\u2019s largest city, Goma, on Monday, President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi late Wednesday vowed \u201ca vigorous and coordinated response\u201d to push back the rebels while reaffirming his commitment to a peaceful resolution. \u201cEnlist massively in the army because you are the spearhead of our country,\u201d he urged young people.",
      "The M23 rebels in eastern Congo are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, far more than in 2012 when they first captured Goma. They are one of more than 100 armed groups vying for control in Congo\u2019s mineral-rich east, which holds vast deposits estimated to be worth $24 trillion and critical to much of the world\u2019s technology.",
      "After capturing much of Goma, a humanitarian hub critical for the more than 6 million people displaced by the conflict in eastern Congo, witnesses said Thursday morning that the rebels were advancing towards South Kivu\u2019s provincial capital Bukavu, causing fear and panic among residents.",

      "A summit of the regional East African bloc, meanwhile, called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in eastern Congo and \u201cstrongly urged\u201d Tshisekedi\u2019s government to hold talks with the rebels. Tshisekedi was conspicuously absent from the virtual summit attended by Rwanda, also a member.",
      "While African countries as well as the U.N. and U.S. have called for an immediate ceasefire, the risk of a regional war has increased, analysts say, exacerbated by the rebels' advance into South Kivu and diatribes between Rwandan and South African officials. Congo is a member of the southern Africa regional bloc and also that of east Africa, whose peacekeeping force it kicked out last year after deeming it ineffective.",
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa blamed the \u201cRwanda Defense Force militia\u201d for the fighting that has resulted in the death of 13 South African peacekeepers in eastern Congo. He also said his government will ensure the peacekeepers are \u201csufficiently supported during this critical mission.\u201d",
      "His comment drew an angry response from Rwandan President Paul Kagame who called the South African peacekeepers a \u201cbelligerent force\u201d working alongside armed groups that target Rwanda. \u201cIf South Africa prefers confrontation, Rwanda will deal with the matter in that context any day,\u201d the Rwandan leader said on X.",
      "Analysts say the real fight in eastern Congo is for control over the Congo\u2019s vast mineral deposits. M23 rebels appear to be preparing to occupy eastern Congo for good, and have told The AP of their plans to set up an administration and return displaced people to their homes.",
      "The chaotic situation with the M23 has its roots in ethnic conflict, stretching back decades to the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, when 800,000 Tutsis and others were killed by Hutus and former militias. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and others involved in the genocide. Many Hutus fled into Congo after 1994.",
      "Unlike in 2012 when the rebels seized Congo for days, observers say their withdrawal could be more difficult now. The rebels have been emboldened by Rwanda, which feels Congo is ignoring its interests in the region and failed to meet demands of previous peace agreements, according to Murithi Mutiga, program director for Africa at the Crisis Group, a think tank.",
      "\u201cUltimately, this is a failure of African mediation (because) the warning signs were always there. Kigali was adopting very bellicose rhetoric and the Congolese government was also adopting very, very aggressive rhetoric,\u201d Mutiga with the Crisis Group said.",

      "\u201cThe mountain has long been an honored ancestor, a source of physical, cultural and spiritual sustenance and a final resting place,\" Paul Goldsmith, the lawmaker responsible for the settlements between the government and M\u0101ori tribes, told Parliament in a speech on Thursday.",
      "But colonizers of New Zealand in the 18th and 19th centuries took first the name of Taranaki and then the mountain itself. In 1770, the British explorer Captain James Cook spotted the peak from his ship and named it Mount Egmont.",
      "In 1840, M\u0101ori tribes and representatives of the British crown signed the Treaty of Waitangi \u2014 New Zealand's founding document \u2014 in which the Crown promised M\u0101ori would retain rights to their land and resources. But the M\u0101ori and English versions of the treaty differed \u2014 and Crown breaches of both began immediately.",
      "In 1865, a vast swathe of Taranaki land, including the mountain, was confiscated to punish M\u0101ori for rebeling against the Crown. Over the next century hunting and sports groups had a say in the mountain's management \u2014 but M\u0101ori did not.",
      "\u201cTraditional M\u0101ori practices associated with the mountain were banned while tourism was promoted,\u201d Goldsmith said. But a M\u0101ori protest movement of the 1970s and '80s has led to a surge of recognition for the M\u0101ori language, culture and rights in New Zealand law.",
      "Redress has included billions of dollars in Treaty of Waitangi settlements \u2014 such as the agreement with the eight tribes of Taranaki, signed in 2023.",
      "\u201cToday, Taranaki, our maunga, our maunga tupuna, is released from the shackles, the shackles of injustice, of ignorance, of hate,\" said Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, a co-leader of the political party Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori and a descendant of the Taranaki tribes, using a phrase that means ancestral mountain.",
      "\u201cWe grew up knowing there was nothing anyone could do to make us any less connected,\u201d she added.",
      "The mountain's legal rights are intended to uphold its health and wellbeing. They will be employed to stop forced sales, restore its traditional uses and allow conservation work to protect the native wildlife that flourishes there. Public access will remain.",
      "New Zealand was the first country in the world to recognize natural features as people when a law passed in 2014 granted personhood to Te Urewera, a vast native forest on the North Island. Government ownership ceased and the tribe T\u016bhoe became its guardian.",
      "\u201cTe Urewera is ancient and enduring, a fortress of nature, alive with history; its scenery is abundant with mystery, adventure, and remote beauty,\u201d the law begins, before describing its spiritual significance to M\u0101ori. In 2017, New Zealand recognized the Whanganui River as human, as part of a settlement with its local iwi.",
      "The bill recognizing the mountain's personhood was affirmed unanimously by Parliament's 123 lawmakers. The vote was greeted by a ringing waiata \u2014 a M\u0101ori song \u2014 from the public gallery, packed with dozens who had traveled to the capital, Wellington, from Taranaki.",
      "The unity provided brief respite in a tense period for race relations in New Zealand. In November, tens of thousands of people marched to Parliament to protest a law that would reshape the Treaty of Waitangi by setting rigid legal definitions for each clause. Detractors say the law \u2014 which is not expected to pass \u2014 would strip M\u0101ori of legal rights and dramatically reverse progress from the past five decades."

      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Hamas is set to free three more Israeli hostages as well as five Thai captives on Thursday, and Israel is to release another 110 Palestinian prisoners, in the third such exchange since a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip took hold earlier this month.",
      "The truce is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas, whose Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel sparked the fighting. It has held despite a dispute earlier this week over the sequence in which the hostages were released.",
      "The Israelis set to be released are Arbel Yehoud, 29, Agam Berger, 20 \u2014 who was abducted along with four other female soldiers who were freed Saturday \u2014 and Gadi Moses, an 80-year-old man. The identities of the Thai nationals who will be released were not immediately known.",
      "A number of foreign workers were taken captive along with dozens of Israeli civilians and soldiers during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack that set off the war. Twenty-three Thais were among more than 100 hostages released during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Israel says eight remain.",
      "Of the people set to be released from prisons in Israel, 30 are serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks against Israelis. Zakaria Zubeidi, a prominent former militant leader and theater director who took part in a dramatic jailbreak in 2021 before being rearrested days later, is also among those set to be released.",
      "Israel said Yehoud was supposed to have been freed Saturday and delayed the opening of crossings to northern Gaza when she was not.",
      "The United States, Egypt and Qatar, which brokered the ceasefire after a year of tough negotiations, resolved the dispute with an agreement that Yehoud and two other hostages would be released Thursday. Another three hostages, all men, are set to be freed Saturday along with dozens more Palestinian prisoners.",
      "On Monday, Israel began allowing Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, the most heavily destroyed part of the territory, and hundreds of thousands streamed back. Many found only mounds of rubble where their homes had been.",
      "In the first phase of the ceasefire, Hamas is set to release a total of 33 hostages, including women, children, older adults and sick or wounded men, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israel says Hamas has confirmed that eight of the hostages to be released in this phase are dead.",
      "Palestinians have cheered the release of the prisoners, who are widely seen by Palestinians as heroes who have sacrificed for the cause of ending Israel\u2019s decades-long occupation of lands they want for a future state.",
      "Israeli forces have meanwhile pulled back from most of Gaza, allowing hundreds of thousands of people to return to what remains of their homes and humanitarian groups to surge assistance.",
      "The deal calls for Israel and Hamas to negotiate a second phase in which Hamas would release the remaining hostages and the ceasefire would continue indefinitely. The war could resume in early March if an agreement is not reached.",
      "Israel says it is still committed to destroying Hamas, even after the militant group reasserted its rule over Gaza within hours of the truce. A key far-right partner in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s coalition is already calling for the war to resume after the ceasefire\u2019s first phase.",
      "Hamas says it won't release the remaining hostages without an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza..",
      "The United States has provided crucial military and diplomatic support to Israel throughout the war and is seen as key to ending the conflict. U.S. President Donald Trump has been a staunch supporter of Israel but has also pledged to end the wars in the Middle East.",

      "Hamas started the war when it sent thousands of fighters storming into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250.",
      "Israel\u2019s air and ground war was among the deadliest and most destructive in decades. More than 47,000 Palestinians have been killed, over half of them women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were militants.",
      "The Israeli military says it killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence, and that it went to great lengths to try to spare civilians. It blames civilian deaths on Hamas because its fighters operate in dense residential neighborhoods and put military infrastructure near homes, schools and mosques.",
      "The Israeli offensive has transformed entire neighborhoods into mounds of gray rubble, and it\u2019s unclear how or when anything will be rebuilt. Around 90% of Gaza\u2019s population has been displaced, often multiple times, with hundreds of thousands of people living in squalid tent camps or shuttered schools.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 02:10:25 -0500",
    "summary": "A young Italian couple is going to court in the Vatican tribunal to challenge a new ban on workplace marriages imposed by the Vatican bank",
    "story": [
      "A young Italian couple is going to court in the Vatican tribunal to challenge a new ban on workplace marriages imposed by the Vatican bank",
      "ROME -- Pope Francis has long urged couples to marry and have babies rather than dogs. He also has long championed the rights of workers and held up labor itself as the foundation of human dignity.",
      "So it has come as something of a surprise to many in the Holy See that the Vatican bank fired a young newlywed couple, with three young children between them, after a new internal bank regulation went into effect barring workplace marriages.",
      "The apparent contradiction between what the pope preaches and what his Vatican practices isn\u2019t lost on Silvia Carlucci and Domenico Fabiani, who on Thursday are challenging the ban in a wrongful termination lawsuit before the Vatican tribunal.",
      "Ahead of the hearing, they told The Associated Press this week that they never once considered calling off their Aug. 31, 2024, nuptials after learning of the new regulation. They said they couldn\u2019t contemplate the bank\u2019s suggestion that one of them quit to avoid running afoul of the new rule, because of financial obligations to their children, former spouses and new mortgage.",
      "\u201cI thought for sure there might have been an intervention by the Holy Father, who rightly gives so much emphasis and value to the role of the family,\u201d Fabiani said in the office of his lawyer, with Carlucci by his side. \u201cAnd yet here we find a family that works there and now finds itself on the street.\u201d",
      "Grasping for her husband\u2019s hand, Carlucci was more blunt: \u201cThere\u2019s a great contrast between what truly happens (in the Vatican) and what is promoted.\u201d",
      "The plight of the 41-year-olds, who between them worked for 25 years at the Institute for Religious Works, as the bank is known, has captured the attention of many in the Vatican, where employment has long been a coveted mark of status in overwhelmingly Catholic Italy. Also, a Vatican job comes with real benefits: tax-free income, access to a duty-free gas station, supermarket, pharmacy and department store and if lucky, access to below-market rents in some of the Holy See\u2019s palazzi in Rome.",
      "But for the past several years, amid a financial crisis that has resulted in hiring freezes, cuts to overtime, seniority bonuses and other benefits, employee discontent seems to be on the rise, with the Carlucci-Fabiani case something of a tipping point in a system where truly independent legal recourse doesn't exist.",
      "The Association of Lay Vatican Employees, the closest thing the Vatican has to a labor union, has taken up the couple\u2019s cause, issuing an online solidarity appeal on their behalf. It has asserted that the new rule violates basic human rights as well as the Vatican\u2019s fundamental laws and the church\u2019s canon law, which in the Vatican take legal precedence over internal regulations.",
      "\u201cWhile we are confident that God will provide for them and their children, we cannot silence the voice of our conscience that recognizes the traits of injustice and lack of charity in the measure that affected these two former colleagues,\u201d the online appeal reads. \u201cThe application of a regulation, while necessary in the governance of any institution, cannot fail to take into account the fact that any institution is made up of people and stands by virtue of the activity and professionalism of these same people.\u201d",
      "The Institute for Religious Works, or IOR as it is known, is a peculiar institution, created in 1942 to help the church carry out its charitable mission while enabling Vatican embassies and religious orders in far-flung parts of the world to send and receive money when commercial banking might be problematic.",
      "Located in a tower just steps inside Vatican City, the bank was long mired in scandal but spent over a decade cleaning up its books and ridding itself of its reputation as an offshore tax haven. The reforms slimmed down its client base to around 12,300 customers among Vatican offices, employees, religious orders and embassies, who are served by a staff of around 100 at its lone Vatican branch.",
      "According to the couple, the bank management announced a new personnel policy on May 2, laying out criteria for employment that said marriage between an IOR employee and another bank employee, or anyone else who works in the Vatican City State, was cause for termination.",
      "The change shocked them: Three months earlier, they had told bank management of their plans to wed after securing the Catholic decrees of nullity for their previous marriages. Carlucci got an advance on her yearly bonus to help secure their mortgage. They had formally publicized their pending nuptials in Rome city hall and their respective parishes.",
      "\u201cThey congratulated us, \u2018A wedding, how wonderful this marriage. Great job, you made it,\u2019\u201d Carlucci recalls her superiors telling her.",
      "The bank has strongly defended its policy as being consistent with best bank practices to promote transparency and impartiality and avoid conflicts of interest.",
      "It says it actually delayed implementing the policy until the last of five married couples in its workforce had retired in March. With such a small staff and one branch, \u201cthis rule is in fact essential to prevent both inevitable professional conflicts of interest between the aspiring spouses concerned, as well as the emergence of possible familistic management doubts among its customers or the general public,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "And yet the couple, and anyone familiar with the Vatican, knows plenty of married partners who work in the city state, not necessarily in the same department but among the 4,500 people who work in the Holy See.",
      "While expressing \u201cdeep regret,\u201d the bank said it had \u201creached the difficult decision\u201d to terminate the couple\u2019s employment on Oct. 1, a month after their church wedding. It is unclear why the bank didn\u2019t just terminate one of the two. A transfer to an unrelated Vatican office wasn't possible under the terms of the new regulation.",
      "The couple wrote to Francis personally, hoping he might intervene, but received no reply.",
      "Francis though seems keenly aware that employee morale is low and that times are tough for families. He recently approved the opening of the Vatican's first day-care center, as well as a \u201cbaby bonus\u201d of an extra 300 euros a month for Vatican employees with three or more children.",
      "During his annual Christmas greetings to Vatican personnel last month, dedicated to the theme of family and work, Francis urged employees to talk to their managers if they have problems.",
      "\u201cIf anyone has any special difficulties, please speak up, tell the people in charge, because we want to solve all difficulties,\u201d Francis told the Dec. 21 audience, attended by far fewer people than in past years. \u201cAnd this is done by dialogue and not by shouting or being silent.\u201d",
      "Carlucci would like her job back, but says her new marriage and blended family matter more.",
      "\u201cFor us, family is at the basis of our entire lives, so no matter what happens and despite everything, we have won,\u201d she said.",

      "Now, reforms can be swept through with just the vote of three quarters of legislators. Bukele\u2019s New Ideas party holds 54 seats and its allies three more in the 60-seat unicameral Congress.",

      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed 15 months ago that Israel would achieve \u201ctotal victory\u201d in the war in Gaza \u2014 by eradicating Hamas and freeing all the hostages",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed 15 months ago that Israel would achieve \u201ctotal victory\u201d in the war in Gaza \u2014 by eradicating Hamas and freeing all the hostages. One week into a ceasefire with the militant group, many Israelis are dubious.",
      "Not only is Hamas still intact, there\u2019s also no guarantee all of the hostages will be released. But what\u2019s really raised doubts about Netanyahu\u2019s ability to deliver on his promise is this week's return of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to their homes in northern Gaza. That makes it difficult for Israel to relaunch its war against Hamas should the two sides fail to extend the ceasefire beyond its initial six-week phase.",
      "\u201cThere is no war to resume,\u201d said Ofer Shelah, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies, a Tel Aviv think tank. \u201cWhat will we do now? Move the population south again?\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no total victory in this war,\u201d he said.",
      "Israel launched its war against Hamas after the militant group\u2019s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, in which some 1,200 people were killed and roughly 250 were taken hostage. Within hours, Israel began a devastating air assault on Gaza, and weeks later it launched a ground invasion.",
      "Israel has inflicted heavy losses on Hamas. It has killed most of its top leadership, and claims to have killed thousands of fighters while dismantling tunnels and weapons factories. Months of bombardment and urban warfare have left Gaza in ruins, and more than 47,000 Palestinians are dead, according to local health authorities who don\u2019t distinguish between militants and civilians in their count.",
      "But the \u201ctotal victory\u201d envisioned by Netanyahu remains elusive.",
      "In the first phase of the ceasefire, 33 hostages in Gaza will be freed, nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in Israel will be released, and humanitarian aid to Gaza will be vastly increased. Israel is also redeploying troops to enable over 1 million Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza.",
      "In the second phase of the ceasefire, which the two sides are expected to begin negotiating next week, more hostages would be released and the stage would be set for a more lasting truce.",
      "But if Israel and Hamas do not agree to advance to the next phase, more than half of the roughly 90 remaining hostages will still be in Gaza; at least a third of them are believed to be dead.",
      "Despite heavy international and domestic pressure to develop a postwar vision for who should rule Gaza, Netanyahu has yet to secure an alternative to the militant group. That has left Hamas in command.",
      "Hamas sought to solidify that impression as soon as the ceasefire began. It quickly deployed uniformed police to patrol the streets and staged elaborate events for the hostages\u2019 release, replete with masked gunmen, large crowds and ceremonies. Masked militants have also been seen along Gaza's main thoroughfares, waving to and welcoming Palestinians as they head back home.",
      "Despite the scale of death and destruction in Gaza \u2014 and the hit to its own ranks \u2014 Hamas will likely claim victory.",
      "Hamas will say, \u201cIsrael didn\u2019t achieve its goals and didn\u2019t defeat us, so we won,\u201d said Michael Milshtein, an Israeli expert on Palestinian affairs.",
      "The return of displaced Palestinians to northern Gaza is an important achievement for Hamas, Milshtein said. The group long insisted on a withdrawal of Israeli troops and an end to war as part of any deal \u2014 two conditions that have effectively begun to be realized.",
      "And Hamas can now reassert itself in a swath of the territory that Israel battled over yet struggled to entirely control.",
      "To enable Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, Israel opened the Netzarim corridor, a roughly 4-mile (6-kilometer) military zone bisecting the territory. That gives Hamas more freedom to operate, while taking away leverage that would be difficult for Israel regain even if it restarted the war, said Giora Eiland, a former Israeli general who had proposed a surrender-or-starve strategy for northern Gaza.",
      "\u201cWe are at the mercy of Hamas,\u201d he said in an interview with Israeli Army Radio. \u201cThe war has ended very badly\u201d for Israel, he said, whereas Hamas \u201chas largely achieved everything it wanted.\u201d",

      "He has strongly hinted that he wants the sides to continue to the second phase of negotiations and shown little enthusiasm for resuming the war.

      "An end to the war complicates Netanyahu\u2019s political horizon. The Israeli leader is under intense pressure to resume the war from his far-right political allies, who want to see Hamas crushed. They envision new Jewish settlements in Gaza and long-term Israeli rule there.",

      "Civil rights activists have gathered outside Target's Minneapolis headquarters to call for a boycott of the retailing giant over its decision to phase out its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Civil rights activists gathered outside the headquarters of Target Corp. on Thursday to call for a national boycott of the retailing giant over its decision to phase out its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",
      "Target announced last Friday that it would join competitor Walmart and a number of other prominent American brands in scaling back their DEI initiatives, which have come under attack from conservatives and the new White House of President Donald Trump.",
      "Nekima Levy Armstrong, a veteran civil rights lawyer in Minneapolis and founder of the Racial Justice Network, joined other local activists and their supporters at a news conference to urge people to begin the boycott on Saturday, the first day of Black History Month. Many of the participants were regular Target shoppers until now, she said.",
      "Levy Armstrong said they were \u201cstunned\u201d that Target, which increased its commitment to building a more diverse workforce in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd, a Black man, in Minneapolis in 2020, backed away from its support of racial equity.",
      "\u201cWe thought that they would hold the line. We thought that they would continue to stand for the values that we all hold dear,\u201d she said. \"But instead they acted cowardly, and they made the decision to bow down to the Trump administration. Well, we are here today saying we will not bow down. We will not step back, and we will not turn around.\u201d",
      "Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on Islamic-American Relations, said that as a company based in the city where Floyd's murder sparked a national reckoning with racial injustice, Target must be called out.",
      "\u201cWe here in Minneapolis today, the good people of the state, are saying to our friends all over the country, \u2018If you were moved to do something good after the murder of George Floyd, it is time for you to stand up and boycott Target,\u2019\u201d Hussein said.",
      "The organizers of the boycott include local Black Lives Matter groups. During the boycott announcement, some speakers cut up their distinctive red Target charge cards, while others called on DEI supporters to shop at Costco, which reaffirmed its commitment to DEI last week.",
      "Despite the anger with Target, the news conference-turned-rally took on a festive atmosphere, with a New Orleans-style brass band playing protest songs like Bob Marley's \u201cGet Up, Stand Up.\u201d Participants circled up for a prayer before the speeches began.",
      "Target, which long was viewed as a strong advocate for the rights of Black and LGBTQ+ people, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday on the call for a boycott. But in a memo to employees last week, Kiera Fernandez, Target\u2019s chief community impact and equity officer, described the company's decision to retire its diversity goals as a \u201cnext chapter\u201d in the company\u2019s human resource and customer engagement strategy.",
      "\u201cAnd as a retailer that serves millions of consumers every day, we understand the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape, now and in the future,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Levy Armstrong said Target has not reached out to her or other local Black leaders. She said they expected more from Target, and now feel like everything it had done in support of people of color was just window dressing. The starting point for any conversation, she said, would be for the company reverse its decision immediately.",
      "\u201cTarget knows what its presence and its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion means to this community,\" Levy Armstrong said. \u201cSo that is why we are focusing on Target first. But that does not mean that those other businesses should not also be held accountable. All of those businesses should be held accountable, and they should not have access to our dollars.\u201d",
      "Speakers also called on long-established civil rights groups that have benefited from Target\u2019s philanthropy, such as the NAACP and the Urban League, to join the opposition to Target\u2019s decision. Levy Armstrong and Hussein said they plan to partner with other national organizations to get the word out about the boycott and to take other steps they were not yet ready to share publicly.",
      "Ever since calls for a boycott began circulating on social media, the founders of several Black-owned businesses that sell their products in Target stores or through the company's online platforms have expressed concern that a broad boycott might hurt them. They included the owners of hair care brands The Doux and Camille Rose, and the cosmetics brand Lip Bar.",
      "The Minneapolis organizers said Black consumers and their white allies can continue to support those companies while cutting Target out.",
      "\u201cWe are asking people to go on their websites and buy directly from those Black companies, because Target will not see a single one of our Black dollars,\u201d Levy Armstrong said."

    "story": [
      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is planning to unveil proposals to put limits on lawsuits",
      "ATLANTA -- The pitch from Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is simple: Putting limits on lawsuits will halt rising insurance costs.",
      "The reality, though, is more complicated.",
      "Changes could reduce liability insurance costs for businesses and commercial property owners. The evidence is mixed on whether it would drive large premium reductions for car and other types of insurance. And some researchers say efforts limiting lawsuits, often called tort reform, fattens insurers' profits more than it cuts the price of policies.",
      "\u201cThe net impact is that it really improves insurer profitability,\u201d said Tyler Leverty, a business professor who studies risk and insurance at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.",
      "When Kemp unveils his proposals Thursday, the Republican governor is likely to keep leaning on his argument that everyone's insurance rates are increasing because unfair lawsuits are on the rise and juries are awarding excessive damages.",
      "The issue is Kemp\u2019s top priority this year after promising the Georgia Chamber of Commerce he would take action and instead pushed a law to have Georgia Insurance Commissioner John King gather data in 2024.",
      "King said that lawsuits are driving insurance companies to reduce coverage for retail businesses, apartment owners, drivers and others. He said business owners in areas that insurers label as high crime are among those struggling the most. Companies that offer low-income housing have also complained.",
      "\u201cGo down to southeast Atlanta and talk to the small convenience owners having to close because they can\u2019t find insurance,\u201d King said.",
      "Some say there's no evidence that a nationwide litigation crisis is driving high insurance rates.",
      "\u201cI went in search of the data, and I have not found it,\u201d said Kenneth Klein, a law professor at California Western School of Law. \u201cIt\u2019s not to say it isn\u2019t happening. It\u2019s to say we cannot document it.\u201d",
      "But Mike Iverson of Oakbridge Insurance and former president of the Independent Insurance Agents Association said insurance companies like predictability when determining rates and how to spread out losses.",
      "In a well-known case, a jury awarded a man almost $43 million after a shooting in a CVS parking lot in Atlanta, arguing the company should have strengthened security. In another case, a Jonesboro mobile home park was ordered to pay $31 million to the daughter of a man who was shot and killed there.",
      "Opponents note that few verdicts are that large and insurance companies are still profitable. They want lawmakers to demand more transparency on how they set rates.",
      "\u201cWhenever they want an excuse to raise rates or limit coverage they will always point to a verdict here and there and make all kinds of claims about how it\u2019s affecting their bottom line,\u201d said Joanne Doroshow, executive director of the Center for Justice & Democracy at New York Law School.",
      "Studying how tort reform impacts premiums in other states is difficult because other factors are in play and there are different combinations of reform. Some saw benefits, but the research varies.",
      "Other factors that influence insurance rates include inflation, extreme weather, and the costs of labor and materials. It is normal for insurance markets to cycle through tough years where less coverage is offered as rates rise.",
      "In many lines of coverage, including those not heavily impacted by lawsuits, insurers in 2022 were less profitable in Georgia than in several other states, according to data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. A spokesperson said over a longer period, though, nothing is abnormal about Georgia's fluctuations.",
      "King\u2019s report, using mostly auto insurance data, says the number of claims and the size of resulting payments have risen over the years, especially those involving lawsuits. Some numbers dropped in 2022 and 2023, but he said that was because the data is incomplete.",
      "King also found that a greater percentage of legal claims are resulting in payments that hit the maximum dollar amount a policy covers.",
      "The Georgia Trial Lawyers Association, which lobbies against tort reform, disputes King's conclusions.",
      "Risk consultant David Stegall said the number of claims is in line with Georgia\u2019s high number of car accidents. Both claims and payouts have mostly been stable or falling, especially when adjusted for population growth and inflation, he said.",
      "He also found that while Georgia residents pay between 11% and 68% more for car insurance than residents of other states, they are more than 200% more likely to be in an accident.",
      "Adam Willis, president of trucking firm F&W Transportation, said his company\u2019s premiums have doubled over the last 10 years while fewer insurers offer full coverage. His company also has been sued more often, he said.",
      "Defenders of the current system say the trade-offs of lawsuit limits are a bad deal.",
      "\u201cThe governor says that limiting your right as a consumer will lower your insurance costs, but that is not only a bad idea for everyday citizens, it\u2019s just not correct,\u201d said state Rep. Tanya Miller, an Atlanta Democrat.",

      "But the fish were still alive and swimming in the farm\u2019s giant indoor tanks. The organizations would need to figure out how to get some 13,000 salmon from the water and then have them processed into frozen fillets for distribution to regional food pantries.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit different,\u201d Kohler said during a break. \u201cIn the past, my volunteer work with the food bank has been sorting carrots or peppers, or gleaning out in the field.\u201d",
      "LocalCoho is a startup that had been piloting a sustainable salmon farming system employing recirculated water. Its facility west of Syracuse had been supplying coho salmon to wholesalers and retailers, including high-end Manhattan sushi restaurants, with the goal of building regional farms across the country.",

      "With a shutdown looming, farm manager Adam Kramarsyck said they didn\u2019t want the fish to go to waste or end up as biofuel. That's when they reached out to see if the fish could be donated as food.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018lemonade out of lemons,\u2019 I guess is the phrase,\u201d Kramarsyck said.",

      "Utah leaders, locals and longtime attendees of the Sundance Film Festival are making their final push to keep the world-renowned independent film festival in the state as its directors consider uprooting it",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- With the 2025 Sundance Film Festival underway, Utah leaders, locals and longtime attendees are making a final push \u2014 that could include paying millions of dollars \u2014 to keep the world-renowned film festival as its directors consider uprooting.",
      "Thousands of festivalgoers affixed bright yellow stickers to their winter coats that read \u201cKeep Sundance in Utah\" in a last-ditch effort to convince festival leadership and state officials to keep it in Park City, its home of 41 years.",
      "Gov. Spencer Cox said previously that Utah would not throw as much money at the festival as other states hoping to lure it away. Now his office is urging the Legislature to carve out $3 million for Sundance in the state budget, weeks before the independent film festival is expected to pick a home for the next decade.",
      "It could retain a small presence in picturesque Park City and center itself in nearby Salt Lake City, or move to another finalist \u2014 Cincinnati, Ohio, or Boulder, Colorado \u2014 beginning in 2027.",
      "\u201cSundance is Utah, and Utah is Sundance. You can\u2019t really separate those two,\" Cox said. \u201cThis is your home, and we desperately hope it will be your home forever.\"",
      "Festival Director Eugene Hernandez told reporters last week that they had not made a final decision. An announcement is expected this year by early spring.",
      "Colorado is trying to further sweeten its offer. The state is considering legislation giving up to $34 million in tax incentives to film festivals like Sundance through 2036 \u2014 on top of the $1.5 million in funds already approved to lure the Utah festival to its neighboring state.",
      "Cincinnati approved a resolution allocating $2.5 million to Sundance if festival leaders relocate to southwest Ohio. Yet money may not be the ultimate draw.",
      "Sundance leaders say the festival has outgrown the ski town it helped put on the map decades ago, and they worry it has developed an air of exclusivity that takes the focus away from the films. An ideal home would make Sundance more centralized, affordable and accessible to all who appreciate independent film.",
      "Some festivalgoers and industry leaders worry Sundance would lose its identity outside its idyllic mountain hometown.",
      "Roger and Carin Ehrenberg, major donors to the festival, said they would stop attending regularly if the festival was outside Utah. Sundance is a \u201cmagical experience\u201d for the New York City philanthropists, they said, due in large part to the atmosphere in Park City.",
      "\u201cIf it goes to Cincinnati, maybe once in a blue moon we would go, but it wouldn't be a regular thing,\" Carin Ehrenberg said. \u201cFor us, it\u2019ll lose its appeal.\u201d",
      "The couple said they would likely continue to donate even if they did not attend.",
      "Nineteen years of fond memories at Sundance helped inspire Dr. Rhonda Taubin to relocate her family from Atlanta to Heber City \u2014 Park City's neighboring town. She has no ties to the film industry but has become a fervent advocate for keeping the festival in her new home state.",
      "This year, she and her friends distributed thousands of \u201cKeep Sundance in Utah\u201d stickers \u2014 and another that read \u201cNOhio for Sundance\u201d \u2014 to show the festival how much it means to the local community.",
      "\u201cI really am not a movie buff, but my other girlfriends are, and being able to share all that we've been through as women, as mothers, as wives, as daughters, I don't want it to end,\u201d Taubin said. \u201cWe watch provocative movies that make us talk and think about things that maybe we've never thought about before. Utah would be at a huge loss without those conversations.\u201d",
      "If Sundance stays in Utah, the festival\u2019s former director John Cooper said major adjustments are needed to improve transportation between Salt Lake City and Park City and make lodging for filmmakers more affordable.",
      "Cooper, who led the festival from 2009 to 2020, said he would be sad to see Sundance shift away from actor and filmmaker Robert Redford's original vision. Its very name comes from Redford's character in the 1969 film \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt like my role was to be a keeper of the flame for Robert Redford and his legacy,\" Cooper told The Associated Press. \u201cThe mountains of Utah, this was his vision. It\u2019s weird to say \u2018Sundance in Ohio.\u2019 But I think it could go anywhere. What it does for a community is so strong.\u201d",
      "On the red carpet this week, many were split on whether Sundance should stay or go.",
      "Actor Elijah Wood urged the festival to remain in Park City, saying the location is part of its DNA.",
      "Others were open to it relocating. Actor Tessa Thompson, who serves on the Sundance Institute's board of trustees, said the festival could maintain its identity in a new city.",
      "\u201cI think that Sundance has more to do with the spirit and community, and I think that's evergreen,\" Thompson said. \"Regardless of where Sundance is, Sundance will always be.\u201d"

      "NASA is looking at developing a craft with a softer boom, and Boeing is also working on a prototype for supersonic commercial travel.",
      "Any new such service will likely face the same hurdles as the Concorde, which flew over the Atlantic and was barred from many overland routes because of the sonic booms it caused.",

      "A deadly crash more than two decades ago hastened the jet's demise. On July 25, 2000, an Air France Concorde crashed into a hotel and exploded shortly after takeoff in Paris, killing all 109 people on board and four on the ground. Investigators determined that the plane ran over a metal strip, damaging a tire that crashed into the underside of the wing, rupturing a fuel tank."

      "Investors are expecting that Musk's close relationship with Trump will translate into lighter regulation on the car company, fewer investigations and help in speeding the development of autonomous driving.",
      "But the Trump administration has also vowed to cut government incentives to customers to buy EVs and says it will loosen emission standards. The latter especially could hurt Tesla because it has a big business in selling \u201cregulatory credits\u201d to other automakers that fall short of the standards.",
      "The latest financial report showed that in the fourth quarter Tesla sold $692 million in these credits, a spigot of cash that could be turned off if Trump follows through on his vow."

      "The new projection is much lower than the government's previous forecast of 1.1% growth, issued in October.",
      "Germany has managed no meaningful economic growth in the past four years as it has struggled to deal with major shifts in the global economy and with structural challenges of its own.

    "story": [
      "Norfolk Southern's solid fourth quarter \u2014 combined with the optimism the railroad is hearing from their customers and support they\u2019re getting from Washington D",
      "Norfolk Southern's solid fourth quarter \u2014 combined with the optimism the railroad is hearing from their customers and support they're getting from Washington D.C. \u2014 has the CEO feeling optimistic about 2025.",
      "The railroad, based in Atlanta, earned $733 million, or $3.23 per share, in the fourth quarter. That's up from $527 million, or $2.32 per share, the prior year, helped by a couple of one-time items whereas the same quarter last year was weighed down by hefty derailment cleanup costs. The insurance payments Norfolk Southern is collecting during the fourth quarter related to the disastrous East Palestine, Ohio, derailment in 2023 and ensuing cleanup provided a $32 million boost, and some sales of rail lines added another $40 million to the bottom line.",
      "Without those unusual items, the railroad would have earned $688 million, or $3.04 per share. That easily exceeded the $2.94 that the analysts surveyed by FactSet Research were predicting.",
      "CEO Mark George said regulators from the Federal Railroad Administration, Surface Transportation Board and National Transportation Safety Board and members of Congress were all positive in recent meetings last week.",
      "It appears that the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress could ease restrictions on the industry instead of continuing to push for the changes President Joe Biden's Transportation Department had recommended after the 2023 derailment near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border.",
      "\u201cEveryone recognizes that we move the American economy. So we\u2019re an integral, vital part of moving the American economy,\u201d George said. \u201cSo they want to be supportive. So those are the messages we were receiving. It feels good and it\u2019s different.\u201d",
      "All the major railroads that have reported earnings this month have said they expect the FRA to now be more likely to approve waivers from regulations the industry has been seeking for years to use automated inspection technology to replace some human inspections. Rail unions have opposed those changes and argued that the new technology should supplement \u2014 not replace \u2014 human inspections.",
      "Democratic U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio, who represents the area of western Pennsylvania just over the border from where the East Palestine derailment happened, said he hopes the Trump administration won't roll back regulations on railroads and undo things like the two-person crew requirement rule the Biden administration finalized last year. Instead, Deluzio said he hopes Vice President JD Vance will help put pressure on Republican leaders in Congress to pass a rail safety bill similar to the one he proposed after the derailment while he was still an Ohio senator.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think this should be the moment to give the industry handouts when in fact, we should be putting stricter requirements on them on how they operate their trains through our communities,\u201d Deluzio said Wednesday at a news conference in western Pennsylvania where he announced plans to reintroduce a rail safety bill similar to the one that stalled after the derailment.",
      "It's hard to tell how any tariffs Trump might impose will affect the shipments railroads deliver. Last week, Union Pacific' s CEO warned that imports could be hurt significantly by tariffs, but NS' George seemed less concerned because he said any drop in imports might be replaced with increases in domestic production.",
      "\u201cThings will play out over time, but we move the U.S. economy, we move GDP. And whether that GDP is coming across the border as an import or whether it\u2019s now being produced domestically due to some onshoring, we\u2019re going to be there to move it,\u201d George said. \u201cSo I kind of think it\u2019s going to be a net wash in terms of volume.\u201d",
      "Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau said companies in all sectors are trying to get a handle on what tariffs will mean, and it's hard to know exactly how many of these trade sanctions will actually be imposed and how targeted they might be.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very common question being asked on this earnings season so far. And really at this point, it\u2019s very difficult to answer,\u201d Windau said.",
      "Norfolk Southern said the East Palestine derailment is now expected to cost nearly $2.2 billion total with about half of that related to legal costs and settlements like the $600 million class-action one. Insurance is expected to cover at least $751 million of that \u2014 leaving only a $1.4 billion impact on the railroad's finances. But only about half of that has been paid out so far.",
      "Norfolk Southern started off the fourth quarter by recovering from Hurricanes Helene and Milton in the Southeast. That hurt some of the railroad's service metrics during the quarter, but George said he's proud of the way the railroad responded to the storms and confident that Norfolk Southern is getting more efficient.",
      "Even with that disruption the railroad hauled 3% more freight in the fourth quarter. But its revenue slipped 2% to $3.02 billion as the lower fuel prices reduced its surcharge revenue. The mix of shipments the railroad hauled also shifted to a less-profitable mix with more deliveries of shipping containers filled with assorted goods, and coal revenue dropped 9% as that line of business continued its long-term decline. That was still slightly ahead of the $3.015 billion that Wall Street predicted.",
      "The railroad predicts its revenue will grow 3% in 2025 and its profit margin will improve as it records another $150 million of productivity savings on top of a nearly $300 million improvement last year.",
      "Norfolk Southern is one of the nation's largest railroads with tracks crossing 22 states in the Eastern United States."

      "U.K. Treasury chief Rachel Reeves says that the new Labour government is backing the construction of third runway at London\u2019s Heathrow Airport",
      "LONDON -- The U.K. government is backing the construction of a third runway at London\u2019s Heathrow Airport, Treasury chief Rachel Reeves said Wednesday.",
      "Another runway at the U.K.\u2019s main airport will bolster the country\u2019s long-term economic growth potential, Reeves said in a speech.",
      "\u201cWe cannot duck the decision any longer,\" she said. \u201cThe case is stronger than ever.\u201d",
      "Reeves said the government was inviting proposals over its construction by the summer and that it would then make a full assessment.",
      "\u201cThis will ensure that the project is value for money and our clear expectation is that any associated service transport costs will be financed through private funding,\u201d she said.",
      "For decades, campaigners, including from within her Labour Party, have opposed a third runway on environmental concerns. London Mayor Sadiq Khan, and John McDonnell, the lawmaker whose constituency contains Heathrow, have both voiced their opposition to the third runway.",
      "Reeves insisted the runway will be \u201cdelivered in line with our legal, environmental and climate objectives.\"",
      "Heathrow\u2019s plan to build a third runway received parliamentary approval in June 2018, but has been delayed by legal challenges and the coronavirus pandemic. Heathrow's chief executive, Thomas Woldbye, has said that he wouldn't continue developing the project without the government confirming that it wants expansion.",
      "Reeves' support for a third runway came in a wide-ranging speech on boosting U.K. growth rates, which have been historically low since the 2008 global financial crisis for a variety of reasons.",
      "The Labour government badly needs growth rates to increase over the coming years, so it can lift living standards following the cost-of-living crisis and to get money into ailing public services.",
      "Since taking office in July, Reeves and Prime Minister Keir Starmer have been criticized for talking down the economy and for increasing taxes on business, a combination that critics argue have led to a growth downturn in the past few months and the sharp downturn in the government's ratings in opinion polls.",
      "Though a third runway won't do much to bolster economic growth in the near-term as it would take up to a decade to build, Reeves hopes that the announcement itself will provide investors with a signal that the government is serious about turning the economy around.",
      "\u201cWe are not waiting for years into the future,\" she said. \u201cWe want to do things now, to turn around the performance, and we want to give businesses and investors confidence that this is a country to start doing things, to start making things in again.\u201d",
      "The construction of a third runway would require more than 700 houses to be demolished and sections of the M25 motorway, which encircles London, to be moved into a tunnel.",

Fighting reignited this week, and the rebels backed by Rwanda, known as M23, announced Monday that they had captured much of the provincial capital of Goma.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of Goma residents were trying to get away from the fighting, with some retreating into Congo\u2019s interior to seek protection, and others crossing into nearby Rwanda. Rwandan border patrol agents thoroughly searched the belongings of the men, women and children crossing the border in waves, with suitcases and children in tow. The displaced people, looking exhausted but relieved, were then taken care of by the Rwandan Red Cross.",

Many Hutus fled into Congo after the genocide.",
      "Analysts say the real fight is for control over the Congo\u2019s vast mineral deposits, estimated to be worth $24 trillion, and critical to much of the world\u2019s technology. M23 appears to be preparing to stay in Congo for good, telling the AP of their plans to set up an administration and return displaced people to their homes.",
      "Analysts have warned that securing a rebel withdrawal could be more difficult than in 2012, when M23 first captured Goma but withdrew after days. Murithi Mutiga, program director for Africa at the Crisis Group, said that the group has become more emboldened by Rwanda, which feels Congo is ignoring its interests in the region and failed to meet demands of previous peace agreements.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 02:10:27 -0500",
    "summary": "Climate change and recent troubles with counterfeit seeds have challenged Kenya's agriculture efforts to improve food security",
    "story": [
      "Climate change and recent troubles with counterfeit seeds have challenged Kenya's agriculture efforts to improve food security",
      "KIKUYU, Kenya -- Tucked away in a lush, forested area of central Kenya's Kikuyu town, the National Seed Bank stands as a crucial safeguard for the future of the country's agriculture. Inside two chilly rooms of a government building, more than 50,000 seed varieties are cataloged and stored.",
      "The bank was established in 1988 after the realization that some traditional varieties of seeds were being lost, an occurrence that is becoming more common with climate change. It aims to conserve seeds for research and reintroduction to farms.",
      "\u201cWe realize that some of the traditional varieties that we had abandoned then are actually more resilient to climate change, so when you introduce them especially in marginal areas, those varieties outperform the improved varieties,\u201d said the director of the Genetic Resources Research Institute that operates the bank, Desterio Nyamongo, referring to hybrid seeds that must be bought every planting season.",
      "He said the some of bank\u2019s seeds also were found to be more resistant to diseases and pests and were high-yielding.",
      "This gives hope to a country that relies heavily on rain-fed agriculture instead of irrigation, leaving it more vulnerable to climate shocks like drought. The sector contributes a third of Kenya's GDP.",
      "Kenya is not alone facing food security pressures. According to a U.N Food and Agriculture and Organization report in 2023, over a billion people across the African continent are unable to afford healthy diets, and the number of hungry people is increasing.",
      "But in Kenya, another complication has emerged. Farmers in recent months suffered losses in the millions of shillings (tens of thousands of dollars) after planting counterfeit seeds bought from private sellers.",
      "Kenyan officials have acknowledged that the seed sector is critical.",
      "During the country\u2019s first international seed quality conference in August, the agriculture ministry\u2019s permanent secretary, Paul Rono, said Africa has limited capacity to produce high-quality certified seeds that are subjected to quality standards.",
      "The head of the Eastern Africa Farmers Federation, Stephen Muchiri, said the vigor of crops in Kenya has become low, and he believes that the main reason is a flawed seed breeding and propagation program.",
      "But some farmers say efforts to improve the seed system in Kenya have been limited by a 2012 law banning seed sharing, which is what millions of farmers did every planting season to cut their production cost.",
      "The government has said the law is meant to prevent the circulation of uncertified seeds and protects farmers, but it faces a court challenge from more than a dozen farmers across Kenya who say it's expensive having to buy new seeds every planting season. The next hearing in the case is in March.",
      "Francis Ngiri is one of the farmers who filed the case. He runs an indigenous seed bank for the local community on his five-acre farm in the semi-arid Gilgil area located 120 kilometers (74 miles) from the capital, Nairobi.",
      "His work has become a learning ground for farmers who have experienced disappointing yields from hybrid seeds.",
      "\u201cWe have seen that indigenous seeds are more resilient and perform better in our area even when there is reduced rainfall,\u201d he told The Associated Press.",
      "He passionately shares his knowledge on conserving the seeds using traditional methods such as covering them with wood ash \u2014 believed to repel weevils \u2014 or keeping them in earthen pots. He emphasized the use of locally available materials at no cost.",
      "Farmer Maximilla Onyura, who farms sorghum in the western county of Busia, said indigenous crops offer a food security solution. She isn't part of the legal challenge but collaborates with Ngiri through a Kenyan organization called the Seed Savers Network.",
      "However, \u201cinstead of our government encouraging those offering solutions through indigenous crops, they are now cracking down on those sharing seeds at community level,\u201d she said.",
      "Seed sharing in Kenya can bring two years in prison, a fine of up to 1 million Kenyan shillings ($7,700), or both. No farmer has been charged.",
      "The National Seed Bank occasionally distributes some of its collection to farmers at no cost in the hope that the varieties that had long adopted to local conditions will be more resilient.",
      "The director, Nyamongo, said farmers who cannot afford farm inputs like fertilizers required for hybrid seeds are better off planting the traditional varieties.",
      "\u201cIt would be wrong for farmers, especially farmers in marginal areas, to start thinking that using the indigenous seed is backwardness,\u201d he said. \u201cFar from it, because some of the indigenous varieties have adopted over time to the local conditions and therefore, they are more resilient.\u201d",
      "Nyamongo did not comment on the farmers' court challenge to the seed-sharing ban.",
      "The president of the Dutch-based climate change adaptation nonprofit Global Center on Adaptation, Patrick V. Verkooijen, said governments can invest in community-based seed programs to preserve a diversity of indigenous varieties.",
      "\u201cIndigenous crop varieties offer many benefits, particularly their genetic diversity, which helps farmers adapt to climate change, combat pests and diseases and manage poor soil fertility. However, they also come with challenges, such as potentially lower yields or susceptibility to new pests and diseases,\u201d he said.",
      "Kenyan proponents of indigenous seeds like Ngiri said lower yields and susceptibility to new pests and diseases only happen when a seed variety is taken from its native location.",
      "\u201cThe reason why they are indigenous is because they have adapted to the climatic conditions and the diseases found in the area they originally came from,\u201d Ngiri said.",

      "Olympic figure skating great and authoritative commentator Dick Button has died at age 95",
      "NEW YORK -- Dick Button was more than the most accomplished men\u2019s figure skater in history. He was one of his sport\u2019s greatest innovators and promoters.",
      "Button, winner of two Olympic gold medals and five consecutive world championships, died Thursday, said his son, Edward, who did not provide a cause. He was 95.",
      "As an entrepreneur and broadcaster, Button promoted skating and its athletes, transforming a niche sport into the showpiece of every Winter Olympics.",
      "\u201cDick was one of the most important figures in our sport,\u201d Scott Hamilton said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a skater after Dick who wasn\u2019t helped by him in some way.\u201d",
      "Button\u2019s impact began after World War II. He was the first U.S. men\u2019s champion \u2014 and his country\u2019s youngest at age 16 \u2014 when that competition returned in 1946. Two years later, he took the title at the St. Moritz Olympics, competing outdoors. He performed the first double axel in any competition and became the first American to win the men\u2019s event.",
      "\u201cBy the way, that jump had a cheat on it,\u201d Button told the U.S. Olympic Committee website. \u201cBut listen, I did it and that was what counted.\u201d",
      "That began his dominance of international skating, and U.S. amateur sports. He was the first figure skater to win the prestigious Sullivan Award in 1949 \u2014 no other figure skater won it until Michelle Kwan in 2001.",
      "In 1952, while a Harvard student, he won a second gold at the Oslo Games, making more history with the first triple jump (a loop) in competition. Soon after, he won a fifth world title, then gave up his eligibility as an amateur. All Olympic sports were subject to an amateur/professional division at the time.",
      "\u201cI had achieved everything I could have dreamed of doing as a skater,\u201d said Button, who earned a law degree from Harvard in 1956. \u201cI was able to enjoy the Ice Capades (show) and keep my hand in skating, and that was very important to me.\u201d",
      "With the Emmy Award-winning Button as the TV analyst, viewers got to learn not only the basics but the nuances of a sport foreign to many as he frankly broke down the performances. He became as much a fixture on ABC\u2019s \u201cWide World of Sports\u201d as Jim McKay and the hapless ski jumper tumbling down the slope.",
      "\u201cDick Button is the custodian of the history of figure skating and its quintessential voice,\u201d 1988 Olympic champion Brian Boitano said in Button\u2019s autobiography. \u201cHe made the words \u2018lutz\u2019 and \u2018salchow\u2019 part of our everyday vocabulary.\u201d",
      "After a 1961 plane crash killed the entire U.S. figure skating team on the way to the world championships, which then were canceled, Button persuaded ABC Sports executive Roone Arledge to televise the 1962 event on \u201cWide World.\u201d That\u2019s when he joined the network as a commentator.",
      "Button\u2019s death coincided with another tragedy in the skating world, Wednesday night\u2019s crash of an American Airlines flight that collided with an Army helicopter and plummeted into the Potomac River outside Washington, D.C., killing everyone on board. Two teenage figure skaters, their mothers, and two former world champions who were coaching at the Skating Club of Boston were among the 14 people killed from the skating community.",
      "Button skated for the Boston club and remained close to it for the rest of his life. The trophy room at the club is named in his honor.",
      "He also provided opportunities for skaters to make money after their competitive careers. He ran professional events he created for TV for years, attracting many top names in the sport \u2014 Hamilton, Torvill and Dean, Kristi Yamaguchi, Kurt Browning and Katarina Witt.",
      "Button\u2019s Candid Productions, formed 1959, also produced such made-for-TV programs as \u201cBattle of the Network Stars.\u201d He also dabbled in acting, but the rink was his realm.",
      "\u201cDick Button created an open and honest space in figure skating broadcasting where no topic or moment was off-limits,\u201d said Johnny Weir, the three-time U.S. champion and current NBC Sports figure skating analyst. \u201cHe told it like it was, even when his opinion wasn\u2019t a popular one. His zingers were always in my mind when I would perform for him, and I wanted to make him as happy and proud as I would my coaches.",
      "\u201cI think that is something very special about commentating figure skating. As an athlete, we rarely have an opportunity to speak, and we rely on the TV voices to tell our story for us. Nobody could do it like Mr. Button.\u201d",

      "Some fans are simply tired of watching Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and the Chiefs hoist another Lombardi Trophy. Kansas City is seeking its fourth Super Bowl victory in its fifth appearance in six years while aiming to become the first team to three-peat in the Super Bowl era.",
      "There\u2019s a perception that officials give the Chiefs the benefit of many calls so that angers fans and some vocal media members. A pair of roughing the passer penalties on Mahomes in Kansas City\u2019s divisional round game against the Texans only fueled that notion. Then a questionable spot on Josh Allen\u2019s failed fourth down sneak in the win over Buffalo in the AFC title game sparked even more criticism.",
      "SiriusXM radio show host Adam Schein called the officiating in the Bills-Chiefs game a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d ESPN analyst and former NFL quarterback Dan Orlovsky said the ball placement on Allen\u2019s play was an \u201cawful call and again a worse review.\u201d",
      "Patriots fans don\u2019t want Mahomes and coach Andy Reid to get closer to the record six championships Tom Brady and Bill Belichick won together in New England.",
      "Brady fans resent that Mahomes, a three-time Super Bowl MVP, is compared to No. 12 when he\u2019s still four rings away from tying him.",
      "\u201cStop with the GOAT comparison already. Brady won seven. Mahomes needs one more to get past halfway,\u201d said a Tampa doctor who grew up in Boston.",
      "Other fans, especially those who haven\u2019t enjoyed a victory parade in a long time or ever, are simply jealous of Kansas City\u2019s success. Many of those fans probably felt the same animosity toward the Patriots when they were winning.",
      "All those commercials featuring Reid and Mahomes can annoy some fickle folks, making them turn against the Chiefs. Of course, it\u2019s difficult to watch any NFL game without seeing former Eagles center Jason Kelce pop up in one advertisement after another.",
      "There\u2019s also the Travis Kelce factor. The four-time All-Pro tight end happens to be dating the world\u2019s biggest pop star. Kelce\u2019s relationship with Taylor Swift has often dominated headlines and taken the spotlight off football.",
      "That bothers some of the die-hards who complain about seeing television cameras pan over to Swift\u2019s reaction in a suite. While Kelce has endeared himself to Swifties, every famous couple has its share of haters.",
      "That\u2019s all added up to make the Eagles the fan favorite heading into the Super Bowl rematch in New Orleans on Feb. 9. Mahomes rallied the Chiefs to a 38-35 victory over Jalen Hurts and the Eagles two years ago in Arizona.",

      "After Smith was trapped leg before by Vandersay, Khawaja remained unruffled, rotating the strike superbly and punishing loose deliveries with precision. He went on to his maiden double century and Josh Inglis became the 21st Australian to score a century on debut.",
      "Khawaja\u2019s eight-hour-plus knock of 232 off 352 balls was historic \u2014 the first Australian to score a double hundred in Sri Lanka. His is Australia's highest individual test score against Sri Lanka. At 38, he's second only to Don Bradman to score a double century for Australia. Khawaja edged behind to slow left-armer Prabath Jayasuriya.",
      "\u201cUsman Khawaja was patient and waited for the loose balls and swept so well,\" Vandersay said. \"Josh Inglis showed lot of intent as well and it's tough to contain when they are stepping out of the crease and putting us under pressure.\u201d",
      "Inglis wasted no time asserting himself, taking on the bowlers and racing to his century off just 90 deliveries, the second fastest for a men's debut. India's Shikhar Dhawan took 85 balls in 2013 against Australia. Inglis' attacking approach, combined with Khawaja\u2019s measured brilliance, combined for 146 runs for the fourth wicket, cementing Australia's dominance.",
      "Inglis made 102 off 94 balls, also edging Jayasuriya behind.",
      "\u201cI tried to be proactive and put bowlers under pressure,\u201d Inglis said. \u201cIf you are stuck for three to four balls, the next ball will probably have your name in it.\u201d",
      "The England-born Inglis has played for Australia in one-day internationals and Twenty20s since 2022, and said he owed his parents a lot for moving from Yorkshire to Perth in 2010.",
      "\u201cWhenever we play England, everyone in the dressing room is asking what anthem I am going to sing. It's a good one,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can't choose where you were born. It's part of my story.\u201d",
      "While Australia made merry on a placid surface, signs of turn emerged late on day two, offering a glimmer of hope for the spinners. The pitch is expected to deteriorate further, making survival increasingly difficult \u2013 especially with Australia boasting three specialist spinners.",

      "Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs keep finding themselves on one side of a Super Bowl rematch",
      "Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs keep finding themselves on one side of a Super Bowl rematch.",
      "A year after beating the San Francisco 49ers for the second time in five seasons in the NFL's championship game, Mahomes and the Chiefs will square off against the Philadelphia Eagles for the second Super Bowl in the past three seasons.",
      "Kansas City won the first meeting 38-35 in Glendale, Arizona, and will try to pull off another Super Bowl sweep on Feb. 9 in New Orleans.",
      "\u201cThis is a great football team (that) we\u2019re playing,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cThey\u2019re great on offense, they\u2019re great on defense and special teams. We played them in a close Super Bowl a couple years ago, but they\u2019ve added players and got even better, so it\u2019ll take our best football to win.\u201d",
      "More than 40 players who participated in that nail-biter two years ago are projected to be on the field next week including stars like Mahomes, Travis Kelce and Chris Jones for Kansas City and Jalen Hurts, Lane Johnson and A.J. Brown for Philadelphia.",
      "Many played big roles in the last Super Bowl meeting. Hurts rushed for three TDs and threw a 45-yard scoring strike to Brown, while Mahomes threw three TD passes, including one to Kelce, Nick Bolton returned a fumble for a touchdown and Harrison Butker kicked the game-winning field goal with 8 seconds left.",
      "There have only been nine Super Bowl rematches in the previous 58 games, with just four happening in a five-year span before this rematch. The winners of those three rematches were the teams that won the first meeting.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the other times there was a Super Bowl rematch within five seasons of the first meeting:",
      "Mahomes rallied Kansas City from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter for a 31-20 win in Super Bowl 54, with his biggest play being a 44-yard pass on third-and-15 to Tyreek Hill that sparked the comeback.",
      "The 49ers kept it even closer last season in a back-and-forth game that featured three go-ahead scoring drives led by Brock Purdy in the fourth quarter or overtime. But it wasn't enough to topple Mahomes.",
      "Mahomes engineered two late game-tying field goal drives in regulation. He then took advantage of San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan's decision to start overtime with the ball by responding to a field goal by the Niners with a walk-off 3-yard TD pass to Mecole Hardman for Kansas City's third title in this current run.",
      "Eli Manning and the Giants spoiled New England\u2019s bid for a perfect season in 2007 and then pulled off the upset again four years later.",
      "The Patriots came into Super Bowl 42 with an 18-0 record and were on the brink of matching the perfect season of the 1972 Dolphins when Tom Brady threw a 6-yard TD pass to Randy Moss to make it 14-10 with 2:42 to go.",
      "But Manning drove New York down the field \u2014 with help from David Tyree\u2019s helmet catch \u2014 and threw a game-winning TD to Plaxico Burress to stun New England.",
      "Manning did it again in the 2011 season, driving to a game-winning touchdown with 57 seconds left for a 21-17 win.",
      "Dallas and Buffalo had the only Super Bowl rematch in consecutive seasons, meeting at the end of the 1992 and 1993 campaigns.",
      "The Cowboys got the best of both.",
      "They used nine takeaways and four TD passes from Troy Aikman to hand the Bills a 52-17 loss in Super Bowl 27.",
      "The rematch was closer but had the same result. James Washington returned a fumble for a TD early in the third quarter to tie the game and Emmitt Smith ran for two TDs in the second half for a 30-13 win.",
      "The Cowboys were on the wrong end of a Super Bowl rematch in the 1970s, losing to the Steelers following the 1975 and 1978 seasons.",
      "Dallas became the first wild-card team to reach the title game in Super Bowl 10 thanks to a desperation pass to beat Minnesota and a blowout against the Rams.",
      "But they fell short against the Steel Curtain in the second second-half in Super Bowl history. Pittsburgh got a safety, two field goals and a 64-yard touchdown catch by Super Bowl MVP Lynn Swann in the fourth quarter of a 21-17 win to complete back-to-back titles for the Steelers.",
      "Pittsburgh won again three years later in the first Super Bowl rematch to deny Dallas back-to-back championships.",
      "MVP Terry Bradshaw threw four TD passes and Jackie Smith dropped a potential touchdown for Dallas. Roger Staubach\u2019s late rally fell short and the Steelers won their third Super Bowl title 35-31.",

      "NEW YORK -- Two years after he won an NBA title, Nikola Jokic views the surging New York Knicks as a \u201ctop-five candidate\u201d to end their 52-year championship drought.",
      "The Knicks beat Jokic's Denver Nuggets 122-112 on Wednesday for their fifth straight victory. At 32-16, they are a game behind reigning champion Boston for second place in the Eastern Conference.",
      "After ringing up 143 points in each of their two previous games, their total Wednesday gave the Knicks 408 over their last three games, a franchise record.",
      "They scored their season high of 145 points in a victory in Denver in November.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re playing really well. They\u2019re well-coached, they\u2019re pushing the pace and in the halfcourt they know what they\u2019re doing. So they\u2019re a really good team,\u201d said Jokic, the three-time NBA MVP. \u201cI think they are the favorites \u2013 not the favorites, but I think top-five candidates for the title.\u201d",
      "The Knicks haven't won the title since 1973 and haven't reached the conference finals since 2000. But they loaded up for a run this summer by acquiring Karl-Anthony Towns, who with Jalen Brunson gave the Knicks two players voted as All-Star starters for the first time since 1975.",
      "Brunson had 30 points and 15 assists Wednesday, becoming just the fourth Knicks player to do that in a game.",
      "But the Knicks, who are currently the fourth choice to win the title at BetMGM behind Boston, Oklahoma City, and Cleveland, don't want to think about having a summer celebration like Jokic and the Nuggets enjoyed in 2023 when they won their franchise's first NBA title.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about the future, I want to talk about the present,\u201d Towns said. \u201cI want to talk about what we can do right now to be the best team we can be, because I have a lot of experience and if you can take care of the present, the future will take care of itself.\u201d",

    "summary": "More changes could be on the way for the PGA Tour",
    "story": [
      "More changes could be on the way for the PGA Tour",
      "PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. -- The PGA Tour is taking a hard look at whether to allow rangefinders and publicize violations as part of a comprehensive study on pace of play and other enhancements to the game that have come out of a survey of 50,000 golf fans.",
      "Tour officials were purposely short on specifics Wednesday during a meeting with reporters on the \u201cFan Forward\u201d initiative that Commissioner Jay Monahan announced a year ago. He is expected to go into greater detail at The Players Championship in March.",
      "But the preview session at Pebble Beach supported Monahan's message late last year that \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d as the PGA Tour embarks on a series of changes.",
      "\u201cI think as we roll the clock forward three, five, 10 years, we\u2019re going to look back at 2025 as an inflection point in the evolution of the tour,\u201d said Andy Weitz, the tour's chief marketing and communications officer.",
      "He said part of that was capital growth from the investment of Strategic Sports Group, which put $1.5 billion into PGA Tour Enterprise with the potential to double the amount.",
      "Fenway Sports Group, a big part of SSG, has Theo Epstein as a senior advisor. Epstein, former general manager of the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs, worked with Major League Baseball on recent changes that include a pitch clock and larger bases to encourage more stealing.",
      "The shot clock has been mentioned to help improve pace of play on tour, and the topic has gained momentum in recent weeks when the final round of threesomes has taken about 5 1/2 hours to finish.",
      "Weitz said the tour formed a study group a month ago with three players \u2014 Sam Burns, Jhonattan Vegas and Adam Schenk \u2014 who likely would pass their findings to the Players Advisory Council, a 16-member panel that has been more involved than ever.",
      "Rangefinders \u2014 or distance measuring devices \u2014 currently are allowed only at the PGA Championship. The tour is trying to find a spot in the schedule for a test run to see if it helps speed play by getting players the yardages quicker.",
      "Gary Young, the senior vice president of rules and competition, said the sample tests could be at signatures events that have smaller fields, or perhaps a tournament like the Zurich Classic that features team competition.",
      "The potential of disclosing violations would be a break from PGA Tour tradition. The tour is different from most other sports leagues in that it has never disclosed fines, disciplinary action or violations that relate to pace of play. The tour long felt that would be little more than a distraction. What it heard from fans was a need for more transparency.",
      "\u201cI think there's a real moment now for that all to be looked at,\u201d PGA Tour President Tyler Dennis said.",
      "Weitz said the discussion has met with little resistance from players. He had breakfast Wednesday morning with Max Homa and said Homa told him, \u201cWe want to hold each other accountable, and we want to play in a way that is the best version of the fan experience.\u201d",
      "Another example to help speed play was the use of a video review center at the new PGA Tour Studios in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida.",
      "All of the changes came from the \u201cFan Forward\u201d program, which included a survey that grew out of a fan council started in 2017. An outside agency helped the tour reach 50,000 fans who were surveyed in three waves.",
      "The topics:",
      "\u2014 Broadcast enhancement, much of it geared around showing more shots, more meaningful consequences (such as the 36-hole cut) and fewer tap-ins.",
      "\u2014 Competition adjustments, which includes the tour studying another change to the format in the Tour Championship. Depending on player feedback, a proposal could go before the policy board as early as March.",
      "\u201cIf we can get alignment between one concept, then we\u2019ll do it as early as \u201925. If it is, \u2018Yes, we love this idea but,\u2019 and there needs more conversation, it\u2019ll have to be \u201926 because there will be more to work through,\u201d said Billy Schroeder, senior vice president of competitions.",
      "\u2014 Player content and profile. Weitz said for the ages 18-34 demographic, fans were most interested in personality on the course, and then off the course, and lastly competitive performance.",
      "\u2014 Fan experience on the golf course, and what golf can learn from other sports in which the entire playing field can't be seen from one spot. Formula One was an example of that.",
      "The tour already has gone through player-driven changes in recent years, such as the $20 million signature events with smaller fields and no cuts, reducing field sizes in 2026 and lowering to 100 players from 125 players in FedEx Cup who keep full cards.",
      "More changes could be on the way, some of them already being studied.",
      "\u201cIf the voice of the fans is at the center of what we do, we're on the right path,\u201d Weitz said.",

      "For her, the slalom competition Thursday in Courchevel, France, is simply the next step in getting her health back to 100%.",
      "The two-time Olympic champion is still rounding into top form after a spill in a giant slalom race on Nov. 30 in Killington, Vermont, where something punctured her in the side and caused severe trauma to her oblique muscles.",
      "Shiffrin said she wasn't even sure if she would make it back at all this season.",
      "\u201cTo be here at this point is just so incredible,\u201d Shiffrin said in a video she recorded ahead of Thursday's competition. \"It\u2019s just really hard to zoom out and look at that whole big picture and all the hype (around chasing her 100th win) that has been talked about since the start of the season.",
      "\u201cThis is a step. This is a really big step in my recovery. But it\u2019s only one step, actually. We\u2019re taking it as it comes. My biggest goal is to enjoy being back in the start gate again.\u201d",
      "The French region has long held a special place for Shiffrin. She's won seven World Cup events at Courchevel/Meribel, spanning four different disciplines. She's captured three world championship medals in this area, too. It's also where she earned her first win after losing her father. Jeff Shiffrin died at age 65 in February 2020, in an accident at the family home in Colorado.",
      "\u201cIt was very much the first race that helped me believe on any level that I might be able to return to the form that I had before my dad\u2019s accident,\u201d explained Shiffrin, who can become the first Alpine ski racer to amass 100 World Cup wins. \"It helped me realize that even though my life might never be the same, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not worth it.

      "With the help of physical therapist Regan Dewhirst, she's steadily regained her strength. On Jan. 1, Shiffrin was back on skis. Two weeks later, she was executing some easy turns through slalom gates. This race, a return to competition, is just the next step along the way.",

    "story": [
      "The Philadelphia Eagles can trace their run to the Super Bowl to an epic collapse last season",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- The Eagles were indeed flying high as the best in the NFL, boasting a 10-1 record with a No. 1 seed, home-field advantage in the playoffs, and yes, a Super Bowl ring all ahead as credible goals.",
      "This season? On the way to the Super Bowl on Feb. 9 in a rematch from two years ago against Kansas City?",
      "No, try 2023, when coach Nick Sirianni and quarterback Jalen Hurts' run at a Super Bowl instead turned into one of the more epic meltdowns in Philly sports history \u2014 and there have been scores of them.",
      "The Eagles were 10-1 until they were clobbered by San Francisco at home by 23 points in an NFC championship game rematch. Dallas beat the Eagles by 20 points the next week and the losses \u2014 and finger pointing \u2014 snowballed from there. The Eagles limped to a 1-5 regular-season finish before they were put of their misery in a wild-card loss to Tampa Bay.",
      "Sirianni was on the hot seat despite three playoff appearances and a Super Bowl trip in three seasons. Changes were mandated \u2014 from the assistants to the game plan to drafting to repairing the loose connective tissue inside the locker room.",
      "The harsh lessons learned from last season fueled the Eagles on their way to a 14-win regular season and three more wins in the playoffs.",
      "Team owner Jeffrey Lurie and general manager Howie Roseman declined to move on from Sirianni and the Eagles made the moves needed to bring them back to the top of the NFL \u2014 and they are one win away from reaching the pinnacle.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been the story of the 2023 to the 2024 Eagles. As bad of a feeling we had about how last year ended, I think it makes you who you are,\u201d Sirianni said.",
      "Now, it's off to try to win just the franchise's second Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s pretty dope,\u201d Sirianni said. \u201cThat\u2019s all my focus is on.\u201d",
      "Perhaps a sign their rapport this season has turned more cohesive than taxing, Sirianni insisted Hurts was joking when the QB quipped after the NFC title game that he had been freed from the offense's \u201cstraitjacket.\"",
      "Hurts had six wins this season when he threw for less than 200 yards passing before he threw for 246 yards and accounted for four touchdowns in the NFC championship game win over Washington.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been winning a couple different ways this year. I think he was just having fun after the game,\u201d Sirianni said. \u201cI know this, and he\u2019s said this plenty of times: He doesn\u2019t care how we win. I don\u2019t care how we win, as long as we win. We do everything we can do to be able to win.\u201d",
      "The No. 1 storyline in training camp this season was just how thorny was Hurts and Sirianni's relationship last season and would any issues carry over into this one?",
      "Hurts offered a lukewarm endorsement of Sirianni in the aftermath of the playoff loss at Tampa Bay. He said days later his tepid response was only because he was caught off guard by questions about Sirianni\u2019s job status.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot together, right? A lot of wins, some down times,\u201d Sirianni said this week. \u201cThat\u2019s what kind of forges relationships.\u201d",
      "While some of the best Super Bowl winners in history have come with strained relationships between a QB and coach, Hurts has backed Sirianni publicly this season \u2014 even if it wasn't always a rousing endorsement. They are, through it all, only the first coach/QB pair in franchise history to make two Super Bowls.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s done a great job,\u201d Hurts said.",
      "One of the most distressing signs the Eagles were in free fall mode last season with no way out came when Sirianni made former Lions coach Matt Patricia the defensive play-caller and essentially stripped defensive coordinator Sean Desai of any true responsibility. Desai and Patricia were jettisoned in the offseason, as was offensive coordinator Brian Johnson. Johnson lasted only one season in Philadelphia and Hurts regressed, throwing a career-high 15 interceptions and with his passer rating dropping to 89.1 from 101.5.",
      "The new guys couldn't be better.",
      "Offensive coordinator Kellen Moore assumed play-calling responsibilities and has been one of the hottest head coaching candidates in the NFL. The Eagles jumped on hiring 66-year-old Vic Fangio to run the defense and he's made it the top-rated one in the league.",
      "The defense has allowed 10, 22 and 23 points and has 10 takeaways \u2014 including 21 points off three fumble recoveries against the Commanders \u2014 in the postseason.",
      "\u201cThe players have to play well to play great defense, so it\u2019s a combination of what Vic does and how he motivates the guys to get them to play to the highest level that they can,\u201d Sirianni said. \u201cJust got a ton of respect for him and sure glad he\u2019s here.\u201d",
      "A former backup QB who played behind Dak Prescott with Dallas in 2017 before becoming his position coach the next year, Moore directed a Philadelphia offense that featured Barkley as the ninth running back in NFL history to rush for 2,000 yards in the regular season.",
      "\u201cThere are different things that we\u2019ve been doing that have really helped us. There are some things that are similar to what we\u2019ve done in the past because we\u2019ve been good at those things,\u201d Sirianni said. \u201cAnd then there are things that are new to both what we\u2019ve done and Kellen\u2019s system as well. Kellen\u2019s done a phenomenal job of handling all those things, putting our offense in positions that we been successful in.\u201d",
      "Former Eagles running back Miles Sanders ran for a solid 1,269 yards in the 2022 Super Bowl season and Kenneth Gainwell was \u2014 and still is \u2014 a serviceable backup.",
      "Hurts was the team's leading rusher with 70 yards in the Super Bowl and the Eagles had just 115 yards rushing overall.",
      "The Eagles seem like a whole new franchise at times with Saquon Barkley.",
      "Barkley is near the top of the short list of all-time great Philadelphia sports free-agent signings. He ran for 2,005 yards, rips off 60-yard scoring runs with the ease of a Joel Embiid layup and has turned the offense into its most elite dual threat since the halcyon days of Donovan McNabb and Terrell Owens.",
      "The Eagles aren't going to have a chance at beating the Chiefs if Barkley isn't at his best \u2014 no small feat in a season that's earned him comparisons to Terrell Davis and Eric Dickerson as among the best for a running back in NFL history.",

      "It\u2019s a question Roger Goodell gets when he\u2019s in London: Would the NFL stage a Super Bowl internationally",
      "LONDON -- It\u2019s a question Roger Goodell gets when he\u2019s in London: Would the NFL stage a Super Bowl internationally?",
      "The usual answer is that America\u2019s biggest sporting event is reserved for cities that have NFL franchises. But as the commissioner noted in October, \u201c things change. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all if that happens one day.\u201d",
      "As the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles get set to square off in the Super Bowl in New Orleans on Feb. 9, here\u2019s a look at some key factors and possible venues if the league were to take its marquee event abroad in a bid to take the game to a truly global audience.",
      "It wouldn't be anytime soon. Super Bowl locations are set through 2028. And for international priorities, league officials are focused on increasing the number of regular-season games played abroad. Eight is the maximum number of league-operated games per season but they want to double that soon. This season, Brazil joined the list of countries to host a regular-season game. Spain is next. Ireland and Australia have been identified, and the league is considering the United Arab Emirates, too.",
      "Viewers \u2014 and advertisers \u2014 are accustomed to the 6:30 p.m. ET kickoff but with London five hours ahead and cities in Spain and Germany six hours ahead that would require flexibility on both sides. A game in Mexico City or Brazil would be easier from that perspective.",
      "Europe in February can be dreary weather-wise, but Real Madrid\u2019s newly renovated Santiago Bernabeu Stadium has a retractable roof. Even considering outdoor stadiums, Europe is the fastest-warming continent. The UK had its warmest February on record last year and was wetter than average, and Germany\u2019s weather service said the 2023-24 winter was the country\u2019s third-warmest and also one of the wettest.",
      "Goodell\u2019s comments in London also preceded the U.S. presidential election. President Donald Trump, who tried to buy the Buffalo Bills in 2014, has weighed in on NFL topics in the past.",
      "While U.S. cities are willing to bend to the NFL\u2019s considerable demands for Super Bowl week, their foreign counterparts may be less accommodating. In Europe, local governments are less likely to have the financial autonomy to underwrite a huge event, said Stefan Szymanski, a University of Michigan professor of sport management.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s also not clear why the NFL would wish to forego the much greater level of interest here in the US,\" Szymanski added. \"I think it would have to be far more popular in Europe for this to make any sense. But maybe one day.\u201d",
      "A look at some potential hosts:",
      "Pros: Time zone, proximity to U.S., weather. Azteca has hosted five regular-season NFL games, including the first one held outside the United States. Cool history \u2014 both Pele and Maradona won a World Cup at Azteca, site of the \u201c Hand of God \u201d goal by Maradona.",
      "Cons: Altitude. It is 7,200 feet above sea level (2,000 higher than any NFL stadium) Do you want to see players gasping for air by halftime? Not to mention thousands of American fans aren\u2019t traveling for a cardio workout. An NFL game in 2018 was pulled from Azteca on short notice because of field conditions.",
      "Pros: Basically, brand new and custom built with the NFL in mind, it boasts state-of-the-art infrastructure, dedicated NFL locker rooms and field. It has hosted games since 2019 and has a long-term contract with the league. Spurs chairman Daniel Levy got the stadium built and would be a key partner for such a big event.",
      "Cons: Time zone, weather, capacity (under 63,000).",
      "Pros: Wembley is the NFL's \u201cOG\u201d in Europe. It hosted the first regular-season game played outside North America \u2014 a mudfest between the New York Giants and Miami Dolphins in 2007, and it annually hosts a Jacksonville Jaguars game. At 86,000-plus capacity, it\u2019s significantly bigger than Tottenham. Jaguars owner Shad Khan tried to buy the stadium from the English Football Association in 2018.",
      "Cons: Time zone, weather.",
      "Pros: Home of Real Madrid soccer club, Bernabeu has a retractable roof, so no weather worries. Like Tottenham, there\u2019s a retractable soccer field that makes way for an American football field underneath. In 2025, the stadium will host the NFL\u2019s first-ever regular-season game in Spain. Real Madrid said the deal is for several years. Stadium capacity is more than 78,000.",
      "Cons: Time zone.",
      "Pros: A rebuilt Camp Nou with a capacity of 104,000 would offer the NFL the chance to stage the biggest Super Bowl ever. The record attendance is 103,985 at the Rose Bowl in 1980. Like Madrid, Barcelona also brings global brand power. Mediterranean climate. The league has already spoken to Barcelona about a regular-season game.",
      "Cons: Not in the NFL rotation yet. Time zone.",
      "Pros: The NFL has been eyeing a return to Berlin for years. \u201c Olympiastadion \u201d will host its first regular-season game in 2025 as part of a multiyear deal that involves the cooperation of the Berlin Senate. Playing in the capital likely gives Olympic Stadium an advantage over other German cities. Capacity is just over 74,000.",
      "Cons: Time zone, weather.",
      "Pros: A Super Bowl week amid iconic monuments and museums in the French capital might entice even some skeptics. Capacity is 80,000.",
      "Cons: The league and the stadium operators have discussed a regular-season game, but it hasn\u2019t happened yet because of uncertainty over the lease. Time zone, weather.",
      "Pros: One of the largest stadiums in Europe with capacity over 86,000. Dublin's proven ability to handle hordes of Americans who arrive each August for college football, though those games are at the smaller Aviva Stadium.",
      "Cons: Not in the NFL rotation yet, time zone, weather.",
      "Pros: Kickoff time. Enticing for traveling fans just weeks before Carnival. Capacity is 78,000.",
      "Cons: Not in the NFL rotation \u2014 Goodell has named Rio as a likely host but hasn't specified a venue. Sao Paolo's Corinthians Arena is too small. Might be too hot? February is Rio's hottest month with the average daily maximum temperature of 86 degrees and high humidity. The highest temperature at kickoff of a Super Bowl was in 1973 when it was 84 degrees.",

      "Jalen Hurts bucked decades of history just by getting back to the Super Bowl after losing his first trip there as a starting quarterback",
      "Jalen Hurts bucked decades of history just by getting back to the Super Bowl after losing his first trip there as a starting quarterback.",
      "Now Hurts will try to become the fourth quarterback to win the NFL's ultimate prize as a starting quarterback after losing his first Super Bowl start.",
      "Hurts came close two years ago when Philadelphia lost 38-35 to Kansas City in Glendale, Arizona. With a win next week in New Orleans, Hurts will be the first quarterback since John Elway 27 years ago to win a Super Bowl as a starter after losing in his first trip.",
      "Out of the 36 starting quarterbacks who lost their Super Bowl debuts, the only ones to end up on the victory stage as a starter are Kansas City's Len Dawson, who lost Super Bowl 1 and then won it three years later, and Miami's Bob Griese, who followed a loss in Super Bowl 6 with a win the following year.",
      "Just getting back to this stage is unusual for Hurts, who ended a string of 19 straight QBs who failed to return to the Super Bowl after losing their first trip as a starter. The last to get back was Buffalo's Jim Kelly, who lost four straight trips in the 1990-93 seasons.",
      "Hurts will one again face Patrick Mahomes, who will tie Elway for the second most Super Bowl starts at quarterback with his fifth next week, trailing only Tom Brady's 10. With a win, Mahomes will join Brady (six), Terry Bradshaw (four) and Joe Montana (four) as the only QBs with four rings.",
      "Mahomes will make his fifth Super Bowl start as a small group of QBs has had a stranglehold on the AFC's Super Bowl berths. In the last 22 seasons, only six AFC QBs have started a Super Bowl with Brady leading the way with eight, Peyton Manning having four and Ben Roethlisberger three. Joe Flacco and Joe Burrow each have one since the start of the 2003 season.",
      "It has been an entirely different case in the NFC with 19 quarterbacks combining for the 22 starts, including one for Brady with Tampa Bay. Hurts joins Russell Wilson and Eli Manning as the only quarterbacks to start two Super Bowls for an NFC team since the start of the 2003 season.",
      "The Philadelphia Eagles ran their way to the Super Bowl.",
      "The Eagles tied an NFL playoff record with seven touchdown runs in the NFC title game win over Washington, matching the mark Chicago set against Washington in the 1940 NFL title game.",
      "Hurts scored on three of the TD runs with Saquon Barkley adding three more \u2014 including his record seventh touchdown run of at least 60 yards this season. The only other teammates to each run for three touchdowns in a regular season or playoff game since at least 1940 came when Priest Holmes (four) and Derrick Blaylock (three) did it for Kansas City in a 56-10 win over Atlanta on Oct. 24, 2004.",
      "The Eagles also set a record for most yards rushing in a season with 3,731 in the regular season and playoffs. The mark before this season was 3,535 by Miami in its perfect 17-0 season in 1972. Baltimore also eclipsed that mark with 3,664 yards rushing.",
      "The Eagles have a chance to break their own record for most touchdown runs in a season. They have 39 heading into the Super Bowl \u2014 three shy of the mark they set in the 2022 season.",
      "Josh Allen once again came out on the short end of a playoff matchup against Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs.",
      "Allen is the first quarterback ever to lose four postseason starts against another QB, although little of the blame should be pointed in his direction.",
      "Allen has a 100.2 passer rating with 11 combined touchdown runs and passes and just one turnover in four playoff starts against the Chiefs and has lost all of them.",
      "Allen's 101.5 career passer rating in the playoffs ranks fourth best among the 74 quarterbacks with at least six playoff starts in the Super Bowl era, trailing only Super Bowl winners Mahomes (105.6), Kurt Warner (102.8) and Matthew Stafford (102.3). Allen's seven career playoff wins as a starter are the most for any QB who hasn't made the Super Bowl.",
      "The Bills became the first team to win at least 11 games in five straight seasons without reaching a Super Bowl, topping the previoius mark of four held by San Francisco (1995-98) and Philadelphia (2000-03).",
      "The coaching carousel is nearly filled with the New Orleans Saints the only team out of the seven who fired their head coach hasn't found a replacement.",
      "The new batch features four coordinators who got promoted into their first head coaching jobs and two retreads in former Tennessee coach Mike Vrabel getting the nod in New England and Pete Carroll getting hired in Las Vegas after previous stints with the Jets, Patriots and Seahawks.",
      "Carroll joins Bill Parcells and Marty Schottenheimer as the only coaches since 1940 who have had non-interim stints with four franchises.",
      "The addition of Carroll sets up a power-packed roster of coaches in the division, led by Kansas City's Andy Reid, who has 301 career wins and his going for his fourth career Super Bowl title.",
      "Denver's Sean Payton (179 wins) and Carroll (181) have combined for 360 additional wins with both winning Super Bowl titles. Jim Harbaugh of the Chargers has a .685 winning percentage in five seasons as an NFL head coach with one Super Bowl trip and a college national championship.",
      "He will try to join Carroll, Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer as the only coaches to win a title in college and the pros.",
      "The AFC West will be the first division to start a season with every head coaching having previously been to a Super Bowl. The 1999 NFC West came close with Atlanta's Dan Reeves, Carolina's George Seifert, New Orleans' Mike Ditka and St. Louis' Dick Vermeil all having gone with San Francisco's Steve Mariucci the outlier.",
      "Only two divisions didn't have any coaching changes with the NFC West and AFC North remaining stable. That's nothing new for the AFC North, which last had a coaching change following the 2019 season when Cleveland hired Kevin Stefanski to replace Freddie Kitchens.",
      "Next season will mark the sixth straight with the same four head coaches for the four teams. That's the longest stretch ever without a coaching change, topping the four straight seasons for the NFC Central in 1978-81 and the NFC West from 2019-22.",

Griner is signing for only one year because a new collective bargaining agreement featuring potentially massive salary increases is expected to take effect in 2026.",
      "Griner missed the 2022 season when she was detained for nearly 10 months in Russia after authorities said a search of her luggage revealed vape cartridges containing oil derived from cannabis. She was freed in a prisoner swap when the United States released notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout.",
      "Griner averaged 17.8 points, 6.6 rebounds and 1.5 blocks this past season with Phoenix. She's third on the WNBA's career blocks list, 65 behind leader Margo Dydek.",

      "Griner becomes the most prominent free-agent signing in Atlanta's history, and she joins a talented squad led by Rhyne Howard and Allisha Gray. The Dream made a coaching change this offseason, bringing in Karl Smesko from Florida Gulf Coast. Griner, Howard and Gray are playing in the new 3-on-3 league Unrivaled this offseason.",

      "Griner, a 10-time All-Star, also had discussions with Dallas and Las Vegas.",
      "It has been an offseason of change for Phoenix. Earlier Tuesday, the Mercury were finalizing a deal to acquire Alyssa Thomas from the Connecticut Sun, a person familiar with that trade told the AP. It\u2019s also not clear whether veteran Diana Taurasi will play again or retire.",

      "Retired swingman Andre Iguodala will become just the seventh player to have his number retired by the Golden State Warriors in a ceremony next month",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- As Andre Iguodala moves around town in the Bay Area these days, he is regularly stopped by fans eager to praise him for how he carried himself while playing for the Golden State Warriors.",
      "For his grit and his drive. For doing all the little things many never saw.",
      "Some even share how his example influenced the way they raise their own kids \u2014 because that's how much he has meant to big-time basketball both on the court and off it.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m used to getting stopped a lot but now it throws me off because I don\u2019t play basketball anymore,\u201d Iguodala said. \"You can see a good fan versus a bad fan from a mile away, and so I\u2019m able to see, OK, this is a decent human being, and this is a genuine interaction. I think the folks that I\u2019m running into in the Bay are of high value and morals, and so 99% are really good interactions.",
      "\u201cYou walk away feeling a little bit better about yourself, actually, because you realize it\u2019s bigger than you.\u201d",
      "Now, Iguodala will give them more to celebrate and cheer about.",
      "The Warriors announced Tuesday that Iguodala is becoming the seventh player to have his number retired by the franchise \u2014 set to join Rick Barry (24), Wilt Chamberlain (13), Nate Thurmond (42), Al Attles (16), Chris Mullin (17) and Tom Meschery (14).",
      "Golden State will honor Iguodala and hang his No. 9 jersey following an afternoon game against Dallas on Feb. 23, meaning former teammate Klay Thompson will have the chance to be there.",

      "Iguodala retired in October 2023 after 19 NBA seasons and four championships with Golden State, including an NBA Finals MVP award in 2015. Shortly after announcing he was done playing, Iguodala became the acting executive director of the National Basketball Players Association.",
      "The 40-year-old Iguodala was the No. 9 overall pick in the 2004 NBA draft out of Arizona and played in 1,231 career games. He spent eight seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers, one in Denver, six with the Warriors, two in Miami and the last two back for Golden State. He was part of NBA champions in 2015, \u201817, \u201918 and 2022.",
      "A defensive stopper who took on a variety of roles, Iguodala not only mentored teammates at the end of his career but also provided insight to coach Steve Kerr.",
      "It was Kerr who trusted Iguodala to perform on the big stage that the coach moved him into the starting lineup trailing 2-1 to the Cavaliers in the 2015 Finals and gave him the assignment of guarding then-Cleveland star LeBron James.",
      "\u201cA lot of those things go unnoticed,\" the retired swingman said. \u201cI constantly get stopped by folks and they say, 'You know, you really helped me raise my children in terms of bringing a proper approach, to whatever it is that you do, respecting what you do, doing it at a high level, teamwork, discipline. Sacrifice is probably the biggest thing that they use in regards to me, with sometimes less is more, but knowing when to be ready for the big moments.\u201d",

      "No rookie has emerged as the leader of this year's class. There isn't a single first-year player on pace to average 15 points and appear in enough games to qualify for the league's leaderboard; the last time that happened was 2016-17. And right now, according to BetMGM Sportsbook, the favorite to win rookie of the year is someone who has started four games all season, all of them in the last week or so \u2014 Miami's Kel'el Ware.",

      "\u201cHe really has a chance to be special,\u201d Paul said of Castle, his Spurs teammate.",

      "Workers at a factory in rural Ohio were up all night churning out footballs for this year\u2019s Super Bowl",
      "As soon as this year's Super Bowl matchup was set, workers at the Wilson Sporting Goods football factory jumped into action.",

      "But this time of year it's all about the Super Bowl. The Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs will face off for the Lombardi Trophy for the second time in three years on Feb. 9 in New Orleans.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the footballs, by the numbers:",
      "The two teams will each get a shipment of 108, plus a dozen more for the kickers, all stamped with the Super Bowl logo and team names. Some of the balls will be for practices, while the best ones will be set aside by the quarterbacks. About 50 of those will be bagged and locked away for each team until it's time for kickoff.",
      "Wilson makes five different sizes for players of all levels, from the pros to youth leagues. Some have different patterns. NFL balls are notable for the lack of a stripe on the ends. They're also embedded with a chip that tracks the ball's position on the field, how far it travels and its trajectory.",
      "Normally it takes three days from start to finish. But the first batch of footballs must be sent to the Super Bowl teams Monday, within about 18 hours, so they have enough time to break them in for practices and the game. That's why the workers start production right away the night of the conference title games.",
      "It's a 20-step process, most of it by hand, from cutting out the four leather panels that are sewn together with 250 stitches to putting in the laces. For NFL footballs, the work goes to the factory's most experienced and skilled workers. \u201cCertain parts of the process require a handmade feel,\u201d said Kevin Murphy, general manager of Wilson Team Sports. \u201cIt's like making a beautiful, sculpted pair of shoes.\u201d",
      "Throughout production the balls are weighed, measured and inspected for flaws. Once finished, they're checked again. By the time they're packaged and ready for shipping, each one will have been touched by about 50 workers.",
      "It churns out roughly 500,000 footballs each year, or about 2,500 per day. NFL teams go through several hundred during a season. For the Super Bowl, Wilson will make between 10,000-20,000 commemorative balls that will be sold by retailers nationwide and at the game site. If there's high demand, the factory will keep producing the souvenir balls well after.",
      "Since 1941, Wilson has made every football used by the league. Its factory in Ada has been making the official game balls since 1955. This year the company opened a new plant in the village that allows for more production and a museum. Fans can tour the factory, too."

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple on Thursday disclosed its iPhone sales dipped slightly during the holiday-season quarter, signaling a sluggish start to the trendsetting company\u2019s effort to catch up to the rest of Big Tech in the race to bring artificial intelligence to the masses.",
      "The iPhone\u2019s roughly 1% drop in revenue from the previous year\u2019s October-December period wasn\u2019t entirely unexpected, given the first software update enabling the device\u2019s AI features didn\u2019t arrive until just before Halloween, and the technology still isn\u2019t available in many markets outside the U.S.",
      "The countries still awaiting Apple\u2019s AI suite include China, a key market where the company continued to lose ground.",
      "Apple also was only able to eke out a modest revenue gain across its entire business, although the results came in ahead of the analyst projections that guide investors. The Cupertino, California, company earned $36.3 billion, or $2.40 per share, a 7% increase from the previous year. Revenue edged up from the previous year by 4% to $124.3 billion.",
      "Those numbers included iPhone revenue of $69.1 billion. In China, Apple\u2019s total revenue registered $18.5 billion, an 11% decrease from the previous year.",
      "Part of that erosion in China reflected the iPhone\u2019s shrinking market share in that country, where homegrown companies have been making more headway. Apple\u2019s iPhone year-over year shipments in China declined nearly 10% in the most recent quarter, while native companies Huawei and Xiaomi posted year-over-year increase of more than 20%, according to the research firm International Data Corp.",
      "The holiday-season results served to confirm bringing AI to the iPhone and Apple\u2019s other products may not boost the company\u2019s recently lackluster growth as much as investors initially thought it might after CEO Tim Cook unveiled the technology before a rapt crowd last June.",
      "The anticipation that an AI-infused iPhone would prod hordes of consumers to ditch their current devices and splurge on an upgrade is the main reason Apple\u2019s stock price surged by 30% last year. But the sinking realization that an uptick in demand may take longer than expected has caused Apple\u2019s shares to backtrack by 5% during the first month of the new year. The stock slipped slightly in extended trading after the numbers came out.",
      "The concerns hovering around Apple's weakening iPhone sales come against broader worries about whether AI will be as lucrative for U.S. tech companies as once envisioned after Chinese startup DeepSeek released a version of the technology that was built at a far lower cost than had been previously thought possible.",
      "Unlike tech peers such as Microsoft, Google corporate parent Alphabet Inc. and Facebook corporate parent Meta Platforms, Apple hasn\u2019t been investing as heavily in AI \u2013 one of the reasons it has been an industry laggard. But that restraint could work to its advantage if DeepSeek\u2019s early breakthroughs in driving down AI costs gains momentum.",
      "Apple\u2019s services division remained the company\u2019s biggest moneymaker outside the iPhone, with revenue of $26.3 billion in the past quarter, a 14% increase from the previous year. Although the services division has been thriving for years, it generates more than $20 billion annually by locking in Google as the automatic search engine on the iPhone and other products. That deal is now under threat of being banned as part of the proposed punishment for Google\u2019s search engine being declared an illegal monopoly."

      "The Justice complaint alleges that Hewlett Packer Enterprise, under increased competitive pressure from the fast-rising Juniper, was forced to discount products and services and invest more in its own innovation, eventually leading the company to simply buy its rival.",
      "The lawsuit said that the combination of businesses would eliminate competition, raise prices and reduce innovation.",
      "HPE and Juniper issued a joint statement Thursday, saying the companies strongly oppose the DOJ's decision.",
      "\u201cWe will vigorously defend against the Department of Justice\u2019s overreaching interpretation of antitrust laws and will demonstrate how this transaction will provide customers with greater innovation and choice, positively change the dynamics in the networking market,\u201d the companies said.",
      "The combined company would create more competition, not less, the companies said.",
      "The Justice Department's intervention \u2014 the first of the new administration and just 10 days after Donald Trump's inauguration \u2014 comes as somewhat of a surprise. Most predicted a second Trump administration to ease up on antitrust enforcement and be more receptive to mergers and deal-making after years of hypervigilance under former President Joe Biden\u2019s watch.",
      "Hewlett Packard Enterprise announced one year ago that it was buying Juniper Networks for $40 a share in a deal expected to double HPE\u2019s networking business.",
      "In its complaint, the government painted a picture of Hewlett Packard Enterprise as a company desperate to keep up with a smaller rival that was taking its business.",
      "HPE salespeople were concerned about the \u201cJuniper threat,\u201d the complaint said, also alleging that one former executive told his team that \u201cthere are no rules in a street fight,\u201d encouraging them to \u201ckill\u201d Juniper when competing for sales opportunities.",
      "The Justice Department said that Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Juniper are the U.S.'s second- and third-largest providers of wireless local area network (WLAN) products and services for businesses.",
      "\u201cThe proposed transaction between HPE and Juniper, if allowed to proceed, would further consolidate an already highly concentrated market \u2014 and leave U.S. enterprises facing two companies commanding over 70% of the market,\u201d the complaint said, adding that Cisco Systems was the industry leader.",
      "Many businesses and investors accused Biden regulatory agencies of antitrust overreach and were looking forward to a friendlier Trump administration.",
      "Under Biden, the Federal Trade Commission sued to block a $24.6 billion merger between Kroger and Albertsons that would have been the largest grocery store merger in U.S. history. Two judges agreed with the FTC\u2019s case, blocking the proposed deal in December.",
      "In 2023, the Department of Justice, through the courts, forced American and JetBlue airlines to abandon their partnership in the northeast U.S., saying it would reduce competition and eventually cost consumers hundreds of millions of dollars a year. That partnership had the blessing of the Trump administration when it took effect in early 2021.",
      "U.S. regulators also proposed last year to break up Google for maintaining an \u201cabusive monopoly\u201d through its market-dominate search engine, Chrome. Court hearings on Google\u2019s punishment are scheduled to begin in April, with the judge aiming to issue a final decision before Labor Day. It\u2019s unclear where the Trump administration stands on the case.",
      "One merger that both Trump and Biden agreed shouldn\u2019t go through is Nippon Steel\u2019s proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel. Biden blocked the nearly $15 billion acquisition just before his term ended. The companies challenged that decision in a federal lawsuit early this year.",
      "Trump has consistently voiced opposition to the deal, questioning why U.S. Steel would sell itself to a foreign company given the regime of new tariffs he has vowed."

      "Researchers have found the oldest known evidence of lead pollution dating to around 5,200 years ago in ancient Greece",
      "WASHINGTON -- Ancient Greece produced the earliest records of democracy, western philosophy \u2014 and, it turns out, lead pollution.",
      "Researchers studying sediment cores recovered from mainland Greece and the Aegean Sea have found the oldest known evidence of lead pollution in the environment dating to around 5,200 years ago.",
      "That's 1,200 years older than the previous earliest recorded lead pollution, which was found in a peatbog in Serbia.",
      "In antiquity, lead was released into the atmosphere as a byproduct of smelting ore for copper and silver. The toxic metal later condensed as dust and settled onto the soil.",
      "\u201cSilver was used for jewelry, for special objects \u2014 but it wasn't found in a pure state,\u201d but mined in ore combined with lead, said Heidelberg University archaeologist Joseph Maran, co-author of a new study published Thursday in Communications Earth and Environment.",
      "The site with the earliest signs of lead contamination is located in northeastern Greece, near the island of Thasos. Prior archaeological evidence suggests Thasos was one of the region\u2019s most significant sites for silver mining and metalwork, said Maran.",
      "\u201cLead released from smelting is the world\u2019s first form of toxic or industrial pollution,\u201d said Yale historian Joseph Manning, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The researchers found that levels of lead contamination remained fairly low and localized in ancient Greece, considered the cradle of European civilization, throughout the Bronze Age, the Classical period and the Hellenistic period. The Classical period is famous for Athenian democracy, Socrates and Plato, and the Hellenistic period saw Greek cultural influence peak across the Mediterranean region.",
      "But around 2,150 years ago, the researchers detected \u201ca very strong and abrupt increase\" in lead emissions caused by human activities across Greece, said co-author Andreas Koutsodendris at Heidelberg University.",
      "Around that time, in 146 B.C., the Roman army conquered the Greek peninsula, transforming the region\u2019s society and economy. As Roman trade, colonies and shipping expanded across the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, demand for silver coins grew rapidly, requiring smelting that released lead, said Koutsodendris.",
      "Later the Roman Empire used lead for tableware and for construction, including pipes.",
      "Previous research \u2013 including an analysis of ice cores from Greenland \u2013 had detected high levels of lead across much of the Northern Hemisphere during Roman times.",
      "But the new study adds a more \"specific and local picture to how lead levels changed,\u201d said Nathan Chellman, an environmental scientist at the University of Nevada, Reno, who was not involved in the research.",

      "It's the latest instance of a large corporation settling litigation with the president, who has threatened retribution on his critics and rivals, and comes as Meta and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, have joined other large technology companies in trying to ingratiate themselves with the new Trump administration.",

Two of the people said terms of the agreement include $22 million going to the nonprofit that will become Trump's future presidential library. The balance will go to legal fees and other litigants, they said.",

      "Zuckerberg visited Trump in November at his private Florida club to try to mend fences with the incoming president, something other technology, business and government officials have done as well. At the dinner, Trump brought up the litigation and suggested they try to resolve it, kick-starting two months of negotiations between the parties, the people said.",

      "Twitter, Facebook and Google are all private companies, and users must agree to their terms of service to use their products. Under Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, social media platforms are allowed to moderate their services by removing posts that, for instance, are obscene or violate the services\u2019 own standards, so long as they are acting in \u201cgood faith.\u201d The law also generally exempts internet companies from liability for the material that users post.",
      "But Trump and some other politicians have long argued that X, Facebook and other social media platforms have abused that protection and should lose their immunity \u2014 or at least have it curtailed.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Two-thirds of animal and plant populations are declining in genetic diversity, which makes it harder to adapt to environmental changes, according to research published Wednesday.",
      "Long before a species goes extinct, the population becomes smaller and more fragmented, shrinking the number of potential mates and therefore genetic mixing. This leaves a species more vulnerable to future threats such as disease.",
      "\u201cA surprisingly trend was that we saw genetic diversity declining even among\" many species that aren't considered at risk, said co-author Catherine Grueber, a conservation biologist at the University of Sydney.",
      "Researchers examined data for 628 species studied between 1985 and 2019. The greatest losses in genetic variation were seen in birds and mammals.",
      "Findings were published in the journal Nature.",
      "\u201cWhen a species has different genetic solutions, it's better able to deal with changes,\u201d said David Nogu\u00e9s-Bravo at the University of Copenhagen, who was not involved in the study.",
      "If a new disease spreads through a population or climate change alters summer rainfall, some individuals will fare better than others, in part because of their genes. Higher genetic diversity also means there\u2019s a greater chance of a species' survival.",
      "Conservation efforts to connect isolated populations \u2014 basically expanding the dating pool for a particular species \u2013 can help maintain or even restore genetic diversity.",
      "Florida panthers are an endangered species that have steadily lost habitat to freeways and urban sprawl. By the mid-1990s, the remaining big cats in southern Florida showed clear signs of inbreeding \u2013 with kinked tails and low sperm counts in males.",
      "Biologists brought eight female panthers from Texas to Florida. Twenty years later, the number of Florida panthers in the wild has grown significantly and genetic diversity increased.",
      "\u201cIsolated populations suffer,\u201d said Duke University ecologist Stuart Pimm, who was not part of the research. \u201cThe solution is to reconnect them.\"",

      "PARK CITY, Utah -- Access to the Sundance Film Festival doesn\u2019t require a trip to Park City, Utah, anymore \u2014 just an internet connection. Over half of the films that premiered this past week will be available to steam on the festival\u2019s online platform starting Thursday.",
      "What started as a COVID-era necessity has become one of the festival\u2019s most beloved components, even for those who do brave the cold and the lines to see films in person.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s really great to be able to offer that opportunity to our audiences, but also to our artists. Sundance is a festival of discovery and each of the films coming to the festival is seeking that moment with audiences,\u201d said festival director Eugene Hernandez. \u201cHow cool is it that even for that short window of time, just a few days, folks from anywhere in the country can log on in their living room with family and friends, get together and watch a few of the films?\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 08:42:26 -0500",
    "summary": "A new report says advanced artificial intelligence systems have the potential to create extreme new risks, such as fueling widespread job losses, enabling terrorism or running amok",
    "story": [
      "A new report says advanced artificial intelligence systems have the potential to create extreme new risks, such as fueling widespread job losses, enabling terrorism or running amok",
      "LONDON -- Advanced artificial intelligence systems have the potential to create extreme new risks, such as fueling widespread job losses, enabling terrorism or running amok, experts said in a first-of-its-kind international report Wednesday cataloging the range of dangers posed by the technology.",
      "The International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI is being released ahead of a major AI summit in Paris next month. The paper is backed by 30 countries including the U.S. and China, marking rare cooperation between the two countries as they battle over AI supremacy, highlighted by Chinese startup DeepSeek stunning the world this week with its budget chatbot in spite of U.S. export controls on advanced chips to the country.",
      "The report by a group of independent experts is a \u201csynthesis\u201d of existing research intended to help guide officials working on drawing up guardrails for the rapidly advancing technology, Yoshua Bengio, a prominent AI scientist who led the study, told the Associated Press in an interview.",
      "\u201cThe stakes are high,\u201d the report says, noting that while a few years ago the best AI systems could barely spit out a coherent paragraph, now they can write computer programs, generate realistic images and hold extended conversations.",
      "While some AI harms are already widely known, such as deepfakes, scams and biased results, the report said that \u201cas general-purpose AI becomes more capable, evidence of additional risks is gradually emerging\u201d and risk management techniques are only in their early stages.",
      "It comes amid warnings this week about artificial intelligence from the Vatican and the group behind the Doomsday Clock.",
      "The report focuses on general purpose AI, typified by chatbots such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT used to carry out many different kinds of tasks. The risks fall into three categories: malicious use, malfunctions and widespread \u201csystemic\u201d risks.",
      "Bengio, who with two other AI pioneers won computer science\u2019s top prize in 2019, said the 100 experts who came together on the report don\u2019t all agree on what to expect from AI in the future. Among the biggest disagreements within the AI research community is the timing of when the fast-developing technology will surpass human capabilities across a variety of tasks and what that will mean.",
      "\u201cThey disagree also about the scenarios,\u201d Bengio said. \u201cOf course, nobody has a crystal ball. Some scenarios are very beneficial. Some are terrifying. I think it\u2019s really important for policymakers and the public to take stock of that uncertainty.\u201d",
      "Researchers delved into the details surrounding possible dangers. AI makes it easier, for example, to learn how to create biological or chemical weapons because AI models can provide step by step plans. But it\u2019s \u201cunclear how well they capture the practical challenges\u201d of weaponizing and delivering the agents, it said.",
      "General purpose AI is also likely to transform a range of jobs and \u201cdisplace workers,\u201d the report says, noting that some researchers believe it could create more jobs than it takes away, while others think it will drive down wages or employment rates, though there\u2019s plenty of uncertainty over how it will play out.",
      "AI systems could also run out of control, either because they actively undermine human oversight or humans pay less attention, the report said.",
      "However, a raft of factors make it hard to manage the risks, including AI developers knowing little about how their models work, the authors said.",
      "The paper was commissioned at an inaugural global summit on AI safety hosted by Britain in November 2023, where nations agreed to work together to contain potentially \u201ccatastrophic risks.\u201d At a follow-up meeting hosted by South Korea last year, AI companies pledged to develop AI safety while world leaders backed setting up a network of public AI safety institutes.",
      "The report, also backed by the United Nations and the European Union, is meant to weather changes in governments, such as the recent presidential transition in the U.S., leaving it up to each country to choose how it responds to AI risks. President Donald Trump rescinded former President Joe Biden\u2019s AI safety policies on his first day in office, and has since directed his new administration to craft its own approach. But Trump hasn\u2019t made any move to disband the AI Safety Institute that Biden formed last year, part of a growing international network of such centers.",
      "World leaders, tech bosses and civil society are expected to convene again at the Paris AI Action Summit on Feb 10-11. French officials have said countries will sign a \u201ccommon declaration\u201d on AI development, and agree to a pledge on sustainable development of the technology.",
      "Bengio said the report's aim was not to \"propose a particular way to evaluate systems or anything.\" The authors stayed away from prioritizing particular risks or making specific policy recommendations. Instead they laid out what the scientific literature on AI says \u201cin a way that\u2019s digestible by policymakers.\"",
      "\u201cWe need to better understand the systems we\u2019re building and the risks that come with them so that we can we can take these better decisions in the future,\u201d he said.",

      "The aircraft, which flew for the first time in March, is made almost completely from lightweight carbon fiber. It uses an augmented reality vision system to help with landing, since its long nose and high-angle approach can make it difficult for pilots to see.",
      "\u201cThe future of aviation is here and now,\u201d Amy Marino Spowart, president and CEO of the National Aeronautic Association, said in a statement. \u201cNot only is there hope for faster and better commercial flight, but Boom proves that it can be done sustainably.\u201d",
      "Boom is one of several companies with an eye on supersonic passenger travel. Any new such service will likely face the same hurdles as the Concorde, which flew over the Atlantic and was barred from many overland routes because of the sonic booms it caused.",
      "Sonic booms are heard on the ground when airplanes fly faster than the speed of sound \u2014 typically about 760 mph (1,223 kph) near sea level but varying depending on temperature, altitude and other conditions, according to the Congressional Research Service.",

      "Chinese artificial intelligence startup company DeepSeek stunned markets and AI experts with its claim that it built its immensely popular chatbot at a fraction of the cost of those made by American tech titans.",
      "That immediately called into question the billions of dollars U.S. tech companies are spending on a massive expansion of energy-hungry data centers they say are needed to unlock the next wave of artificial intelligence.",
      "Could this new AI mean the world needs significantly less electricity for the technology than everyone thinks? The answer has profound implications for the overheating climate . AI uses vast amounts of energy, much of which comes from burning fossil fuels, which causes climate change. Tech companies have said their electricity use is going up, when it was supposed to be ramping down, ruining their carefully-laid plans to address climate change.",
      "\u201cThere has been a very gung ho, go ahead at all costs mentality in this space, pushing toward investment in fossil fuels,\u201d said Eric Gimon, senior fellow at Energy Innovation. \u201cThis is an opportunity to tap the brakes.\u201d",
      "Making AI more efficient could be less taxing on the environment, experts say, even if its huge electricity needs are not going away.",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s claims of building its impressive chatbot on a budget drew curiosity that helped make its AI assistant the No. 1 downloaded free app on Apple\u2019s iPhone this week, ahead of U.S.-made chatbots ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden we wake up Monday morning and we see a new player number one on the App Store, and all of a sudden it could be a potential gamechanger overnight,\" said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. \u201c It caused a bit of a panic. These were the hottest stocks in the world.\u201d",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s app competes well with other leading AI models. It can compose software code, solve math problems and address other questions that take multiple steps of planning. It's attracted attention for its ability to explain its reasoning in the process of answering questions.",
      "Leading analysts have been poring through the startup's public research papers about its new model, R1, and its precursors. Among the details that stood out was DeepSeek\u2019s assertion that the cost to train the flagship v3 model behind its AI assistant was only $5.6 million, a stunningly low number compared to the multiple billions of dollars spent to build ChatGPT and other well-known systems. DeepSeek hasn\u2019t responded to requests for comment.",
      "The $5.6 million number only included actually training the chatbot, not the costs of earlier-stage research and experiments, the paper said. DeepSeek was also working under some constraints: U.S. export controls on the most powerful AI chips. It said it relied on a relatively low-performing AI chip from California chipmaker Nvidia that the U.S. hasn\u2019t banned for sale in China.",
      "Data centers consumed about 4.4% of all U.S. electricity in 2023 and that's expected to increase to 6.7% to 12% of total U.S. electricity by 2028, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.",
      "It's been axiomatic that U.S. tech giants must spend much more on building out data centers and other infrastructure to train and run their AI systems. Meta Platforms, the parent of Facebook and Instagram, says it plans to spend up to $65 billion this year, including on a massive data center complex coming to Louisiana.",
      "Microsoft said it plans to spend $80 billion this year. And Trump last week joined the CEOs of OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank to announce a joint venture that hopes to invest up to $500 billion on data centers and the electricity generation needed for AI development, starting with a project already under construction in Texas.",
      "When there's an innovative technology that's useful to the general population and it's affordable, people will use it, said Vic Shao, founder of DC Grid, which delivers off-grid, direct current power to data centers and electric vehicle charging stations.",
      "That means data centers will still be built, though they may be able to operate more efficiently, said Travis Miller, an energy and utilities strategist at Morningstar Securities Research.",
      "\u201cWe think that the growth in electricity demand will end up at the lower end of most of the ranges out there,\u201d he said.",
      "If DeepSeek's claims hold true, some routine AI queries might not need a data center and could be shifted to phones, said Rahul Sandil, vice president and general manager for global marketing and communications at MediaTek, a semiconductor company. That would ease the computing need and give more time to scale up renewable energy sources for data centers.",
      "Bloom Energy is one of the AI-related stocks that took a hit Monday. KR Sridhar, founder and CEO, said it's imperative that the U.S. leads in AI because it can power data centers with clean energy, unlike other countries that still primarily rely on coal.",
      "\u201cWe can continue to make it better and we will continue to make it better,\u201d he said.",
      "Rick Villars, an analyst for market research group IDC, said the DeepSeek news could influence how AI researchers advance their models, but they\u2019ll still need plenty of data centers and electricity.",
      "\u201cWe think this actually could boost and accelerate the time frame for when AI becomes much more embedded into our lives, in the work sense, the living sense and in health care,\u201d Villars said. \u201cSo we still think the capacity is required.\u201d",

      "Visa is the first partner for the platform's \u201cX Money Account\" service, which is set to launch later this year, X CEO Linda Yaccarino said in a Tuesday post announcing the news. The offering, Yaccarino noted, will support an in-platform digital wallet and peer-to-peer payments connected to users' debit cards, with an option to transfer funds to a bank account.",
      "According to Visa, which also posted about the partnership on X Tuesday, these services will be powered by Visa Direct \u2014 the payment giant's instant money transferring service \u2014 and will be available to X Money Account users in the U.S.",
      "Whether X Money will become available to consumers in other countries, and perhaps through additional payment partners in the near future is still known. And an exact date for the U.S. launch has also not been announced yet.",
      "In her post Tuesday, Yaccarino called the partnership with Visa a \u201cmilestone for the Everything App\u201d and the \u201cfirst of many big announcements about X Money this year.\"",
      "The prospect of San Francisco-based X, formerly known as Twitter, becoming an \u201ceverything app\" has been floated around for some time. Before officially closing the deal to purchase the platform for $44 billion back in 2022, Musk expressed interest in creating his own version of something similar to China\u2019s WeChat \u2014 a \u201csuper app\u201d that does video chats, messaging, streaming and payments.",
      "And his fascination with such a platform began long before the Twitter deal was on the table. Musk has been toying with the idea of an \u201ceverything app\u201d since the late 1990s when he launched a startup called X.com that was later merged into what became X.com. He continued to push for PayPal to diversify but was rebuffed by company CEO Peter Thiel and other executives. PayPal was sold in 2002 to eBay for $1.5 billion \u2014 providing Musk with a windfall that he funneled into the creation of SpaceX and an investment in Tesla in its early days.",
      "The landscape is far more competitive today \u2014 with a handful of companies making similar efforts to expand their in-platform offerings. Other social media giants, such as Facebook parent Meta, have added shopping, games and even dating features.",
      "Consumers now have different platforms at their disposal for communications, payment services, entertainment and more. How X's coming \u201ceverything\u201d features will fare has yet to be seen. Since Musk's 2022 takeover, the platform has already alienated many users and advertisers over reports of rising hate speech and misinformation.",
      "X\u2019s ambitions could also thrust the company into the crosshairs of other powerful tech giants trying to fend off a perceived competitive threat. U.S. regulators have alleged that Apple, for example, has been illegally using its market power to stifle so-called super apps from making their way onto its iPhone since 2017.",
      "As part of an antitrust lawsuit filed last year, the U.S. Justice Department said it had uncovered evidence showing that Apple believed a super app would lessen consumers\u2019 usage of the iPhone\u2019s own software and services, including payment processing. The Cupertino, California, company has vehemently denied the allegations and is trying to persuade a federal judge in New Jersey to dismiss the entire case.",

      "\u201cPeople may think there\u2019s some hidden business logic behind this, but it\u2019s mainly driven by curiosity,\u201d Liang said.",
      "When DeepSeek was asked, \u201cWho is Liang Wenfeng?\u201d its first answer was to name a different Chinese entrepreneur with the same name, at least as spelled in English letters.",
      "When asked: \u201cWhere is Liang Wenfeng from and where did he go to university?\u201d it said that as of October 2023, the most recent knowledge cutoff for DeepSeek's R1 AI model, \u201cthere is no publicly available information about Liang Wenfeng\u2019s background, including his place of origin or educational history.\"",
      "\"If you are referring to the founder of DeepSeek, details about his personal life or academic background have not been disclosed publicly. For more information about DeepSeek, you can visit its official website,\u201d it said.",
      "Liang's focused approach fits in with his determination to push AI learning forward. After decades of relying on innovation from the West, he says China should be making its own contributions.",
      "\u201cWhat we see is that Chinese AI can\u2019t be in the position of following forever. We often say that there is a gap of one or two years between Chinese AI and the United States, but the real gap is the difference between originality and imitation,\u201d he said in another Waves interview in November. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t change, China will always be only a follower \u2014 so some exploration is inescapable.\u201d",

      "HONG KONG -- The Chinese artificial intelligence firm DeepSeek has rattled markets with claims that its latest AI model, R1, performs on a par with those of OpenAI, despite using less advanced computer chips and consuming less energy.",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s emergence has raised concerns that China may have overtaken the U.S. in the artificial intelligence race despite restrictions on its access to the most advanced chips. It's just one of many Chinese companies working on AI, with a goal of making China the world leader in the field by 2030 and besting the U.S. in their battle for technological supremacy.",
      "Like the U.S., China is investing billions into artificial intelligence. Last week, it created a 60 billion yuan ($8.2 billion) AI investment fund, days after the U.S. imposed fresh chip export restrictions.",
      "Beijing has also invested heavily in the semiconductor industry to build its capacity to make advanced computer chips, working to overcome limits on its access to those of industry leaders. Companies are offering talent programs and subsidies, and there are plans to open AI academies and introduce AI education into primary and secondary school curriculums.",
      "China has established regulations governing AI, addressing safety, privacy and ethics. Its ruling Communist Party also controls the kinds of topics the AI models can tackle: DeepSeek shapes its responses to fit those limits.",
      "Here's an overview of some other leading AI models in China.",
      "Alibaba Cloud\u2019s Qwen-2.5-1M is the e-commerce giant's open-source AI series. It contains large language models that can easily handle extremely long questions, and engage in longer and deeper conversations. Its ability to understand complex tasks such as reasoning, dialogues and comprehending code is improving.",
      "Like its rivals, Alibaba Cloud has a chatbot released for public use called Qwen - also known as Tongyi Qianwen in China. Alibaba Cloud\u2019s suite of AI models, such as the Qwen2.5 series, has mostly been deployed for developers and business customers such as automakers, banks, video game makers and retailers as part of product development and shaping customer experiences.",
      "Ernie Bot, developed by Baidu, China\u2019s dominant search engine, was the first AI chatbot made publicly available in China. Baidu said it released the model publicly to be able to collect massive real-world human feedback to build its capacity.",
      "Ernie Bot 4.0 had more than 300 million users as of June 2024. Similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT, users of Ernie Bot are able to ask it questions and have it generate images based on text prompts.",
      "Doubao 1.5 Pro is an AI model released by TikTok's parent company ByteDance last week. Doubao is currently one of the most popular AI chatbots in China, with 60 million monthly active users.",
      "ByteDance says the Doubao 1.5 Pro is better than ChatGPT-4o at retaining knowledge, coding, reasoning, and Chinese language processing. According to ByteDance, the model is also cost-efficient and requires lower hardware costs compared to other large language models because Doubao uses a highly-optimized architecture that balances performance with reduced computational demands.",
      "Moonshot AI is a Beijing-based startup valued at over $3 billion after its latest fundraising round. It says its recently released Kimi k1.5 matches or outperforms the OpenAI o1 model, which is designed to spend more time thinking before it responds and can solve harder and more complex problems. Moonshot claims that Kimi outperforms OpenAI o1 in mathematics, coding, and ability to comprehend both text and visual inputs such as photos and video."

Observers are eager to see whether the Chinese company has matched America\u2019s leading AI companies at a fraction of the cost.",

In 2023, China issued regulations requiring companies to conduct a security review and obtain approvals before their products can be publicly launched.",
      "Here are some answers The Associated Press received from DeepSeek's new chatbot and ChatGPT:",
      "For many Chinese, the Winnie the Pooh character is a playful taunt of President Xi Jinping. Chinese censors in the past briefly banned social media searches for the bear in mainland China.",
      "ChatGPT got that idea right. It said Winnie the Pooh had become a symbol of political satire and resistance, often used to mock or criticize Xi. It explained that internet users started comparing Xi to the bear over similarities in their physical appearances.",
      "DeepSeek's chatbot said the bear is a beloved cartoon character that is adored by countless children and families in China, symbolizing joy and friendship.",
      "Then, abruptly, it said the Chinese government is \u201cdedicated to providing a wholesome cyberspace for its citizens.\" It added that all online content is managed following Chinese laws and socialist core values, with the aim of protecting national security and social stability.",
      "It might be easy for many people to answer, but both AI chatbots mistakenly said Joe Biden, whose term ended last week, because their data was last updated in October 2023. But they both tried to be responsible by reminding users to verify with updated sources.",
      "The 1989 crackdown saw government troops open fire on student-led pro-democracy protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, resulting in hundreds, if not thousands, of deaths. The event remains a taboo subject in mainland China.",
      "DeepSeek's chatbot answered, \u201cSorry, that's beyond my current scope. Let's talk about something else.\u201d",
      "But ChatGPT gave a detailed answer on what it called \u201cone of the most significant and tragic events\u201d in modern Chinese history. The chatbot talked about the background of the massive protests, the estimated casualties and the legacy.",
      "DeepSeek's chatbot's answer echoed China's official statements, saying the relationship between the world's two largest economies is one of the most important bilateral relationships globally. It said China is committed to developing ties with the U.S. based on mutual respect and win-win cooperation.",
      "\u201cWe hope that the United States will work with China to meet each other halfway, properly manage differences, promote mutually beneficial cooperation, and push forward the healthy and stable development of China-U.S. relations,\u201d it said.",
      "ChatGPT's answer was more nuanced. It said the state of the U.S.-China relationship is complex, characterized by a mix of economic interdependence, geopolitical rivalry and collaboration on global issues. It highlighted key topics including the two countries' tensions over the South China Sea and Taiwan, their technological competition and more.",
      "\u201cThe relationship between the U.S. and China remains tense but crucial,\u201d part of its answer said.",
      "Again \u2014 like the Chinese official narrative \u2014 DeepSeek's chatbot said Taiwan has been an integral part of China since ancient times.",
      "\u201cCompatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are connected by blood, jointly committed to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,\u201d it said.",
      "ChatGPT said the answer depends on one's perspective, while laying out China and Taiwan's positions and the views of the international community.

      "NATO is deploying eyes in the sky and on the Baltic Sea to protect cables and pipelines that stitch together the nine countries with shores on Baltic waters",
      "ABOARD A FRENCH NAVY FLIGHT OVER THE BALTIC SEA -- With its powerful camera, the French Navy surveillance plane scouring the Baltic Sea zoomed in on a cargo ship plowing the waters below \u2014 closer, closer and closer still until the camera operator could make out details on the vessel's front deck and smoke pouring from its chimney.",
      "The long-range Atlantique 2 aircraft on a new mission for NATO then shifted its high-tech gaze onto another target, and another after that until, after more than five hours on patrol, the plane's array of sensors had scoped out the bulk of the Baltic \u2014 from Germany in the west to Estonia in the northeast, bordering Russia.",
      "The flight's mere presence in the skies above the strategic sea last week, combined with military ships patrolling on the waters, also sent an unmistakable message: The NATO alliance is ratcheting up its guard against suspected attempts to sabotage underwater energy and data cables and pipelines that crisscross the Baltic, prompted by a growing catalogue of incidents that have damaged them.",
      "\u201cWe will do everything in our power to make sure that we fight back, that we are able to see what is happening and then take the next steps to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. And our adversaries should know this,\" NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said this month in announcing a new alliance mission, dubbed \u201cBaltic Sentry,\u201d to protect the underwater infrastructure vital to the economic well-being of Baltic-region nations.",
      "Power and communications cables and gas pipelines stitch together the nine countries with shores on the Baltic, a relatively shallow and nearly landlocked sea. A few examples are the 152-kilometer (94-mile) Balticconnector pipeline that carries gas between Finland and Estonia, the high-voltage Baltic Cable connecting the power grids of Sweden and Germany, and the 1,173-kilometer (729-mile) C-Lion1 telecommunications cable between Finland and Germany.",
      "Undersea pipes and cables help power economies, keep houses warm and connect billions of people. More than 1.3 million kilometers (807,800 miles) of fiber optic cables \u2014 more than enough to stretch to the moon and back \u2014 span the world's oceans and seas, according to TeleGeography, which tracks and maps the vital communication networks. The cables are typically the width of a garden hose. But 97% of the world\u2019s communications, including trillions of dollars of financial transactions, pass through them each day.",
      "\u201cIn the last two months alone, we have seen damage to a cable connecting Lithuania and Sweden, another connecting Germany and Finland, and most recently, a number of cables linking Estonia and Finland. Investigations of all of these cases are still ongoing. But there is reason for grave concern,\" Rutte said on Jan. 14.",
      "At least 11 Baltic cables have been damaged since October 2023 \u2014 the most recent being a fiber optic cable connecting Latvia and the Swedish island of Gotland, reported to have ruptured on Sunday. Although cable operators note that subsea cable damage is commonplace, the frequency and concentration of incidents in the Baltic heightened suspicions that damage might have been deliberate.",
      "There also are fears that Russia could target cables as part of a wider campaign of so-called \u201chybrid warfare\u201d to destabilize European nations helping Ukraine defend itself against the full-scale invasion that Moscow has been pursuing since 2022.",
      "Without specifically blaming Russia, Rutte said: \u201cHybrid means sabotage. Hybrid means cyber-attacks. Hybrid means sometimes even assassination attacks, attempts, and in this case, it means hitting on our critical undersea infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Finnish police suspect that the Eagle S, an oil tanker that damaged the Estlink 2 power cable and two other communications cables linking Finland and Estonia on Dec. 25th, is part of Moscow\u2019s \u201cshadow fleet\u201d used to avoid war-related sanctions on Russian oil exports.",
      "Finnish authorities seized the tanker shortly after it left a Russian port and apparently cut the cables by dragging its anchor. Finnish investigators allege the ship left an almost 100-kilometer (62-mile) long anchor trail on the seabed.",
      "Several Western intelligence officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of their work, told The Associated Press that recent damage was most likely accidental, seemingly caused by anchors being dragged by ships that were poorly maintained and poorly crewed.",
      "One senior intelligence official told AP that ships' logs and mechanical failures with ships' anchors were among \u201cmultiple indications\u201d pointing away from Russian sabotage. The official said Russian cables were also severed. Another Western official, also speaking anonymously to discuss intelligence matters, said Russia sent an intelligence-gathering vessel to the site of one cable rupture to investigate the damage.",
      "The Washington Post first reported on the emerging consensus among U.S. and European security services that maritime accidents likely caused recent damage.",
      "The European Subsea Cables Association, representing cable owners and operators, noted in November after faults were reported on two Baltic links that, on average, a subsea cable is damaged somewhere in the world every three days. In northern European waters, the main causes of damage are commercial fishing or ship anchors, it said.",
      "In the fiber-optic cable rupture on Sunday connecting Latvia and Sweden, Swedish authorities detained a Maltese-flagged ship bound for South America with a cargo of fertilizer.",
      "Navibulgar, a Bulgarian company that owns the Vezhen, said any damage was unintentional and that the ship's crew discovered while navigating in extremely bad weather that its left anchor appeared to have dragged on the seabed.",
      "The alliance is deploying warships, maritime patrol aircraft and naval drones for the mission to provide \u201cenhanced surveillance and deterrence.\u201d",
      "Aboard the French Navy surveillance flight, the 14-member crew cross-checked ships they spotted from the air against lists of vessels they had been ordered to watch for.",

      "\u201cI like bidding wars because you make your best deals,\u201d Trump said as he spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One while flying back to Washington from Miami, where Republican House members were holding a conference.",

      "In one of his first acts in office last week, Trump extended the deadline for TikTok to find new ownership that satisfies the government by 75 days, to April 4 from January 19.",
      "The president has said that he\u2019s looking for the ultimate purchaser to give the U.S. a 50% stake in the company, which is owned by China-based ByteDance. But the details remain murky, and its unclear whether he's proposing control of the app by the government or another U.S. entity.",
      "Last week, the artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI presented a new proposal to ByteDance that would allow the U.S. government to own up to 50% of a new entity that merges Perplexity with TikTok\u2019s U.S. business, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "Several other investors \u2014 including billionaire Frank McCourt and Trump's former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin \u2014 have spoken publicly about their desire to purchase TikTok's U.S. platform. Trump has also said he\u2019s spoken to \u201cmany people\u201d privately about the company.",
      "After the bipartisan law was signed by former President Joe Biden in April, ByteDance said it did not have plans to sell the platform and fought the statute in court for months. China also rebuked Washington over the divestment push, though more recently it appears to be softening its stance.",
      "In media interviews last week, Bill Ford, the chairman of the global investing firm General Atlantic and a ByteDance board member, said the company is prepared to engage with the Trump administration and Chinese officials to find a solution that keeps TikTok available. He also floated the idea that there could be a solution short of a full divesture by ByteDance.",
      "Lawmakers and officials in both parties have raised national security concerns about Chinese ownership and potential manipulation on the immensely popular platform, which is used by more than 170 million U.S. users.",
      "Trump was in favor of a TikTok ban before he reversed his position last year. He credits the platform with helping him win more young voters during the recent presidential election.",
      "Microsoft, along with Walmart, made a failed bid for TikTok during Trump\u2019s first term after Trump tried to ban the app. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella later described it as the \u201cstrangest thing I\u2019ve ever worked on.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The repealed regulation keeping teens from buying guns originated in 1968.",
      "A federal appeals court on Thursday struck down a longstanding federal ban that prevented the sale of handguns to Americans between the ages of 18 and 20 \u2014 a landmark gun control regulation in place since 1968.",
      "The conservative Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the federal law banning handgun sales to teens is inconsistent with the nation's historical tradition and violates the Second Amendment.",
      "The decision cited the Supreme Court's 2022 opinion by Clarence Thomas in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen, which significantly expanded gun rights and threatens to rollback other gun safety laws nationwide.",
      "\"Ultimately, the text of the Second Amendment includes eighteen-to-twenty-year-old individuals among 'the people' whose right to keep and bear arms is protected,\" the court wrote in its opinion statement.",
      "The statement went on, \"The federal government has presented scant evidence that eighteen-to-twenty-year-olds\u2019 firearm rights during the founding-era were restricted in a similar manner to the contemporary federal handgun purchase ban, and its 19th century evidence 'cannot provide much insight into the meaning of the Second Amendment when it contradicts earlier evidence.'\"",

    "story": [
      "Police have arrested a total of six people in connection with a deadly explosion of illegal fireworks in a Honolulu neighborhood on New Year\u2019s Eve",
      "HONOLULU -- Police arrested a total of six people in connection with a deadly explosion of illegal fireworks in a Honolulu neighborhood on New Year\u2019s Eve and confiscated 500 pounds (227 kilograms) of unused fireworks from the scene of the blast, authorities said Thursday.",
      "Police arrested two couples on Wednesday and one couple last Friday, said Honolulu police homicide Lt. Deena Thoemmes said. Police expect to arrest more people, she said.",
      "Police were working with prosecutors to file charges but it is taking time due to the number of people arrested, large volume of evidence being examined and fireworks being tested, she said.",
      "\u201cWe are recovering more evidence and identifying more individuals. As a result, additional arrests will be forthcoming,\u201d Thoemmes said at a news conference.",
      "The explosion killed three women, one man and a 3-year-old boy and injured about 20 others. The tragedy occurred when a lit bundle of mortar-style aerials tipped over and shot into crates of unlit fireworks, causing a rapid-fire series of blasts.",
      "All six suspects were arrested on allegations of first-degree reckless endangering, first-degree endangering the welfare of a minor and multiple fireworks offenses. The first two suspects have been released pending investigation.",
      "Manslaughter was the most serious potential charge in the case and was being investigated, Thoemmes said. Detectives will study how the fireworks were acquired and will ask the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for help with that part of the investigation, she said.",
      "The 500 pounds recovered from the scene were found in the carport and in vehicles belonging to people at the gathering, Thoemmes said.",
      "The igniting of illegal fireworks \u2014 many of them aerials normally used in professional fireworks shows \u2014 has become increasingly common in Hawaii in recent years. People set off fireworks year-round but especially during the year-end holidays.",
      "Hawaii authorities have said existing laws are difficult to enforce, in part because the evidence is often incinerated when fireworks are lit. Residents are also often reluctant to testify against their neighbors, making cases difficult to prove in court.",
      "The deadly New Year's explosion prompted Gov. Josh Green to propose overhauling fireworks enforcement laws, including creating $300 citations that police could issue to violators. He has also asked lawmakers to enable Class A felony charges and possibly decades in prison for those whose actions with fireworks severely injure or kill people.",
      "The state Department of Law Enforcement has asked lawmakers to appropriate $5.2 million to hire eight people and expand a forensic lab to crack down on the persistent rampant smuggling of fireworks.",
      "Police said the first two suspects arrested, a man and a woman both 33 years-old, ignited illegal fireworks at the New Year\u2019s Eve gathering and allowed their children \u2014 ages 15, 10 and 1 \u2014 to also light illegal fireworks. The 1-year-old was injured, treated at a hospital and released, police said.",
      "Thoemmes said the two other couples arrested Wednesday both lived at the house where the explosion occurred.",
      "One couple \u2014 a 35-year-old man and a 38-year-old woman \u2014 allegedly attended the gathering with their four minor children. All four children were injured, taken to a hospital to be treated for their wounds and released.",
      "The other couple was a 29-year-old woman and 32-year-old man. Police said they were at the party with their two minor children, who were not injured.",
      "Thoemmes said some people initially interviewed by detectives provided false statements.",
      "\u201cHindering prosecution is a crime and those who do so will face charges,\u201d she said.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 13:46:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Experts in the DEI field say anti-discrimination programs are intended to produce merit-based systems. President Donald Trump has implemented anti-DEI executive orders.",
    "story": [
      "Executive order slams diversity programs as \"immense public waste.\"",
      "Executive orders signed recently by President Donald Trump state that diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs prioritize diversity over merit in hiring, claiming DEI efforts are an \u201cimmense public waste and shameful discrimination.\"",
      "Some experts in the DEI field disagree, and several tell ABC News that diversity, equity and inclusion programs are aimed at creating a true merit-based system, where hiring, salaries, retention and promotions are decided without bias or discrimination toward employees.",
      "Before the anti-discrimination legislative movement of the 1960s -- including the Equal Pay Act of 1963, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 -- discrimination against certain groups was widespread, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "\"If you were from a dominant group -- generally white people, generally men, straight, cisgender, fully-abled -- you had a huge leg up in terms of getting employment recommendations, higher pay promotions,\" Erica Foldy, a professor at NYU\u2019s Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, told ABC News.",
      "She continued, \"So, Trump and his allies are harking back to this time that they say was more merit-based, but that's not at all how these organizations operated.\"",
      "DEI initiatives -- like implementing accessibility measures for people with disabilities, addressing gender pay inequity, diversifying recruitment outreach, or holding anti-discrimination trainings -- are intended to correct discriminatory organizational practices, experts say.",
      "DEI experts argue that diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives are \"on the path of creating more merit-based companies, more merit-based firms,\" Foldy said, aiming to ensure that qualified people of all backgrounds have an \"equal chance of being hired; you're going to be paid the same as employees at comparable levels.\"",
      "\"Business as usual, without attention to discrimination, is deeply, deeply inequitable,\" Foldy said.",
      "Amri Johnson, a DEI expert and author, told ABC News that the ideal of meritocracy operates under the assumption \"that opportunities are fair.\" Today, studies across industries continue to show that discrimination against a person's race, gender, disability, sexual orientation, military background, or other factors continues to permeate the job market.",
      "\"If organizations truly want the best talent, companies need to be intentional about how they source and engage with talent,\" said Johnson.",
      "Each year, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission plays a role in hundreds of legal cases concerning ongoing discrimination against protected classes in the workplace.",
      "The EEOC's 2023 performance report offers a long list of lawsuits it settled or won that year. One lawsuit noted blatant racist graffiti or comments made by fellow employees, paired with the discriminatory designation of hard physical labor solely for Black employees; others noted the failures of several employers to make reasonable accommodations for pregnant or disabled workers that led to the employee's termination or job offers rescinded.",
      "One study found that racial and ethnic discrimination in hiring continues to be a problem globally.",
      "\"Relative to white applicants, applicants of color from all backgrounds in the study had to submit about 50% more applications per callback on average,\" according to research from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that analyzed 90 studies involving 174,000 total fake job applications tweaked to include racial indicators but with otherwise similar professional credentials.",
      "\"Diversity doesn\u2019t go away because DEI goes away. It is an inevitable part of any human community (business or otherwise),\" said Johnson. \"Not learning how to deal with its tensions and complexity is leaving value on the table.\"",
      "Some DEI experts point to research from management consulting firm McKinsey & Company that found that companies with more diversity financially and socially outperform those that are less diverse.",
      "\"The most successful companies understand that DEI isn\u2019t just a '\"nice-to-have,'\" said Christie Smith, the former vice president for inclusion and diversity at Apple, in a written statement. \"It\u2019s a driver of innovation, talent attraction, and competitive advantage. The question is whether leaders will have the courage to stay the course and hold firm against political headwinds.\"",
      "On Thursday, Trump claimed, without citing evidence, that diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives for air traffic controllers at the Federal Aviation Administration were partly to blame for the tragic plane and helicopter collision in Washington on Wednesday night.",
      "The accusation comes after Trump signed sweeping orders aiming to terminate \"diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility\" programs in or sponsored by the federal government and its contractors.",
      "The White House argues that DEI programs \"deny, discredit, and undermine the traditional American values of hard work, excellence, and individual achievement in favor of an unlawful, corrosive, and pernicious identity-based spoils system.\"",
      "\"Americans deserve a government committed to serving every person with equal dignity and respect, and to expending precious taxpayer resources only on making America great,\" reads Trump's executive order.",
      "The order revokes several decades-old or years-old executive actions, including the 1965 Equal Employment Opportunity order prohibiting hiring discrimination by federal contractors and its amendments expanding professional development, data collection and retention opportunities.",
      "The order also explicitly revokes a 1994 order to develop environmental justice strategies that address disproportionately high health and environmental impacts faced by low-income or minority communities.",
      "Among the list of orders that are now revoked is a 2011 order requiring federal agencies to develop strategies \"to identify and remove barriers to equal employment opportunity.\"",
      "Those in favor of axing DEI programs argue that these initiatives could lead to lawsuits claiming discrimination following the Supreme Court's ruling on SFFA v. Harvard that disallows race to be taken into consideration in college applications.",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research has been a strong advocate against DEI, submitting shareholder proposals to reverse the DEI policies at major companies like Costco, John Deere, and others. Ethan Peck, deputy director for the NCPPR\u2019s Free Enterprise Project, told ABC News that such companies should be \"colorblind.\"",
      "\"We're saying that companies have an obligation, a legal obligation, and an obligation to their shareholders, and an obligation to their employees to treat everybody the same, regardless of their race and sex, and we'd submit any proposal to keep that that way,\" Peck said.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 09:46:32 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump ally Kash Patel, the president's pick for FBI director, is likely to be questioned about his fitness to lead Thursday during his Senate confirmation hearing.",
    "story": [
      "The staunch Trump ally has derided the FBI as the \"Federal Bureau of Insanity.\"",
      "As Kash Patel, President Donald Trump's pick to lead the FBI, appears Thursday for his Senate confirmation hearing, some of the rhetoric he has espoused for years to defend Trump and promote Trump's reelection is sure to elicit sharp questions about whether he is fit to lead one of the nation's premiere law enforcement agencies.",
      "Patel has derided the FBI as the \"Federal Bureau of Insanity.\" He's announced \"a mission to annihilate the 'Deep State'\" -- what he calls a \"cabal of unelected tyrants\" inside government, undermining Trump. He's said the conspiracy theory QAnon, claiming a secret global plot to traffic children and take down Trump, is right in many ways and \"should get credit for all the things\" it has accomplished. And he once promised to \"come after\" and prosecute \"the conspirators not just in government, but in the media\" who \"helped Joe Biden rig the presidential election\" in 2020.",
      "On a podcast two years ago, Trump adviser Roger Stone told Patel his critics are right about one thing: \"You are a Trump loyalist.\"",
      "Patel chuckled and nodded affirmatively.",
      "But that's just what Democrats -- and even some Republicans -- on the Senate Judiciary Committee may wonder about most: If confirmed, is Patel so loyal to Trump that he would use the FBI to push Trump's political agenda and target Trump's perceived enemies?",
      "According to Patel, the FBI has already become a political weapon -- especially with its multiple investigations of Trump, including the unprecedented search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in 2022 -- and that's what he wants to change.",
      "\"The rot at the core of the FBI isn't just scandalous, it's an existential threat to our republican form of government,\" Patel wrote in his book, published two years ago, titled \"Government Gangsters.\"",
      "Trump, on social media, called Patel's book \"the roadmap to end the Deep State's reign\" when it came out.",
      "Many of Trump's allies in Congress have lauded Patel's nomination, touting him as the change agent needed at the top of an embattled agency. Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has called Patel's career \"a study in fighting for unpopular but righteous causes, exposing corruption, and putting America First.\"",
      "Democrats, however, not only point to what they see as Patel's concerning rhetoric -- but also what they've described as his relative lack of experience for such a significant position.",
      "After meeting with Patel last week, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said he has \"grave concerns\" about Patel's nomination, declaring, \"Mr. Patel has neither the experience, the temperament, nor the judgment to lead the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\u201d",
      "Now in his mid-40s, Patel grew up on New York's Long Island, ultimately deciding to attend law school after caddying for a group of criminal defense attorneys at the Garden City County Club. By his own account, in 2005, he graduated from Pace University Law school in the bottom third of his class -- something he was \"very proud of,\" he once joked.",
      "After law school, he spent nine years as a public defender, and in late 2013 he moved to Washington, D.C., to join the Justice Department's National Security Division as a terrorism prosecutor, helping U.S. attorneys' offices around the country prosecute their cases.",
      "He was involved in Justice Department cases all over the world, including ones stemming from the 2012 attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi and the 2010 World Cup bombings in Uganda.",
      "But in his book and in media interviews, he said he grew frustrated with his time at the Justice Department, especially after a dust-up with a federal judge that made national headlines.",
      "In early 2016, while Patel was in Tajikistan for work, the judge presiding over one of his cases in Texas called for an in-person hearing back in the United States. Patel didn't have a suit or tie with him in Tajikistan, and after racing halfway around the world to make the hearing, the judge badgered him to \"dress like a lawyer\" and \"act like a lawyer,\" according to a transcript of the exchange.",
      "\"You don't add a bit of value, do you?\" the judge added.",
      "As Patel recounted in his book, his bosses at the Justice Department privately expressed support for him, but when the Washington Post wrote a story about it two weeks later, the Justice Department, in Patel's telling, refused to defend him publicly, so the newspaper \"dragged my name through the mud.\"",
      "Patel has also described how he grew upset over the Justice Department's handling of the Benghazi case following the 2012 attack by Islamic militants, believing that \"terrorists went free\" despite his disputed assertion that the Obama administration had enough evidence to charge even more people for the attack.",
      "\"I just got to my breaking point,\" Patel once recalled. So in 2017, he left the Justice Department to become a senior investigator on Capitol Hill, where he helped lead the House Republicans' probe of \"Russiagate\" -- which, as he describes it, exposed FBI wrongdoing in its 2016 investigation of alleged ties between Trump's presidential campaign and Russia.",
      "Patel's work on the Russia probe led to him joining the Trump administration in 2019, and in the final year of Trump's presidency he was appointed acting deputy director of national intelligence -- the second-in-command of the entire U.S. intelligence community -- and then chief of staff to the acting U.S. defense secretary, a position that critics claimed he was unqualified to hold even for just the 10 weeks he was there.",
      "After Trump's first administration ended, Patel regularly appeared on conservative media outlets, frequently praising Trump and criticizing the Justice Department for investigating and then prosecuting Trump for his alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving office and his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Patel has claimed -- despite the Justice Department's inspector general finding otherwise -- that the FBI played a part in pushing pro-Trump protesters to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. And he has claimed in media interviews and court testimony that Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser and then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi deserve blame for the attack -- not Trump -- because, Patel insists, Trump days earlier had authorized up to 20,000 National Guard to secure the Capitol.",
      "The judge who listened to his court testimony in a case about Trump\u2019s eligibility to be on Colorado\u2019s ballot in the November election ruled that Patel \"was not a credible witness,\" saying his testimony was \"not only illogical\" but \"completely devoid of any evidence in the record.\"",
      "After Trump left office, Patel launched a tax-exempt charity, now known as the Kash Foundation, which made national headlines in 2023 with revelations that it provided thousands of dollars to at least two so-called \"FBI whistleblowers\" who helped House Republicans push disputed claims of corruption inside the Justice Department.",
      "Patel has said his charity helps fund defamation lawsuits, supports whistleblowers, buys meals for families in need over Christmas, supports Jan. 6 families, and more recently funds \"rescue operations\" out of Israel.",
      "But he has refused to offer specifics about who is benefiting from his charity, and, as ABC News previously reported, experts have questioned whether it was following the law. At the time, Patel declined to speak with ABC News about its reporting.",
      "After Trump announced his latest presidential campaign, Patel traveled the country to promote Trump's reelection, saying that Trump would fire \"thousands and thousands and thousands\" of government employees to root out the \"Deep State.\"",
      "Three weeks after Trump was reelected president, he named Patel as his pick to lead the FBI.",

    "summary": "Lawmakers gave DNI nominee Tulsi Gabbard more than a half-dozen chances to withdraw past support of Edward Snowden in her confirmation hearing, but she didn't take them.",
    "story": [
      "DNI nominee backed off past comments about Russia and government surveillance.",
      "Lawmakers on the Senate Intelligence Committee peppered director of national intelligence nominee Tulsi Gabbard with questions about her controversial rhetoric on Russian aggression, Syria\u2019s use of chemical weapons, and government surveillance programs at her high-stakes confirmation hearing on Thursday.",
      "But it was her statements about Edward Snowden, the prolific leaker of national secrets, that generated the most colorful moments of her three hours of public testimony.",
      "Senators from both sides offered Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman, countless opportunities to withdraw her past support of Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who fled the country with more than 1 million classified records.",
      "And while she acknowledged on multiple occasions that Snowden broke the law, she stood firm in ways that seemed at times to frustrate even some Republicans on the panel.",
      "Gabbard has in the past called Snowden a \u201cbrave\u201d whistleblower who uncovered damning civil liberties violations by the intelligence community. As a lawmaker, she introduced legislation supporting a grant of clemency.",
      "On Thursday, she repeatedly refused to withdraw that characterization of him. And she repeatedly refused to call him a \u201ctraitor.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is where the rubber hits the road,\u201d Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet boomed inside the hearing room. \u201cThis is not a moment for social media, this is not a moment to propagate conspiracy theories \u2026 this is when you need to answer the questions of people whose votes you\u2019re asking for to be confirmed as the chief intelligence officer of this nation.\u201d",
      "\u201cIs Edward Snowden a traitor to the United States of America? This is not a hard question to answer when the stakes are this high,\u201d he continued.",
      "She declined to say. Instead, Gabbard repeated that she felt his acts were illegal and that she disagreed with his methods.",
      "\"Edward Snowden broke the law,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not agree with or support with all of the information and intelligence that he released, nor the way in which he did it.\"",
      "But, she added, he \"released information that exposed egregious, illegal and unconstitutional programs.\"",
      "Gabbard faces perhaps the most difficult route to confirmation of all of President Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks. She cannot afford to lose any Republican votes in the committee, and at least two members of the panel, Susan Collins and Todd Young, declined to offer their support after the open portion of the hearing concluded.",
      "While she stood firm on Snowden, Gabbard backtracked on other matters, including her suggestion in 2022 that U.S. and NATO forces had provoked Russia into its war with Ukraine. Asked by Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., who bore responsibility for Moscow\u2019s aggression, Gabbard was unequivocal: \u201c[Russian President Vladimir] Putin started the war in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "She also said that she \u201cshed no tears for the fall of the Assad regime,\u201d referring to Bashar al-Assad, the former Syrian dictator who fled Damascus late last year. Gabbard was chastised in 2017 for meeting with Assad in person and later casting doubt on intelligence tying his regime to the use of chemical weapons.",

      "Denver Health in Colorado has stopped providing gender-affirming surgeries for people under age 19, a spokesperson confirmed Thursday, in order to comply with the executive order and continue receiving federal funding.

      "Trump's order, signed Thursday, is part of a push to reverse Biden administration policies meant to protect transgender people and their care. It ordered agencies to take steps to makes sure that hospitals receiving federal research and education grants \u201cend the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\u201d",
      "Other hospitals told The Associated Press that their current practices would continue. Lurie Children\u2019s Hospital of Chicago said hospital officials are reviewing the order and \u201cassessing any potential impact to the clinical services we offer to our patient families.\u201d",

    "title": "What does Donald Trump's anti-DEI executive order mean for private companies?",
    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 15:40:57 -0500",
    "summary": "What does President Donald Trump's executive order directing federal agencies to \"encourage\" private companies to abandon DEI policies mean for businesses?",
    "story": [
      "Trump directed federal agencies to \"encourage\" companies to abandon DEI actions.",
      "Amid a flurry of executive actions President Trump is taking to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives within the federal government, the Trump administration is also turning its attention to private companies and institutions.",
      "President Trump signed an executive order the day after he was sworn in to his second term that not only rescinded DEI policies in the federal government, but also \"[encourages] the private sector to end\" what the order calls \"illegal DEI discrimination and preferences,\" claiming in part that DEI policies \"violate the text and spirit of our longstanding Federal civil-rights laws.\"",
      "\"Hardworking Americans who deserve a shot at the American Dream should not be stigmatized, demeaned, or shut out of opportunities because of their race or sex,\" the order said.",
      "Several legal experts who advise companies and institutions regarding their DEI policies told ABC News that while the Trump administration doesn't have the legal authority to mandate that private businesses abandon their DEI policies, the executive order's language uses the threat of potential legal action against certain companies with DEI policies to ostensibly force them to do so.",
      "'It's a powerful threat'",
      "Part of Trump's Jan. 21 executive order directs the attorney general, \"within 120 days of this order, in consultation with the heads of relevant agencies and in coordination with the Director of [the Office of Management and Budget],\" the latter of which oversees the performance of all federal agencies, to \"submit a report \u2026 containing recommendations for enforcing Federal civil-rights laws and taking other appropriate measures to encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI.\"",
      "The order instructs the federal agencies to \"identify up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of publicly traded corporations, large non-profit corporations or associations, foundations with assets of 500 million dollars or more, State and local bar and medical associations, and institutions of higher education with endowments over 1 billion dollars,\" as well as \"litigation that would be potentially appropriate for Federal lawsuits, intervention, or statements of interest.\"",
      "Those agencies are further directed to identify \"key sectors of concern\" and \"the most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners\" within each agency's jurisdiction, and to develop \"a plan of specific steps or measures to deter DEI programs or principles.\"",
      "The possibility of a legal battle with the federal government over DEI is already causing concern for many private businesses, experts told ABC News.",
      "\"It's a powerful threat that companies are responding to it by taking another very close look at their programs to make sure that they are comfortable with them,\" said labor attorney Jason Schwartz, a partner and co-chair of the Labor and Employment Practice at Gibson Dunn in Washington, D.C., and who leads the firm's DEI task force.",
      "\"Nobody wants to be on that Donald Trump DEI blacklist,\" Kenji Yoshino, a professor of constitutional law at NYU and the director of NYU's Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, and who also advises Fortune 500 companies on DEI matters, told ABC News. \"I worry that there's a very smart move and savvy move on the part of the executive branch to cast a fear through this kind of gesture of 'we are going to single you out,' or targeting so that a lot of companies are going to withdraw or pull back more than they needed to pull back, strictly legally.\"",
      "\"[Companies] just don't want to be one of those nine,\" Yoshino added, referring to the number of the executive order's \"potential civil compliance investigations.\"",
      "\"Until those nine are announced, it's going to cause others to be risk-averse,\" said Yoshino. \"So there's a kind of, you know, preemptive compliance, you know, or obedience going on.\"",
      "How companies are responding",
      "Schwartz told ABC News that since Trump signed his executive order, companies have been scrambling to seek legal counsel regarding their DEI policies and whether they need to be revised.",
      "\"The phone is literally ringing off the hook,\" he said, referring to the calls his firm is receiving. \"Companies are very concerned. They want to make sure, obviously, that they stay on the right side of the law.\"",
      "Yoshino said that the phones at NYU's Center for DEI likewise have been \"ringing off the hook\" with calls from companies seeking advice on how to proceed with their DEI initiatives. For now, he advises that concerned parties take a measured approach.",
      "\"The reflexive response is often to be like, 'Oh, if we shut it down, we will minimize risk,' and we regard that to be short sighted, both because there are smart ways to tweak these programs to lower the risk, or even lower to zero, eliminate the risk while still getting the same results,\" Yoshino told ABC News.",
      "\"And alternatively, if you eliminate all your DEI policies, you're then going to get sued from the other side,\" he cautioned, noting that marginalized groups could argue that rolling back DEI \"leads to a less inclusive, more discriminatory environment.\"",
      "Several large corporations \u2013 including Amazon, Meta, McDonalds, Walmart and Ford \u2013 announced before Trump was sworn in for his second term that they were ending, scaling back or otherwise reevaluating some of their DEI-related programs or initiatives.",
      "However, according to Yoshino, whose office has been tracking the impact of Trump's actions on DEI, even some companies who are stepping away from some DEI initiatives are retaining some policies or programs committed to inclusion, and that the majority of companies on the Fortune 500 list \"still have pro-DEI statements on their websites.\"",
      "Some companies also are publicly standing by their DEI commitments, with leaders at Goldman Sachs, Costco and JPMorgan Chase & Co recently speaking out in support of their diversity programs amid pressure from anti-DEI activist shareholders to roll back their policies.",
      "\"I do think that it's really important not to overreact,\" Yoshino told ABC News.",
      "What comes next?",
      "While it's unclear what might be \"litigation that would be potentially appropriate for Federal lawsuits, intervention, or statements of interest\" against private companies, as the executive order states, as well as what might be the outcome of any such actions, Yoshino and Schwartz both noted that anti-DEI litigation efforts in the U.S. have been escalating since the Supreme Court's June 2023 landmark ruling that effectively ended affirmative action in higher education.",
      "Since the Supreme Court decision, conservative legal advocacy groups have been ramping up litigation against private companies over their DEI initiatives, Schwartz said, noting that with Trump's executive order, those groups have now \"moved their operation into the White House.\"",
      "\"They now have the full force and power of the United States government where they can bring these cases,\" Schwartz added.",
      "Yoshino agreed, telling ABC News that the president is now putting the \"muscle of the executive branch behind the impact of that decision.\"",
      "Yoshino said that while the Supreme Court case addressed the higher education admissions process and was not about diversity and inclusion efforts in the private sector, \"it gave us such a clear window into how [the Supreme Court] was thinking about the issue of race discrimination.\"",
      "The Supreme Court ruled that \"in the same way that you can't discriminate against a person of color, you also can't discriminate against a white individual,\" according to Yoshino. \"That contrasts that with the previous jurisprudence that said you're allowed to use a [race] classification in narrow circumstances so long as your intent is to lift up a historically subordinated group.\"",
      "According to Schwartz, while the Trump administration is \"not creating new laws\" regarding the legality of DEI through his executive order, the Department of Justice is gearing up to bring cases against private companies by arguing that existing laws \"already prohibit many of the DEI programs that exist.\"",
      "Schwartz also pointed to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) as a federal agency that is likely to help advance the White House's anti-DEI efforts. The federal agency, which has the authority to investigate and prosecute cases of alleged employment discrimination, is now led by Trump appointee Andrea Lucas, who said in a statement upon being named EEOC acting chair Jan. 21 that her priorities are \"consistent with the President's Executive Orders,\" and include \"rooting out unlawful DEI-motivated race and sex discrimination.\"",
      "\"Our employment civil rights laws are a matter of individual rights. We must reject the twin lies of identity politics: that justice is measured by group outcomes and that civil rights exist solely to remedy harms against certain groups,\" Lucas' statement continued. \"I am committed to ensuring equal justice under the law and to focusing on equal opportunity, merit, and colorblind equality.\"",

    "summary": "A federal judge signaled he will issue a temporary restraining order barring the Trump administration from freezing federal loans and grants.",
    "story": [
      "The temporary restraining order has not yet been signed.",
      "A federal judge signaled he will issue a temporary restraining order barring the Trump administration from freezing federal loans and grants, raising concerns the White House will try to enact the same policy described in the now-rescinded memo from the Office of Management and Budget.",
      "District Judge John McConnell Jr. has not entered the temporary restraining order given the rapidly changing circumstances, but signaled he would sign an order proposed by the 22 state attorneys general who brought the case.",
      "McConnell had harsh words for the Trump administration and justified his future order -- despite the OMB's change of policy -- based on a social post by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.",
      "\"I think the breadth of the relief that plaintiffs are seeking is extraordinary,\" argued Department of Justice attorney Daniel Schwei before McConnell cut him off.",
      "\"Respectfully, so was the breadth of the OMB directive,\" McConnell said.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Donald Trump's administration sent a memo rescinding its sweeping directive that sought to pause potentially trillions in loans, grants and financial assistance, according to a memo obtained by ABC News.",
      "\"OMB memorandum M-25-13 is rescinded,\" the short memo from Matthew Vaeth, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, reads. \"If you have questions about implementing the President's Executive Orders, please contact your agency General Counsel.\"",
      "The new directive follows a tumultuous 48 hours for the White House, as states and local governments raised concerns that funding for health care, law enforcement, disaster aid and infrastructure spending could be paused or delayed during the expansive rollout of the policy.",
      "Leavitt defended the policy on social media, saying Trump still plans to implement a funding freeze without specifying what mechanism the president plans to use.",
      "\"This is NOT a rescission of the federal funding freeze,\" Leavitt posted on X. \"It is simply a rescission of the OMB memo. Why? To end any confusion created by the court's injunction. The President's EO's on federal funding remain in full force and effect and will be rigorously implemented.\"",
      "Amid the confusion, a federal judge on Tuesday in Washington, D.C., issued a stay of the policy through Monday as lawyers for the Department of Justice struggled to confirm the extent of the directive. The policy had been set to go into effect at 5 p.m. on Tuesday.",
      "\"Without this funding, Plaintiff States will be unable to provide certain essential benefits for residents, pay public employees, satisfy obligations, and carry on the important business of government,\" 22 state attorneys general had said in the lawsuit challenging the policy Tuesday.",
      "On Monday, the Office of Management and Budget ordered federal agencies to freeze any federal funding to activities that might be implicated by Trump's executive orders, causing states, local governments and nonprofits to scramble to determine if their funding would be cut off. Less than 24 hours after the policy was revealed, the White House attempted to clarify the policy in a memo, saying programs that provide direct benefits to Americans -- such as Social Security, Medicare and SNAP benefits -- would be excluded from the freeze.",
      "During the hearing Tuesday, the lawyer for the Department of Justice struggled to clarify exactly what would be affected.",
      "\"It seems like the federal government currently doesn't actually know the full scope of the programs that are going to be subject to the pause. Is that correct?\" U.S. District Judge Loren L. AliKhan asked.",
      "\"I can only speak for myself, which is just based on the limited time frame here, that I do not have a comprehensive list,\" DOJ lawyer Daniel Schwei said, adding, \"it just depends\" on the type of program and funding source.",

    "summary": "If confirmed, former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard would become the youngest-ever DNI. Sources tell ABC News the vote on her nomination is expected to be close.",
    "story": [
      "Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton says she has been \"smeared.\"",
      "If she is confirmed as director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard would be the youngest-ever in that role, the first millennial, the first Asian American, and only the second woman to hold the position.",
      "But she is expected to face questions in her confirmation hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee about statements she has made that appear to support U.S. enemies and dictators as well as having no significant experience in intelligence. Gabbard can afford to lose the votes of only three Republicans and sources tell ABC News the vote on her nomination is expected to be a close one.",
      "Chairman Tom Cotton, R-Ark., began his opening statement by expressing \"dismay\" at what he characterized as unfair attacks on Gabbard's patriotism, citing Hillary Clinton's accusation that she was \"an asset of a foreign nation,\" referring, of course, to Russia.",
      "Cotton said he personally \"spent two hours\" reviewing Gabbard's past background checks and found them \"clean as a whistle.\"",
      "\"No doubt she has some unconventional views,\" Cotton acknowledged, but suggested any criticism from Democrats reflects their frustration that she \"saw the light\" and left their party.",
      "In his opening statement, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the committee's top Democrat, ticked through a litany of Gabbard's more controversial public statements to demonstrate what he called his \"significant concerns about your judgment and your qualifications.\"",
      "\"Now I don't know if your intent in making those statements was to defend those dictators, or if you were simply unaware of the intelligence and how your statements would be perceived,\" Warner said. \"In either case, it raises serious questions about your judgment.\"",
      "In her opening statement, Gabbard confronted her critics.",
      "\"I want to warn the American people who are watching at home. You may hear lies and smears in this hearing that will challenge my loyalty to and my love for our country,\" she said. \"Those who oppose my nomination imply that I am loyal to something or someone other than God, my own conscience and the Constitution of the United States, accusing me of being Trump's puppet, Putin's puppet, Assad's puppet, a guru's puppet, Modi's puppet, not recognizing the absurdity of simultaneously being the puppet of five different puppet masters.",
      "\"The same tactic was used against President Trump and failed. The American people elected President Trump with a decisive victory and mandate for change. The fact is, what truly unsettles my political opponents is I refuse to be their puppet,\" she continued.",
      "For most of her career, Gabbard has broken barriers. She was the youngest woman ever elected to a state house of representatives and the first to graduate from the Accelerated Officer Candidate School at the Alabama Military Academy as a distinguished honor graduate. In Congress, she was the first Samoan American, the youngest woman elected at the time, and the first combat veteran to serve -- a distinction she shares with Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth.",
      "Gabbard has prepared extensively over the past two months for her hearings, meeting with former DNI leaders, including John Negroponte, the first DNI, and Michael Allen, who led Negroponte's confirmation hearing preparations. She also has consulted with Trump allies Morgan Ortagus, deputy special presidential envoy for Middle East peace, and FBI director nominee Kash Patel.",
      "She has sought input from a broad range of intelligence experts, former government officials and lawmakers across the aisle. She has participated in policy roundtables with lawyers, ex-intelligence officials, and national security negotiators, including figures involved in the Abraham Accords.",
      "She also held a full-scale mock confirmation hearing ahead of Thursday's Senate Intelligence Committee proceedings. Former Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who chaired the committee from 2015 to 2020, will introduce her.",
      "Sources on both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill tell ABC News Gabbard will likely face scrutiny over her past stances on Russia, Ukraine, Syria, and Iran, as well as her defense of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who reached a plea deal with the Justice Department over disseminating classified documents he had obtained illegally. Gabbard said last year on \"Real Time With Bill Maher\" that \"the charges against him are one of the biggest attacks on freedom of the press that we've seen and freedom of speech.\"",
      "As a member of Congress, Gabbard introduced a bill in 2020 calling for the federal government to drop all charges against Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who leaked information in 2013 about how the U.S. government surveils the American public.",
      "She's also expected to face question on her reversal on Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), a key surveillance tool she voted against reauthorizing in 2020, her last year in Congress.",
      "Gabbard argued that Americans shouldn't be forced to choose between security and liberty, saying that the Patriot Act and FISA have \"been allowing for the abuses of our civil liberties and overreach by our own intelligence and law enforcement agencies through doing things like warrantless sweeping collection of our data, violating our Fourth Amendment constitutional rights.\"",
      "Gabbard is also expected to face questions past statements about former President Donald Trump including her decision to vote present on Donald Trump's.",
      "Over the last two months, Gabbard has met with more than 50 senators, primarily Republicans. The meetings have largely served as an introduction -- an opportunity to explain her past positions and assuage concerns about her political evolution. A source close to her told ABC News, \"They know they can't put her in a box. She's not a Democrat. She's a new Republican. She has very similar, if not 100% aligned, views with President Trump on 'America First' foreign policy. That makes people uneasy because they can't quite figure her out.\"",
      "Gabbard, like Trump, is a former Democrat whose policy views have shifted significantly. Her evolution has been shaped by her 22 years in the Army, including deployments to Iraq, Kuwait, and Djibouti. If confirmed, she will be the first female DNI to have served in the military. She plans to continue serving in the Army Reserve, which is permitted under ODNI regulations.",
      "Behind the scenes, Gabbard has earned bipartisan support within the intelligence community for her willingness to engage with a range of stakeholders. Earlier this month, the families of two former ISIS and al-Qaeda hostages publicly endorsed her nomination in a letter shared with ABC News. The parents of Kayla Mueller, who was killed by ISIS, and Theo Padnos, a former al-Qaeda hostage, argued that the radicalization of individuals -- such as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, who drove his truck into a crowd of New Orleans New Year's revelers -- underscores the need for Gabbard's swift confirmation.",
      "The letter of support came under scrutiny by some lawmakers after rebels toppled Syria's Bashar al-Assad. Gabbard met with Assad in Syria in 2017, which remains a point of controversy. She has previously defended the trip as a \"fact-finding mission\" and has maintained that U.S. intervention in Syria empowered extremist groups.",
      "Gabbard warned in the same year that she was concerned that toppling Assad's regime could lead to groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda to step in to fill the void and \"completely massacre all religious minorities there in Syria.\"",
      "\"I had no intention of meeting with Assad, but when given the opportunity, I felt it was important to take it,\" Gabbard said in a 2017 statement. \"We should be ready to meet with anyone if there's a chance it can help bring about an end to this war.\"",
      "Padnos, who was kidnapped by the al-Nusra Front in 2012 and held for nearly two years, said Gabbard's willingness to engage with hostage families compelled him to speak out.",
      "\"This is a woman with deep compassion for the victims of terrorism and the courage to get things done,\" he told ABC News. \"Nobody else has offered their help -- except Tulsi.\"",
      "Gabbard told ABC News that she was \"honored and humbled by that statement of support.\"",
      "She has also received backing from law enforcement. The National Sheriffs' Association endorsed her nomination, citing her commitment to bridging intelligence gaps between federal agencies and local authorities. In a statement, the group praised Gabbard's pledge to give sheriffs \"a seat at the table\" in national security discussions.",
      "Sheriff Kieran Donahue, president of the National Sheriffs' Association, wrote \"Gabbard has demonstrated a commitment to addressing the critical disconnect between our intelligence agencies and local law enforcement in preparing for sophisticated and pervasive threats.\"",
      "A source close to Gabbard told ABC News that her focus as director of national intelligence will be on restoring trust in the intelligence community and reforming what is and isn't classified. Specifically, she aims to ensure that the intelligence provided to the Senate and White House is not information already available to lawmakers through media outlets. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers have expressed concern about the overclassification of information.",
      "The source added that Gabbard intends to provide more accurate, raw intelligence to help lawmakers make informed decisions, rather than relying on overclassified data. She also plans to streamline the process for security clearances and return ODNI to its original mission -- leading the intelligence community by fostering integration, collaboration and innovation.",
      "Her allies argue that her outsider perspective will help modernize the intelligence community -- though critics remain skeptical of her lack of traditional experience.",
      "Thursday's hearing will test whether Gabbard can win over skeptics -- or if her controversial past will derail her bid to become the nation's top intelligence officer.",

    "title": "First border patrol embed with the new Trump administration: Reporter's notebook",
    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 09:58:30 -0500",
    "summary": "ABC had the first border patrol embed with the new Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "The coordination between agents on both sides is unlike anything we've seen.",
      "As the sun rises in El Paso, our convoy heads up Mount Cristo Rey. We are riding shotgun with border patrol agents as they drive us along the state line, where Texas turns into New Mexico and both states border Chihuahua, Mexico.",
      "This is the first embed given to any world news outlet by the U.S. Border Patrol since the new Trump administration took office and it's clear, they are eager to show us how well things are going.",
      "\"This is as forward as you can be on the front line,\" Agent Orlando Rubio noted as we drove up to the border wall.",
      "As we make our way down the road, we run into a row of Border Patrol SUVs on the switchback roads of the mountainside. However, as we get closer, we realize agents aren't inside those vehicles, they are filled with combat soldiers. Dozens of them from Fort Bliss dressed in their fatigues, sitting out here, just watching.",
      "\"Most of this area is heavily trafficked by smugglers,\" Rubio told ABC News. \"So, what we see is a lot of footpaths that smugglers use to bring people into the country.\"",
      "But the paths are eerily quiet today. Clothing and water bottles are scattered all over the mountainside, but there's not a single person in sight.",
      "Most of this area has a border wall in place, but on Mount Cristo Rey, there are about 1.5 miles left open. During our embed, our cameras caught crews starting construction again for the first time in nearly four years.",
      "The metal barriers being used were likely stored away when the Biden administration halted construction on the wall in 2021. Until the new Administration can get more funding, they'll have to resourcefully use what they've got left to help secure the border.",
      "And then, something I've never seen along the border, a black helicopter passing over us multiple times. Rubio points and waves to it before explaining it's federal agents from Mexico scouting the area for smugglers.",
      "We are driving to check something else out when we see another group of Mexican federal agents along the border, flagging us down. In Spanish, they ask U.S. agents if there are any CBP operations running today. They got a call about a drone flying in the area and were trying to find it, but wanted to make sure it didn't belong to Border Patrol.",
      "This level of coordination between agents on both sides of the border is unlike anything we've seen.",
      "All along the Southwest border, we've reported a dramatic decrease in apprehensions over the last eight months. The El Paso sector is no exception, reporting just 127 migrant encounters on Tuesday. In fact, they saw a 63% decrease in apprehensions the last few months of fiscal year 2024.",
      "And yet, more resources and manpower are on their way. A clear effort by the Trump administration to send a strong message.",
      "\"We always need more, infrastructure and manpower, anything that can help us achieve securing our nation's border,\" Rubio adds as we drive away.",

    "title": "Some government employees dismayed after Musk jokes about buyout offer",
    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 21:30:10 -0500",
    "summary": "After the Trump administration offered two million government employees buyouts on Tuesday, DOGE head Elon Musk joked about the offer, leaving some employees dismayed.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has offered buyouts to two million federal employees.",
      "After the Trump administration offered two million federal employees buyouts on Tuesday, Elon Musk -- the world's richest man and the architect of Trump's effort to reduce the size of the government -- took to his own social media platform to boast and joke about the offer, leaving some federal employees who spoke to ABC News dismayed.",
      "By replying to an email sent out Tuesday, all full-time federal employees -- with the exception of military personnel and postal workers -- have the option to get eight months' salary if they agree to leave their jobs.",
      "\"The federal workforce should be comprised of employees who are reliable, loyal, trustworthy, and who strive for excellence in their daily work,\" the email sent to employees said, offering them what it called a \"deferred resignation\" from their positions.",
      "Commenting on X, Musk laughed at a specific aspect of the offer, writing, \"Hit 'Send,'\" accompanied by a screenshot of the letter to employees describing how to submit their resignation via email.",
      "Musk's attitude as he works to enact sweeping changes across the federal government -- potentially impacting hundreds of thousands of career employees who have spent their lives working behind the scenes -- is not lost on some workers, who told ABC News that the Trump administration and Musk's tone have been \"cruel\" and \"demoralizing.\"",
      "\"It feels like the new administration thinks we are dirt and do nothing for the country,\" said one 20-year federal employee who asked not to be identified out of fear of retribution. \"This is heartbreaking.\"",
      "According to a copy of the resignation letter posted by the Office of Personnel Management, federal employees have to acknowledge that the positions they vacate could be eliminated or consolidated, and their response to the buyout email may be used \"to assist in federal workforce reorganization efforts.\"",
      "While employees are not expected to work during their deferred resignation period, resigning workers need to commit to a \"smooth transition\" out of their roles.",
      "Bolstered by an executive order that would make it easier to fire career government employees, administration officials said they expect the reduction of the government workforce from the buyout and other executive actions to be \"significant.\"",
      "Unprecedented in its scope and nature, the buyout appears to be one part of Trump's sweeping approach to reducing the size of the government -- using an approach that mirrors tactics used by Musk in the past. When Musk took over Twitter in November 2022, he similarly sent a company-wide email that gave workers an ultimatum: work harder or leave with severance. Yesterday's email shared the same subject line -- \"A fork in the road\" -- that Musk used in his email.",
      "As federal employees were digesting the terms of the buyout Wednesday, it was unclear exactly who was eligible for it and whether there would really be severance payments, which could be delayed by litigation.",
      "Max Alonzo, national secretary-treasurer for the National Federation of Federal Employees, expressed skepticism about the terms of the resignations.",
      "\"Absolutely do not resign. There is nothing that says that the day that you resign, that they can't just let you go. They don't have to pay you -- there's nothing that says they have to pay you till September 30,\" he said. \"This is nothing that has been done before. This is not in our regulations. There's no regs about it. We're not even sure if it's actually legal. This is about trying to cut the federal workforce down, really kind of just breaking down these pillars of democracy.\"",
      "Foreign service officers within the State Department received the \"fork in the road\" email, but so far, State Department officials have been unable to provide their 16,000-person workforce a clear answer on whether they're eligible to take it, according to an official familiar with the matter. Even if staffers are deemed eligible for the buyouts, there's concern that -- if enough of them take the federal government up on its offer -- it will have an impact on national security because of the sudden, drastic downsizing.",
      "\"The implications could be really scary,\" said the official, who also asked not to be identified. \"This could really do some damage.\"",
      "The sweeping approach appears to be one of the first monumental steps to reshape the government by Musk, who supported Trump's election with $250 million in contributions and became one of Trump's closest advisers.",
      "When Trump first announced his plans to establish the \"Department of Government Efficiency\" in November, he framed it as an outside group that would advise the White House on how to make government more efficient. Two months later, when Trump actually established DOGE through an executive order, he took a different approach, giving Musk control of what used to be known as the United States Digital Service, a unit within the Executive Office of the President tasked with improving government websites.",
      "In an executive order signed the same day, Trump also tasked the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to work with DOGE and the Office of Personnel Management to \"submit a plan to reduce the size of the Federal Government's workforce through efficiency improvements and attrition.\"",
      "In addition to helming DOGE, Musk has extended his influence in the federal government by having his former employees and DOGE loyalists take on critical roles in other parts of government. Scott Kupor -- Trump's pick to lead the Office of Personnel Management. -- thanked the president for the \"opportunity to serve\" the country by helping Musk, and OMP's chief of staff Amanda Scales worked for Musk's AI company as recently as this month.",
      "To run the Office of Management and Budget, Trump tapped Project 2025 architect Russell Vought, who shares Musk's desire for historic spending cuts and workforce reductions. Vought was a central figure in Trump's attempt to categorize thousands of civil servants as political appointments, making it easier to fire employees without the protections given to civil servants. As one of his first acts in office, Trump signed an executive order to strip thousands of government workers of their employment protections.",
      "The new hirings and executive orders represent the first steps in Musk's plan for \"mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy,\" as he wrote in the Wall Street Journal in November.",
      "\"DOGE intends to work with embedded appointees in agencies to identify the minimum number of employees required at an agency for it to perform its constitutionally permissible and statutorily mandated functions,\" wrote Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who recently departed DOGE to run for public office."

    "story": [
      "The tallest building in Havana is impossible to miss",
      "HAVANA -- It\u2019s impossible to miss. The huge rectangular mass of concrete and glass \u2014 the tallest building in Havana \u2014 dominates the city skyline, towering 150 meters (490 feet) above colonial homes with its 542 luxury rooms and majestic views of the city and the sea.",
      "The Selection La Habana hotel, managed by Spanish chain Iberostar, has yet to be inaugurated but it is already the target of criticism \u2014 and not only for its unusual shape. Cubans are questioning the government\u2019s allocation of millions of dollars towards luxury tourism while the island grapples with a severe economic crisis and tourism numbers plummet to historic lows.",
      "\u201cAll that money could have been spent to build hospitals and schools,\u201d lamented Susel Borges, a 26-year-old artisan, as she looked up to the towering edifice, known to locals as the \u201cK and 23 building\u201d because of its location.",
      "Located near the legendary Habana Libre hotel and the iconic Coppelia ice cream parlor, the new hotel is part of a government plan to build a dozen luxury establishments \u2014 mainly in Havana \u2014 that did not stop even during the COVID-19 pandemic and while existing luxury hotels remained largely unoccupied.",
      "For decades, tourism drove the Cuban economy, generating annual revenues of up to $3 billion. But in December, Cuban authorities said only 2.2 million tourists visited the island in 2024, a decrease of roughly 200,000 from 2023 and significantly lower than the 4.2 million tourists who visited in 2019.",
      "The government attributes the decline in tourism to a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of factors including supply shortages, a severe energy crisis causing massive blackouts and a lack of personnel, due to emigration and low wages. Furthermore, the island is grappling with a surge in U.S. sanctions, including restrictions on travel by U.S. citizens, a ban on cruise ships and other measures specifically designed to stifle the growth of Cuba\u2019s tourism industry.",
      "\u201cTourism is gone,\u201d said Julio Garc\u00eda Campos, driver of a shiny red 1951 Pontiac with an original engine. \u201cTourists used to line up to get on one of these!\u201d he said, recalling a bygone era when the island was bustling with American and European travelers following a removal of sanctions by then-President Barack Obama.",
      "The new Selection La Habana, like all other hotels in Cuba, is state-owned and operates under GAESA, a conglomerate belonging to the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces that has often been criticized because of the opacity of its businesses. As a military-run operation, it is exempt from audits by the Comptroller General\u2019s Office and has not disclosed the amount it invested in the 40-story hotel.",
      "Cuban economist Pedro Monreal notes the \u201cincongruity\u201d of investing capital in the tourism sector when very little is being allocated to strategic areas such as agriculture.",
      "\"With food insecurity a concern, it\u2019s troubling that agricultural investment lags significantly behind tourism investment, remaining 11 times lower,\u201d Monreal noted last year on social media.",
      "Architects also expressed little enthusiasm for the new hotel, pointing at its disruptive appearance within the environment, its excessive height violating urban regulations and tall glass windows that are ill-suited for a tropical climate.",
      "\u201cThis building serves as a perfect example in our classes of what should not be done in terms of bioclimatic design,\u201d said Abel Tablada, an architect and university professor, adding it's \"unforgivable\" that the little money available to the Cuban state has been allocated to a building that does not add value to the city.",

      "NEW YORK -- The captain of an unauthorized tour boat that capsized in the Hudson River, killing a woman and a 7-year-old child, was sentenced Thursday to 18 months in prison, prosecutors said.",
      "Richard Cruz, 33, pleaded guilty in October to a misconduct and neglect charge specific to boating. Court papers show he admitted that he overloaded his boat \u2014 called Stimulus Money \u2014 and didn't have the Coast Guard credentials needed to take paying customers aboard.",
      "The boat flipped over and plunged all 13 people aboard into the water near Manhattan\u2019s West Side on July 12, 2022, prosecutors said. The woman, 48, and the boy died after being trapped underneath the vessel.",

      "The indictment was unsealed Thursday, a week after local, state and federal authorities raided the home of one of the defendants and two farms in a rural area east of Albuquerque that were no longer licensed by the state. Items seized included 8,500 pounds (3,855 kilograms) of marijuana, some methamphetamine, two firearms, $35,000 in cash, illegal pesticides and a bullet proof vest.",
      "The charges against Dineh Benally, 48; Donald Benally, 74; and Irving Rea Yui Lin, 73, of California, include conspiracy to manufacture and distribute marijuana, possession with intent to distribute and polluting a protected waterway.",
      "Prosecutors described the alleged operation as a brazen criminal enterprise and asked a federal judge to detain the men pending trial, suggesting in a motion that there was a risk the defendants would flee and that they were a danger to the community.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is that defendants are drug traffickers who operate in accordance with their own laws, so how can anything short of detention ensure the safety of the community or defendants' appearance in this matter,\" the motion reads.",
      "Phone and email messages seeking comment were left Thursday for the defendants.",
      "Dineh Benally first made headlines when cannabis farming operations in northwestern New Mexico were raided by federal authorities in 2020. The Navajo Department of Justice sued him, leading to a court order halting those operations.",
      "A group of Chinese immigrant workers also sued Benally and his associates. The workers claimed they were lured to northern New Mexico and forced to work long hours trimming marijuana on the Navajo Nation, where growing the plant is illegal.",
      "Just last year, New Mexico marijuana regulators revoked the license of the growing operation in Torrance County, east of Albuquerque. Regulators levied a $1 million fine, saying there were about 20,000 mature plants on site \u2014 four times more than the number allowed under the license. Inspectors also found another 20,000 immature plants.",
      "According to the indictment, the enterprise involved the construction of more than 1,100 cannabis greenhouses, the solicitation of Chinese investors to bankroll the effort and the recruitment of Chinese workers to cultivate the crops. Dineh Benally also is accused of approaching the chief of police for the Navajo Nation in an attempt to bribe him with drug proceeds to allow marijuana to be grown on tribal land.",
      "With armed guards securing the farms on tribal land, the indictment alleges, vacuum sealers were used to package marijuana and Chinese workers transported the drugs across state lines.",
      "The defendants also are accused of violating federal clean water standards by installing a dam made of sandbags along the San Juan River to help irrigate the crops. Wells also were drilled to access water.",
      "If convicted, the defendants each face no less than 10 years and up to life in prison, prosecutors said.",

      "Police arrested two couples on Wednesday and one couple last Friday, said Honolulu police homicide Lt. Deena Thoemmes said. Police expect to arrest more people, she said.",
      "Police were working with prosecutors to file charges but it is taking time due to the number of people arrested, large volume of evidence being examined and fireworks being tested, she said.",
      "\u201cWe are recovering more evidence and identifying more individuals. As a result, additional arrests will be forthcoming,\u201d Thoemmes said at a news conference.",
      "The explosion killed three women, one man and a 3-year-old boy and injured about 20 others. The tragedy occurred when a lit bundle of mortar-style aerials tipped over and shot into crates of unlit fireworks, causing a rapid-fire series of blasts.",

      "What was once the largest solar power plant of its type in the world appears headed for closure just 11 years after opening",
      "LOS ANGELES -- What was once the world's largest solar power plant of its type appears headed for closure just 11 years after opening, under pressure from cheaper green energy sources. Meanwhile, environmentalists continue to blame the Mojave Desert plant for killing thousands of birds and tortoises.",
      "The Ivanpah solar power plant formally opened in 2014 on roughly 5 square miles of federal land near the California-Nevada border. Though it was hailed at the time as a breakthrough moment for clean energy, its power has been struggling to compete with cheaper solar technologies.",
      "Pacific Gas & Electric said in a statement it had agreed with owners \u2014 including NRG Energy Inc. \u2014 to terminate its contracts with the Ivanpah plant. If approved by regulators, the deal would lead to closing two of the plant's three units starting in 2026. The contracts were expected to run through 2039.",
      "\u201cPG&E determined that ending the agreements at this time will save customers money,\u201d the company said in a statement on its website.",
      "Southern California Edison, which buys the rest of the power from the three-unit plant, is in discussions with owners and the U.S. Energy Department regarding a buyout of its Ivanpah contract.",
      "The plant appears likely to become a high-profile loser in the race to develop new types of clean energy in the era of climate change.",
      "The Ivanpah plant uses a technology known as solar-thermal, or concentrated solar, in which nearly 350,000 computer-controlled mirrors roughly the size of a garage door reflect sunlight to boilers atop 459-foot towers. The sun\u2019s power is used to heat water in the boilers\u2019 tubes and make steam, which drives turbines to create electricity.",
      "NRG said in a statement that the project was successful, but unable to compete with rival photovoltaic solar technology \u2014 such as rooftop panels \u2014 which have much lower capital and operating costs.",
      "Initially \u201cthe prices were competitive but advancements over time in photovoltaics and battery storage have led to more e\ufb03cient, cost effective and flexible options for producing reliable clean energy,\u201d NRG added.",
      "A post on the PG&E website said that Ivanpah's \u201ctechnology had worked on a smaller scale in Europe.\u201d But over time, it couldn't match the lower prices of photovoltaic technology.",
      "The plant has long been criticized for the environmental tradeoffs that came with large-scale energy production in the sensitive desert region. Rays from the plant's mirrors have been blamed for incinerating thousands of birds. Conservation groups tried to stop construction on the site because of threats to tortoises.",
      "\u201cThe Ivanpah plant was a financial boondoggle and environmental disaster,\u201d Julia Dowell of the Sierra Club said in an email.",
      "\u201cAlong with killing thousands of birds and tortoises, the project\u2019s construction destroyed irreplaceable pristine desert habitat along with numerous rare plant species,\" Dowell said. \u201cWhile the Sierra Club strongly supports innovative clean energy solutions and recognizes the urgent need to transition away from fossil fuels, Ivanpah demonstrated that not all renewable technologies are created equal.\u201d",
      "There were other early problems. After its much-hyped opening, the plant didn\u2019t produce as much electricity as expected for a simple reason: the sun wasn\u2019t shining as much as expected.",
      "The plant can be a startling sight for drivers heading toward Las Vegas from Southern California along busy Interstate 15. Amid miles of rock and scrub, its vast array of mirrors can create the image of a shimmering lake atop the desert floor, but depending on the angle of the sun and mirrors, it could also be blinding.",
      "If the PG&E agreement is approved, NRG said the units will be decommissioned, \u201cproviding an opportunity for the site to potentially be repurposed for renewable (photovoltaic) energy production.\u201d The company did not respond to questions about the projected cost or what would become of the equipment at the site."

      "Trump also picked Burgum to chair a new National Energy Council that's tasked with achieving American \u201cenergy dominance.\u201d He would have a seat on the National Security Council \u2014 a first for the interior secretary.",
      "His directive from Trump is to make it even easier for energy companies to tap fossil fuel resources, including from public lands. That raised alarms among environmentalists and some Democrats as greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels bake the planet.",
      "Burgum eagerly assisted the energy industry during his time as governor, when he was also profiting from the lease of family land to oil companies, according to records obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "During his confirmation hearing, Burgum said the U.S. can use energy development as leverage to promote peace and to lower consumer costs.",
      "He raised concerns about the reliability of renewable power sources promoted under former President Joe Biden, and said the U.S. needs to generate more electricity from sources such as coal and nuclear that can run constantly.",
      "Democrats in response accused the Trump administration of abandoning an \u201call of the above\u201d energy policy to favor fossil fuels.",

      "Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate, said Burgum would rightfully prioritize energy innovation over regulation.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s going to take the common-sense action of unlocking our lands for oil and for gas production,\u201d Barrasso said. He added that more than 600,000 acres of land in Wyoming have been approved for energy production but were not offered for development by the Biden administration.",
      "The U.S. currently produces more crude oil than any nation in history, according to the Energy Information Administration. More cost-effective technology in recent decades drove drilling booms in states including New Mexico, Texas and North Dakota, where vast expanses of rural farmland have been industrialized by oil and gas companies.",
      "The booms brought billions of dollars in tax revenue to state and federal governments. But burning those fuels is also unleashing immense volumes of carbon dioxide that scientists say is warming the planet.",
      "The Interior Department has jurisdiction over a half-billion acres of federal land and vast areas offshore. Those areas produce about one-quarter of U.S. oil annually.",
      "The interior secretary also oversees the National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management and other subagencies.",
      "Burgum succeeds Deb Haaland, who under Biden sharply scaled back oil and gas sales and promoted solar and wind projects on federal lands.",
      "Trump made energy development a centerpiece of his first term and is again vowing to abolish restrictions on the industry that are intended to protect the environment and public health.",
      "Burgum, during his hearing earlier this month before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee, suggested to lawmakers that carbon dioxide from fossil fuels could be captured to neutralize their contribution to global warming.",
      "Carbon-capture skeptics say the technology is untested at scale and allows the fossil-fuel industry to continue largely unchanged even as climate change becomes increasingly urgent.",
      "During Haaland's tenure at the Interior Department, officials also reversed actions taken during Trump's first term that weakened protections for imperiled species while making it easier for private developers to pursue projects on public lands.",
      "Republicans in Congress have said they plan to again seek changes to rules on endangered species and they want Burgum to help.",
      "Burgum says federal lands can be used for many purposes including recreation, logging and oil and gas production that can lift local economies.",

    "story": [
      "Tennessee lawmakers have approved legislation drastically expanding the number of families who can use taxpayer money on private schools regardless of income",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Tennessee lawmakers on Thursday approved legislation drastically expanding the number of families who can use taxpayer money on private schools regardless of income, a long-sought victory for Republican Gov. Bill Lee with some help from President Donald Trump to win over GOP holdouts.",
      "The bill heads to Lee for his almost-certain signature. Tennessee would join a dozen other states that have eliminated traditional strict income requirements for families seeking to access public dollars to fund alternatives to public education for their children.",
      "Under Tennessee's proposal, 20,000 education vouchers of around $7,000 each would become available next year. Half of those would go to students who are lower income, disabled or otherwise able to participate in the new voucher program, but any student entitled to attend a public school could access the remaining 10,000.",
      "Thursday's House and Senate approval occurred within a session specially called by Lee, allowing him to narrowly focus lawmakers' attention instead of waiting for action during the ongoing, monthslong regular session covering all kinds of topics. The special session began Monday.",
      "Trump weighed in on social media Tuesday. He praised Tennessee lawmakers for \u201cworking hard to pass School Choice this week, which I totally support.\u201d Additionally, the Trump administration told the U.S. Education Department to use discretionary money to prioritize school choice programs and give states new guidance on how they can use federal money to support K-12 voucher programs.",
      "The head of the conservative Club for Growth, which is running TV ads lauding the voucher plan, also warned Republican lawmakers that they would fund primary election challengers to try to defeat anyone who opposes the bill.",
      "Supporters have repeatedly argued expanding school choice is critical to supporting parental rights and giving families the best options for their children. At the Republican National Convention, Lee even called school choice the \u201ccivil rights issue of our time.\"",
      "Yet Democrats, who hold only a sliver of power in Tennessee but led the charge on publicly questioning the governor\u2019s voucher plan, repeatedly pointed out this week the unexpected costs that have popped up in other states and stressed that the legislation would largely benefit wealthy families who don\u2019t need the financial assistance. Legislative analysts assume about two-thirds of the vouchers will go to students already attending private schools.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake, this is welfare for the wealthy,\u201d said Democratic Rep. John Ray Clemmons during Thursday's floor debate.",
      "Republicans have defended the lax income limits, arguing parents need more choices, regardless of wealth.",
      "\u201cAs the sponsor of this legislation, I\u2019ve never once said that this was a program designed for disadvantaged families,\u201d GOP Sen. Jack Johnson said.",
      "The push to expand school vouchers comes as Republicans across the country have increased their criticisms of public schools in recent years. They have said some public schools were too slow to reopen in the COVID-19 pandemic, sought to limit what public schools can teach about race and sexuality, and adopted laws and rules banning transgender athletes in school sports.",
      "Yet when presented directly to voters, school choice expansion efforts have faltered. Last election, Kentucky voters rejected a measure to enable public funding for private school attendance, and Nebraska voters partially repealed a law that uses taxpayer money to subsidize private education. A proposed constitutional amendment in Colorado that would have established schoolchildren\u2019s \u201cright to school choice\u201d also was defeated.",
      "In Tennessee, multiple local school boards passed resolutions stating their opposition to Lee's voucher plan. Teachers and students flocked to the Capitol this week, holding signs and yelling out as lawmakers walked into floor sessions pleading with them not to gut public education dollars. On Thursday, some protesters handed out fake money labeled \u201cvoucher scam bribe.\"",
      "Another sticking point was the large amount of testimony from families of students who have learning disabilities pointing out that private schools can and do reject students with certain impairments. A last-minute amendment that would have prohibited private schools from discriminating against students with disabilities was rejected from the House.",
      "Since taking office in 2019, Lee has narrowly won efforts to create a school voucher program for low-income families in three counties. But last year, Lee failed to win enough support to launch a statewide school voucher program no longer based on income.",
      "For the upcoming budget year, more than $400 million would be set aside for the voucher plan that folds in other education initiatives. One of those add-ons is $172 million for one-time bonuses of $2,000 for teachers.",
      "In order to receive it, however, a local school board would have to pass a resolution opting in to the bonus section of the voucher bill. The requirement was added after a number of school boards passed resolutions broadly opposing vouchers.",
      "Legislative budget analysts project the legislation will cost $190.8 million annually in future years.",
      "While Republicans touted their focus on adding billions of dollars to K-12 education in recent years, Democrats noted that Tennessee ranks near the bottom of all states in per-pupil funding for K-12 education."

      "The Van\u2019s RV-10 attempted to make an emergency landing shortly after takeoff on Jan. 2 from Fullerton Municipal Airport, south of Los Angeles. The crash killed the pilot and his teenage daughter and injured 19 people inside a furniture manufacturing business.",

      "Investigators cite witness statements and a car's dashcam video of the moments before the crash. The NTSB typically releases preliminary findings within weeks of a plane crash, and a final report comes months later.",
      "One witness at the airport said he noticed the plane seemed to be flying \u201cat a lower altitude than he would have expected considering its distance down the runway.\u201d He also said the aircraft's left door was open and up, according to the report.",
      "\u201cHe then saw an arm reach up and pull the door down. By this time the airplane was far enough away that he could no longer discern what was happening,\u201d the report said.",
      "Witnesses from a different vantage point described seeing the plane \"flying lower than normal and banking aggressively left,\" prompting concern it might stall.",
      "\"The airplane then rolled right as its nose dropped, and dove towards the warehouse where it collided in a fireball,\" the report said. The witnesses stated that just before impact they saw a white, panel-like piece fall from the plane.",
      "Moments after takeoff, the pilot told the air traffic control tower: \u201cImmediate landing required.\u201d",
      "He initially said he planned to land on Runway 6. The air traffic controller responded by saying either that strip or Runway 24 were available. The pilot chose Runway 24. Moments later, panicked gasping and an \u201cOh my God\u201d could be heard just before the audio went quiet.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration said at the time that the aircraft asked for a return to the airport at about 900 feet (274 meters). It crashed about 1,000 feet (305 meters) short of Runway 24, hitting a sprawling warehouse owned by Michael Nicholas Designs.",
      "The plane's two occupants, pilot Pascal Reid and his 16-year-old daughter Kelly, were killed. Eleven people on the ground were taken to hospitals, while eight were treated at the scene, police said. The injuries ranged from minor to very serious.",
      "The single-engine, four-seat Van\u2019s RV-10 is a popular home-built airplane sold in kit form. Investigators said Reid owned the aircraft, which was built in 2011."

      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- The small Oregon city at the heart of a major U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year that allowed cities across the country to enforce homeless camping bans is facing a fresh lawsuit over its camping rules as advocates find new ways to challenge them.",
      "Disability Rights Oregon sued Grants Pass on Thursday, accusing it of violating a state law requiring cities\u2019 camping regulations to be \u201cobjectively reasonable.\u201d",
      "The city did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Last June's Supreme Court ruling made the southern Oregon mountain town of 40,000 the unlikely face of the nation's homelessness crisis. It ushered in a new era of homeless policy by allowing cities from San Francisco to New York to ban sleeping outside and fine people for doing so, even when there aren't enough shelter beds.",
      "In Grants Pass \u2014 where officials have struggled for years to address a homelessness crisis that has divided residents \u2014 the decision paved the way for the new mayor and City Council members elected in November to crack down on camping upon taking office.",
      "The high court decision overturned a ruling from a California-based appeals court that found camping bans when shelter space is lacking amounted to cruel and unusual punishment under the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment. It enabled Grants Pass to enforce local ordinances barring camping on city property such as parks and sidewalks.",
      "Grants Pass has just one overnight shelter for adults \u2014 the Gospel Rescue Mission \u2014 and its rules requiring attendance at religious services and barring pets, alcohol, drugs and smoking mean many won\u2019t stay there.",
      "After the ruling was issued, the City Council designated two city-owned properties as the areas where the town's hundreds of homeless people would be allowed to stay.",
      "But last week, the new council closed the larger of the two campsites \u2014 which housed roughly 120 tents, the complaint says \u2014 and made the remaining smaller one only open from 5 p.m. to 7 a.m., forcing people to pack up their belongings every morning and carry them throughout the day with no place where they can legally set down their things.",
      "\u201cIt wants to make being homeless in Grants Pass so unpleasant that people go elsewhere,\u201d Disability Rights Oregon said of the city in its complaint. \u201cDespite the presence of numerous elderly, ill, and disabled people on site, the city increased its draconian restrictions in the dead of winter leaving hundreds of people with no legal option for their continued survival.\u201d",
      "Five homeless people with disabilities who live in Grants Pass are named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit. They include people who use wheelchairs and canes, as well as people suffering from the aftermath of a stroke or missing part of their limbs, according to the complaint.",
      "The complaint says the camping restrictions discriminate against people with disabilities and violate state law, which states that cities' rules regarding when, where and how homeless people can sleep or keep warm and dry outdoors must be \u201cobjectively reasonable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe City has discriminated against people with disabilities by imposing standards for participation in its camping program that require people to move themselves and their own belongings frequently and for no good purpose,\u201d the complaint says. \u201cPeople with physical disabilities affecting their movement or chronic illnesses that make frequent lifting, carrying, and walking distances difficult or impossible have been and will be cited and prosecuted for violating city ordinances regarding camping.\u201d",
      "Disability Rights Oregon is asking the court to block the city from enforcing its camping rules.",
      "Homelessness continues to be a nationwide crisis. Last year, it increased 18% in a dramatic rise driven mostly by a lack of affordable housing as well as devastating natural disasters and a surge of migrants in several parts of the country."

      "In 2019, LaSota and three others were arrested while protesting an event hosted by the Center for Applied Rationality at a camping retreat in Occidental, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. In 2022, two of the others, Emma Borhanian and Jeffrey Leatham, were accused of attacking their landlord with a sword in Vallejo, California. The landlord, Curtis Lind, survived the November 2022 attack but was stabbed to death Jan. 17.",
      "Maximilian Snyder was charged this week with that murder. In November, someone with the same name applied for a marriage license with a Teresa Youngblut in Kirkland, Washington. Snyder's attorney declined to comment on the charges.",
      "Though authorities have not publicly identified the person who bought the gun used in Vermont, the VTDigger news site reported that federal authorities issued an alert to firearms dealers seeking information about purchases made by Michelle Jacqueline Zajko and describing her as a person of interest in the Vermont shooting.",
      "According to a public records database, a Michelle Zajko was registered to vote in 2016 at the same home address in Pennsylvania as Richard and Rita Zajko. In 2021, a Michelle Zajko bought a half-acre piece of property in Derby, Vermont, a few miles (about 6 kilometers) from the Canadian border. According to town records, the land is undeveloped."

    "story": [
      "The FBI has recorded a sharp spike in complaints that its own agents and employees have engaged in sexual misconduct, ranging from assault to harassment, despite a pledge by the bureau\u2019s leaders to eliminate the longstanding problem",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The FBI has recorded a sharp spike in complaints that its own agents and employees have engaged in sexual misconduct, ranging from assault to harassment, despite a pledge by bureau leaders to eliminate the longstanding problem.",
      "An Associated Press investigation found the FBI has received nearly 300 allegations of sexual misconduct since the bureau announced in 2021 it had launched an agency-wide crackdown.",
      "The number marked a nearly 50% increase over complaints filed during the preceding four-year period, according to bureau statistics, an increase advocates and lawmakers described as a sign the bureau is struggling to protect women in a male-dominated workplace. The FBI, for its part, said the increase shows its reforms are making it easier to report misconduct.",
      "\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Iowa Republican, told the AP in a statement, adding he\u2019ll be using his role as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee \u201cto get answers and root out further FBI misconduct.\u201d He blamed former FBI Director Christopher Wray for allowing \u201cthe problem of sexual misconduct at the FBI to fester.\u201d",
      "The FBI told AP it takes allegations of sexual misconduct \u201cextremely seriously\u201d and acts upon them \u201cexpeditiously.\u201d Bureau officials have attributed the spike in complaints, in part, to their outreach efforts.",
      "\u201cWe have come a long way in addressing it in various ways using all the policy tools and legal means at our disposal,\u201d the FBI said in a statement, \u201cbut we absolutely have more to do in accomplishing a meaningful and long-lasting cultural evolution that honors FBI Director Wray\u2019s commitment to eradicating sexual misconduct throughout the organization.\u201d",
      "The FBI declined to provide details about the incidents, citing federal privacy laws and internal guidelines. A monthslong AP investigation, however, revealed that the incidents ranged from sexual assault to agents paying for sex at massage parlors. Other allegations concerned agents making inappropriate sexual comments at office functions or commenting on co-workers\u2019 appearances.",
      "Some allegations were so serious they resulted in criminal investigations or charges. Late last year, an FBI agent in Maryland, Eduardo Valdivia, 40, was charged with sexually assaulting two women he contacted through social media with a promise to give them free tattoos and modeling work. His defense attorney, Robert Bonsib, said Valdivia disputes \u201call allegations that he engaged in any criminal conduct and expects to be cleared of all charges.\u201d",
      "The victims usually were agency employees, though others were women whom agents came across during investigations or met socially. At least a dozen sexual misconduct allegations involved supervisors, the AP found, including at least one top agent.",
      "The FBI determined more than half of the claims warranted internal investigations, statistics show, though the bureau refused to disclose how many resulted in terminations or other discipline.",
      "The AP\u2019s findings come at a moment of significant upheaval in the FBI. Wray, a Republican appointed by then-President Donald Trump in 2017, spent years under withering attacks for various investigations involving Trump. Rather than be fired, Wray stepped down a day before Trump took office on Jan. 20.",
      "Trump has tapped Kash Patel, a strident supporter and former federal prosecutor, to take over as the next director of the FBI. Patel's spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment on how he would tackle the issue of sexual misconduct. His confirmation hearing is scheduled for Thursday.",
      "While Trump and Patel have focused almost exclusively on claims of political weaponization and biased probes in their promises to overhaul the bureau, some lawmakers see the FBI\u2019s record on sexual misconduct as another compelling reason to clean house.",
      "Last year, the Justice Department agreed to pay more than $22 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging female FBI recruits had been routinely harassed by instructors with sexually charged comments about their breast size, false allegations of infidelity and the need to take contraception \u201cto control their moods.\u201d",
      "In interviews, more than a dozen current and former FBI agents said that male-dominated culture would be the hardest to change. A former analyst who once aspired to become the bureau\u2019s first female director said she intentionally gained 30 pounds hoping a harasser would stop \u201ctalking about my body.\u201d",
      "She\u2019d give away clothing that became triggering because she\u2019d worn it when she was harassed. \u201cI would throw up in the office and have panic attacks in the stairway whenever I saw him,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI came very close to suicide twice.\u201d",
      "Victims, several of whom spoke on the condition they not be named, and advocates told AP that many women remain reluctant to come forward for fear of retaliation. They also lack confidence in the FBI\u2019s investigations and too often have seen agents, including high-ranking ones, receive what they consider to be mild discipline. Others retire before they can be punished.",
      "The FBI has spent the last decade seeking to address its masculine culture, in part by boosting its number of female agents. Nearly a quarter of the bureau\u2019s 13,700 agents are women, the bureau says, a number slightly higher than the percentage of women in senior agent ranks.",
      "The FBI said it has made a series of reforms to its processes, training and disciplinary reviews, including creating a 24/7 hotline to report abuse. Those changes were implemented after the AP exposed a pattern of senior FBI officials skirting discipline and retiring even after internal inquiries determined they committed brazen misconduct, including a senior official who harassed eight female subordinates.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether that approach will continue under the Trump administration, which has moved quickly to halt diversity, equity and inclusion efforts across the federal government.",
      "FBI misconduct investigations are shrouded in secrecy, and federal privacy laws obscure the public\u2019s view of which agents face discipline. The government typically will not reveal where an incident took place, even if the claims are substantiated. The AP relied on Freedom of Information Act requests and interviews with nearly two dozen current and former law enforcement officials to flesh out details about the allegations and the resulting investigations.",
      "For scores of allegations it did not investigate, the bureau said it \u201clacked sufficient detail to predicate an investigation\u201d or couldn\u2019t pinpoint a specific code of conduct violation. Other investigations resulted in suspensions, transfers or firings, FBI officials said.",
      "The FBI does not disclose how it disciplines specific agents or supervisors, but the AP reviewed internal records in a few cases that showed how some were punished.",
      "An unidentified supervisor, for example, was fired last year for suggesting his female colleagues had become managers by performing sex acts, the records show. And an FBI boss was suspended 60 days for \u201cunwelcome sexual conduct\u201d at a work event.",
      "In another case, the AP was not able to determine how a senior official was disciplined even after he admitted to wrongdoing. The official, an acting deputy assistant director, admitted he simulated anal sex on a colleague while acting out a graphic joke about predatory priests in the Roman Catholic Church, according to a 2023 report by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general.",
      "\u201cThis is going to be bad,\u201d the agent told colleagues before closing an office door, according to the report. He then performed two wrestling holds on the mortified coworker before landing his punch line.",
      "The agent told investigators he only thrust his genitals once at the colleague and never touched him. He admitted it was inappropriate, the report says, telling investigators he \u201cshouldn\u2019t have told the joke in an office setting.\u201d",
      "Sexual misconduct investigations can be difficult to resolve, and the alleged behavior frequently happens behind closed doors.",
      "In some instances, investigators were not able to substantiate underlying allegations but nevertheless found agents violated related policies or acted unprofessionally. That was the case involving allegations that a supervisor raped an intoxicated woman in a Washington hotel room \u2014 an accusation he denied.",
      "The woman in that case reported to police that Shannon Fontenot met her at a bar when she was already heavily intoxicated and, even after noticing her wedding ring, invited her back to his room, where he opened his wallet and showed her his FBI identification, records show. Fontenot, an assistant special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Springfield, Illinois, field office, had been on assignment in Washington.",
      "Testifying in a civil proceeding in which she unsuccessfully sought a protective order against Fontenot, the woman described the night as \u201cevery woman\u2019s worst nightmare.\u201d She said Fontenot appeared to be a \u201csafe person\u201d and accept her limits, only to wait until she was drunk enough to take advantage of her. She said she had more than a half-dozen drinks and was so intoxicated she nearly walked into a wall.",
      "\u201cI think of FBI agents as our most elite law enforcement officers in the country,\u201d she testified in that civil case. \u201cTo use your position like that is horrifically scary, and it is a huge betrayal of not only my trust, but public trust. It\u2019s awful.\u201d",
      "The AP is not naming the woman because it does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual abuse.",
      "Fontenot testified the encounter was entirely consensual and that the woman did not appear intoxicated.",
      "Federal prosecutors decided not to charge him, saying they could not prove the woman\u2019s claim. The Justice Department\u2019s inspector general also did not substantiate the sexual assault allegations but determined he violated FBI rules in failing to disclose to his superiors that he was under police investigation, government records show.",
      "The FBI confirmed it suspended Fontenot for 10 days and later transferred him to a non-supervisory role at its Washington headquarters. It refused to say when he was transferred.",
      "\u201cThe incident in question was thoroughly investigated, and it was unequivocally determined that no form of sexual misconduct occurred,\u201d Fontenot\u2019s attorney, Mark Rollins, told AP.",
      "Another misconduct investigation involved the agency\u2019s then-No. 3 official who was accused by a subordinate of having \u201cengaged in sexual harassment,\u201d the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general reported.",
      "The employee reported a raft of comments and actions by Jeff Sallet that she described as violating the agency\u2019s sexual harassment policies, though investigators determined, in a lengthy report, that they were not sexual in nature.",
      "Among those the woman found most offensive: Sallet \u2014 who at the time oversaw the bureau\u2019s human resources branch \u2014 allegedly suggested her mother was disappointed she wasn\u2019t \u201cbarefoot and pregnant,\u201d according to the report. In another instance he invited her to join his friend's \u201charem.\u201d",
      "In the moment insurrectionists bore down on the U.S. Capitol, the woman alleged, Sallet looked down from his FBI office window onto Pennsylvania Avenue and asked her, \u201cHow many of those guys are you thinking you\u2019d like to date. That isn\u2019t your type is it?\u201d",
      "The woman also complained Sallet sexually harassed her in part by suggesting they conduct a conference call together in his hotel room on a work trip. \u201cI felt that Sallet was pressuring me to be alone with him in a hotel room,\u201d she wrote in a declaration for an unrelated court case by a former FBI agent seeking disciplinary records related to Sallet. She added that \"we did not need to be physically together for the meeting and none of our co-workers were at the hotel.\u201d",
      "Sallet told the inspector general he did not recall where the call took place but that it would not have been \u201cstrange or odd\u201d to have such a call in his hotel room.",
      "Investigators concluded Sallet \u201cviolated the Department\u2019s zero tolerance policy on harassment by making five inappropriate comments to the subordinate employee,\u201d the inspector general said. \u201cNone of the allegations involved unwelcome touching, and the independent investigation did not find that any of the substantiated conduct was sexual in nature.\u201d",
      "The report added that Sallet was also found to have acted \u201cunprofessionally\u201d in accordance with FBI policies.",
      "Sallet retired in 2021 before the investigation was completed. He has denied the allegations and his attorney, Doug Brooks, noted he was \u201ccleared of all allegations of sexual harassment.\u201d",
      "\u201cJeff Sallet had an honorable and distinguished career at the FBI,\u201d Brooks wrote in an email, adding he had provided his \u201cfull cooperation\u201d to the inspector general investigation. \u201cIt is important to highlight that there were never any allegations of unwelcome (or any) touching made against Mr. Sallet.\u201d",
      "Advocates expressed frustration at the lack of transparency in such cases and blasted the FBI for meting out relatively light punishment to those it has found to have engaged in sexual misconduct.",
      "\u201cWhen high-ranking officials in particular face no meaningful consequences for abusive conduct, it sends the message that anyone is free to act with impunity,\u201d said Stacey Young, co-founder of the DOJ Gender Equality Network, an employee advocacy group that persuaded the Justice Department to adopt a new department-wide sexual misconduct policy.",
      "Other advocates and female agents applauded the bureau for taking steps to address sexual misconduct. But they said it needed to go further to assure victims that their claims were being taken seriously.",
      "Martha Johnson, a recently retired FBI agent who says she was sexually assaulted by an agent many years ago while working in Chicago, said the bureau\u2019s internal processes for reporting sexual abuse have long been set up to doubt and punish victims.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re patting themselves on the back, but the environment is still the same in that women are too afraid to even use a hotline,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this scenario play out over and over for 20 years. They didn\u2019t change anything.\u201d",

      "Tulsi Gabbard, President Donald Trump's pick to be director of national intelligence, is set to go before lawmakers Thursday for a confirmation hearing likely to focus on some of her past views on Russia and Syria",
      "WASHINGTON -- Tulsi Gabbard, President Donald Trump's pick to be director of national intelligence, is expected to face tough questions from lawmakers Thursday over past comments about Russia and a 2017 visit with Syria's now-deposed leader.",
      "The back-and-forth during Gabbard's confirmation hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee could reveal whether she has successfully assuaged concerns from lawmakers of both parties \u2014 or whether worries about her experience and background will sink her nomination to oversee 18 U.S. intelligence agencies.",
      "Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, is a lieutenant colonel in the National Guard who deployed twice to the Middle East and ran for president in 2020. She has no formal intelligence experience, however, and has never run a government agency or department.",
      "It's Gabbard's comments, however, that have posed the biggest challenge to her confirmation. Gabbard has repeatedly echoed Russian propaganda used to justify the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine and criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a corrupt autocrat.",
      "She's been accused of spreading Russian disinformation by Republican lawmakers and has even won praise in Russian state-controlled media.",
      "A 2017 visit with Syrian President Bashar Assad is another point of contention. Assad was recently deposed as his country's leader following a brutal civil war in which he was accused of using chemical weapons. Following her visit, Gabbard faced criticism that she was legitimizing a dictator and then more questions when she said she was skeptical that Assad had used chemical weapons.",
      "As a lawmaker, Gabbard sponsored legislation that would have repealed a key surveillance program known as Section 702, which allows authorities to collect the communications of suspected terrorists overseas.",
      "Gabbard said the program could be violating the rights of Americans whose communications are swept up inadvertently, but national security officials say the program has saved lives.",
      "She now says she supports the program, noting new safeguards designed to protect Americans' privacy.",
      "While lawmakers from both parties have raised concerns about Gabbard's nomination, Republicans have increasingly come to support her. Given thin Republican margins in the Senate, she will need almost all GOP senators to vote yes in order to win confirmation.",
      "Sen. Tom Cotton, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that while he understands there are questions about Gabbard's past views, questions about her loyalty to the U.S. are inappropriate.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s passed five different background checks. I reviewed the latest one. It\u2019s clean as a whistle,\u201d the Arkansas Republican said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s fine for people to have policy differences and ask questions about those differences.

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Kash Patel, President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the FBI, will encounter deeply skeptical questioning from Democratic senators Thursday about his loyalty to the president and stated desire to overhaul the bureau as he faces a high-stakes hearing that will help determine his path toward confirmation.",
      "Patel, a Trump loyalist who has railed against the FBI over its investigations into the president and claimed that Jan. 6 rioters were mistreated by the Justice Department, was picked in November to replace Christopher Wray, who led the nation's premier federal law enforcement agency for more than seven years.",
      "A former aide to the House Intelligence Committee and an ex-federal prosecutor who served in Trump's first administration, Patel has alarmed critics with rhetoric \u2014 in dozens of podcasts and books he has authored \u2014 in which he has demonstrated fealty to Trump, lambasted the decision-making of the agency he's now been asked to lead and identified by name officials he believes should be investigated.",
      "In one such podcast interview last year, he said that if he were in charge of the FBI, he would \u201cshut down\u201d the bureau\u2019s headquarters building on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., and \u201creopen it the next day as a museum of the \u2018deep state.\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201cI\u2019m deeply concerned about his fitness to serve as FBI Director. He has neither the experience, the judgment, nor the temperament to head this critical agency,\u201d Durbin said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "Utah leaders, locals and longtime attendees of the Sundance Film Festival are making their final push to keep the world-renowned independent film festival in the state as its directors consider uprooting it",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- With the 2025 Sundance Film Festival underway, Utah leaders, locals and longtime attendees are making a final push \u2014 that could include paying millions of dollars \u2014 to keep the world-renowned film festival as its directors consider uprooting.",
      "Thousands of festivalgoers affixed bright yellow stickers to their winter coats that read \u201cKeep Sundance in Utah\" in a last-ditch effort to convince festival leadership and state officials to keep it in Park City, its home of 41 years.",
      "Gov. Spencer Cox said previously that Utah would not throw as much money at the festival as other states hoping to lure it away. Now his office is urging the Legislature to carve out $3 million for Sundance in the state budget, weeks before the independent film festival is expected to pick a home for the next decade.",
      "It could retain a small presence in picturesque Park City and center itself in nearby Salt Lake City, or move to another finalist \u2014 Cincinnati, Ohio, or Boulder, Colorado \u2014 beginning in 2027.",
      "\u201cSundance is Utah, and Utah is Sundance. You can\u2019t really separate those two,\" Cox said. \u201cThis is your home, and we desperately hope it will be your home forever.\"",
      "Festival Director Eugene Hernandez told reporters last week that they had not made a final decision. An announcement is expected this year by early spring.",
      "Colorado is trying to further sweeten its offer. The state is considering legislation giving up to $34 million in tax incentives to film festivals like Sundance through 2036 \u2014 on top of the $1.5 million in funds already approved to lure the Utah festival to its neighboring state.",
      "Cincinnati approved a resolution allocating $2.5 million to Sundance if festival leaders relocate to southwest Ohio. Yet money may not be the ultimate draw.",
      "Sundance leaders say the festival has outgrown the ski town it helped put on the map decades ago, and they worry it has developed an air of exclusivity that takes the focus away from the films. An ideal home would make Sundance more centralized, affordable and accessible to all who appreciate independent film.",
      "Some festivalgoers and industry leaders worry Sundance would lose its identity outside its idyllic mountain hometown.",
      "Roger and Carin Ehrenberg, major donors to the festival, said they would stop attending regularly if the festival was outside Utah. Sundance is a \u201cmagical experience\u201d for the New York City philanthropists, they said, due in large part to the atmosphere in Park City.",
      "\u201cIf it goes to Cincinnati, maybe once in a blue moon we would go, but it wouldn't be a regular thing,\" Carin Ehrenberg said. \u201cFor us, it\u2019ll lose its appeal.\u201d",
      "The couple said they would likely continue to donate even if they did not attend.",
      "Nineteen years of fond memories at Sundance helped inspire Dr. Rhonda Taubin to relocate her family from Atlanta to Heber City \u2014 Park City's neighboring town. She has no ties to the film industry but has become a fervent advocate for keeping the festival in her new home state.",
      "This year, she and her friends distributed thousands of \u201cKeep Sundance in Utah\u201d stickers \u2014 and another that read \u201cNOhio for Sundance\u201d \u2014 to show the festival how much it means to the local community.",
      "\u201cI really am not a movie buff, but my other girlfriends are, and being able to share all that we've been through as women, as mothers, as wives, as daughters, I don't want it to end,\u201d Taubin said. \u201cWe watch provocative movies that make us talk and think about things that maybe we've never thought about before. Utah would be at a huge loss without those conversations.\u201d",
      "If Sundance stays in Utah, the festival\u2019s former director John Cooper said major adjustments are needed to improve transportation between Salt Lake City and Park City and make lodging for filmmakers more affordable.",
      "Cooper, who led the festival from 2009 to 2020, said he would be sad to see Sundance shift away from actor and filmmaker Robert Redford's original vision. Its very name comes from Redford's character in the 1969 film \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt like my role was to be a keeper of the flame for Robert Redford and his legacy,\" Cooper told The Associated Press. \u201cThe mountains of Utah, this was his vision. It\u2019s weird to say \u2018Sundance in Ohio.\u2019 But I think it could go anywhere. What it does for a community is so strong.\u201d",
      "On the red carpet this week, many were split on whether Sundance should stay or go.",
      "Actor Elijah Wood urged the festival to remain in Park City, saying the location is part of its DNA.",
      "Others were open to it relocating. Actor Tessa Thompson, who serves on the Sundance Institute's board of trustees, said the festival could maintain its identity in a new city.",
      "\u201cI think that Sundance has more to do with the spirit and community, and I think that's evergreen,\" Thompson said. \"Regardless of where Sundance is, Sundance will always be.\u201d"

    "summary": "A civil jury has ruled that Louisiana parish officials who threatened to arrest and imprison an environmental activist while she attempted to speak during a public meeting did not violate the First Amendment",
    "story": [
      "A civil jury has ruled that Louisiana parish officials who threatened to arrest and imprison an environmental activist while she attempted to speak during a public meeting did not violate the First Amendment",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Louisiana parish officials who threatened to arrest and imprison an environmental activist as she attempted to speak during a public meeting did not violate her right to freedom of speech, a unanimous civil jury ruled Wednesday.",
      "Joy Banner had sought more than $2 million in damages from two St. John the Baptist parish officials \u2014 Parish President Jaclyn Hotard and councilmember Michael Wright \u2014 who she said blocked her from raising allegations of corruption tied to industrial development at a public meeting. While Banner's attorneys said the case had important implications for protecting outspoken citizens from government censorship, lawyers representing the parish said they were model officials trying to curtail disruption and keep the meeting on track.",
      "The case is part of a broader series of disputes playing out in courts and public hearings between grassroots community groups and Louisiana officials over industrial expansion in the 85-mile (136-kilometer) chemical corridor between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, often referred to by environmental activists as \u201cCancer Alley\" because of its high pollution levels.",
      "Banner, co-founder of the environmental and racial justice organization The Descendants Project, gained a national reputation fighting against an $800 million grain terminal slated for her predominantly Black community in St. John the Baptist parish. The project was later aborted.",
      "In a November 2023 parish council meeting, Banner sought to oppose an agenda item introduced by Hotard to use taxpayer funds for a lawyer to defend parish officials from ethics complaints. The state ethics board had launched an investigation after Banner filed a complaint pointing out that Hotard\u2019s mother-in-law, Darla Gaudet, owned a marine transport company that owned land near the proposed site for the grain terminal.",
      "As Banner began to discuss these concerns during the public comment period, councilmember Michael Wright repeatedly banged his gavel and both he and Hotard told Banner she was not speaking on topic as she made her remarks.",
      "Wright then quoted from an obsolete law under which anyone who publicly shared testimony given to a state ethics board investigation could be subject to one year of imprisonment. A federal judge deemed the law unconstitutional years ago.",
      "\u201cWhen I heard the words imprisonment and misdemeanor, I thought, 'That's it, I'm going to jail, I've messed everything up, my business is going to be ruined, my name is going to be ruined.' I was terrified and shocked,\" Banner later testified.",
      "Ike Spears, the parish officials' attorney, noted that they had also interrupted and instructed to stay on topic other members of the public who spoke during the public comment period. He described Banner as a \u201cdisruptive citizen\u201d striving to become a \u201csocial media influencer\u201d and garner media attention from the litigation.",
      "\u201cShe wants us to reward this conduct with $2 million plus,\u201d Spears told jurors.",
      "Banner's attorney William Most countered that her intended comments at the public meeting were \u201cvital\u201d to informing the parish about Hotard's potential conflicts of interest.",
      "\u201cJoy Banner was treated differently than anyone else: She was the only person threatened with arrest and she was also the only one to raise the issue of Hotard's family business interests,\u201d Most said. \u201cShe was directly on topic.\"",
      "Hotard also used vitriolic language to describe Banner, including fantasizing about strangling her, in text messages to her mother-in-law that were introduced as evidence. Most said the messages indicated that Hotard had a personal motivation to shut down Banner's participation in a public meeting.",
      "The state ethics board ruled last year that Hotard had not violated state ethics laws.",
      "Yet Hotard's mother-in-law later revealed during a deposition for Banner's lawsuit that Hotard's husband is a beneficiary of a trust that owned land overlapping with the planned railroad route leading into the proposed grain terminal.",
      "Spears acknowledged that Hotard would \u201cprobably\u201d personally benefit from the grain terminal's approval. But he said increased tax revenue and good-paying jobs were the parish president's driving motivation in supporting the project.",
      "Hotard, who was not present for the verdict, did not respond to an emailed request for comment.",
      "The jury sent a \u201cstrong message against frivolous lawsuits,\u201d Wright said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press. \u201cThis is a significant victory for St. John Parish and a promising sign for businesses and industries considering the River Parishes as their home.\u201d",
      "Juror Cam Owen said he was ready to vote in Banner's favor following closing arguments. He changed his mind \u2014 and came to tears during deliberations \u2014 after closely reviewing the facts and video footage of the public meeting, which he described as the \u201cdeciding factor\" for the jury. Owen said jurors calculated the amount of time Banner was able to speak and concluded she was able to express most of her viewpoint.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, you know, they did try to stop her, but she did actually say what she had to say,\u201d Owen said.",
      "The jury also ruled that the parish had not violated Louisiana's open meetings law.",
      "Banner said she had no regrets about bringing the lawsuit and said it uncovered the parish president's hidden financial interests.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of this case was for transparency,\u201d Banner said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to hold people accountable for the things that we feel are wrong.\u201d",
      "\u201cI hope you can heal,\u201d Eastern District of Louisiana Judge Nannette Jolivette Brown told Banner and the parish officials after the verdict. \u201cThis is only one part of the process.\u201d",

      "The wife of a 72-year-old veteran who was beaten to death by a cellmate in an Alabama jail has filed a civil rights lawsuit against three deputies working at the Macon County jail",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- The wife of a 72-year-old veteran who was beaten to death by a cellmate in an Alabama jail filed a civil rights lawsuit Wednesday against three deputies working at the jail, alleging that the officers ignored his pleas for help.",
      "Attorneys for the wife of John Reed say the deputies working at the Macon County jail that morning in October were made aware of the assault but ignored his cries and need for medical attention. Reed required a wheelchair and 24-hour oxygen for a lung disease.",
      "The three deputies named as defendants entered the holding cell where Reed was injured and neglected to separate him from the cellmate during the attack, according to the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the worst cases of prison neglect that I\u2019ve seen,\u201d said civil rights attorney Bakari Sellers, who is representing Reed's wife, Regene Brantley-Reed.",
      "Court records did not list attorneys representing the three deputies on Wednesday. The Macon County sheriff did not respond to a phone call seeking comment.",
      "Reed's cellmate, Daniel Pollard, 24, has been charged with murder in Reed\u2019s death. His attorney, Jennifer Tompkins, said he has severe mental health issues.",
      "\u201cIn 17 years of criminal law, this is probably one of the worst cases I\u2019ve ever had in the sense of mental health,\u201d Tompkins said.",
      "Pollard pleaded guilty to attempted murder and burglary in 2022 and was sentenced to a 20-year split sentence, with five to be served in jail or prison, according to his arrest records. He was released on probation in May 2024, according to a spokesperson from the Alabama Department of Corrections.",
      "For Brantley-Reed\u2019s Montgomery-based attorney Chuck James, questions remain about why Reed, who had been arrested for alleged drunken driving, was being held with Pollard in the first place.",
      "\u201cThese deputies had multiple opportunities to do the right thing and, if they had, John Reed would be alive today,\u201d James said.",
      "The Macon County sheriff's department did not respond to requests for comment about why Pollard, who was arrested for a misdemeanor, was being held in the county jail.",
      "Tompkins said the problem goes beyond the Macon County jail.",
      "\u201cThe mental health system in Alabama is so broken that we\u2019re not getting the mental health treatment quick enough to prevent crime,\u201d Tompkins said. \u201cWe\u2019re creating a bad environment for not only other inmates but for the jailers too.\u201d",
      "Brantley-Reed said she was waiting outside the jail with less than $300 to bail her husband out while the beating was happening. She didn\u2019t know anything was wrong until she saw first responders arrive at the jail, she said. She was told by an administrator her husband was dead shortly after.",
      "Reed's beating was so severe that his wife had to bring photographs of him to the funeral director so that he could reconstruct his face for the funeral.",
      "Brantley-Reed said there wasn\u2019t a day in their 16-year relationship when her husband didn\u2019t make her laugh. Now, his 95-year-old mother has dementia and cries every day when she asks for her son \u2014 only to be reminded that he is dead.",
      "\u201cIt was just so unexpected and so crazy how it happened that sometimes I can't even get a grip on it,\u201d Brantley-Reed said.",

      "Authorities have planned a news conference for Thursday to discuss the case of Sharon Kinne, who was charged before her 25th birthday with killing her Missouri husband, her boyfriend\u2019s wife and a man she\u2019d picked up in a Mexican bar.",
      "Her whereabouts have been a mystery since she reportedly snuck out of the prison in Ixtacalapan on Dec. 7, 1969. And her story has been featured in the book, \u201cI\u2019m Just an Ordinary Girl: The Sharon Kinne Story\u201d as well as in podcasts and TV stories such as Discovery I.D.\u2019s \u201cDeadly Women.\u201d",
      "An FBI spokeswoman directed questions to the Jackson County sheriff's office in Missouri, which said it couldn't confirm any information before the news conference, including whether she had died. But a news release promised answers.",

      "Kinne, who married at 16, was living in a ranch home in the Independence, Missouri, area in March 1960 when her 25-year-old husband, James Kinne, was shot in the back of the head while napping. Independence is just outside of Kansas City.",
      "The mother of two told police she had heard her 2-year-old daughter ask, \u201cHow does this thing work, Daddy?\u201d Then there was a gunshot. Sharon Kinne said she ran into the bedroom and found the toddler holding her husband\u2019s .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol. The death was ruled accidental.",

      "In June 1961, Sharon Kinne was tried in the death of Patricia Jones. And an all-male jury acquitted her to courtroom applause.",
      "In January 1962, Sharon Kinne was convicted of killing her husband. But, the Missouri Supreme Court later overturned the conviction because of improper jury selection. She was tried again, but jurors couldn't agree on a verdict.",
      "Sharon Kinne then headed to Mexico City. One evening, she picked up a man in a bar and went with him to a hotel. Around 3 a.m., gunshots were heard and Francisco Ordonez lay dead on the floor. Kinne got 13 years for killing Ordonez.",
      "Ballistics tests proved prosecutors\u2019 hunch that a gun found in Sharon Kinne\u2019s Mexican motel was the one that killed Patricia Jones.",
      "Sharon Kinne couldn\u2019t be tried again for that crime, so prosecutors closed the case.",

      "Ten members or associates of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua have been indicted on charges of running a gun trafficking operation in New York City that stretched across the country",
      "Ten members or associates of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua have been indicted on charges of running a gun trafficking scheme in New York City that stretched across the country and aspired to spread internationally, officials said Wednesday.",
      "The indictments, announced by Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz, came after a more than 8-month undercover operation by the district attorney's office, New York City police and other law enforcement agencies. Six of the people charged in the 120-count indictment unsealed Wednesday were taken into custody Tuesday on firearm, drug and conspiracy charges.",
      "The Tren de Aragua gang has been linked to a series of kidnappings, extortion and other crimes throughout the Western Hemisphere tied to a mass exodus of migrants from Venezuela, where the gang originated more than a decade ago. Public awareness of Tren de Aragua in the U.S. climbed after footage from a security camera surfaced on social media showing a group of heavily armed men forcing their way into an apartment in the Denver suburb of Aurora. President Donald Trump said during his campaign that he planned to \u201c liberate Aurora \u201d from Venezuelans he falsely said were \u201ctaking over the whole town.\u201d",
      "Members of the violent street gang have been blamed for sex trafficking, drug smuggling and police shootings across the U.S., as well as the exploitation of migrants.",
      "Of those arrested in the Queens indictment, two were taken into custody in Texas and Florida. Four suspects were taken into custody in New York in an operation that left a city police officer with a severely fractured arm after a defendant slammed it with a door while trying to escape, officials said.",
      "Two of those suspects had been arraigned as of Wednesday afternoon.",
      "Katz said charges had not yet been filed in the ongoing investigation into the assault on the officer. She praised those involved in the undercover operation for seizing guns and drugs.",
      "\u201cAs a result of our investigation, 34 dangerous weapons are now off the streets, and we are dismantling this gang as it attempts to establish itself locally.\u201d Katz said, adding that two of those guns were ghost guns \u2014 firearms without serial numbers that are difficult to trace \u2014 one an AR-style rifle and the other a firearm modified to fire continuously like an automatic weapon.",
      "Two other suspects named in the indictment, including alleged ringleader 24-year-old Enyerbert Blanco, were already in custody on other charges, officials said. Two others remain at large.",
      "Authorities detailed in the indictment how the group used the telephone app WhatsApp to communicate about the gun sales, some of which happened in broad daylight in parking lots or by hiding weapons in trash bags.",
      "Authorities allege three of the indicted suspects, including Blanco, obtained the weapons from other states, including some guns that had been reported stolen. Another suspect provided weapons from his own inventory of firearms. Many of the other suspects acted as couriers to deliver the guns.",
      "The indictment alleges that the criminal enterprise also attempted to deliver weapons internationally to Colombia, hoping to increase their profits. Those attempts were thwarted by the undercover operation, authorities said.",
      "Undercover officers bought some of the weapons as part of the operation, according to the district attorney's office. Those officers also purchased 48 grams of pink cocaine also known as tusi \u2014 a mixture of cocaine, MDMA and ketamine \u2014 from the defendants during the operation.",
      "NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said Wednesday that all of the indicted Tren de Aragua members had entered the country illegally around 2023. He said the police department had become aware of the gang's activities in the city including using motorized scooters to snatch cellphones and conducting organized retail thefts. He said the gang unit has identified at least 67 gang members in the city.",
      "The arrests Tuesday came the same day that newly confirmed U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem joined federal agents to announce the arrest of immigrants wanted on criminal charges. That included an operation in the Bronx that snared Anderson Zambrano-Pacheco, 26. Authorities say he was part of the group of armed men, some affiliated with Tren de Aragua, who appeared in the Aurora, Colorado, video."

      "Jeanne Kay Whitefeather and Donald Ray Lantz went on trial in mid-January and each faced over a dozen counts, including forced labor, civil rights violations, human trafficking and child neglect.",
      "The couple, who are white, were accused of mistreating their children \u2014 all of whom are Black \u2014 by locking them in a shed, forcing them to sleep on the floor and use buckets as toilets, and more.",
      "The Kanawha County Circuit Court jury convicted Whitefeather on all 19 counts against her, including the civil rights violations. Lantz was found guilty on 12 counts out of 16. He was acquitted of four counts of civil rights violations. Both showed little emotion as the verdict was read.",
      "Kanawha County Prosecuting Attorney Debra Rusnak said she cried as she heard the word \u201cguilty\u201d repeated again and again.",

      "The couple was arrested in October 2023 after neighbors saw Lantz lock the oldest girl and her teenage brother in a shed and leave the property. A deputy used a crowbar to get them out.",
      "Inside the main residence, a 9-year-old girl was found alone crying in a loft with no protection from falling, according to a criminal complaint. A fourth child was with Lantz when he eventually returned. Deputies were later led to the couple\u2019s youngest daughter.",
      "The children were found in dirty clothes and smelling of body odor, deputies said, and the eldest boy was found barefoot with what appeared to be sores on his feet.",
      "All five were turned over to Child Protective Services after the couple's arrest.",
      "During the trial, neighbors in Sissonville testified they never saw the children play and witnessed Lantz make them stand in line or perform difficult chores around the yard, including lifting heavy items. After Lantz noticed the curious neighbors, the children mostly stayed indoors.",
      "The couple\u2019s eldest daughter, now 18, testified that the outdoor work occurred mostly in Washington and that some of them were forced to use their hands for digging.",
      "She also said the children were fed a steady diet of peanut butter sandwiches at scheduled times, some left over from a previous meal. Some kids were forced to stand in their rooms for hours and keep their hands on their heads. The oldest girl and boy shared a room, including the same bucket for using the bathroom while the other held up a sheet for privacy.",
      "The couple and their attorneys pushed back on the accusations, with Lantz testifying that the chores were assigned to teach the children responsibility.",
      "Whitefeather called the shed the children were found in a \u201cteenager hangout\u201d and said the teens had access to a key and were free to leave as they pleased.",
      "Whitefeather\u2019s attorney said the oldest boy had attempted to run away from home and the lock on the shed was meant to keep him from trying again.",
      "Testimony showed the children didn\u2019t know where a key was \u2014 detectives found one out of sight on a cabinet in the shed.",
      "Prosecutors said the couple\u2019s tactics were less about teaching responsibility and instead about control.",
      "\u201cThe whole point of treating them this way is they become less than human,\u201d Kanawha County Assistant Prosecutor Chris Krivonyak said.",
      "Krivonyak added, \u201cHow do you do that to someone you love?\u201d",
      "Prosecutors also entered racist text messages into evidence that they said were from Whitefeather, who denied writing them. The oldest daughter testified the children were cursed at \u201call the time\u201d and that Whitefeather used racist language.",
      "Whitefeather also refused to eat off the same plates used by the children, whom she referred to as \u201cdirty,\u201d the girl testified.",

It didn't stop the track's creator trying to nominate it for a Grammy award. And even though the artists were fake, it was still wildly popular.",
      "\"I do not think the use of generative AI for creative purposes should be banned, but I do think that generative AI for these purposes that is trained on people's work without permission should be banned,\" Mr Newton Rex adds. \"AI can be very powerful but let's build it ethically and fairly.\"",

    "summary": "The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Five years ago, on 31 January 2020, the UK left the European Union.",
      "On that day, Great Britain severed the political ties it had held for 47 years, but stayed inside the EU single market and customs union for a further 11 months to keep trade flowing.",
      "Northern Ireland had a separate arrangement.",
      "Brexit was hugely divisive, both politically and socially, dominating political debate and with arguments about its impacts raging for years.",
      "Five years on from the day Britain formally left the EU, BBC Verify has examined five important ways Brexit has affected Britain.",
      "1) Trade",
      "Economists and analysts generally assess the impact of leaving the EU single market and customs union on 1 Jan 2021 on the UK's goods trade as having been negative.",
      "This is despite the fact that the UK negotiated a free trade deal with the EU and avoided tariffs - or taxes - being imposed on the import and export of goods.",
      "The negative impact comes from so-called \"non-tariff barriers\" - time consuming and sometimes complicated new paperwork that businesses have to fill out when importing and exporting to the EU.",
      "There is some disagreement about how negative the specific Brexit impact has been.",
      "Some recent studies suggest that UK goods exports are 30% lower than they would have been if we had not left the single market and customs union.",
      "Some suggest only a 6% reduction.",
      "We can't be certain because the results depend heavily on the method chosen by researchers for measuring the \"counterfactual\", i.e what would have happened to UK exports had the country stayed in the EU.",
      "One thing we can be reasonably confident of is that small UK firms appear to be more adversely affected than larger ones.",
      "They have been less able to cope with the new post-Brexit cross-border bureaucracy. That's supported by surveys of small firms.",
      "It's also clear UK services exports - such as advertising and management consulting - have done unexpectedly well since 2021.",
      "But the working assumption of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's independent official forecaster, is still that Brexit in the long-term will reduce exports and imports of goods and services by 15% relative to otherwise. It has held this view since 2016, including under the previous Government.",
      "And the OBR's other working assumption is that the fall in trade relative to otherwise will reduce the long-term size of the UK economy by around 4% relative to otherwise, equivalent to roughly \u00a3100bn in today's money.",
      "The OBR says it could revise both these assumptions based on new evidence and studies. The estimated negative economic impact could come down if the trade impact judged to be less severe. Yet there is no evidence, so far, to suggest that it will turn into a positive impact.",
      "After Brexit, the UK has been able to strike its own trade deals with other countries.",
      "There have been new trade deals with Australia and New Zealand and the government has been pursuing new agreements with the US and India.",
      "But their impact on the economy is judged by the government's own official impact assessments to be small relative to the negative impact on UK- EU trade.",
      "However, some economists argue there could still be potential longer term economic benefits for the UK from not having to follow EU laws and regulations affecting sectors such as Artificial Intelligence.",
      "2) Immigration",
      "Immigration was a key theme in the 2016 referendum campaign, centred on freedom of movement within the EU, under which UK and EU citizens could freely move to visit, study, work and live.",
      "There has been a big fall in EU immigration and EU net migration (immigration minus emigration) since the referendum and this accelerated after 2020 due to the end of freedom of movement.",
      "But there have been large increases in net migration from the rest of the world since 2020.",
      "A post-Brexit immigration system came into force in January 2021.",
      "Under this system, EU and non-EU citizens both need to get work visas in order to work in the UK (except Irish citizens, who can still live and work in the UK without a visa).",
      "The two main drivers of the increase in non-EU immigration since 2020 are work visas (especially in health and care) and international students and their dependents.",
      "UK universities started to recruit more non-EU overseas students as their financial situation deteriorated.",
      "The re-introduction of the right of overseas students to stay and work in Britain after graduation by Boris Johnson's government also made the UK more attractive to international students.",
      "Subsequent Conservative governments reduced the rights of people on work and student visas to bring dependents and those restrictions have been retained by Labour.",
      "3) Travel",
      "Freedom of movement ended with Brexit, also affecting tourists and business travellers.",
      "British passport holders can no longer use \"EU/EEA/CH\" lanes at EU border crossing points.",
      "People can still visit the EU as a tourist for 90 days in any 180 day period without requiring a visa, provided they have at least three months remaining on their passports at the time of their return.",
      "This applies both to the UK citizens going to the EU and vice versa.",
      "However, a bigger change in terms of travel is on the horizon.",
      "In 2025, the EU is planning to introduce a new electronic Entry Exit System (EES) - an automated IT system for registering travellers from non-EU countries.",
      "This will register the person's name, type of the travel document, biometric data (fingerprints and captured facial images) and the date and place of entry and exit.",
      "It will replace the manual stamping of passports. The impact of this is unclear, but some in the travel sector have expressed fears it could potentially add to border queues as people leave the UK.",
      "The EES was due to be introduced in November 2024 but was postponed until 2025, with no new date for implementation yet set.",
      "And six months after the introduction of EES, the EU says it will introduce a new European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS). UK citizens will have to obtain ETIAS clearance for travel to 30 European countries.",
      "ETIAS clearance will cost \u20ac7 (\u00a35.90) and be valid for up to three years or until someone's passport expires, whichever comes first. If people get a new passport, they need to get a new ETIAS travel authorisation.",
      "Meanwhile, the UK is introducing its equivalent to ETIAS for EU citizens from 2 April 2025 (though Irish citizens will be exempt). The UK permit - to be called an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - will cost \u00a316.",
      "4) Laws",
      "Legal sovereignty - the ability of the UK to make its own laws and not have to follow EU ones - was another prominent Brexit referendum campaign promise.",
      "To minimise disruption immediately following Brexit in 2020, the UK incorporated thousands of EU laws into UK law, becoming known as \"retained EU law\".",
      "According to the latest government count there were 6,901 individual pieces of retained EU law covering things like working time, equal pay, food labelling and environmental standards.",
      "The previous Conservative government initially set a deadline of the end of 2023 to axe these EU laws.",
      "But with so much legislation to consider there was concern there was not enough time to review all the laws properly.",
      "In May 2023 Kemi Badenoch - the Trade Secretary at the time - announced only 600 EU laws would be axed by the end of 2023, with another 500 financial services laws set to disappear later.",
      "Most were relatively obscure regulations and many of them had been superseded or become irrelevant.",
      "All other EU legislation was kept, though ministers reserved powers to change them in future.",
      "And the UK has changed some EU laws. For example, it banned the export of live animals from Great Britain for slaughter and fattening and changed EU laws on gene editing crops.",
      "Brexit has also given the UK more freedom in certain areas of tax law.",
      "EU member states are prohibited from charging VAT on education under an EU directive. Leaving the EU enabled Labour to impose VAT on private school fees.",
      "A zero rate of VAT on tampons and other sanitary products was introduced by the UK government in 2021. This would not have been possible in the EU as the EU VAT Directive at the time mandated a minimum 5% tax on all sanitary products. However, in April 2022 the EU's rules changed so the bloc also now allows a zero rate on sanitary products.",
      "5) Money",
      "The money the UK sent to the EU was a controversial theme in the 2016 referendum, particularly the Leave campaign's claim the UK sent \u00a3350m every week to Brussels.",
      "The UK's gross public sector contribution to the EU Budget in 2019-20, the final financial year before Brexit, was \u00a318.3bn, equivalent to around \u00a3352m per week, according to the Treasury.",
      "The UK continued paying into the EU Budget during the transition period but since 31 December 2020 it has not made these contributions.",
      "However, those EU Budgets contributions were always partially recycled to the UK via payments to British farmers under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and \"structural funding\" - development grants to support skills, employment and training in certain economically disadvantaged regions of the nation. These added up to \u00a35bn in 2019-20.",
      "Since the end of the transition period UK governments have replaced the CAP payments directly with taxpayer funds.",
      "Ministers have also replaced the EU structural funding grants, with the previous government rebranding them as \"a UK Shared Prosperity\" fund.",
      "The UK was also receiving a negotiated \"rebate\" on its EU Budget contributions of around \u00a34bn a year - money which never actually left the country,",
      "So the net fiscal benefit to the UK from not paying into the EU Budget is closer to to \u00a39bn per year, although this figure is inherently uncertain because we don't know what the UK's contribution to the EU Budget would otherwise have been.",
      "The UK has also still been paying the EU as part of the official Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and its financial settlement. The Treasury says the UK paid a net amount of \u00a314.9bn between 2021 and 2023, and estimated that from 2024 onwards it will have to pay another \u00a36.4bn, although spread over many years.",
      "Future payments under the withdrawal settlement are also uncertain in part because of fluctuating exchange rates.",
      "However, there are other ways the UK's finances remained connected with the EU, separate from the EU Budget and the Withdrawal Agreement.",
      "After Brexit took effect, the UK also initially stopped paying into the Horizon scheme, which funds pan-European scientific research.",
      "However, Britain rejoined Horizon in 2023 and is projected by the EU to pay in around \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32bn) per year on average to the EU budget for its participation, although historically the UK has been a net financial beneficiary from the scheme because of the large share of grants won by UK-based scientists.",
      "The future",
      "There are, of course, a large number of other Brexit impacts which we have not covered here, ranging from territorial fishing rights, to farming, to defence. And with Labour looking for a re-set in EU relations, it's a subject that promises to be a continuing source of debate and analysis for many years to come.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 00:18:27 GMT",
    "summary": "Many companies have left X but it's not always a simple decision.",
    "story": [
      "On March 21, 2006 the first ever tweet was posted by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey: \"Just setting up my twttr\". It was a simple introduction to a brand new platform.",
      "Backed by celebrities, it was different to other social media sites, like MySpace or Facebook, because you could interact with any user without them having to approve a request. Companies rushed to join the service, hoping to get closer to their customers.",
      "\"If you were a brand that wanted to be part of any cultural moments that were happening, Twitter was a great place to be,\" Alex Wilson, a senior strategist at the marketing agency Pitch tells BBC News.",
      "On June 4, 2010 Elon Musk, the owner of Space X, logged on for the first time: \"Please ignore prior tweets, as that was someone pretending to be me :) This is actually me.\"",
      "Twelve years later he would buy the platform for $44bn (\u00a338.1bn), reshape the algorithm, reinstate banned accounts, repurpose the policy around \"free speech\", and rename it X.",
      "He also fired thousands of staff - around 80% of the workforce.",
      "Since Mr Musk's takeover companies have been choosing to leave the platform in what's been termed \"the great X-odus\".",
      "One of their main concerns was the content that would be seen around their posts that users could screengrab and share.",
      "For example, between June 2022 and February 2023 antisemitic posts on X doubled, according to research by the Institute of Strategic Dialogue.",
      "More recently in the UK, Mr Musk's posts about British politics have stirred up controversy.",
      "In particular, his posts on the subject of grooming gangs put pressure on the government, which announced a review of the issue.",
      "\"There is no doubt that Musk's ownership of X is having an impact on public opinion in the UK,\" Luke Tryl from the research group More In Common tells BBC News.",
      "However, according to More In Common, only 16% of Brits believe his interventions are designed to achieve justice for victims, whereas 44% think he is doing it for attention, and his approval rating with the British public sits at -35.",
      "The changing tone of X and the controversy surrounding its owner have spurred some firms to leave the platform and others have pulled their advertising as well.",
      "At the end of 2023 firms including Apple, IBM and Disney paused advertisement on the platform.",
      "Others brands including Unilever and Mars were sued by Mr Musk, who accused them of unlawfully agreeing to boycott the site.",
      "\"It's broadly fair to say Twitter is becoming less relevant across the world,\" Mr Wilson says in the Pitch office in central London, with posters of clients ranging from charities, telecommunications, and sports leagues.",
      "\"It's been a very long time since clients came to us and say: 'Twitter's fun and exciting. We want to be in that space'.",
      "\"Unless you are targeting specific audiences, maybe certain political audiences or sports  - football is still big on Twitter - it's hard to see the value in it.\"",
      "Trump's election victory has prompted other organisations to leave X, with others considering their positions as Mr Musk's influence in the White House grows.",
      "Beginning in 2013, German football team FC St Pauli, which plays in Germany's top league, the Bundesliga, posted more than 60,000 times, racking up nearly 250,000 followers.",
      "But less than 10 days after Trump's return to the White House was confirmed, the club posted: \"You can find our statement about saying goodbye to X on BlueSky. Feel free to follow us there. We're out of here.\"",
      "\"We discussed the decision for a year. We were mostly posting content with counter speech to hate. We had a lot of content for diversity, anti-racism, and anti-sexism,\" club spokesperson, Patrick Gensing told the BBC.",
      "\"We have seen assaults on X, antisemitism, conspiracy theories,\" he says.",
      "The argument that such posts are justified by freedom of speech, does not convince him.",
      "\"We don't think racism is freedom of speech,\" says Mr Gensing.",
      "One of the most recent departures from X was by the UK arm of BMW. In late January it announced it was no longer posting on X and directed people to its posts on Facebook and Instagram.",
      "There's no definitive way to know how many brands are choosing to leave or reduce their posts on the platform.",
      "When approached, X did not respond to the points raised in this article. But last year Mr Musk claimed X had 600 million monthly active users, and said the platform maintains its \"purpose is to serve the public conversation\".",
      "Mr Musk \"has been clear that X is willing to make trade-offs to adopt a more open, less moderated approach compared to Twitter\", says Goran Calic, visiting scholar at Harvard Business School.",
      "But leaving X can have negative consequences for organisations and their relationships with customers.",
      "\"When users leave, the impact depends on who is leaving and why. A local authority posting news provides significant value to the network. If such an account leaves, it can hurt both the platform and its users,\" he tells BBC News.",
      "\"Users protesting by leaving should weigh the broader social implications of staying versus exiting.\"",
      "For some organisations who need to get their message out quickly, X still has value that other competitors simply can't offer.",
      "\"For us there is still that value [on being on X],\" says Andrew Cassidy, senior director of digital strategy and engagement at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA).",
      "\"We try to match where our riders are. When people are tweeting at the MBTA someone can provide a definitive answer in the moment. Our broadcasting system is exclusively tied into our X account, but we still field customer service questions across other platforms.\"",
      "\"Our focus is providing customer service to the largest number of riders that we possibly can,\" Mr Cassidy says.",
      "\"With the current landscape being what it is, X still feeds that need.\"",
      "It's \"unthinkable\", Mr Gensing explains, not to have a presence on social media in 2025.",
      "\"We have to view all the platforms critically, it's not only X. The companies behind them set up the rules of the game and they can change them.\"",

    "summary": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce expansion plans but some question the short-term benefits.",
    "story": [
      "The expansion of Heathrow Airport has been backed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who is hoping investment in a third runway, along with a series of other transport projects, will drive economic growth in the UK.",
      "Reeves has said expansion of the UK's biggest airport is \"badly needed\" and could lead to 100,000 jobs.",
      "However opponents claim expanding the airport would lead to higher emissions and blight local communities with extra noise and pollution. Friends of the Earth has said it would be \"hugely irresponsible in the midst of a climate emergency\".",
      "So is a third runway at Heathrow the right way to bring an immediate boost to the economy in any case?",
      "In terms of actual spades in the ground at Heathrow, the short answer is no.",
      "A third runway has been on the cards for many years. It has also been kicked into the long grass on several occasions.",
      "The argument in favour has always been an economic one. Large airports create jobs, promote trade and bring in both business travellers and tourists.",
      "Heathrow currently handles \u00a3200bn worth of trade a year and - the airport's owner would argue - provides a vital avenue for exports, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "But Heathrow's infrastructure is straining at the seams.",
      "Last year, a record 83.9 million passengers passed through its terminals with its two runways handling around 1,300 landings and take-offs every day.",
      "Flights from the airport are currently capped at a maximum of 480,000 per year and in practical terms it has reached that limit.",
      "A third runway would potentially increase the number of flights permitted to 720,000.",
      "Expanding the airport would, in theory, provide an avenue for growth that simply isn't there at the moment.",
      "The construction project itself - the biggest privately-funded infrastructure scheme in Europe - would create thousands of jobs.",
      "But a third runway at Heathrow is unlikely to become a reality for many years.",
      "HS2 blew billions - here's how and why",
      "Reeves hints at support for Heathrow expansion",
      "Firstly, a formal planning process has to take place. This type of major infrastructure project would require a Development Consent Order and unless the government changes the system, that would take between 18 months and two years.",
      "Secondly, it is highly likely any decision in favour of a third runway would be subject to a judicial review.",
      "Expansion of Heathrow is highly controversial - opponents include environmental groups, local authorities as well as nearby residents, and this stage could take another year and a half.",
      "So even with favourable winds, it could take at least three years to get to the construction stage which is itself expected to take another six or seven years.",
      "In terms of what can be achieved sooner that could potentially create bankable short-term benefits, separate projects to expand Gatwick and Luton airports are well-advanced and could be signed off by the Transport Secretary within weeks.",
      "The real value of backing a third runway at Heathrow is the less tangible but no less important signal to investors about the UK's attitude towards major infrastructure projects, say supporters.",
      "The uncertainty over the construction of the HS2 high speed line under the previous Conservative government is widely believed to have undermined confidence in the country's ability to turn ambitious plans into reality.",
      "A strong commitment to Heathrow expansion might help to reverse that perception.",
      "With the plan itself expected to cost close to \u00a320bn, insiders say firm government support will be vital if it goes ahead.",
      "Although the project would be privately-funded, people close to the scheme warn that it could not proceed without close co-ordination with ministers - including changes to the policy framework that sets out how the costs of the investment can be recovered.",
      "For the chancellor herself, there could be a short-term benefit in throwing her weight behind airport expansion plans now.",
      "Some economists have argued that if additional growth can be factored into economic forecasts currently being prepared by the Office for Budget Responsibility, it might make it easier for her to meet self-imposed fiscal rules within this parliament.",
      "If not, then Reeves is likely to bump into her own \"iron\" fiscal rules to pay for day-to- day spending out of tax receipts by 2029 - meaning spending cuts or further tax rises.",

      "However, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"a third runway is badly needed\", adding the government \"cannot duck the decision any longer\".",
      "How would Heathrow Airport be expanded?",
      "Heathrow is already the UK's busiest airport, serving more than 80 million travellers a year with its four passenger terminals and two runways.",
      "A third runway would mean demolishing hundreds of homes, diverting rivers, and rerouting the M25 motorway between junctions 14 and 15 through a tunnel under the new runway.",
      "The number of flights, currently capped at 480,000 a year, could go up to 720,000 - or nearly 2,000 a day on average.",
      "Heathrow told the BBC that it would eventually be able to serve up to 140 million passengers a year once the third runway is in operation.",
      "The airport's owners, who include Saudi Arabia and Qatar's sovereign wealth funds and private equity firm Ardian, said the costs of expansion would be met by charging airlines for use of the larger airport.",
      "But after years of wrangling over the original plans, the initial cost estimate of \u00a314bn will need to be revised.",
      "When could a third runway open?",

      "Several members of the current government - including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer - voted against a Heathrow expansion when in opposition.",
      "But Sir Keir recently told the BBC that the government has climate commitments, \"but growth is really important too\".",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"Any aviation expansion will only be able to go ahead if it is consistent with our carbon budgets.\"",
      "However, London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office said he has \"a long-standing opposition to airport expansion around London\" because of the impact on air quality and noise.",
      "Heathrow's boss, Thomas Woldbye, said in December he was waiting for a \"clear steer\" from the government before he could take plans forward.",
      "Could an extra runway help the economy?",
      "Some arguments for investing in the UK's transport infrastructure include a boost in growth, more jobs, and help for UK exports.",
      "Other European cities boast hub airports with more runways, including Amsterdam which serves fewer passengers than Heathrow but has five runways. Paris Charles de Gaulle and Frankfurt have four.",
      "Currently, over \u00a3200bn of British trade passes through Heathrow annually. Heathrow has not devised figures on how much trade is expected to increase after a third runway, which it will do when it arrives at planning stage.",
      "The Airport Commission, an independent panel that examines the need for additional UK airport capacity, looked into the likely impact of Heathrow expansion and reported in 2015 that there would be benefits to the tune of \u00a361bn over 60 years.",
      "It said that included reduced fares, fewer delays, greater resilience, and the creation of up to 77,000 jobs.",
      "Forging ahead with Heathrow expansion would also send a clear message to foreign investors that the government means what it says about making growth its priority.",
      "However, some critics, including think tank the New Economics Foundation say the impact on growth is exaggerated, arguing more capacity in the south of England might simply displace activity from other regions.",
      "Will a third runway at Heathrow help UK growth?",
      "What would the environmental impact be?",
      "Aviation is one source of damaging emissions that can contribute to climate change, and the industry is under pressure to find ways to reduce its impact.",
      "Reeves pointed to progress on creating sustainable fuels, and electric planes. A third runway at Heathrow would also mean \"that instead of circling London, flights can land\" she added, meaning less fuel is used.",
      "But it is far from clear that those technologies will be enough to make up for the growing demand for air travel. Heathrow will have to prove that its plan meets the governments net-zero by 2050 targets in any planning application.",
      "Last year the government's independent adviser on cutting emissions, the Climate Change Committee, warned that the UK should not go ahead with airport expansion without a framework in place to manage capacity across the country.",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",

      "It\u2019s a problem confronting many of the open source software pioneers who transformed the technology world in the 1990s and early 2000s.",
      "Their ethos was that anyone could contribute to the development of an open source application or operating system \u2013 and the software and underlying code could be used, modified, and distributed for free.",
      "The open source movement broke the stranglehold of big technology companies, spurred innovation and underpins much of today\u2019s technology landscape.",
      "In 1999, Loris Degioanni made his first contributions to an open source network analysis tool that eventually became Wireshark, as part of his master\u2019s thesis. \u201cMy concern was graduating,\u201d he says, not succession planning or the long-term future of the project.",

      "While projects do come and go, he explains, some remain relevant over the years, and founders and maintainers usually want to ensure they live on while there is demand. That\u2019s not just because they\u2019ve invested time in developing the code itself, but also because they have spawned communities, both virtual and in the real world.",
      "But while the likes of Mr Stenberg and Mr Degioanni can take action to ensure the keys to the kingdom are passed on, ensuring there is someone to pass them to can be a challenge.",
      "Many in the open source community worry there are not enough younger developers willing to get involved in contributing to or maintaining projects. This is often unpaid work after all.",

      "\u201cYou've got a next generation who haven't engaged as a philanthropic community and volunteer community in the same way, at the same scale.\u201d",
      "There are technology barriers to address too. Many key open source projects were originally written in C, a coding language first developed in the early 1970s.",
      "While C is still taught in universities, it is no longer widely used in the commercial world, Mr Degioanni explains. \u201cThe fact that C is the main language makes it harder to attract a younger generation.\u201d",
      "There are ways to work around this. Mr Degioanni says both Wireshark and a project he founded, Falco, rely on \u201cplug-ins\u201d, which can allow new functionality to be written in different languages.",
      "Mr Torvalds has given his blessing to the adoption of Rust as a programming language for Linux, while noting the \u201cRust versus C discussion has taken almost religious overtones in certain areas.\u201d",
      "When it comes to steering projects into the future, leaders and maintainers have the option of handing over control to foundations. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, for example, oversees 208 projects, with more than 250,000 contributors. Wireshark has its own independent foundation, with Mr Degioanni as a board member.",
      "Not everyone subscribes to the foundation model. Stenberg and his collaborators have kept curl completely independent. \u201cI'm much better off without being in their neighbourhoods and just running my own neighbourhood,\u201d he says.",
      "And foundations still face the issue of ensuring a steady supply of fresh developers to keep projects alive, he notes.",
      "Miss Brock says it\u2019s essential that the open source community consider how it encourages younger people to participate.",

    "summary": "The territory's untapped mineral wealth has caught the eye of both mining firms and Donald Trump.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has said he thinks the US will gain control of Greenland, underlining his persistent claim on the Arctic island, on one occasion pointing to \"economic security\" as the reason. While the autonomous Danish territory has been quick to say it isn't for sale, its vast and mostly untapped mineral resources are in great demand.",
      "Jagged grey peaks suddenly appear before us, as the motorboat navigates choppy coastal waters and dramatic fjords at Greenland's southern tip.",
      "\"Those very high pointy mountains, it's basically a gold belt,\" gestures Eldur Olafsson, the chief executive of mining company Amaroq Minerals.",
      "After sailing for two hours we stepped ashore at a remote valley beneath Nalunaq mountain, where the firm is drilling for gold.",
      "It's also scouring the surrounding mountain range and valleys, hunting for other valuable minerals, having snapped up exploration licences spanning over 10,000 sq km (3,861 sq miles).",
      "\"We're looking for copper, nickel, and rare earths,\" says the Icelandic boss. \"This is uncharted, and still has the potential to have multiple big deposits.\"",
      "The base camp is a cluster of mobile buildings and bright orange accommodation tents housing more than 100 staff, including Greenlanders, Australians, and British former coal miners. From there a road climbs up the valley, and we drive by car into the gold mine, following a dark tunnel upwards inside the mountain.",
      "\"See here!\" says Mr Olafsson pointing to a seam of white quartz and a thin dark line. \"Gold, gold, gold. All the way over. Isn't that extraordinary?\"",

      "The mine, which Amaroq bought in 2015, had operated for most of the preceding decade, but closed due to then falling gold prices, and high operating costs.",
      "Amaroq is confident that the mine will now be profitable. And it plans to ramp up production this year, where it has built a brand new processing plant to crush the ore and refine the precious metal into gold bars.",
      "\"We can either walk off site every month with a suitcase of gold, versus a 30,000 tonne ship [carrying the ore],\" explains Mr Olafsson.",
      "He says that Greenland presents an unrivalled opportunity because its huge mineral reserves are largely untouched.",
      "\"It can be the supplier of all the minerals the Western world will need for decades,\" adds Mr Olafsson. \"And that is a very unique position.\"",
      "Yet currently there are just two active mines on the entire island.",
      "Greenland is a self-governing territory that is part of Denmark, but controls its own natural resources.",
      "It's endowed with the eighth largest reserves of so-called rare earth elements, which are vital for making everything from mobile phones to batteries and electric motors. It also has large amounts of other key metals, such as lithium and cobalt.",
      "There is oil and gas too, but new drilling is banned, while deep-sea mining has also been ruled out.",
      "Christian Kjeldsen, director of Greenland's Business Association, says that the global \"geopolitical situation right now is driving interest in the world's biggest island\".",
      "He points to China having the world's largest reserves of rare earth metals, while the West wants to secure alternative supplies.",

      "Trump ramps up threats to gain control of Greenland and Panama Canal",
      "That has fuelled a growing focus among Western nations to get access to Greenland's minerals. China has also been keen to get involved, but its presence is limited.",
      "Reuters recently reported that the US lobbied an Australian mining firm not to sell Greenland's biggest rare earth project to potential Chinese buyers.",
      "Greenland's Minister for Business, Trade and Raw Materials, Naaja Nathanielsen, says that interest in the territory's minerals has \"absolutely increased within the last five years or so\".",
      "She adds: \"We're used to being a hotspot for the climate crisis. We want to be a part of the solution.\"",
      "Permits have now been given for 100 blocs across Greenland, where companies are searching for viable deposits. British, Canadian and Australian mining firms are the biggest foreign licence holders, while Americans hold just one.",
      "But there are many more steps before these sites become potential mines.",
      "Yet while Greenland may be sitting on mineral riches, any \"gold rush\" continues to be slow to materialise.",
      "The economy, which has an annual GDP of just over $3bn (\u00a32.4bn), is still driven by the public sector and fishing. And the territory also relies on an annual $600m subsidy from Denmark.",
      "Greenland's politicians hope that mining revenues will reduce reliance on the annual $600m subsidy from Denmark, and help boost independence efforts. But in the meantime Greenland is making more money from tourism.",
      "Officially mining is still important for independence, says Javier Arnaut, head of Arctic Social Sciences at Greenland University. \"But in practical terms, you can see that there are very few mining licenses awarded.\"",
      "Ms Nathanielsen concedes that while there are partnerships being developed with the US and EU, \"we still have not seen large amounts of money flowing into this sector\". She hopes that there will be another three to five mines operating within the next decade.",
      "However mining is not easy in Greenland because of its remote geography and weather. It's the world's largest island and 80% of it is covered by an ice sheet. It has rugged mountains and no roads between settlements.",
      "\"It's an arctic terrain,\" says Jakob Kl\u00f8ve Keiding, from the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, which has mapped the territory's deposits. \"We have problems with harsh conditions in terms of the climate and limited infrastructure. So it's quite expensive to open a mine.\"",
      "Those high costs, coupled with low global metal prices, have held back investors.",
      "Others blame red tape for the sector's slow growth. The territory has strict environmental regulations and social impact requirements, and getting permits can take time.",
      "Ms Nathanielsen maintains that most communities do support mining, and that it boosts local economies. \"They [overseas miners] are shopping in the local shop. They're employing local employees. They're chartering a local boat or helicopter,\" she says.",
      "Yet in the south's biggest town, Qaqortoq, resident Heidi Mortensen M\u00f8ller is sceptical whether new mines will lead to employment for locals. \"When they say they're going to add jobs, who are they talking about?\"",
      "Jess Berthelsen, head of local labour union, SIK, says that many people think mining income \"will leave the country\", and not benefit Greenland. But he supports the growth of the sector. \"Greenland needs more income and to earn money from other ways than fishing.\"",
      "It's unclear how Trump's latest gambit on Greenland will play out. However, the territory's prime minister Mute Egede said earlier this month that \"we need to do business with the US\" and that it was \"doors open in terms of mining\".",
      "Mr Kjeldsen from the business association, hopes it will be bring \"much needed investment\" to the sector. \"On the other hand, if the uncertainty surrounding the signals from Trump drag on for a longer period, there is a risk that this might impact the investment environment negatively.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 25 Jan 2025 02:26:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Maxime Chapoutier makes wines that combine French and Australian grapes, a strict no-no in the EU.",
    "story": [
      "Winemaker Maxime Chapoutier would be arrested if he tried to sell two of his newest wines in his native France.",
      "\"There would likely be outrage about these wines in France, and that would be a good thing,\" he says. \"Sometimes you need to be provocative to drive change.\"",
      "The two bottles in question, one white and one red, would be illegal in France because they are made from a blend of French and Australian base wines.",
      "Under both French and European Union law it is forbidden to make a wine that combines EU and non-EU fruit. In France in particular, authorities take such things very seriously.",
      "The French wine industry has a celebrated word called \"terroir\", which applies to all the environmental factors that affect vines growing in a vineyard, such as the soil, the climate, and the elevation. As a result, wines from a specific place are held in the highest esteem.",
      "Add a strict appellation or classification system for France's wine regions, and the thought of blending French and Australian wine to create a global hybrid would horrify many French wine lovers.",
      "Yet Maxime has done just this, and it is all thanks to one word - Brexit.",
      "For while he cannot sell the two wines in the EU, he can do so in the UK now that London no longer has to follow food and drink rules set by Brussels.",
      "Maxime has created the wines in partnership with UK online retailer The Wine Society, where they are called Hemispheres Red and Hemispheres White. The red is made from syrah grapes, or shiraz as they are called in Australia, while the white is a blend of marsanne and viognier varieties.",
      "The Australian red and white wine components are shipped in bulk to the UK, where they are blended with wine from France's northern Rhone and Roussillon regions before bottling.",
      "Maxime who works for his family's celebrated Rhone-based wine company Chapoutier, say that while he respects France's focus on terroir, there should be room for global blends to also be sold.",
      "\"Chapoutier has been making wine for more than 200 years, very terroir driven, and biodynamic,\" he says. \"But more and more people are turning their back on French wines because they don't understand the complicated appellation rules.",
      "\"We need to adapt for consumers and make wines more accessible, which international blends can help to do. Maybe the EU law will change. It is also more ecological to ship wine from Australia to Europe in bulk, as you don't have the weight of all the glass bottles.\"",
      "Another wine company now making wines by combining grapes from two continents is Australian firm Penfolds. It sells reds made from both Australian and Californian grapes, and others that mix Australian and French. Again they cannot be sold in the EU, but they can in the UK, US, Australia and elsewhere.",
      "Penfolds refers to these blends as \"wine of the world\", and says that they \"possess an otherness that can best be described as worldly\". Whatever that is supposed to mean.",
      "Unsurprisingly, some more traditional winemakers are not in favour of this development. One such person is Jas Swan, an independent winemaker based in Germany.",
      "While the two-continent blends from Chapoutier and Penfolds are made with care from quality grapes, and priced accordingly, she is fearful that if the trend grows it will mean a lot more cheap, low-grade wine going on sale.",
      "\"I believe that those types of wine would have nothing left of any terroir, even before they left their continent,\" she says. \"Those wines would have seen only machine work, heavy additions to keep them clean, and are manufactured to be easy to drink for the masses.",
      "\"Why can consumers not be more demanding? The consumerism is insane.\"",
      "Peter Richards, who holds the top global wine industry qualification, the master of wine (MW), is also sniffy. \"The notion of cross-country blending for wine isn't something I find outrageous in itself,\" he says. \"My concern is more that this is about creating novelty for novelty's sake.\"",
      "His wife, Susie Barrie, who is also an MW, adds: \"I remain to be convinced that a wine made by blending grapes from different countries can be great in terms of taste.\"",
      "By contrast, wine writer Jamie Goode says that development of two-continent wine \"is actually quite a fun idea\".",
      "\"If the wines are good, and made well from good vineyard sites - and not simply a gimmick blending together cheap bulk wines and then slapping a huge margin on the wine - then this is quite interesting.",
      "\"The fundamental basis for fine wine is the notion of terroir - that wines come from a place, and their flavour expresses this place in unique ways. But not all wines have to be terroir wines, and there's room for wines like this.",
      "\"In some ways, there's a lot of skill required to blend the right wines together to create something interesting coming from such different places.\"",
      "Pierre Mansour, head of buying for The Wine Society, says he and his colleagues came up with the idea of creating two wines made from grapes from different continents as part of the company's 150th birthday celebrations.",
      "\"We were thinking about the future of wine, and we wanted to do something innovative. In the end we thought that one area of innovation is blending, of creating a wine that can mitigate for the impact of climate change on a particular country.",
      "\"And from a carbon footprint out of view, it is more environmentally friendly to ship wine in bulk from Australia to the UK. But at the same time we did expect 'terroirists' to say 'hold on this is fundamentally against the French principle of wine'.",
      "\"So we approached Chapoutier, thinking that they might say 'are you mad, how dare you insult us', but they were great. They were really enthusiastic.\""

      "'Real regret'",

      "Many of the children she had spoken to had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and felt they had acted impulsively.",
      "\"One little boy said, 'I broke windows. The next day, I drove past those windows on the bus and I felt terrible.' There was real regret,\" she said.",
      "The children's commissioner's findings come a week after Axel Rudakubana pleaded guilty to the murders of Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe.",
      "He was sentenced to 52 years in prison for the \"meticulously planned rampage\" in which 10 other people, mostly children, were also stabbed on 29 July last year.",

      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer described the violence at the time as \"far-right thuggery\" and promised that those involved would \"face the full force of the law\".",
      "The children's commissioner's report said at least 147 children had been arrested and 84 charged since the riots, with some as young as 12 sentenced over their involvement.",
      "Dame Rachel said her interviews with 14 of those \"unheard and overlooked\" children \"raise some really serious questions about childhood in England and why our children feel so disaffected and disempowered\".",

      "\"Today's findings offer no simple solutions but paints a more complex picture than has been debated following the riots. However, it is one that we must grapple with in order to create a more positive experience of childhood.\"",
      "Her report suggested that previous negative interactions and a deep-seated mistrust of the police had fuelled the actions of children, who viewed the riots as an opportunity to retaliate against the police.",
      "Poverty and a lack of opportunities in their communities also formed the background of their involvement, the report said.",
      "Dame Rachel criticised the \"unusually severe and swift\" charges which followed the riots, which she said overlooked children's potential for rehabilitation.",

      "A government spokesperson said: \"The senseless violence we saw on our streets after the tragic loss of Bebe, Elsie and Alice brought shame to our nation, and the mobilisation of our police and entire criminal justice system to bring perpetrators of all ages to justice was vital in restoring order. There is no justification for the violence which they endured last year.",

      "It is not about being negative about technology, he added, but about making sure that everyone was aware of the risks.",
      "\"The hope is that sooner or later it will be the social norm not to buy a smartphone until young people are at least 14, maybe older.",

      "She said she had had a phone since she was 11 years old, describing it as a \"necessity\".",

      "She said she had also experienced the \"darker side\" of the technology when last year a man had airdropped inappropriate photos to her at a bus stop.",

      "The event had been partly organised by Claire Smith, the principal of nearby Tudor Grange Academy, which has been a phone-free school for many years.",

      "Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood posted twice on Instagram. One an old picture of him, Faithfull and Richards in a recording studio with the caption \"Farewell dear Marianne\", and a more recent shot of the pair with the words \"Marianne will be dearly missed. Bless her xx\".",
      "\"Marianne passed away peacefully in London today, in the company of her loving family,\" a statement from her spokesperson said.",
      "\"She will be dearly missed.\"",
      "The singer had previously suffered multiple health problems, including bulimia, breast cancer and emphysema caused by decades of smoking.",
      "In 2020, she contracted Covid-19 and was hospitalised for 22 days.",
      "Doctors said they did not expect her to survive - but she pulled through, releasing her 21st album, She Walks in Beauty, a year later.",
      "Her story is a remarkable portrait of the rock and roll era.",
      "She was a doe-eyed poster girl of the 1960s, plucked from obscurity by the Rolling Stones' manager at the age of 16 and given As Tears Go By, the first song ever written by Jagger and Keith Richards.",
      "An international hit, her version was light and breathy, delivered in a folk-pop style that was to become her trademark during the swinging 60s.",
      "With her eponymous debut album and 1966's North Country Maid, she became part of the \"British Invasion\" of the US pop charts.",
      "Meanwhile, her affair with Jagger turned her into a tabloid lightning rod. After they split she fell into drug addiction - at one point living homeless on the streets of Soho.",
      "She re-emerged tentatively with the 1976 album Dreamin' My Dreams but really hit her stride with 1979's New Wave-influenced Broken English, on which she showcased the ashen voice and hard-won wisdom that would define the second act of her career. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award.",
      "In recent years, she teamed up with songwriters like PJ Harvey and Nick Cave, who each cited her as an inspiration.",
      "Other collaborators over the years included David Bowie, Lou Reed, Jarvis Cocker, Damon Albarn, Emmylou Harris and Metallica, whose drummer Lars Ulrich thanked Faithfull for her \"incredible and unique contribution to our music, and for always being so willing to join us in performing it\".",
      "Her acting career ran in parallel to music. On stage, she appeared alongside Glenda Jackson in Chekhov's Three Sisters; and played Ophelia in Hamlet \u2013 later admitting her nightly descent into madness had been chemically enhanced.",
      "She also played God in two episodes of the sitcom Absolutely Fabulous, and the devil in William Burroughs' and Tom Waits' musical, The Black Rider.",
      "But music was where her heart lay. Her penultimate album, 2018's Negative Capabilty, was a meditation on ageing, loneliness and grief \u2013 inspired partly by the death of her old friend, and fellow Rolling Stones' paramour Anita Pallenberg; and partly by the terror attacks on the Bataclan nightclub in her adopted home of Paris.",
      "Taking her full circle, the album included a raw and emotional re-recording of As Tears Go By that reduced everyone in the studio to tears, according to producer Rob Ellis.",
      "Faithfull received the World Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2009 Women's World Awards, and was made a commandeur of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the government of France.",
      "Faithfull's long-time friend, the BBC Radio 2 presenter Bob Harris, called her an \"encapsulation of the sixties\".",
      "He said while she initially was known for being Mick Jagger's girlfriend, through her \"people began to see her as an artist, as a creator\".",
      "Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight, Harris added: \"To me, she was wonderful, she was interesting, very, very bright, and from an aristocratic background, which was always part of the way she carried herself.\"",
      "The singer married and divorced three times - to artist John Dunbar in 1965, Ben Brierly of punk band the Vibrators in 1979, and actor Giorgio Della Terza in 1988.",
      "She is survived by her son, Nicholas Dunbar.",

    "title": "BBC apologises for culture of silence over Russell Brand",
    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 14:52:37 GMT",
    "summary": "Staff felt they could not speak up with concerns about the star's behaviour, an internal review finds.",
    "story": [
      "The BBC has apologised to staff who felt they could not speak up with concerns about Russell Brand's behaviour because he was seen as \"too influential\" and they felt he \"would always get his way and therefore they stayed silent\".",
      "The apology came as the BBC published the findings of an internal review into Brand's time as a presenter for BBC Radio 2 and 6 Music between 2006 and 2008.",
      "The investigation considered eight complaints, two of which were made while he worked for the corporation.",
      "One of those, which related to him urinating into a cup and behaving aggressively during his Radio 2 show, was registered formally at the time, and the BBC has now admitted it was \"not dealt with effectively\".",
      "The BBC launched the investigation after separate allegations in 2023 from several women who accused the 49-year-old actor and comedian of rape, sexual assaults and emotional abuse.",
      "Brand has denied all allegations and said his relationships were \"always consensual\".",
      "'Stayed silent'",
      "Thursday's report found that \"only one formal complaint was made about Brand's inappropriate conduct in the workplace\" during his stint on air, and beyond that there was \"no evidence that his behaviour was raised with management formally at the time\".",
      "But the BBC acknowledged that Brand was \"perceived to be too influential\" for staff to complain about.",
      "Many of those interviewed for the internal investigation \"believed, rightly or wrongly, that Russell Brand would always get his way and therefore they stayed silent\", the report said. They also believed he \"had the support of the station management\".",
      "While one informal complaint was also made, the report said \"it is clear that there were other concerns but those involved felt unable or unwilling to raise these at the time as they felt the concerns would not be taken seriously and the systems for making complaints were not as clear as they are now\".",
      "Competition winner",
      "Commenting on the report, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said the complaints were \"horrendous\".",
      "\"As is the fact that staff felt unable to raise concerns because they did not think that they would be believed or taken seriously,\" she said.",
      "She added that the BBC must \"take action to reassure its staff and the wider public that it takes these issues seriously\".",
      "\"For too long, there has been a culture of silence in the media industry where inappropriate behaviour like Brand's has been tolerated or downplayed. Power imbalances and a perception that certain stars cannot be challenged are sadly not unique to this case.\"",
      "The review also found that Brand had consensual sex with a competition winner from his 6 Music show on BBC premises.",
      "Speaking to the review team, that person said that while what happened was consensual, they now felt \"Brand had abused his position and taken advantage of them\".",
      "The report added that there were \"management failings\" and \"there should have been better systems in place to ensure that Brand's unacceptable behaviour was promptly picked up and addressed\".",
      "Channel 4, where Brand also worked as a presenter, released its own internal review findings in March 2024. Its boss apologised to a former employee after the probe found it had not investigated a \"serious\" complaint made against the star in 2009.",
      "Brand has been interviewed three times by police since September 2023.",
      "In November 2024, the Metropolitan Police sent the Crown Prosecution Service a file of evidence, but prosecutors have not yet decided whether to bring charges.",
      "'Not taken seriously'",
      "A BBC employee made a formal complaint to a manager in 2007 after Brand urinated into a cup in the Radio 2 studio, and then threw objects in anger when one of the production team made a mistake during a second show.",
      "The report said it was likely that this was then raised verbally with the Radio 2 controller at the time, Lesley Douglas, although she does \"not recall these concerns ever being raised with her\".",
      "Douglas denied that Brand ever sought to exercise any influence over her, and said her relationship with him similar to that she had with other presenters on the station.",
      "The BBC made light of the 2007 incident in a press response at the time, the report said, when a spokesperson told the Independent that Brand had urinated in a cup \"and someone has shown him where the toilet is\".",
      "\"Regrettably this incident was not taken seriously at this time,\" the report said.",
      "Another staff member said they had raised concerns informally about Brand's conduct in 2006 and 2007, the report said.",
      "Someone else alleged that Brand \"tucked his fingers down their trousers and underwear and pulled them towards him\" in a corridor while on set of a BBC radio production, but did not complain at the time.",
      "Staff members who were \"most closely\" involved in his shows described his behaviour in general as \"promiscuous or out-of-control\", but said they did not \"witness anything non-consensual or potentially illegal\".",
      "'Inadequate' complaint handling",
      "Another complaint was made to the BBC about an incident in Los Angeles in 2008.",
      "Brand is alleged to have followed \"Olivia\" into a bathroom and shown his penis to her moments before he began pre-recording his radio show.",
      "The woman, who was not a BBC employee but worked in the same building, did not complain at the time, thinking \"she would not be believed\".",
      "The report found no evidence of anyone in BBC management being aware of Olivia's experience at the time.",
      "In 2019, a BBC News staff member raised the incident with their line manager after Olivia confirmed she wanted to take the matter further.",
      "\"It is likely those involved in escalating the complaint in 2019 felt that there was nothing that could be done as it was over ten years later,\" the report said.",
      "It concluded that the complaint process was \"inadequate\", as was the handling of the 2019 complaint, and the BBC has apologised to Olivia.",
      "Another of the complaints in the report was made by a woman named Alice, who said a car provided by the BBC for Brand collected her and took her to his house when he was in his 30s and she was a 16-year-old schoolgirl.",
      "The report concluded that it was not able to verify these claims but it was \"unlikely that the cars described by Alice were chauffeur-driven BBC cars or BBC management cars\".",
      "The report, and Alice, agree that if Brand did \"persuade a taxi or mini-cab pre-booked on his behalf by the BBC to make these journeys, it's likely to have been done without the knowledge of the BBC staff who booked his cars for him in advance\".",
      "The review cost \u00a3662,062 and was conducted by the BBC's director of editorial complaints and reviews, Peter Johnston.",
      "He added: \"The processes for raising any concerns were also not as developed as they are now.",
      "\"In the intervening years the BBC has introduced other mechanisms and routes for staff to raise concerns.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 18:54:39 GMT",
    "summary": "After fame and infamy in the Swinging 60s, she hit rock bottom before re-emerging as a respected artist.",
    "story": [
      "By her own admission, Marianne Faithfull, who has died aged 78, \"didn't do conventional\".",
      "She was the convent-educated teenager who abandoned school after meeting the Rolling Stones.",
      "A delicate-featured picture of innocence, she inhaled the highs of chart success, before falling victim to alcohol and hard drugs.",
      "After splitting up with Mick Jagger, Faithfull spent years living as a heroin addict on the streets of Soho.",
      "Given the chance to restart her singing career, she went on to make more than 20 albums.",
      "Her whisky-soaked voice, turned cracked and dusky, conveyed the inner torments of her painful life-experiences.",
      "Marianne Evelyn Gabriel Faithfull was born in Hampstead on 29 December 1946.",
      "Her mother was Baroness Eva Sacher-Masoch, a Hungarian, half-Jewish former ballet dancer who had fled the Nazis in World War II.",
      "Her father was Major Glyn Faithfull, an eccentric British MI6 agent turned professor of Italian literature.",
      "The stage was set for an unusual childhood.",
      "Marianne spent her early years at Braziers Park, an upmarket commune founded by her father in an Oxfordshire country house.",
      "In her autobiography, she described it as a \"mixture of high utopian thoughts and randy sex\".",
      "After divorcing, Lady Sacher-Masoch spirited her six-year-old daughter to a terraced house in Reading, discouraging further contact with Major Faithfull.",
      "According to Marianne, she was raised like \"one of her mother's cats\".",
      "She had regular bouts of tuberculosis and was sent to St Joseph's Roman Catholic boarding school, despite her father's complaints that the nuns would \"give her a problem with sex for the rest of her life\".",
      "While still at school, Marianne began singing folk songs a cappella in Reading coffee-houses - and, before long, her exquisite looks and obvious talent saw her sucked into the vortex of Swinging 60s London.",
      "In 1964, she attended a Rolling Stones launch party, on the arm of British artist John Dunbar, and was spotted by the flamboyant record producer Andrew Loog Oldham.",
      "Famously, he described her as an \"angel\" with impressive vital statistics.",
      "Oldham was the Rolling Stones' manager and felt he could package his new discovery as a pop star.",
      "She would, he thought, be a useful vehicle for songs that weren't quite a fit for his more important act.",
      "The Rolling Stones were a rhythm and blues band. When singer Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards wrote a gentle ballad, When Tears Go By, they dismissed it as a \"piece of tripe\".",
      "So Oldham gave it to Marianne Faithfull.",
      "The song had not been written for her but, she said, \"fitted me so perfectly it might as well had been\".",
      "The melancholy classic, sung in her detached, wintry voice, reached the UK Top 10.",
      "The Stones were so disappointed they had missed a hit, they recorded their own version a year later.",
      "Faithfull followed up with a series of singles, including Summer Nights, This Little Bird and - her highest chart success - Come and Stay with Me.",
      "She caught Bob Dylan's eye when he came to town.",
      "Inspired by her doe-eyed looks, the American singer-songwriter wrote her a poem - but tore it up when she turned him down.",
      "In 1965, she married John Dunbar and gave birth to their son. Soon afterwards, she left the family home and moved in with Mick Jagger.",
      "He was not Faithfull's first Rolling Stone. \"I slept with three of them,\" she later admitted, \"and then I decided the lead singer was the best bet.\"",
      "Her influence on the band was significant.",
      "Let's Spend the Night Together, You Can't Always Get What You Want and Wild Horses were all songs said to have been written about her.",
      "And Sympathy for the Devil was inspired by The Master and Margarita, a Russian novel Faithfull introduced to Jagger.",
      "As one of the faces of the 1960s, Faithfull carved out a side-career as an actor.",
      "She appeared at London's Royal Court in an adaptation of Chekhov's Three Sisters, alongside Glenda Jackson.",
      "She became the first person ever to utter the F-word in a mainstream film, I'll Never Forget What'sisname, in 1967.",
      "A year later, she starred opposite Alain Delon, as a doomed, leather-clad beauty in The Girl on a Motorcycle.",
      "Her character's psychedelic and erotic fantasies saw the film win the first ever X-rating in the United States.",
      "Of course, there were a lot of drugs.",
      "During a police raid on Keith Richards' house in Sussex, Faithfull was discovered naked, draped in a fur rug - which she took indecent pleasure in occasionally letting slip.",
      "Allegations involving a Mars bar, she insisted, were entirely made up. But the drugs bust took a toll on her reputation. \"It destroyed me,\" she later said.",
      "\"To be a male drug addict and to act like that is always enhancing and glamorising, she explained.",
      "\"A woman in that situation becomes a slut and a bad mother.\"",
      "Faithfull co-wrote Sister Morphine with Jagger and Richards and released the song in 1969.",
      "The lyrics - the authorship of which were later the subject of a legal dispute with the band - are a terrifying insight into the effect of heroin and cocaine addiction: \"The scream of the ambulance is sounding in my ears. Tell me, Sister Morphine, how long have I been lying here?\"",
      "The relationship with Jagger - whom she accused of having a misogynistic streak - fell apart at the turn of the decade.",
      "At the same time, Faithfull lost custody of her son and her life began to spiral out of control.",
      "A suicide attempt left her in a coma, and she ended up an alcoholic, anorexic heroin addict living in a bomb-damaged building in London's Soho.",
      "She looked back on these years in a BBC interview in 2002, describing her addiction as a kind of brutal therapy.",
      "\"I was in agony and I healed myself as best I could,\" she said. \"One of the ways was with drugs, because they are painkillers.",
      "\"It was all too much for me,\" she explained. \"I really didn't like my gilded cage.\"",
      "Occasional attempts to emerge from her squat in Chelsea failed.",
      "Her voice - affected by drug abuse and laryngitis - had become permanently rough and lower in pitch.",
      "But, a decade after her split with Jagger, Faithfull made Broken English - her most critically acclaimed album.",
      "Gone was the innocence of the 1960s - and in its place, a post-punk performer of depth and world-weary experience.",
      "The album's final track, Why'd Ya Do It?, is the rasping rant of a woman reacting to a man's infidelity - set to a riff inspired by Jimi Hendrix.",
      "It was a moment of metamorphosis: the Rolling Stone party-girl had become a gravel-voiced, truth-telling sophisticate.",
      "The album's critical success was not matched commercially. It did well in France and Germany but reached just number 57 in the UK charts.",
      "But it did earn Faithfull a Grammy nomination in 1981, for best female rock vocal performance.",
      "She moved to America, where Island Records put her into rehab.",
      "Still suffering from alcohol and drug addiction, she had a string of mishaps - including breaking her jaw on the stairs. On one occasion, her heart actually stopped.",
      "But she held it together, and released more than a dozen albums over the next three decades.",
      "She also wrote an autobiography, Faithfull - looking back on the 1960s and 70s with a notable absence of self-pity.",
      "Constantly worried about money, she auctioned off much of her 1960s memorabilia in 2024 - saying that she preferred gardening to looking back.",
      "Now in her late 70s, she had inherited her mother's ancient title and - technically a baroness - was living in Paris.",
      "In the last decade of her life, Faithfull had to cancel concert tours after being diagnosed first with breast cancer and then hepatitis C.",
      "She was also troubled by the complications of a broken back and hip, and thought she would never sing again after weeks in hospital with the coronavirus.",
      "But she never quite lost the creative spark.",
      "In recent years, she published a record that put the words of Keats and Wordsworth to music.",
      "And Negative Capability, her 21st album, was described by the Guardian as a \"masterly mediation on ageing and death\".",
      "It was notable for They Come at Night, her furious response to the Bataclan terror in Paris.",
      "\"They come at night,\" she sang, \"and the world goes blind with fear. Terror in Paris, the future is here.\"",
      "It also dealt with Faithfull's own increasing frailty and loneliness, as well as the loss of close friends, including fellow Rolling Stones muse Anita Pallenberg.",
      "\"I know I'm not young and I'm damaged,\" she wrote defiantly. \"But I'm still pretty kind of funny.\"",
      "Marianne Faithfull will in part be remembered for being Mick Jagger's girlfriend and surviving the horrors of drink and drug addiction.",
      "But her resurrection proved - if proof were needed - a rock star's muse can become a fully fledged, respected artist in her own right.",

      "Yet, while there are no plans to take the Bridget Jones story any further, author Helen Fielding is not completely ruling out the prospect.",
      "The new film sees Bridget living as a widow, becoming a single mother and tackling modern dating.",
      "The story is partially inspired by Fielding's own loss. Her husband, Kevin Curran, died in 2016.",
      "Zellweger says the film is a \"beautiful story and really the most personal for Helen. She is sharing about her own experiences about loss, grief and finding new happiness, it's a pretty special one\".",
      "She adds she has always felt \"really, really lucky to get the part\" and \"was just trying not to get fired\".",

      "Ejiofor, who is mainly known for grittier roles in films like 12 Years a Slave and American Gangster says the film is a \"different speed\" to his usual projects.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 08:31:24 GMT",
    "summary": "Jurors had been questioned about whether Rihanna's connection to the case could sway the verdict",
    "story": [
      "Pop star Rihanna was in a Los Angeles courtroom on Wednesday as her partner, rapper A$AP Rocky, continued his trial on assault charges.",
      "The singer, who shares two children with the rapper, sat in the court with A$AP Rocky's family as the trial delved into allegations that he pulled a gun out on his former friend and opened fire multiple times.",
      "The trial started on Friday and will determine whether the rapper will face penalties on two charges of felony assault. He could face decades in prison.",
      "A$AP Rocky has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his lawyers have argued the weapon was a prop gun and his former friend is only after money.",
      "Here's what you need to know about the case.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky charged with?",
      "A$AP Rocky's assault trial began on 24 January in Los Angeles.",
      "The rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was charged with two felony assault charges relating to a 2021 shooting incident in Hollywood.",
      "Authorities allege A$AP Rocky and a former friend got into a heated discussion that turned violent and led to the rapper pulling out a gun and opening fire.",
      "Who is the accuser Terell Ephron?",
      "The victim in the case is fellow artist and childhood friend Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli. He is the star witness for prosecutors",
      "They were both part of the A$AP Mob hip-hop collective and have known one another since their time together at a New York high school.",
      "Their relationship eroded over time as A$AP Rocky's career took off and he became famous.",
      "It all led up to a disagreement between the pair in November 2021.",
      "Mr Ephron took the stand this week to describe their relationship and the moments of the alleged shooting.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky accused of doing?",
      "Authorities have said Mr Ephron met Mr Mayers on 6 November in 2021, a day after the pair got into a disagreement.",
      "They met outside a Hollywood hotel about a block from the iconic Hollywood Walk of Fame.",
      "Prosecutors say when the pair met things got physical. Mr Mayers is then alleged to have whipped out a gun from his waistband and pointed it toward Mr Ephron, telling him \"I'll kill you right now\".",
      "Court documents outline that Mr Ephron told the rapper to fire the weapon, which Mr Mayers did not and instead started walking away.",
      "Mr Ephron followed behind and yelled at Mr Mayers about their disagreements, court documents show.",
      "That's when prosecutors allege Mr Mayers pulled out the gun again and opened fire.",
      "Court documents allege multiple bullets were fired, one of which is alleged to have grazed Mr Ephron's knuckles.",
      "Authorities say parts of the incident were captured on surveillance footage, including some footage that included audio of gunfire, although there is no video showing the shooting.",
      "Some of this footage has been played in court already for jurors.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky saying about the allegations?",
      "There are several key points of contention in the case: the weapon, police investigation and Mr Ephron's injuries.",
      "The rapper's lawyers have noted the weapon authorities say was the gun he pulled out was not usable - instead it was a prop weapon his security encouraged him to carry to ward off would-be attackers.",
      "His lawyers have also focused on Mr Ephron taking multiple days to report the incident to police, and how authorities found no trace of bullet casings or a shooting when they responded to the incident.",
      "Court documents detail that Mr Ephron returned to the scene later and gathered two shell casings he said he found in the area. He brought them when he reported the incident to police two days later.",
      "He also did not immediately go to hospital after the incident and instead sought medical treatment after flying back to New York.",
      "Could A$AP Rocky face prison time?",
      "Yes, the rapper could face up to 24 years in prison if found guilty in the trial, which is expected to go on for about three weeks.",
      "A panel of 12 jurors will decide his fate.",
      "Will Rihanna appear in court again?",
      "It's unclear if Rihanna will continue appearing for the trial. Before the proceedings started, the rapper's lawyer had told the court this week that Mr Mayers has tried to keep his family away from all of this.",
      "Media reports indicate that on Wednesday she sat between the rapper's mother and sister in the courtroom. The couple's two children did not appear.",
      "Rihanna's presence sparked intense media and fan interest outside the courthouse, but she entered through a non-public entrance used by judges, and was already seated in the courtroom when media were allowed into the chamber.",
      "During jury selection, prosecutors questioned jurors about Rihanna and whether her connection to the case would affect their ability to deliver a fair verdict. While some described themselves as Rihanna fans, and many more had heard of Rihanna than A$AP Rocky, jurors said her presence in the courtroom would not influence their decision making.",
      "Rihanna's presence did attract attention from jurors in a murder trial across the hall at the courthouse, with some commenting on her being so nearby.",
      "Rocky's trial is being televised, but Rihanna sat out of view of the cameras in the courtroom.",

      "The Royal Ballet School (RBS) has reached a financial settlement with a former student, who said the body-shaming she experienced while at the elite institution has left her with lifelong psychological damage.",
      "Ellen Elphick, 31, had claimed the London-based school breached its duty of care when she attended between 2009 and 2012.",

      "\"If I had a knife, this is what I would cut off,\" Ellen says the teacher said.",
      "The comment plunged Ellen into shame, she says, and exacerbated her struggles with disordered eating. She later received a diagnosis of atypical anorexia and body dysmorphia",
      "She said there was a pattern of similar comments from multiple teachers at the school, that further eroded her confidence and intensified her eating disorder.",

      "The game requires players to navigate a large, complex map, often revisiting areas much later on in their playthrough.",

      "And Ubisoft's accessibility wins come just days after it announced the closure of its Leamington Spa studio and staff reductions at other international offices, totalling 185 job losses.",
      "Late last year the company also said it had disbanded the team behind award winner The Lost Crown after reports suggested it did not hit sales targets.",
      "The publisher, which employs an estimated 13,500 people worldwide, has also delayed the upcoming game in its flagship Assassin's Creed series twice.",
      "But they are far from the only company affected.",

      "The likes of former Manchester City striker turned content creator Sergio Aguero, and Brooklyn Beckham will be racing in the electric-powered vehicles, which can go from 0-60mph in 1.82 seconds - 30% faster than a current F1 car.",
      "Aguero has amassed 30m followers on social media platform Instagram, while Beckham has 16m.",
      "\"Using their reach, their profiles and their fan base to help elevate ours feels like a really good combination,\" says Formula E chief executive Jeff Dodds.",
      "Each influencer will be paired with a professional FE team and driver, and then undergo six weeks of intensive training before getting behind the wheel of this season's cars and racing at a circuit in Miami on 5-6 March.",
      "It is the latest example of a sport trying to harness the popularity of celebrities to generate content and reach younger audiences.",
      "But will it work? And does it risk devaluing the real action on track?",
      "\"I'm really excited,\" says Beckham. \"Like my dad, I've always been obsessed with driving.\"",

      "\"I was blown away, and the more people who do [see it], the more people will understand.\"",

      "\"When this comes out, people are going to think that I'm going to try and become an F1 driver,\" he says.",

      "\"It's not a gimmick because it's the real car on a Grade 1 racing track.\"",
      "The influencers will be behind the wheels of the fastest accelerating single-seater race car in the world.",
      "\"They'll be on the track individually, which is a much safer environment,\" says Dodds who wants to introduce this as a standalone promotional event in the race calendar.",
      "\"But it also gives them the opportunity to push the boundaries as far as they're comfortable. This will be a case of how brave are they? How far are they prepared to push the car?\"",
      "The amateur drivers will be put through their paces in a driving simulator before being guided by the professionals in dedicated physical and driver training sessions.",

      "While its finances are improving, an annual loss of $45m (\u00a336m) was posted last year.",
      "But Dodds is upbeat, predicting that by 2030, Formula E can overtake MotoGP in terms of popularity in motorsport, and be second only to Formula 1.",
      "\"We have around 400m fans around the world - about half the size of F1 in just 10 years,\" he says.",
      "\"So I'd argue that's a really successful first period, and we have a broadcast reach of about half a billion around the world that's growing between 20 and 30% every year.",
      "\"I don't look at F1 and say 'we have to beat them', because it's a very different product and audience.\"",

      "Meanwhile, YouTubers taking part in boxing started out as a novelty in 2018.",

      "\"I'm a massive boxing fan and I choose not to watch a lot of those bouts,\" says Dodds.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 01:25:47 GMT",
    "summary": "The Scottish rock band explain how music helped them through a tough period in their personal lives.",
    "story": [
      "One word keeps cropping up during our interview with Glasgow four-piece Mogwai \u2013 and that word is \"weird\".",
      "It was \"psychedelically weird\" when their last album, As The Love Continues, unexpectedly went to number one in 2021.",
      "The achievement was made \"even weirder\" by the fact it happened during the pandemic, \"so we couldn't even go to the pub to talk about how weird it was\", says frontman Stuart Braithwaite.",
      "The success took them all the way to the Mercury Prize gala (\"such a weird ceremony\"), but they didn't let it influence their new album, The Bad Fire.",
      "In fact, they completely forgot to mention the chart achievement to their new producer, John Congleton (St Vincent, The Killers, Blondie, Modest Mouse).",
      "He only found out when a French journalist brought it up in an interview.",
      "\"He was like, 'Wait, your last album went to number one?' And we were like, 'Yeah'.",
      "\"And he was like, 'Wow, that's weird'.\"",
      "To be fair, he was right.",
      "Mogwai are not a band who ever seemed destined for global domination.",
      "Formed by longtime friends who wanted to create \"serious guitar music\", the quartet specialise in long, mesmerising instrumentals, riddled with creeping anxiety and devastating pay-offs.",
      "Their journey to number one took 25 years, aided by chart rules that place higher value on physical record sales over streams when calculating rankings.",
      "Mogwai - a cult band with a fanbase that prizes vinyl \u2013 found the scales tipped in their favour. For one glorious week, they outsold Dua Lipa and Harry Styles.",
      "\"It was a huge surprise,\" Braithwaite reiterates.",
      "\"We want our music to do as well as it can, but we're not uber-ambitious. We're not like Queen, plotting world domination.\"",
      "But even if the band had been inclined to capitalise on their success, fate was conspiring against them.",
      "As they prepared to record the follow-up to As The Love Continues, keyboardist Barry Burns received the news every parent dreads: His daughter might die.",
      "Doctors had diagnosed her with aplastic anaemia, also known as bone marrow failure, where the body stops producing enough blood cells.",
      "\"She had blood coming out of her gums and bruises all over,\" he recalls. \"It was extremely stressful.\"",
      "The condition is exceptionally rare, with only 30 to 40 children diagnosed in the UK per year, but Burns had first-hand experience of how serious it could be.",
      "\"The weird thing was that my neighbour when I was a kid had it and, sadly, she died,\" he says.",
      "\"So obviously, I really panicked because I thought I knew the outcome \u2013 but thankfully the treatment is completely different now.\"",
      "After a bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy, his daughter recovered.",
      "\"She's going to be fine, but I've had an awful two years.\"",
      "Opaque and impressionistic",
      "It wasn't the only trauma the band experienced while making the record.",
      "Live agent Mick Griffiths, who had worked with them since the start of their career, died of cancer, while bassist Dominic Aitchison lost his father.",
      "Even Braithwaite's pet dog, Prince, had problems that caused turmoil. \"He got cancer and had to have his leg amputated two weeks before we started recording,\" he recalls.",
      "Appropriately enough, the album's title, The Bad Fire, is a Glaswegian term for hell. But anyone expecting an outpouring of grief or a reckoning with mortality is in for disappointment.",
      "\"If anything weighty happens in my life, the last thing I want to do is write a song about it,\" Braithwaite told The Herald newspaper in 2003, an ethos that holds true today.",
      "Largely instrumental, their songs are deliberately left open to interpretation. The band christen their compositions with nonsense titles and in-jokes (You're Lionel Richie, Secret Pint, Simon Ferocious) to avoid the imposition of meaning.",
      "The new album continues that tradition, with deliciously-titled tracks like Pale Vegan Hip Pain and Fanzine Made Of Flesh (although Lion Rumpus may be the most self-descriptive entry in the band's discography).",
      "When lyrics appear, they're opaque and impressionistic. The only hint of the turbulence Mogwai experienced comes on the groggy, distortion-washed 18 Volcanoes, where Braithwaite quietly sings: \"Hope has come another day/Hold me close in every way.\"",
      "\"Some journalists in France said the album was really cathartic, and I can kind of see that,\" he says. \"But I don't think its maudlin at all.",
      "\"It's vaguely upbeat, by our standards.\"",
      "Released last Friday, The Bad Fire is heading for the top five of the UK albums chart amid stiff competition from Central Cee and Teddy Swims.",
      "Again, physical sales will give The Bad Fire an advantage over streaming hits, a situation Braithwaite is pretty happy about.",
      "\"The streaming world is very murky and hard to understand,\" he says.",
      "\"It does make a lot of money, but it makes a lot of money for old music and artists with popular back catalogues, and I think that's really discouraged a lot of big labels from investing in new music.\"",
      "He adds that Spotify is filled with \"fake bands making generic music\" for its curated playlists, especially in genres like chill-out, lo-fi and relaxation.",
      "It's an accusation that's been repeatedly levelled against the streaming service, and which it has called \"categorically untrue\". But Braithwaite is sceptical.",
      "\"You absolutely know that if anyone's going to be making generic AI music, it's going to be the streaming services, just so they don't have to pay humans.\"",
      "Streaming isn't entirely bad for Mogwai, however. Over on YouTube, their crepuscular 2005 album track Take Me Somewhere Nice has been streamed 85 million times.",
      "The video isn't even official. Uploaded by a fan, it's illustrated by a drawing of a girl with her head in an upturned goldfish bowl.",
      "Originally drawn by video game designer Ken Wong, the picture's aura of disconnection and alienation has become so synonymous with Mogwai's song that some fans have turned it into tattoos.",
      "\"I almost want to go, 'Mate, you know, that's not the cover of the record',\" laughs Braithwaite. \"But it's cool.",
      "\"And the comments under the video are a sort of endless message board of young kids who are going through a hard time supporting each other. There's an agony aunt vibe about it.",
      "\"That's one thing I do like about the digital world, that music has these other lives.\"",
      "For Braithwaite, who read a lot of William Blake's poetry during the recording of The Bad Fire, there's something alluring about the prospect of art outliving its creator.",
      "\"I'm kind of obsessed with the concept of eternity within culture,\" he says.",
      "\"William Blake was kind of laughed out of society for his ideas but hundreds of years later, his paintings were projected onto the dome of St Paul's Cathedral, and Jerusalem is the unofficial English national anthem. It's incredible.",
      "\"I like the idea of, when we're long gone, having made some kind of mark.\"",
      "The concept has extra resonance this year, as Mogwai celebrate their 30th anniversary. They've come a long way, from gobby young upstarts who sold T-shirts slagging off their rivals to respected stalwarts of the British rock scene.",
      "So how does it feel to have reached this stage? Was it something they ever anticipated at their first practice, the first Tuesday after Glastonbury, in the front room of his parents' house?",
      "\"Well, I thought we'd have flying cars by this point,\" laughs Braithwaite. \"So any joy at the fact I was still eking out a living as a musician would probably be tempered by the lack of jet packs.\"",
      "To put it another way, it simply feels weird."

    "summary": "Boarders sees five black teenagers swap their inner-city education for an elite boarding school.",
    "story": [
      "The scholarship students of St Gilberts are back for the second season of Boarders, the hit comedy drama that sees five black teenagers swap their inner-city education for an elite boarding school.",
      "At the almost exclusively white private school, Toby, Jaheim, Leah, Omar and Femi find themselves once again fighting against microaggressions, racial stereotypes and tone-deaf peers.",
      "The battles their characters fight are not too dissimilar to what some of them have had to go through in real life.",
      "Josh Tedeku, who plays Jaheim, attended a private school growing up, so knows what it feels like to \"be in the minority\".",
      "\"I wasn't beaten up like my character in Boarders is, but the feeling of not fully belonging was always there - I felt a bit like a fish out of water and isolated at times,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Describing his schooling years as \"tough\", he says he's now \"proud that we've given a safe space to people who felt like they were in the minority at school\".",
      "The 21-year-old, who has also starred in Rapman's Netflix superhero series Supacell, says Boarders is also an important show as it \"represents all different types of black people\".",
      "Myles Kamwendo plays Omar, one of the more introspective scholarship students, who finds himself exploring his sexuality and learning to accept who he is.",
      "The 22-year-old says the \"characters are really differentiated in the show and the beauty is that everyone can relate to a different character and see themselves in them\".",
      "Boarders gave the five leading actors their first major roles and they all tell the BBC they experienced imposter syndrome.",
      "\"It's funny because I am so different to my character,\" says Jodie Campbell, who plays Leah. \"I felt a lot of imposter syndrome at the start of series one because I was working with such talented people.\"",
      "Most of the actors were able to channel their feelings of imposter syndrome into their characters who are navigating how to fit into a school that wasn't built for them.",
      "But Campbell says she wasn't able to do that as her character \"doesn't feel any imposter syndrome\".",
      "\"Leah thinks it's the institution's fault for not welcoming her and she believes she has every right to be there.\"",
      "As the most outspoken of the scholarship students, Leah refuses to conform to the school's traditions and expectations. She finds herself regularly in trouble for challenging authority figures like the headmaster.",
      "'I laugh at ridiculousness of racism'",
      "In the first series, Leah confronts the entrenched racism at St. Gilbert's by challenging the display of a racist painting and Campbell says it was hard to perform scenes that tackled issues of racism and microaggressions.",
      "\"I had to really prepare myself for some scenes,\" she explains. \"I was looking at an offensive painting every day and that was hard but I used that fuel to arm my character\".",
      "She adds that it's important for these conversations to be had and Boarders does it well as it \"explores those difficult topics through comedy\".",
      "Tedeku says he appreciated having other actors similar to him around so that when things got too much they could \"group together and laugh at how stupid things are\".",
      "\"I actually think racism is funny in that I laugh at how ridiculous it is that you can hate someone so much that you go out of your way to make fun of them or single them out all because of the colour of their skin.\"",
      "The first season of Boarders was largely praised by critics - The Guardian awarded it four-stars and said the show doesn't get \"bogged down in conflicts about race and class\" and instead \"encompasses all the mess and joy of youth, where few people ever really feel that they fit in\".",
      "Similarly, The Telegraph called Boarders \"razor-sharp\" and said it tackles \"everything from bigotry to inclusion\".",
      "The Daily Mail, however, wasn't impressed, suggesting it was \"full of lazy sterotypes\" and giving it only one star.",
      "In the new series, the students are pitted against each other as the number of scholarships are to be whittled down from five to three.",
      "Tedeku says he knows what it feels like in real life to be set against his peers.",
      "\"There's a sense in some communities that only one person can get up at a time and we can't all go together, but that mindset needs to change.\"",
      "His co-star Sekou Diaby who plays Toby, agrees and explains that the acting industry \"can be a toxic environment\".",
      "\"Competition is healthy but sometimes it's so aggressive it's as if you're actually fighting each other. It's crazy and backwards to push your peers down.\"",
      "He believes the arts industry in the UK still has a long way to go and is far behind the industry in the US.",
      "\"In America you see more black minority groups working together to achieve something, but in the UK it feels like you're fighting for each other's spot.\"",
      "Diaby adds that it's even harder to break into the industry if you're from a working class background as \"there's a lot of nepotism in the industry\".",
      "\"But being different is also really powerful because your point of view is rarer in the industry so your take on things will be more unique and that's what will make you stand out.\"",

    "summary": "A number of tracks that didn't make a big impact when they were first released have now become hits.",
    "story": [
      "When the lists of the most successful songs of 2024 in the charts, streaming and social media were revealed recently, they included the expected big hitters and some evergreen classics. But sprinkled among them was a different type of hit song.",
      "A number of tracks that failed to make a big impact when they were first released, mostly in the 2010s, have since bubbled up and become firm favourites.",
      "The rise of these slow-burning sleeper hits in recent years is \"one of the most fascinating trends right now\", says Stuart Dredge, head of insight at Music Ally.",
      "Here is our guide to the biggest 2010s sleeper hits.",
      "The Night We Met - Lord Huron (2015)",
      "This song only reached number 77 in the UK at the time of release, but was the 60th most popular song in 2024, according to the Official Charts Company's end-of-year list - above Charli XCX's biggest track. It was even higher on Spotify's global end-of-year chart, at 24.",
      "The LA folk-rock group's song first took off after being used in the 13 Reasons Why soundtrack in 2018, and with aching lyrics harking back to the start of a relationship, it has since been recycled in various TikTok memes and Molly-Mae Hague's pregnancy announcement video in 2022 (even though it's actually a break-up song). Cosmopolitan put it top of its playlist of Sad Songs to Blast When You're Feeling Hella Moody.",
      "Sweater Weather - The Neighbourhood (2012)",
      "This one reached the US top 20 but missed the UK top 40. It has snowballed on social media and is now the seventh most-streamed song in Spotify history, spending more than three years in total in its global daily top 50. The California band say the autumnal theme made it an \"accidental seasonal hit\", and it has also been adopted as a bisexual anthem.",
      "Champagne Coast - Blood Orange (2011)",
      "Champagne Coast didn't chart originally but British singer Dev Hynes' seductive \"come to my bedroom\" refrain was used in TV show Euphoria's soundtrack in 2019, and then the song blew up on TikTok last summer. It was the most popular old song on the platform in 2024 and sixth overall on Billboard's end-of-year TikTok chart. It finally reached the UK top 20 in July.",
      "Evergreen - Richy Mitch & the Coal Miners (2017)",
      "Evergreen is just 87 seconds long and didn't chart originally, but became the go-to song for \"hopecore\" videos offering snippets of positivity and optimism on TikTok last year. It spent 35 weeks in the UK top 60 in 2024, and was in the overall end-of-year top 100.",
      "Lovely - Billie Eilish (2018)",
      "Released on the 13 Reasons Why soundtrack, this track didn't reach the UK or US top 40s, but Eilish's delicate duet with Khalid is now her most-streamed song, and 14th on Spotify's all-time list. It is apparently, among other things, good for sending you to sleep.",
      "I Wanna Be Yours - Arctic Monkeys (2013)",
      "I Wanna Be Yours was on the hit AM album but only reached 99 in the UK as a single. However, last year it had more Spotify plays than any other song over a decade old. TikTok users have chosen the melodramatic chorus to soundtrack their romantic declarations.",
      "The Sound of Silence - Disturbed (2015)",
      "Hard rock band Disturbed's brooding but beautiful cover of the Simon and Garfunkel classic has now spent eight months in the UK top 60 in the past year, helped by a dance remix and a TikTok shuffle dance trend.",
      "See You Again by Tyler, the Creator (2017)",
      "See You Again didn't chart at the time but took off on TikTok (where else?), with one snippet turning into a personality quiz (do you sing along with Tyler's \"OK OK OK OK\" or guest vocalist Kali Uchis' \"La la la la\"?). The song finally reached number 21 in the UK in 2023, and was the 19th most-streamed song on Spotify in the US in 2024.",
      "Songs from all eras have been resurfacing for several years, of course.",
      "Many were hits to start with. Mr Brightside by The Killers (2004) is a fixture, while Kate Bush's Running Up That Hill (1985) and Sophie Ellis-Bextor's Murder on the Dancefloor (2001) shot back up the charts thanks to TV and film soundtracks.",
      "But when it comes to songs that weren't as big the first time around, the 2010s dominate.",
      "One reason is that people who grew up in those years are introducing their favourite tunes to others, according to Sarah Kloboves from music data analysts Chartmetric.",
      "\"This revival is pioneered by these older Gen Z listeners [in their mid-20s]. But when they start to create these trends, you also have the younger Gen Zs and even Gen Alpha [young teens and below] that are hearing these songs for the first time - the release date is interesting because it's old, but it's not too old.\"",
      "Dredge agrees: \"A lot of the influencers on places like TikTok are a few years older, so they are probably using songs from the 2010s that soundtracked their teenage years.\"",
      "Taylor Swift's Cruel Summer (2019) could even be described as a sleeper hit - it wasn't released as an official single at the time, but eventually reached number one in 2023 and was the fifth-biggest song of 2024 overall on Apple Music.",
      "Others, though, are not such obvious hits. Musically, most sound quite restrained and atmospheric - they're emotive soundtrack songs rather than upbeat bangers or full-blooded anthems.",
      "\"These aren't songs that were released with the intention of being a pop hit,\" Kloboves says.",
      "\"Not to bash on pop music or pop stars, but sometimes they all sort of sound the same. But I think a lot of these songs are very different from what you might usually hear in the mainstream,\" she says.",

      "At a screening in October, I was struck by the impact Hard Truths had on the audience. Its relatively short 95-minute runtime disguises a film with significant depth and which punches well above its weight.",
      "Speaking to BBC News in December, Jean-Baptiste reflected: \"Pansy comes from a generation where you're taught to just get on with things. It's like the pre-Oprah generation, self-help - it's before all that. You just went, 'I feel rubbish, but I've got to do the laundry.' You get up and you get on with it.\"",

      "About 50 people a year with the inherited blood disorder are likely to receive it, experts say.",
      "Prof Bola Owolabi, of NHS England, called it a \"monumental step forward\", and said the one-off treatment Casgevy, also known as Exa-cel, \"holds a very real prospect of  a cure\".",
      "A confidential agreement has been made with manufacturer Vertex on how much the NHS will pay.",
      "Campaigners have described the treatment as \"groundbreaking\" and its availability on the NHS as a \"milestone\".",
      "Sickle cell disease can be life-threatening and cause recurring intense pain, when blood vessels become blocked by misshapen red cells.",
      "About 15,000 people in England live with the condition, which mainly affects people of Black African and Black Caribbean heritage.",
      "It is caused by genetic change that means people make haemoglobin - a key protein in red blood cells - that doesn't work properly.",
      "This results in red blood cells becoming sickle in shape and stiff and sticky - rather than flexible smooth discs.",
      "These sickle cells do not live as long as healthy red blood cells and can clump as they travel around blood vessels - reducing oxygen to vital parts of the body.",
      "This puts people at risk of organ damage, stroke, heart failure and a greatly  reduced quality of life.",
      "In trials all patients who received the therapy - which tweaks a specific gene and allows the body to make more healthy red blood cells - avoided stays in hospital for a year after treatment and most for three-and-a-half years. Further data is still being studied.",
      "NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said the therapy \"could be absolutely transformative \u2013 it could enable patients to live free from the fear of sickle cell crises hanging over them\".",

      "\"This is going to be a life-changing moment for many of my patients.\"",
      "How the gene therapy works",
      "It is a multi-step process.",
      "First, blood stem cells from a patient's bone marrow (where all blood cells originate) are removed from the body.",
      "In the laboratory, a gene-editing tool called Crispr is used.",
      "This allows a specific gene to be pinpointed and very precise editing to take place.",
      "However, instead of directly editing a faulty gene, Casgevy instead takes advantage of a process that happens when babies are in the womb, where they make red blood cells with foetal haemoglobin (a key protein that carries oxygen). This switches to the adult form once they are born.",
      "Crucially foetal haemoglobin is not affected by sickle cell disease, so Crispr acts by dampening down the \"switch\" that makes the body produce the adult form.",
      "Patients have to undergo \"conditioning\" chemotherapy to make sure their bodies are ready to accept the edited stem cells.",
      "Modified stem cells are then transfused back into the body, where they multiply and increase the production of stable, well-functioning red cells.",
      "The full treatment must be considered carefully - it can involve lengthy stays in hospital and may have side effects, including headaches and bleeding problems.",

      "Overall levels of the virus have not yet reached the peak of recent years.",
      "But one farmer, who has previously lost 30% of his flock because of bird flu, told the BBC that, without a vaccine, it was only a matter of time before \"it all kicks off again\".",

      "Essex turkey farmer Paul Kelly, whose business was hit hard in the worst avian flu outbreak from 2021 to 2023, told the BBC that \"the foot has been taken off the gas\" when it comes to making poultry vaccines available to UK farmers.",

      "He added that the organisation was a \"huge supporter\" of vaccination for poultry but recognised there were challenges, including the cost to farmers and the impact on trade with other countries that prohibit imports from producers that vaccinate.",
      "Meanwhile, there are also some scientific concerns about bird flu vaccinations.",
      "Recent work by researchers from the UK's Royal Veterinary College and institutions in China found possible evidence that they may be linked to changes in how the virus evolves.",
      "They carried out genetic analysis of avian flu samples collected from wild birds and farmed poultry between 1996 and 2023.",
      "While they found that infections occurred more often in unvaccinated birds, they also found that in countries with high vaccination rates, there was a higher rate of change in the virus itself.",
      "They said such evolution could, in theory, lead to vaccines needing to be updated frequently to remain effective and to the virus spilling over into unvaccinated populations. They acknowledged that more research was needed to establish whether there was a direct causal link between vaccination and virus evolution.",

      "Border officials will also get powers to seize migrants' phones in the search for intelligence about who helped them cross the Channel.",
      "Those convicted of acts in preparation of smuggling, such as buying boat parts, face up to 14 years in jail, in an attempt to tackle gangs at a far earlier stage in their preparations.",

      "He described the changes as \"minor tinkering\" and said a real deterrent was needed, after Labour scrapped a scheme which would have seen some migrants sent to Rwanda.",
      "The new offence of endangering lives at sea could lead to the prosecution of anyone arriving in the UK on a small and unsafe boat who has been involved in intimidating or coercing others passengers to take part in the journey, or who has refused to be rescued outside of British waters.",
      "Boat launches from French beaches are often terrifying and dangerous, investigators say, with some of the passengers doing the work of gangs by forcing reluctant travellers to climb on board.",

      "A senior law enforcement official said investigators often found themselves dealing with \"traumatised victims in a floating crime scene\".",

      "Ministers hope these powers will mean the police will be able to arrest and charge more gang members, or seek their extradition from abroad, before boats have left France.",
      "The proposed powers are based on legal principles that have been used for 20 years to apprehend suspected terrorists at much early stages of their planning.",

    "story": [
      "The UK needs to \"up its game\" and get a work ethic in order to compete in the global economic race, Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp has said.",

      "Before entering politics he set up businesses in finance and travel.",
      "He said he developed a strong work ethic in his early teens, delivering newspapers, washing people's cars and working in Sainsburys.",

      "\"It is something I would like to infuse more into our national culture as well.\"",
      "Asked if he thought a belief in hard work was something that was missing in Britain, he replied \"I do a bit.\"",

      "However, this was shortly followed by a dramatic tumble in the value of the pound as the market reacted badly to the mini-Budget.",
      "Asked about the post, Philp told Nick Robinson: \"Clearly commenting on currency movement was a dumb idea and I shouldn't have done that - I learnt a lesson.\"",
      "He said that Truss's tax reductions should have been accompanied by \"some spending restraint in order to help balance the books and to maintain market confidence\".",
      "\"I made that case internally... but it wasn't listened to.\"",
      "\"I was hoping, despite all the difficulties and the very bad market reaction, there was a way to get through it to implement a growth plan... ultimately there wasn't a way of doing that.",

      "His son and daughter were born at 25 weeks and one day, only just past the legal limit for abortion.",

    "title": "Five key impacts of Brexit five years on",
    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 01:41:46 GMT",
    "summary": "The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Five years ago, on 31 January 2020, the UK left the European Union.",
      "On that day, Great Britain severed the political ties it had held for 47 years, but stayed inside the EU single market and customs union for a further 11 months to keep trade flowing.",
      "Northern Ireland had a separate arrangement.",
      "Brexit was hugely divisive, both politically and socially, dominating political debate and with arguments about its impacts raging for years.",
      "Five years on from the day Britain formally left the EU, BBC Verify has examined five important ways Brexit has affected Britain.",
      "1) Trade",
      "Economists and analysts generally assess the impact of leaving the EU single market and customs union on 1 Jan 2021 on the UK's goods trade as having been negative.",
      "This is despite the fact that the UK negotiated a free trade deal with the EU and avoided tariffs - or taxes - being imposed on the import and export of goods.",
      "The negative impact comes from so-called \"non-tariff barriers\" - time consuming and sometimes complicated new paperwork that businesses have to fill out when importing and exporting to the EU.",
      "There is some disagreement about how negative the specific Brexit impact has been.",
      "Some recent studies suggest that UK goods exports are 30% lower than they would have been if we had not left the single market and customs union.",
      "Some suggest only a 6% reduction.",
      "We can't be certain because the results depend heavily on the method chosen by researchers for measuring the \"counterfactual\", i.e what would have happened to UK exports had the country stayed in the EU.",
      "One thing we can be reasonably confident of is that small UK firms appear to be more adversely affected than larger ones.",
      "They have been less able to cope with the new post-Brexit cross-border bureaucracy. That's supported by surveys of small firms.",
      "It's also clear UK services exports - such as advertising and management consulting - have done unexpectedly well since 2021.",
      "But the working assumption of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's independent official forecaster, is still that Brexit in the long-term will reduce exports and imports of goods and services by 15% relative to otherwise. It has held this view since 2016, including under the previous Government.",
      "And the OBR's other working assumption is that the fall in trade relative to otherwise will reduce the long-term size of the UK economy by around 4% relative to otherwise, equivalent to roughly \u00a3100bn in today's money.",
      "The OBR says it could revise both these assumptions based on new evidence and studies. The estimated negative economic impact could come down if the trade impact judged to be less severe. Yet there is no evidence, so far, to suggest that it will turn into a positive impact.",
      "After Brexit, the UK has been able to strike its own trade deals with other countries.",
      "There have been new trade deals with Australia and New Zealand and the government has been pursuing new agreements with the US and India.",
      "But their impact on the economy is judged by the government's own official impact assessments to be small relative to the negative impact on UK- EU trade.",
      "However, some economists argue there could still be potential longer term economic benefits for the UK from not having to follow EU laws and regulations affecting sectors such as Artificial Intelligence.",
      "2) Immigration",
      "Immigration was a key theme in the 2016 referendum campaign, centred on freedom of movement within the EU, under which UK and EU citizens could freely move to visit, study, work and live.",
      "There has been a big fall in EU immigration and EU net migration (immigration minus emigration) since the referendum and this accelerated after 2020 due to the end of freedom of movement.",
      "But there have been large increases in net migration from the rest of the world since 2020.",
      "A post-Brexit immigration system came into force in January 2021.",
      "Under this system, EU and non-EU citizens both need to get work visas in order to work in the UK (except Irish citizens, who can still live and work in the UK without a visa).",
      "The two main drivers of the increase in non-EU immigration since 2020 are work visas (especially in health and care) and international students and their dependents.",
      "UK universities started to recruit more non-EU overseas students as their financial situation deteriorated.",
      "The re-introduction of the right of overseas students to stay and work in Britain after graduation by Boris Johnson's government also made the UK more attractive to international students.",
      "Subsequent Conservative governments reduced the rights of people on work and student visas to bring dependents and those restrictions have been retained by Labour.",
      "3) Travel",
      "Freedom of movement ended with Brexit, also affecting tourists and business travellers.",
      "British passport holders can no longer use \"EU/EEA/CH\" lanes at EU border crossing points.",
      "People can still visit the EU as a tourist for 90 days in any 180 day period without requiring a visa, provided they have at least three months remaining on their passports at the time of their return.",
      "This applies both to the UK citizens going to the EU and vice versa.",
      "However, a bigger change in terms of travel is on the horizon.",
      "In 2025, the EU is planning to introduce a new electronic Entry Exit System (EES) - an automated IT system for registering travellers from non-EU countries.",
      "This will register the person's name, type of the travel document, biometric data (fingerprints and captured facial images) and the date and place of entry and exit.",
      "It will replace the manual stamping of passports. The impact of this is unclear, but some in the travel sector have expressed fears it could potentially add to border queues as people leave the UK.",
      "The EES was due to be introduced in November 2024 but was postponed until 2025, with no new date for implementation yet set.",
      "And six months after the introduction of EES, the EU says it will introduce a new European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS). UK citizens will have to obtain ETIAS clearance for travel to 30 European countries.",
      "ETIAS clearance will cost \u20ac7 (\u00a35.90) and be valid for up to three years or until someone's passport expires, whichever comes first. If people get a new passport, they need to get a new ETIAS travel authorisation.",
      "Meanwhile, the UK is introducing its equivalent to ETIAS for EU citizens from 2 April 2025 (though Irish citizens will be exempt). The UK permit - to be called an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - will cost \u00a316.",
      "4) Laws",
      "Legal sovereignty - the ability of the UK to make its own laws and not have to follow EU ones - was another prominent Brexit referendum campaign promise.",
      "To minimise disruption immediately following Brexit in 2020, the UK incorporated thousands of EU laws into UK law, becoming known as \"retained EU law\".",
      "According to the latest government count there were 6,901 individual pieces of retained EU law covering things like working time, equal pay, food labelling and environmental standards.",
      "The previous Conservative government initially set a deadline of the end of 2023 to axe these EU laws.",
      "But with so much legislation to consider there was concern there was not enough time to review all the laws properly.",
      "In May 2023 Kemi Badenoch - the Trade Secretary at the time - announced only 600 EU laws would be axed by the end of 2023, with another 500 financial services laws set to disappear later.",
      "Most were relatively obscure regulations and many of them had been superseded or become irrelevant.",
      "All other EU legislation was kept, though ministers reserved powers to change them in future.",
      "And the UK has changed some EU laws. For example, it banned the export of live animals from Great Britain for slaughter and fattening and changed EU laws on gene editing crops.",
      "Brexit has also given the UK more freedom in certain areas of tax law.",
      "EU member states are prohibited from charging VAT on education under an EU directive. Leaving the EU enabled Labour to impose VAT on private school fees.",
      "A zero rate of VAT on tampons and other sanitary products was introduced by the UK government in 2021. This would not have been possible in the EU as the EU VAT Directive at the time mandated a minimum 5% tax on all sanitary products. However, in April 2022 the EU's rules changed so the bloc also now allows a zero rate on sanitary products.",
      "5) Money",
      "The money the UK sent to the EU was a controversial theme in the 2016 referendum, particularly the Leave campaign's claim the UK sent \u00a3350m every week to Brussels.",
      "The UK's gross public sector contribution to the EU Budget in 2019-20, the final financial year before Brexit, was \u00a318.3bn, equivalent to around \u00a3352m per week, according to the Treasury.",
      "The UK continued paying into the EU Budget during the transition period but since 31 December 2020 it has not made these contributions.",
      "However, those EU Budgets contributions were always partially recycled to the UK via payments to British farmers under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and \"structural funding\" - development grants to support skills, employment and training in certain economically disadvantaged regions of the nation.

    "story": [
      "Heathrow's third runway can be built and operating in a decade's time, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said.",
      "Reeves told the BBC she wanted to see \"spades in the ground\" in the current Parliament and planes to start using the runway by 2035.",
      "She also said that Sadiq Khan, the Labour Mayor of London who is opposed to Heathrow's expansion, could not stop the new runway.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the Conservatives were in favour of a third runway at Heathrow \"in principle\" but \"it remains to be seen\" whether it can be built in a decade.",
      "The extra runway at Heathrow was one of a number of infrastructure projects announced by the chancellor on Wednesday as part of the government's plans to boost economic growth.",
      "\"We think that we can get flights off within a decade,\" Reeves told the BBC.",
      "\"I say that because we're not just announcing that we back it, we are changing the way that our planning system works to make it easier to deliver projects like the third runway at Heathrow.\"",
      "When asked if Sadiq Khan could stop the expansion the chancellor said \"no\".",
      "\"There can be judicial reviews but we are confident that this airport expansion will happen, that we will get the third runway built,\" she said.",
      "Some have argued that it will take much longer than a decade for a third runway at Heathrow to become reality.",
      "A formal planning process has to take place, which could take between 18 months and two years. Any judicial review of the plan could take another year and a half, while actually building the runway could take about seven years.",

      "On Sunday, Reeves told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg that \"sustainable aviation and economic growth go hand in hand\" but said plans would be set out in due course.",
      "Speaking at a weekly meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party, Reeves said: \"Kick starting economic growth is this Labour government's number one mission because I do not believe low growth is our destiny.",

    "story": [
      "The expansion of Heathrow Airport has been backed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who is hoping investment in a third runway, along with a series of other transport projects, will drive economic growth in the UK.",
      "Reeves has said expansion of the UK's biggest airport is \"badly needed\" and could lead to 100,000 jobs.",
      "However opponents claim expanding the airport would lead to higher emissions and blight local communities with extra noise and pollution. Friends of the Earth has said it would be \"hugely irresponsible in the midst of a climate emergency\".",
      "So is a third runway at Heathrow the right way to bring an immediate boost to the economy in any case?",
      "In terms of actual spades in the ground at Heathrow, the short answer is no.",
      "A third runway has been on the cards for many years. It has also been kicked into the long grass on several occasions.",
      "The argument in favour has always been an economic one. Large airports create jobs, promote trade and bring in both business travellers and tourists.",
      "Heathrow currently handles \u00a3200bn worth of trade a year and - the airport's owner would argue - provides a vital avenue for exports, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "But Heathrow's infrastructure is straining at the seams.",
      "Last year, a record 83.9 million passengers passed through its terminals with its two runways handling around 1,300 landings and take-offs every day.",
      "Flights from the airport are currently capped at a maximum of 480,000 per year and in practical terms it has reached that limit.",
      "A third runway would potentially increase the number of flights permitted to 720,000.",

      "But a third runway at Heathrow is unlikely to become a reality for many years.",
      "HS2 blew billions - here's how and why",
      "Reeves hints at support for Heathrow expansion",

      "Secondly, it is highly likely any decision in favour of a third runway would be subject to a judicial review.",
      "Expansion of Heathrow is highly controversial - opponents include environmental groups, local authorities as well as nearby residents, and this stage could take another year and a half.",
      "So even with favourable winds, it could take at least three years to get to the construction stage which is itself expected to take another six or seven years.",
      "In terms of what can be achieved sooner that could potentially create bankable short-term benefits, separate projects to expand Gatwick and Luton airports are well-advanced and could be signed off by the Transport Secretary within weeks.",
      "The real value of backing a third runway at Heathrow is the less tangible but no less important signal to investors about the UK's attitude towards major infrastructure projects, say supporters.",
      "The uncertainty over the construction of the HS2 high speed line under the previous Conservative government is widely believed to have undermined confidence in the country's ability to turn ambitious plans into reality.",
      "A strong commitment to Heathrow expansion might help to reverse that perception.",
      "With the plan itself expected to cost close to \u00a320bn, insiders say firm government support will be vital if it goes ahead.",
      "Although the project would be privately-funded, people close to the scheme warn that it could not proceed without close co-ordination with ministers - including changes to the policy framework that sets out how the costs of the investment can be recovered.",
      "For the chancellor herself, there could be a short-term benefit in throwing her weight behind airport expansion plans now.",
      "Some economists have argued that if additional growth can be factored into economic forecasts currently being prepared by the Office for Budget Responsibility, it might make it easier for her to meet self-imposed fiscal rules within this parliament.",
      "If not, then Reeves is likely to bump into her own \"iron\" fiscal rules to pay for day-to- day spending out of tax receipts by 2029 - meaning spending cuts or further tax rises.",

      "Heathrow expansion",
      "The chancellor said that allowing Heathrow to build a third runway would \"create 100,000 jobs\", boost investment and exports and \"unlock futher growth\".",
      "She cited a new report by the consultancy Frontier Economics which found it could increase the UK's potential GDP by 2050 by 0.43%, around \u00a317bn.",
      "That is broadly in line with the findings of an independent commission by Sir Howard Davies in 2015, which concluded a third runway at Heathrow would support UK trade and enhance productivity and push up GDP by 0.65-0.75% by 2050 relative to otherwise.",
      "However, most analysts believe it would likely take many years before shovels went into the ground to start building a new runway, even with new reforms to speed up the planning process.",
      "And the government will have a difficult balancing act to both expand Heathrow and meet its climate goals.",
      "BBC Verify asked the Treasury for its source for the 100,000 jobs figure and it pointed to a 2017 report by the Department for Transport estimating that a new runway at Heathrow could add between 57,000 and 114,000 additional local jobs. Though that report added that \"these jobs are not additional at the national level, as some jobs may have been displaced from other airports or other sectors.\"",
      "Oxford-Cambridge Growth Corridor",
      "The chancellor in her speech claimed an Oxford and Cambridge Growth Corridor \"could add up to \u00a378bn to the UK economy by 2035\".",
      "This corridor is a resurrection of the previous government's plans to join Oxford and Cambridge with new transport links and allow those two university and research hubs to expand.",
      "In support of the chancellor's figure, the Treasury has cited research by an industry group called the Oxford-Cambridge Supercluster.",
      "This research shows that this \u00a378bn is a \"cumulative figure\" over 10 years, not the boost in a given year.",
      "The analysis suggests the project could add \u00a325bn in Gross Value Added (GVA) a year to the UK economy by 2035.",
      "That would constitute roughly a permanent 1% boost to UK GDP by that date.",
      "Estimates of the impacts of an infrastructure project on growth are inherently uncertain and very sensitive to the assumptions of researchers about what would have happened to growth if it had never been built.",
      "Yet most economists do believe infrastructure projects, especially those that allow already productive places to expand, will ultimately help the UK economy grow more rapidly than otherwise.",
      "Ben Caswell, a senior economist at The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr), said: \"Big infrastructure projects typically deliver growth over the long term, approximately 10 to 20 years.\"",
      "\"There may be a small demand side boost in the short term when shovels are in the ground, but nothing so significant that you would see it in headline GDP growth figures.",
      "\"However, after the project is complete, the supply capacity of the economy is permanently enhanced, and, all other things equal, that delivers higher sustained GDP growth than would have otherwise been.\"",
      "Pensions reform",
      "Another reform the chancellor says will be pro-growth is enabling UK companies to access the funds from their \"defined benefit pension\" pots, held on behalf of their workforces to fund their retirement.",
      "Defined benefit pension schemes guarantee an annual pension payment to retired workers, based on their salary while they were in work.",
      "Many of these defined benefit pension pots have moved into surplus in recent years due to the rise in interest rates since the pandemic, meaning their financial assets (their investments) are greater than their financial liabilities (what they have to pay out to pensioners).",
      "The Treasury has said that approximately 75% of schemes are now in surplus and that the total surplus adds up to \u00a3160bn.",
      "The chancellor wants to legislate to allow the firms to use these funds to invest, while keeping safeguards to protect and guarantee workers' pension pay-outs.",
      "Pension shake-up plan aims to boost growthWhat's the plan for a third runway at Heathrow Airport?At a glance: What was in Rachel Reeves's speech?",

      "What's the plan for a third runway at Heathrow Airport?",
      "At a glance: What was in Rachel Reeves's speech?",
      "Measuring the size of the surplus of defined benefit scheme depends on various complex assumptions about the scheme and its relationship to the employer.",
      "The official Pension Regulator estimates that on one measurement the size in September 2024 was \u00a3207bn, but \u00a3137bn on a different measurement.",
      "The Treasury's estimate is roughly midway between the two.",
      "If such sums were deployed that could, in theory, make a positive difference to overall UK business investment, which is regarded by economists as both a short term and a long term driver of GDP growth.",
      "Total business investment in 2023, according to official data, was \u00a3258bn.",
      "But the size of any boost from this pension reform would depend on companies being willing to invest their surpluses, which is subject to great uncertainty as many firms have been looking to offload their defined benefit pension schemes to insurance companies in recent years.",

      "She'd hate the comparison, but the way she's been talking over recent weeks sounds more like a Conservative chancellor.",
      "She wants to get rid of barriers to business and make it harder for green groups to put the brakes on big development. She's easing off plans to make life more expensive for wealthy non-doms \u2013 and is expected to approve new airport runways and cut welfare.",
      "It doesn't sound much like Reeves' Budget in October, in which she raised whopping taxes, increased spending on public services and reminded us, time and time again, how much trouble the economy was in and how the Conservatives \u2013 she claimed \u2013 had left that fabled \u00a322bn black hole.",

      "This is pretty cheap for central London. Similar drinks at pubs within easy walking distance of Parliament, such as the Red Lion, the St Stephen's Tavern or the Marquis of Granby would set you back a bit more (according to our extensive research).",

      "The North Norfolk MP says this is \"problematic\" because \"it creates all sorts of circumstances where behaviours that are not only undesirable but in some cases wholly toxic end up becoming accepted as the price of socialising\".",
      "Commons leader Lucy Powell argued this week that it was safer for MPs and their staff to drink in Westminster's bars, where they are protected by security guards and codes of conduct, than in ordinary London pubs.",

      "\"If I wanted to go for a drink with my team, I could choose anywhere in London where no one would know who we were and no one would know that we were there and that's actually a far more secure way of having a safe night out.\"",

      "Overall levels of the virus have not yet reached the peak of recent years.",
      "But one farmer, who has previously lost 30% of his flock because of bird flu, told the BBC that, without a vaccine, it was only a matter of time before \"it all kicks off again\".",

      "He added that the organisation was a \"huge supporter\" of vaccination for poultry but recognised there were challenges, including the cost to farmers and the impact on trade with other countries that prohibit imports from producers that vaccinate.",
      "Meanwhile, there are also some scientific concerns about bird flu vaccinations.",
      "Recent work by researchers from the UK's Royal Veterinary College and institutions in China found possible evidence that they may be linked to changes in how the virus evolves.",
      "They carried out genetic analysis of avian flu samples collected from wild birds and farmed poultry between 1996 and 2023.",
      "While they found that infections occurred more often in unvaccinated birds, they also found that in countries with high vaccination rates, there was a higher rate of change in the virus itself.",
      "They said such evolution could, in theory, lead to vaccines needing to be updated frequently to remain effective and to the virus spilling over into unvaccinated populations. They acknowledged that more research was needed to establish whether there was a direct causal link between vaccination and virus evolution.",

      "If you have ever struggled with the sudden shift in routine imposed by the seasonal \"springing forward\" and \"falling backward\" of the clocks, spare a thought for the sled dogs of Ontario, Canada.",
      "Researchers say the time shift is measurably unsettling for those working dogs, whose days are dictated by strict schedules.",
      "When scientists from the University of Toronto put movement sensors on a group of Canadian sled dogs, they saw that the animals were active and moving around almost exactly an hour early - the morning after the clocks went back.",
      "In contrast, pet dogs of the same breeds as the working dogs showed no measurable effect - apparently resting peacefully during their extra hour in bed.",
      "\"I wasn't expecting any differences between the two groups [of dogs],\" said Lavania Nagendran, one of the lead researchers.",
      "\"So it was interesting to see that the dogs were so aligned to their routine.\"",
      "The study, published in the journal PLoS One, is part of a wider project investigating the differences in behaviour between wolves and domestic dogs.",
      "\"Not all animals can just switch up their schedule based on human influences, [like changing the clocks]\" said Ming Fei Li, the co-lead researcher.",
      "She explained that she and her colleagues hoped to learn whether wolves are also able to adjust their activity patterns \u2013 and whether this flexibility evolved naturally in canines, or if it was imposed on dogs when we domesticated them.",
      "Much of the research into the impact of changing the clocks -  on health and sleep - is focused on humans. Previous studies have suggested that the time shift causes disrupted, or fragmented, sleep and that this can last up to a week. Research has even found an increase in fatal traffic accidents immediately after the clocks go back or forward.",
      "This is the first study to investigate its effect in domestic dogs.",
      "The researchers put their motion trackers on 25 sled dogs and 29 pets \u2013 all of which were in or near Ontario, in Canada.",
      "For the sled dogs, the time change was a sudden shift in a strict daily routine. Prior to the clocks going back, handlers would arrive at their kennels at sunrise. The morning when the clocks went back, those sled dogs were up, active and moving around an hour before the handlers appeared.",
      "For most of those working dogs, however, the disruption lasted just a day. The following morning, the majority of the dogs' activity again aligned with the arrival of their human handlers.",
      "However, for pet dogs there was no measurable disruption. After the clocks went back, their activity in the morning seemed to adjust to this new, human-imposed schedule.",
      "\"When we've spoken to pet owners, everyone comments that \u2013 with that hour change - their dog or cat is up in the morning, going crazy, waiting to be fed.",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 22:11:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Scientists say the fires that engulfed Los Angeles were made 35% more likely due to climate warming.",
    "story": [
      "Climate change was a major factor behind the hot, dry weather that gave rise to the devastating LA fires, a scientific study has confirmed.",
      "It made those weather conditions about 35% more likely, according to World Weather Attribution - globally recognised for their studies linking extreme weather to climate change.",
      "The authors noted that the LA wildfire season is getting longer while the rains that normally put out the blazes have reduced.",
      "The scientists highlight that these wildfires are highly complex with multiple factors playing a role, but they are confident that a warming climate is making LA more prone to intense fire events.",
      "\"Climate change increased the risk of the devastating LA wildfires,\" said Dr Clair Barnes, from Imperial College London, the study's lead author.",
      "\"Drought conditions are more frequently pushing into winter, increasing the chance a fire will break out during strong Santa Ana winds that can turn small ignitions into deadly infernos.\"",
      "The Santa Ana winds are strong and gusty east or north-easterly winds that blow from inland California towards the coast.",
      "What are Santa Ana winds and how are they fuelling LA wildfires?",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Four ways climate change worsens extreme weather",
      "Around 30 people have died and more than 10,000 homes have been destroyed in the fast-spreading, destructive fires that broke out in early January.",
      "This new study looks at what are termed the fire-prone conditions that can lead to dangerous conflagrations.",
      "It's been carried out by a team of researchers from World Weather Attribution (WWA), a global group that publishes rapid analyses of climate-related weather events.",
      "They use climate models to simulate how the warming that has occurred since the middle of the 19th century is influencing heatwaves, droughts, floods and fires.",
      "The widespread burning of coal, oil and gas in the wake of the industrial revolution has driven billions of tonnes of planet-warming gases into the atmosphere.",
      "Acting like a blanket, these gases have driven up temperatures by around 1.2C since then.",
      "By using climate models and statistical methods along with real world observations, the WWA group have been able to show how much of an influence climate warming has had on extreme events.",
      "In the case of the LA fires, they found that the hot, dry conditions that drove them are expected to occur once every 17 years.",
      "This is an increase in likelihood of around 35% compared to a world that hadn't experienced warming.",
      "\"We actually see that the models show very much the same results that the [real world] observations have,\" said Dr Friederike Otto, the head of World Weather Attribution.",
      "\"So there, in this combined index, we are quite confident about the result... we have actually a signal that we can say that we definitely can attribute that, also quantitatively.\"",
      "The researchers also examined other important variables that can lead to wildfire including the length of the fire season.",
      "By analysing weather observations, the scientists found that this has increased by around 23 days since the world began warming, around 1850.",
      "The team say that this means the dry conditions and the Santa Ana winds that are crucial for the spread of fires, are increasingly overlapping.",
      "Another key element is drought.",
      "Dry conditions in the LA area over the October to December period are now about 2.4 times more likely than before humans starting using fossil fuels on a large scale.",
      "The researchers are clear that climate change increased the probability of the hot, dry conditions that gave rise to the fires.",
      "However, the authors are more cautious about the link between rising temperatures and the longer fire season or decreased rainfall, saying that the models did not show a significant connection.",
      "Despite these reservations, the conclusion is that a warmer world increased the chances of the devastating wildfires occurring - as more fossil fuels continue to be burnt, those chances will continue to rise.",
      "\"Overall the paper finds that climate change has made the Los Angeles fires more likely despite some statistical uncertainty,\" said Prof Gabi Hegerl, from the University of Edinburgh, who was not part of the study team.",
      "\"This is a carefully researched result that should be taken seriously,\" she said in a statement.",
      "The new work builds on research that was published while the fires were still burning fiercely.",
      "That study linked the wildfires to what's termed \"climate whiplash.\"",
      "The idea is that very wet years are followed almost immediately by very dry ones, which increases the risk of fires.",
      "This is what happened in LA, when two wet winters were followed by an extremely dry autumn and winter this year \u2013 the wet weather promoted the growth of grass and shrubs that became the fuel for the fires that took off in the gusting Santa Ana winds.",

      "Even Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, the operating system which kick-started the open source revolution in the early 1990s, noted at the Open Source Summit Europe in September that the \u201ckernel maintainers are aging\u201d.",
      "Amanda Brock, CEO of OpenUK, a non-profit organization which represents the UK\u2019s open technology community, says younger developers might not appreciate the grip that closed software companies had in earlier decades.",
      "\u201cYou've got a next generation who haven't engaged as a philanthropic community and volunteer community in the same way, at the same scale.\u201d",
      "There are technology barriers to address too. Many key open source projects were originally written in C, a coding language first developed in the early 1970s.",
      "While C is still taught in universities, it is no longer widely used in the commercial world, Mr Degioanni explains. \u201cThe fact that C is the main language makes it harder to attract a younger generation.\u201d",
      "There are ways to work around this. Mr Degioanni says both Wireshark and a project he founded, Falco, rely on \u201cplug-ins\u201d, which can allow new functionality to be written in different languages.",
      "Mr Torvalds has given his blessing to the adoption of Rust as a programming language for Linux, while noting the \u201cRust versus C discussion has taken almost religious overtones in certain areas.\u201d",
      "When it comes to steering projects into the future, leaders and maintainers have the option of handing over control to foundations. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, for example, oversees 208 projects, with more than 250,000 contributors. Wireshark has its own independent foundation, with Mr Degioanni as a board member.",
      "Not everyone subscribes to the foundation model. Stenberg and his collaborators have kept curl completely independent. \u201cI'm much better off without being in their neighbourhoods and just running my own neighbourhood,\u201d he says.",
      "And foundations still face the issue of ensuring a steady supply of fresh developers to keep projects alive, he notes.",
      "Miss Brock says it\u2019s essential that the open source community consider how it encourages younger people to participate.",
      "This is about showing that while being a contributor can be challenging it\u2019s also career enhancing, giving young people an entry into established ecosystems and an opportunity to finesse and highlight their technical skills.",
      "\u201cIt's a way to help STEM talent flight,\u201d Miss Brock adds. \u201cBecause people can work from home in the UK or whatever country they\u2019re in.\u201d",
      "Degioanni is more sanguine. Even if there\u2019s \u201cprobably less visceral enthusiasm\u201d for the concept of open source, he says, the fundamental idea of being able to modify software is now a given.",
      "And, he continues, \u201cI've worked with open source my whole life. I've created my own projects. I've seen people join the projects that I created. I've seen people start their own open source projects.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, he says, there is a \u201cjoy, especially for a young person\u201d in creating software, seeing it being used and sparking a community.",
      "\u201cThat feeling doesn't get old,\u201d he says. Even if the pioneers who popularized the earliest open source projects do.",

      "\"The national army gave up fighting and we were forced to withdraw.\"",
      "Romania's foreign ministry spokesman Andrei \u021a\u0103rnea told the BBC that \"complex\" negotiations followed, which saw the M23 hand over the Romanian fighters - whom he described as private employees of the DR Congo government on an army training mission - to Rwanda.",
      "Goma sits right on the border with Rwanda - and the mercenaries were filmed by journalists as they crossed over, surrendering to body searches and other checks.",
      "Before they crossed over, phone footage shows M23 commander Willy Ngoma berating one of the Romanians in French, telling him to sit on the ground, cross his legs and put his hands over his head.",

      "\"They recruited you with a salary of $8,000 a month, you eat well,\" Ngoma yelled, pointing out the disparity between that and a Congolese army recruit's pay.",
      "\"We are fighting for our future. Do not come for adventure here,\" he warned.",
      "It is not clear where Ngoma got the $8,000 figure, but the contract shown to the BBC by a former Romanian mercenary in October detailed that \"strictly confidential remuneration\" for senior personnel started at $5,000 per month during active duty and $3,000 during periods of leave.",
      "The agreement outlines an \"indefinite period\" of service, with contractors scheduled to take a one-month break after every three months of deployment.",
      "I had met the ex-mercenary in Romania's capital, Bucharest, where I had gone to investigate Asociatia RALF, which a group of UN experts say is a Romanian enterprise with \"ex-Romanians from the French Foreign Legion\".",

      "The UN experts say that two private military companies were brought on board to bolster its forces in 2022, not long after the M23 had regrouped and begun capturing territory in North Kivu.",
      "The province has been unstable for decades with numerous militias operating there making money from its minerals like gold and coltan - used to make batteries for electric vehicles and mobile phones.",
      "The first firm that was signed up was Agemira RDC, headed by Olivier Bazin, a French-Congolese national. The experts say the company employed Bulgarian, Belarusian, Georgian, Algerian, French and Congolese nationals.",
      "This outfit was tasked with refurbishing and increasing DR Congo's military air assets, rehabilitating airports and ensuring the physical security of aircraft and other strategic locations.",
      "A second contract was signed between Congo Protection, a Congolese company represented by Thierry Kongolo, and Asociatia RALF.",
      "According to the UN experts, the contract specified that Asociatia RALF had expertise and extensive experience in the provision of security management services.",
      "It would provide training and instruction to the Congolese troops on the ground by means of a contingent of 300 instructors, many of them Romanians.",
      "When I spoke to Mr Potra in July about the extent of his group's involvement on the ground and whether it had engaged in fighting, he said: \"We have to protect ourselves. If M23 attacks us, they won't simply say: 'Oh, you're just instructors - go home'.\"",
      "Mr Potra was hands-on during the DR Congo mission until a few months ago when he returned to Romania - and has since been embroiled in a controversy amid the annulled presidential election there.",

      "He said the Romanians did much more on the ground in North Kivu province: \"Only a very small number of us were actually trainers.",
      "\"We worked long shifts of up to 12 hours, guarding key positions outside Goma.\"",
      "He maintained the pay was not worth the risks the military contractors had to take.",
      "\"Missions were disorganised, working conditions poor. Romanians should stop going there because it's dangerous.\"",

      "The family of Vasile Badea, one of two Romanians who were killed last February when an army convoy was ambushed by the M23 fighters on its way to Sake, a frontline town near Goma, told the BBC he had been a police officer.",

      "\"We are very busy trying to find 800 people who need to be mentally prepared for the job and know how to fight,\" the mercenary recruiter told the BBC.",
      "He said he did not work for Asociatia RALF, but refused to say which outfit he was with.",
      "\"The recruits will be placed in positions corresponding to the level of their training, earning between $400-$550 per day,\" he explained.",

    "story": [
      "The aviation world is struggling to understand how a deadly mid-air collision between a passenger plane and military helicopter was able to happen in what one expert described as \"the most controlled bit of airspace in the world\".",
      "A US Army Black Hawk helicopter with a crew of three collided with an American Airlines jet carrying 64 people seconds before the passenger aircraft was due to land at Washington National airport.",
      "Both aircraft were sent careering into the icy Potomac River on Wednesday night.",
      "The exact cause of the crash remains unknown.",
      "Officials will release a preliminary report within 30 days, according to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) - which is leading the investigation.",
      "Crews were able to recover flight data recorders - known as the black boxes - from the wreckage on Thursday, according to the BBC's US news partner CBS. The devices can help investigators pinpoint what led up to a crash.",
      "Restricted airspace",
      "Airspace over the District of Columbia is heavily restricted to protect both national security and the buildings that house core aspects of US government.",
      "Commercial planes are prevented from flying over the Pentagon, the White House and other historic landmarks.",
      "Yet the area sees a lot of air traffic, Aviation attorney Jim Brachle, who has handled numerous litigation matters related to jets and Reagan airport, told the BBC.",
      "There is commercial traffic but also private aviation and helicopters that fly around the city, often carrying high-ranking officials and politicians between sensitive locations.",
      "\"You got these really narrow pathways in and out and you've got a lot of congestion and extra airplanes, so you're putting a lot of aircraft in a really confined space,\" he said.",
      "Jeff Guzzetti, a former aircraft accident investigator for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the NTSB, told BBC Newshour that it seems the helicopter was in communication with the control tower before the accident. The air traffic controller pointed out the American Airlines flight to the helicopter, he said.",
      "\"The helicopter pilot indicated he had the airplane in sight and was going to visually separate from it \u2013 and then the accident happened shortly thereafter - so there's going to be a lot of questions about exactly what did the helicopter pilot see?\" Mr Guzzetti said.",
      "Helicopter zones",
      "Todd Inman, part of the five-member NTSB board, said that DC is also a \"unique environment\" because of helicopters and specific zones they're allowed to fly.",
      "\"If you look at DC, you see a lot of helicopters going down into this area so there's a very well-defined system in that regard,\" he said.",
      "Mr Inman could not provide any specifics on altitude of the helicopter before it collided with the American Airlines flight.",
      "Mr Brachle, who has handled numerous litigation matters related to jets and Reagan airport, told the BBC the question that remains is how two aircraft ended up in the same airspace.",
      "\"What's really unique about Reagan is right there on the river. There's also a helicopter route that crosses right through that final approach and that's at or below 200 feet,\" he said.",
      "Brachle said the routes for both helicopters and the approach for aircraft intersect.",
      "\"You're putting potentially two different aircraft in a really small space with hardly any separation,\" he said. \"If you get one that's maybe a little too low, one that's a little too high, you end up being in the same spot.\"",
      "'Nexus' of aviation systems",
      "Aviation consultant Philip Butterworth-Hayes said the incident occurred at the \"nexus of different aviation systems\", including civilian and military systems, as well as procedures specific to the airport.",
      "\"You are at the border of three or four aviation systems here - and it's at those borders where most accidents tend to happen,\" he added.",
      "But UK-based aviation expert John Strickland said the amount of commercial air traffic in the area cannot fully explain why the deadly collision was able to happen.",

      "\"So DC is not different in that sense to London or New York\u2026 it's not totally unusual.\"",
      "Mr Butterworth-Hayes continued: \"This is the most controlled bit of airspace in the world. You have both US government and civilian systems - Ronald Reagan airport is even owned by the government, it's one of the very, very few like that.",
      "\"This really is the most secure - and should be the safest - airspace in the world, given the number of security and civilian safety organisations working in that area.\"",
      "Footage shows aircraft on radar systems",
      "The last fatal crash involving a commercial plane in the US was in February 2009. Officials and experts alike have stressed that this type of incident is incredibly rare due to tight safety restrictions on all types of flights.",
      "Footage obtained from an air traffic control source by CBS News, the BBC's US news partner, showed the two aircraft which appear to have been involved in the crash clearly visible on radar systems accessible to controllers.",
      "Audio sourced by BBC News appears to confirm the helicopter was in contact with air traffic control on the ground at the airport.",
      "The helicopter was asked if it had the passenger plane \"in sight\" and to \"pass behind\" it. In the audio that follows, controllers appear to realise there has been a collision and can be heard directing other planes in the air to neighbouring airports.",
      "Mr Butterworth-Hayes said an in-air collision like this requires a number of things going wrong.",
      "He said that in order to fly in civilian airspace, the military helicopter would have needed to be fitted with a transponder alerting surrounding aircraft to its position.",
      "That means both aircraft should have been able to see each other, he says, plus there would have been instructions from air traffic control and an aircraft protection safety device that operate separately from each other.",
      "\"On this occasion, you have these two different systems and both should have been able to keep these aircraft separate.\"",
      "The Black Hawk helicopter was part of B Company, 12th Aviation Battalion. It left Fort Belvoir, a military base in Virginia, and was taking part in a training exercise.",
      "Helicopter crew 'fairly experienced'",
      "US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth has said the helicopter's crew were \"fairly experienced\" and taking part in an annual night flight training session.",
      "Speaking to CNN, Cedric Leighton - a retired US Air Force colonel - said it was normal for that type of military aircraft to be training at night in the area, particularly to make sure pilots are proficient with using instruments needed to fly in the dark.",
      "He said one of the unit's duties is to transport high-ranking personnel around the capital - though none were on board at the time of the crash as it was a training flight.",
      "The unit's pilots are expected to be proficient at flying in DC's busy airspace and \"train in order to avoid incidents like this\", he added.",
      "Mr Butterworth-Hayes said only experienced pilots would be able to train in such a busy section of airspace.",
      "\"Whether it's training for new systems or equipment, we need to know what systems the pilot had turned on in the helicopter and whether they had all the safety systems on board, or whether they were trying a new procedure or new route.\"",

      "Trump and his fellow Republicans have regularly attacked \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" programmes in the federal government.",
      "His team has made undoing such programmes a core part of their first days in office, saying they have divided Americans and weakened the country.",
      "And less than 24 hours after the first major US air disaster in more than a decade, Trump \u2013 along with his secretaries of transportation and defence, and his vice-president \u2013 took turns hammering their point, even as they provided no evidence that federal hiring practices had any connection to this particular crash.",
      "Asked by a reporter how he could blame diversity programmes for the crash when the investigation had only just begun, the president responded: \"Because I have common sense.\"",
      "At other moments, he acknowledged there was no confirmed cause, saying \"it's all under investigation\".",
      "Trump said the hiring guidance for the FAA's diversity and inclusion programme included preference for those with disabilities involving \"hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, epilepsy, severe intellectual disability, psychiatric disability and dwarfism\".",

The agency was seeking people with \"targeted disabilities\" that the federal government was prioritising for recruitment at the time.",
      "But it's unclear how that drive to make recruitment more diverse may have impacted the ranks of air traffic controllers, who President Trump said needed to all be \"naturally talented geniuses\". The FAA has more than 35,000 employees, only a fraction of which perform that role.",
      "In response to criticisms over diversity hiring practices last year, the agency released a statement asserting that all new hires must meet \"rigorous qualifications\" that \"vary by position\".",

      "\"We had a situation where we had a helicopter that had an ability to stop,\" he said. \"For some reason, it just kept going.\"",

But warships previously docked at the port have not appeared in satellite images since the collapse of the Assad regime - which Moscow backed throughout the Syrian civil war.",
      "The Kremlin has signalled its desire to retain control over the base, and said in December that it was speaking to the new authorities about maintaining a presence there.",
      "However, evidence suggests that Moscow has now decided to move valuable equipment away from the port. Satellite images have also shown Russian hardware being removed from the nearby Hmeimim airbase for several weeks.",

      "In it, the president confirmed he had spoken to Kagame about the escalating conflict and that both leaders had agreed \"on the urgent need for a ceasefire and the resumption of peace talks by all parties to the conflict\".",
      "Ramaphosa also insisted, in a later statement, that the presence of South African troops in DR Congo was not a \"declaration of war against any country or state\" - an apparent reference to Rwanda.",
      "South Africa's Defence Minister Angie Motshekga, however, had a slightly different take, telling reporters: \"There's been no hostilities between us, it's just that when they were firing above our heads, the president did warn them [that] if you're going to fire, we're going to take that as a declaration of war.\"",
      "But Ramaphosa went further on X, saying the peacekeepers were killed in attacks by the M23 and - he pointedly added - \"Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) militia\".",

      "It first joined the UN's peacekeeping mission, Monusco, following the end of the racist system of apartheid in 1994.",
      "At the time, the South Africa's military had just emerged from being regarded as a \"highly effective apartheid war-time force\" to a \"peacetime force\" left to grapple with reduced funding and a \"lack of political direction\", Thomas Mandrup, an associate professor at the country's Stellenbosch University, told the BBC.",
      "While South Africa has said its involvement in DR Congo was guided by its need to \"contribute to the stability\" of a fellow Sadc member, defence analyst Dean Wingrin said the country's economic interests also influenced its decision.",
      "\"The DRC is a very big trading partner with [us] because eastern DRC is so rich in minerals. We import a lot of minerals\u2026 from the DRC so South Africa has an interest in a peaceful DRC,\" he told the BBC.",
      "While Monusco's mission has largely been about peacekeeping, escalating tensions in the region led to the establishment of the Force Intervention Brigade in 2013 to \"actively engage\" with the numerous armed groups in eastern DR Congo.",
      "This intervention had initial success in repelling the M23, the most prominent rebel group.",
      "This was partly due to the deployment of South Africa's attack aircraft - Rooivalk - which had a \"devastating effect\" on the M23 in a short space of time, according to Mr Wingrin.",
      "The rebel group then effectively melted away and was subsequently expelled from eastern DR Congo - until its recent comeback which has seen it capture much of the region.",
      "However, South Africa's military has been in no position, this time around, to thwart the rebel group's advance as it has lost its airpower.",

      "\"We're missing that vital aircover that would've come in so handy a few days ago but is way too late now,\" he said.",
      "Mr Mandrup expressed a similar view, saying South Africa deployed its troops in 2023, ignoring warnings that \"you haven't got the capabilities needed, the defence force is in shambles and you're facing an opponent that's much better equipped than in 2013\".",
      "He added that it was difficult for South Africa to bring back its troops at this point because the \"forces are locked down and caught in two bases\".",
      "\"They can't get out, get aircover [or] reinforcements. They can't even get the wounded out,\" he said.",
      "Ramaphosa seemed to agree, saying in a recent statement that the situation in the region was \"tense, volatile and unpredictable\".",
      "In spite of this, any decision to pull South African troops out of DR Congo ultimately lies with Sadc since SAMIDRC was deployed by the 16-member regional bloc.",
      "There are reports that Sadc is set to take this decision at a summit taking place on Friday.",
      "For Mr Wingrin, there was a need for the South African government to do \"serious introspection\" over its military involvement in DR Congo.",
      "\"Is it something they want to push at all costs and what is it worth to South Africa to have sons and daughters dying so far away?\" he asked.",
      "So, South Africa's president appears to have a difficult choice \u2013 keep his soldiers in DR Congo and risk further deaths, or the embarrassment of pulling them out, presumably after negotiating safe passage for them with Rwanda.",

    "story": [
      "It begins with a phone call with a location.",
      "Once the details are received, a team from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) sets off in vehicles marked with the humanitarian organisation's logo to pick up the hostages in Gaza.",
      "Israeli military and medical personnel are also assembled at several different locations, waiting to bring them home.",
      "\u200b\u200bThe hostage releases, watched around the world, come after months of tense negotiations aimed at ending a war that began on 7 October 2023, when Hamas fighters killed some 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped 251 others.",
      "In the 15 months that followed, more than 47,000 Palestinians were killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and many more lost their homes in Israeli bombardments.",
      "Under the terms of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas that began on 19 January, a total of 33 Israeli hostages are due to be released and returned to their families during the first phase, lasting six weeks.",
      "In exchange, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails are being freed.",
      "If anything goes wrong, it risks the hostages remaining in captivity, and reigniting the war.",
      "\"This is more than just a drive,\" says ICRC spokesperson Sarah Davies.",
      "\"These operations may seem simple, but in fact they are very complex and require rigorous security measures to minimise the risks to those involved.\"",
      "The ICRC, which acts as a neutral intermediary in the handover, assembles a team of specialists, some of whom have been involved in similar operations in the past - though this is more challenging than most.",
      "Crucial planning",
      "There are some details that the group cannot speak about publicly because of concerns that it could compromise the security of the operation.",
      "Ms Davies says planning is crucial to ensuring that the exchange runs smoothly. They have mapped out alternative routes to get to different locations in Gaza, knowing that the \"safest route can change\" at any time.",
      "Among their biggest concerns are the dangers posed by unexploded ordnance, destroyed and damaged infrastructure, and large crowds with \"heightened emotions\".",
      "\"Our teams prepare and plan for as many scenarios as possible,\" she says.",
      "\"The most important thing for us is to be able to return any person entrusted to our care safely back to their homes.\"",
      "But it is impossible to plan for everything.",
      "\"From previous experience, here and in other places around the world, we know that the logistics and final details can change at any time, even \u2013 and particularly \u2013 during operations themselves,\" says Ms Davies.",
      "Medical staff and so-called weapons contamination specialists, trained in identifying explosive remnants of war, travel with the teams.",
      "During the operations, ICRC representatives also maintain regular contact with both Israeli officials and Hamas, as well as mediators.",
      "In the previous releases, Hamas has circulated the names of the released hostages in advance on its Telegram channels, without revealing exactly where the handovers will happen.",
      "The first public signs of the locations have been the presence of armed and masked members of Hamas's military wing.",
      "\"I found out from a kiosk guy that there was something happening at the junction and that al-Qassam fighters were having a parade,\" a local journalist says of the first release in Gaza City earlier this month.",
      "Crowds started gathering to watch as the fighters assembled in formation, and word began to spread that the first three hostages released under the ceasefire deal would appear there.",
      "\"When people realised this would be the place where they would hand over the Israeli hostages, people started chanting [for al-Qassam and senior Hamas figures],\" he says. \"They started shouting 'God is greatest' - that showed how joyful they were.\"",
      "The journalist was also there for the second release - at a different location in Gaza City - the following week, which he describes as being \"more organised\".",
      "The fighters set up a small stage area with a desk and chairs, and stood in formation to separate the hostages from the crowds.",
      "White cars with blacked out windows were used to bring the hostages - four women soldiers - to the area.",
      "The young women were filmed thanking their captors and being handed gift bags in a video published by Hamas' military wing.",
      "They were brought on to the stage and waved at the cheering crowd, before being handed over to the care of the ICRC.",
      "Hamas spokesman Abdul Latif al-Qanou said in a later statement that the \"scenes and details\" of the staged handover \"tell the story of resistance creativity, heroism, and reinforce a model of pride and dignity\".",
      "Ms Davies says there are some aspects of the handover that are \"out of our control\".",
      "\"At all times, ICRC staff do their utmost to protect the dignity of those being released, but\u2026 it is important that people recognise the limitations of what we can do,\" she says.",
      "\"Our priority remains the safe and successful release and transfer of those in our care.\"",
      "The hostages are transferred to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on the outskirts of Gaza.",
      "Col Dr Avi Banov, deputy chief of the Israel Defense Forces medical corps, says: \"We're prepared through the outskirts of Gaza and other areas to receive the hostages.",
      "\"We always prepare because Hamas does not tell us, 'OK, we're going to free them in this area or in that area'.\"",
      "Across the border, reception points have been set up to receive them.",
      "On site are military and medical personnel, social workers and the hostages' families.",

His was one of several teams on standby in case one of the hostages had a medical emergency and says there were strict instructions about how to interact with those who returned.",
      "He recalls: \"We were told if you evacuate them, don't ask them questions, don't do anything inappropriate, just be quiet and then if the hostages asks you something or want something, of course you're going to answer and give it to them. But be low key.\"",
      "He says the atmosphere at the base was one of excitement and nerves. \"It was a very important mission,\" he says.",
      "Col Dr Banov says the return begins with an introduction between the hostages and medical staff.",
      "The returned hostages are assigned a physician, a nurse and a social worker who \"accompany them all the way through\" to them being taken to hospital.",
      "Families are advised to give the hostages \"a little bit of time\" with the medical teams before the reunion to allow them to \"breathe and understand that [they're] in a safe place again\".",
      "Giving hostages agency",
      "\"We start with vitamins, something small to eat and drink, and then the families,\" Col Dr Banov says.",
      "As part of a \"grounding\" process, he says, efforts are made to give the released hostages agency to make their own decisions, with questions like: \"Would you like to take a shower before or after you meet your parents?\"",
      "Of the first seven hostages to be released, he says most had \"some sort of shrapnel injuries\" as well as suffering from malnutrition and metabolic problems.",
      "\"They're not good physically, mentally it's a very complicated issue,\" he says.",
      "In the coming weeks, he notes, the bodies of dead hostages will also arrive, with plans in place to transfer them to a forensic laboratory before funerals in Israel.",
      "After receiving initial treatment at the reception point, the surviving hostages are transferred in a \"specially adapted\" helicopter to a hospital elsewhere in the country.",
      "Col Dr Banov says: \"We tell them\u2026 we will take a helicopter back home. And then, if you're willing to, we're going to start talking about what you have been through.\"",

      "\"It is with deep sadness that we announce the death of the singer, songwriter and actress Marianne Faithfull,\" her spokesperson said. \"Marianne passed away peacefully in London today, in the company of her loving family. She will be dearly missed.\"",
      "Faithfull was born in Hampstead, London, in December 1946. She was a folk singer who, one day, met with the manager of the Rolling Stones at a party, which led to her recording \"As Tears Go By\" by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards in 1964. She was just 17 years old when she recorded the hit single.",
      "\"They came up and said to the person I was with, 'Can she sing?'\" Faithfull said to CBS Sunday Morning during a 2009 interview.",
      "The pop song ended up on the U.K. and American charts. Multiple hit singles and two debut albums followed.",
      "Jagger said on Thursday that he was \"so saddened to hear of the death\" of Faithfull.",

    "title": "Idina Menzel returns to Broadway in \"Redwood\"",
    "published": "Sun, 26 Jan 2025 10:43:27 -0500",
    "summary": "In her new musical, \"Redwood,\" the Tony Award-winning star of \"Wicked\" and \"Rent\" plays a woman seeking a refuge, and a purpose, by escaping into a redwood forest.",
    "story": [
      "Last fall, when superstar Idina Menzel wasn't in New York, she hung out in Oakland, Calif. At Bandaloop Studios, she was learning to dance suspended at the end of a rope \u2026 and this from a woman who says she isn't much of a dancer on the ground. \"I don't know what I'm doing!\" she exclaimed.",
      "But when you see exactly why she was doing this, it suddenly all makes sense.",
      "In the new Broadway musical \"Redwood,\" the audience is transported to the heart of the redwood forest, and seemingly into the trees themselves. It's loosely inspired by a woman named Julia Butterfly Hill, who, in the late '90s, spent more than two years living in a thousand-year-old redwood to save it from being cut down. Her effort worked: the tree was saved.",
      "And now, Menzel and writer-director Tina Landau are taking their own leap of faith with an idea they've been kicking around for more than a decade.",
      "Asked if she was ever worried that their experiment would fail, Landau said, \"Yes, I'm still worried. I didn't know. But it was one of those passion projects for both myself and Idina where it was just like, let's just trust that what is meant to happen will happen.\"",
      "\"Redwood\" is about a workaholic mom who runs away from it all, and finds herself in the redwood forest where her life is changed forever.",
      "One of the themes of the show is based on the fact that 300-foot redwoods actually support each other. Landau said, \"Their roots only go five or six feet into the ground. Their roots go sideways instead of down, until they reach the roots of other trees, and they intertwine with those. So, all the trees end up holding each other up.\"",
      "To listen to Idina Menzel perform \"Great Escape,\" from the musical \"Redwood,\" click on the video player below:",
      "The musical, which is currently in previews, is all-new, but Menzel is on familiar ground. She's performing at the Nederlander Theatre, which is the same theatre where she opened in \"Rent\" in 1996. \"Yeah, it's like a homecoming for me. It's full circle. It's very emotional for me. When I did 'Rent,\" that was the first professional job I ever had \u2013 and it was a Broadway show. So, I was super-lucky. That was a beautiful time in my life.\"",
      "It was beautiful. She was 25 years old, and her performance in \"Rent\" put her squarely on the map, with a Tony Award nomination. \"I got a record deal that I always wanted to get,\" she said. \"I wanted to be signed to a record label so badly and make my own album, and I did. And that was a dream come true. But then I only sold, like, three albums. So, then I got dropped from the label. And then by that time, my whole kind of momentum of being this Tony-nominated actress from the hit musical 'Rent,' it sort of dissipated. And then I had to kind of keep pounding the pavement again. It wasn't until 'Wicked' that things started to really look up again.\"",
      "As the original Wicked Witch Elphaba in Broadway's \"Wicked,\" Menzel won a Tony, and helped turn the show into a mega-hit, though it wasn't always easy being green. Asked what Elphaba gave her, Menzel replied, \"Green ears for the rest of my life!\"",
      "Idina Menzel performs \"Defying Gravity\" from \"Wicked\" on \"The Late Show With David Letterman\":",
      "And then, she was an animated princess in Disney's \"Frozen,\" singing the song that millions of would-be princesses couldn't get out of their heads. \"My relationship with 'Let It Go' is fabulous,\" she said. \"It's one of the best things that's ever happened to me. People always say, 'Do you get sick of a song like that?' And maybe they think I'm lying to you, but I really don't.\"",
      "Idina Menzel, as Elsa, performs \"Let It Go\" in \"Frozen\":",
      "\"When I was a little girl, if I would have dreamt that I'd be up there singing a song like this, I wouldn't have believed it. Or, no, I would have, 'cause I really was very cocky when I was little, and I actually, you know, believed in myself and thought, 'Definitely, it's definitely gonna happen for me.'\"",
      "But the task of writing Menzel's next big song went to someone who'd never written for a big Broadway star (or for anyone). \"Redwood\" is composer Kate Diaz's very first show, but you'd never know it. Asked what it's like to write for The Idina Menzel, Diaz said, \"It's amazing. I had never written for anybody else before, so great place to start, for sure! What an incredible voice to write for.\"",
      "I asked, \"Is there a little part of you that's like, 'Let me just see if she can do this'?\"",
      "\"I mean, she usually can,\" Diaz replied, \"So, not really.\"",
      "And she can do it on demand, as she demonstrated in the new \"Wicked\" film where she brought back her classic vocal riff.",
      "Her new show offers a different way to go green: an immersion in a leafy redwood forest. Even the seats in the newly-remodeled Nederlander are green. For Menzel it's almost hard to believe: \"It's just so rare that you get to see it come to fruition after so many years, and they're literally loading things into the Nederlander as we speak. That accomplishment isn't lost on me, and it's just, I'm so emotional about it.",
      "And now she's hoping to defy gravity, again. \"But I think green and being high, flying, literally or figuratively, is just something that I must respond to or attract in my life, in my characters,\" Menzel laughed. \"And I'm kind of happy with that!\"",

    "summary": "The playful anarchy of author-illustrator Dav Pilkey's bestselling \"Dog Man\" series, about a hero cop who is part-man, part-police dog, is now on screen in a new animated film, with comedian Pete Davidson playing Dog Man's arch-nemesis, Petey the Cat.",
    "story": [
      "It's hard to believe, but as author and Illustrator Dav Pilkey recently told students at Boy's Prep in the Bronx, he created Dog Man back when he was in second grade. \"He looks a little bit different,\" he said.",
      "The kids loved hearing when someone with learning disabilities (\"I had ADHD, and I was dyslexic, and I was the class clown, and I couldn't sit still,\" he said) could go on to be so successful.",
      "Every book in Pilkey's Dog Man series has been the bestselling children's book for the year it came out.",
      "And as the new film out next week reminds us, it all started when a police officer and his dog got into a bad accident \u2013 and doctors sewed the head of the dog onto the man's body, creating \u2026 Dog Man!",
      "And while he's part man, he's all dog. \"Oh, yeah, yeah. The man part doesn't really come out that much,\" Pilkey said.",
      "But in addition to all the fun, Pilkey tries to layer meaning into the Dog Man books, even in their titles, from \"The Scarlet Shedder\" and \"Fetch-22,\" to \"Lord of the Fleas,\" and \"A Tale of Two Kitties.\" \"I was looking at Charles Dickens' 'A Tale of Two Cities,' which is such a wonderful book. It talks about sacrifice, self-sacrifice, and the value of that.\"",
      "\"And you hope that children will be moved to read these classics?\" I asked.",
      "\"I hope so, yeah,\" Pilkey replied. \"I hope they don't think 'Oh, that Charles Dickens stole an idea from Dav Pilkey.' That wouldn't be so good!\"",
      "Pilkey's sense of humor is what made director Peter Hastings want to make the \"Dog Man\" movie. He also directed a TV series based on Pilkey's \"Captain Underpants\" books. \"I just love his sensibility, the playful anarchy of his work,\" Hastings said.",
      "Comedian Pete Davidson gets top billing in the film: \"I'm a huge Dav Pilkey fan,\" he said. \"I grew up reading all the 'Captain Underpants' books. My mom got them for me. All the young kids in my family, they all read 'Dog Man,' they're obsessed with 'Dog Man.' And then right around the time I started noticing that, we got the offer.\"",
      "It was an offer to play Dog Man's nemesis, Petey the Cat. Davidson said it was fun to play the villain: \"It's a really fun, loud, layered character,\" he said. \"I don't get a lot of opportunities to stretch like that.\"",
      "In fact, as readers of the \"Dog Man\" books know, things start to change when Petey tries to clone himself, and instead creates \u2026 an adorable kitten!",
      "\"His character has a great arc in the story,\" said Hastings.",
      "\"It's the best arc I've ever been given\" Davidson laughed. \"Usually I'm in a movie for, like, nine minutes, and then shot in the face, so it was nice to have a full [arc]!\"",
      "Asked if it's hard for someone else to control his characters, Pilkey said, \"No, no. Not at all actually. I'm just so honored that they wanted to do something with my characters, so I was like, YESSS!!! Jumping up and down.\"",
      "But Pilkey says what really matters to him is seeing how much kids appreciate all the work he puts into his books.",
      "Asked whether he ever worries about running out of ideas, he said, \"No, I think I worry about running out of time to get all of my ideas down on paper!\"",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Jan 2025 10:07:41 -0500",
    "summary": "This month, the Sundance Film Festival is once again providing a showcase for independent filmmakers and documentarians from around the world. But that isn't all that Sundance does. \"Sunday Morning\" goes behind the scenes.",
    "story": [
      "Park City Utah is a snow globe kind of place. It sparkles and glitters like a fairy tale, especially at this time of year, when the silver screens of Sundance come to this silver mining town, and young filmmakers start thinking of the moment they might see some glitter of their own.",
      "Sian Heder's film \"CODA\" premiered at Sundance in 2021. It went on to win three Oscars the following year, including best picture. It doesn't always happen that way, but the Sundance Film Festival does have a pretty good track record of catapulting independent filmmakers into a career.",
      "Its alumni include the likes of Steven Soderbergh (\"Sex, Lies, and Videotape\"), Quentin Tarantino (\"Reservoir Dogs\"), Christopher Nolan (\"Memento\"), and Lulu Wang (\"The Farewell\"). They were all introduced not only to audiences, but to powerful film distribution companies, at the annual festival held high in the Wasatch Mountains of Utah.",
      "\"I think that was the big breakthrough with Sundance, is that finally these new voices, these exciting new filmmakers had a place where they could actually show what they had done and potentially sell them,\" said eight-time Oscar nominee Glenn Close.",
      "She first heard about Sundance from its famous founder, Robert Redford, on the set of \"The Natural.\" His idea \u2013 then in its infancy - was in some ways just as pure as baseball itself.",
      "As Redford told us in 2018, \"I said, wait a minute, there are other stories out there. There are other voices to be heard that are not being given a chance. What if we created something, an opportunity, for those people to get their films made and have them distributed? \u2026 The smaller stories. The more offbeat stories. The more controversial.\"",
      "Which is why he wanted his non-profit Sundance Institute to be held as far away from profit-focused Hollywood as possible. So, he set it up amid the pines and aspens of Utah's Provo Canyon, on land he bought after the success of \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\"",
      "Close said, \"You are surrounded by nature in a way that, if you're from a city, it's undeniable,\" she said. \"It's a spiritual thing. And I think that was very important for Bob.\"",
      "Redford said he didn't think the idea he started would last beyond two or three years. But the Sundance Institute has lasted 44 years and counting. It's become for film what Michelin Stars are to fine dining.",
      "You don't choose Sundance; Sundance chooses you.",
      "Michelle Satter, the Institute's founding senior director, has been by Redford's side since 1981. \"We'll get 3,000 scripts; we'll select 12,\" she said. \"That's a tiny number. But there are a lot of people globally who want to tell stories, and we believe in the power of storytelling.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do you know when you've found a unique story or a unique talent?\"",
      "\"It speaks to me,\" Satter replied. \"If they don't have a voice that is unique, we're not interested.\"",
      "\"And what does that mean to you, voice'?\"",
      "\"There's something about the way they tell the story that does not feel generic, like anybody could tell the story,\" said Satter. \"But they're bringing something from their own experience, from their own connection to storytelling that uplifts it.\"",
      "According to Satter, \"A film is not complete until it reaches an audience and engages with an audience.\"",
      "Last Spring, Satter allowed us into Sundance's storied Directors and Screenwriters Lab, this time held in Estes Park, Colorado. One of the lab's advisors was four-time Oscar nominated actor-director Ed Harris.",
      "\"It's not about ego,\" Harris said. \"It's not about anything other than learning, making mistakes. I love the work. It's all about the work, and I learn as much as I probably help anybody.\"",
      "All the Sundance \"Fellows,\" as they're called, bring projects already in the works, like Hannah Gray Organschi, polishing up her upcoming feature film. \"There's tough feedback, like, feedback that's good,\" she said. \"And to have that at the phase where you can really be deepening and honing the characters and story is, it feels lucky.\"",
      "Casey Modderno was fine tuning her rom-com: \"The questions I think that you're normally asked as a filmmaker are, like, about budget, about accessibility, about market response. And so, to be asked questions about the feeling of the film and the aesthetics of the film and the texture, and just go deep in craft, it's, like, super-special.\"",
      "And then there's Sean Wang. \"This experience has just, like, changed my DNA as a filmmaker,\" he said.",
      "What got him accepted to Sundance was his screenplay for his first feature film, \"Didi.\" He had been toiling away on the film pretty much by himself with his crew for six years. \"I was just obsessed with, 'Who won Sundance this year? Who won the Audience Award? Who won the Jury Prize? What's the next filmmaker that is coming out of Sundance?'\" he said.",
      "Turns out he was one of those Sundance filmmakers. Last year, \"Didi\" not only won two of the Sundance Film Festival's top prizes; it got him a distribution deal.",
      "Wang notes that Sundance doesn't finance films. \"They have no financial stake in your movie,\" he said. \"When we sell the movie, they're not like, 'Great. Where's our 10%?' It's a very giving environment. Obviously they want your films to succeed.\"",
      "This year the California wildfires cast a long shadow over the festival. Michelle Satter's home, where we did our interview, is now gone, as are so many others.",
      "None of those victims were forgotten in Utah this past week. As Satter told the audience, \"We lost our village, but at the end of the day, we are the village.\"",
      "As for Robert Redford, the visionary who started it all is now 88. He hasn't been here in person for the last three years, but his spirit remains. Independent film has forever been changed \u2013 a legacy that he and others have taken to the box office bank.",
      "Glenn Close said, \"He put his money where his mouth is. And you know, I'm in awe of that. And I salute him for it.\"",

      "Adam Ross, the acclaimed author of \"Mr. Peanut,\" returns with \"Playworld\" (Knopf), a novel dipped in nostalgia and flecked with love and sorrow, about a child actor coming of age as the object of attraction for an older woman.",
      "Read an excerpt below.",
      "\"Playworld\" by Adam Ross",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Prologue",
      "In the fall of 1980, when I was fourteen, a friend of my parents named Naomi Shah fell in love with me. She was thirty-six, a mother of two, and married to a wealthy man. Like so many things that happened to me that year, it didn't seem strange at the time.",
      "Two decades later, when I finally told my mother\u2014we were on Long Island, taking a walk on the beach\u2014she stopped, stunned, and said, \"But she was such an ugly woman.\" The remark wasn't as petty as it sounds. If I was aware of it then, it neither repulsed me nor affected my feelings for Naomi. It was just a thing I took for granted, like the color of her hair.",
      "Wiry and ashen, it had the shading but not the shimmer of pigeon feathers. Naomi kept it long, so that it fell past her shoulders. I knew it by touch, for my face was often buried in it. Only later did I wonder if she considered herself unattractive, because she always wore sunglasses, as if to hide her face, large gold frames with blue-tinted prescription lenses. When we were driving together, which was often that year, she'd allow these to slide down her nose and then look at me over their bridge. She might've considered this pose winning, but it was more likely to see me better. Her mouth often hung slightly open. Her lower teeth were uneven, and her tongue, which pressed against them, always tasted of coffee.",
      "Naomi's car was a silver Mercedes sedan\u2014300sd along with turbo diesel nickel-plated on the back\u2014that made a deep hum when she drove. The interior, enormous in my mind's eye, was tricked out with glossy wood paneling and white leather, back seat so wide and legroom so ample they made the driver appear to be far away. It was in this car that Naomi and I talked most often. We'd park, and then she'd lean across the armrest to press her cheek to mine, and I'd sometimes allow her to kiss me. Other times we'd move to the back. Lying there with Naomi, her nose nuzzled to my neck, I'd stare at the ceiling's dotted fabric until the pattern seemed to detach and drift like a starred sky. This car was her prized possession, and like many commuters, she had turned the machine into an extension of her body. Her left thumb lightly hooked the wheel at eight o'clock when traffic was moving, her fingertips sliding to eleven when it was slow. She preferred to sit slightly reclined, her free hand spread on her inner thigh, though after she lost her pinky the following summer, and even after being fitted with a prosthesis, she kept it tucked away.",
      "\"I was worried you'd think it was disgusting,\" she said, the digit hidden between the seat and her hip. She'd bought herself a diamond ring to hide the seam, and for the most part the likeness was uncanny, but at certain angles you could tell\u2014the cuticle's line was too smooth, the nail's pale crescent too creamy to match the others. Like my father's fake teeth, which he occasionally left lying around our apartment, I was fascinated by it, though my curiosity wasn't morbid. I was a child actor, you see, a student of all forms of dissembling, and had long ago found my greatest subject to be adults.",

      "\"The Note\" by Alafair Burke",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "It was meant to be a harmless prank. Not even a prank, not initially.",
      "An inside joke, only for the three of them. But now she was locking her apartment door behind two departing police officers.",
      "She had managed to sound appropriately earnest but unworried when they began asking questions. After all, why should May Hanover, of all people, be nervous around police? May was the good girl, always. The one who only needed to be told once by a teacher to open a book to a specific page. The teenager who drove strictly within the limits of her learner's permit. Even her pug, Gomez, seemed to understand at an instinctive level why he needed to break away from his neighbor buddies to ride the building's service elevator while they strutted brazenly with their humans through the lobby.",
      "May, simply put, was a rule follower. A rule enforcer, in fact. It was a trait that had helped her succeed in life, but, as she had learned, could also lead to trouble.",
      "Josh emerged from the bedroom where he'd gone to give her privacy when the police arrived. Gomez waddled slightly behind him. \"Was that about Roland Shaw?\"",
      "Shaw was the man she'd convicted in her final in-person trial as an assistant district attorney after he was found breaking into his next victim's apartment. \"How'd you know?\" Could a question be a lie? That one probably counted. So many lies since she'd gotten home yesterday from her long weekend in the Hamptons.",
      "\"That was a major case for you. I recognized the big guy from the news.\"",
      "The trial was before she and Josh had found themselves suddenly living together. Before they were engaged. The media coverage consisted of two small articles in the Post, including a photograph of a defiant-looking May flanked by two detectives in the courthouse hallway\u2014one of them the \"big guy\" Josh recognized. Whereas May was obsessed with all things crime-related\u2014in her job, the news, truth or fiction\u2014Josh found it all, quote, \"dark and depressing.\" But Josh was interested in all things May-related. Of course he had followed the coverage.",
      "\"The DA's Office got an inquiry from another jurisdiction and needed to clear something up,\" she said. Misleading, but technically true.",
      "\"They couldn't just call you?\" he asked.",
      "\"Actually, he called, but I didn't see the message.\" That one was a full-on lie. \"Guess he's training a new guy and wanted a change of scenery.\"",
      "\"Well, I'm glad they were quick. I really wanted a Negroni but thought the sound of a cocktail shaker might be inadvisable while you were in official law enforcement mode.\"",
      "\"Another reason why you should stir,\" she said. \"I like what I like.\"",
      "\"Make two? I'm getting back into my comfy clothes.\" She called Lauren once she was alone in the bedroom. \"Hey there, woman. We were just saying we miss you.\"",
      "\"Yes, we miss you!\" Kelsey called out in the background. \"Come back here right now. It's boring without you.\"",
      "May could hear a few drinks' worth of enthusiasm in Kelsey's voice. \"You're clearly having a miserable time. Absolutely suffering.\" She felt a knot form in her sternum as she steeled herself to explain why she was calling. \"I don't even know how to say this, but the police are probably going to call you. Both of you.\"",
      "\"What? How would they even know about us?\" Lauren asked. \"They came to my apartment. They asked who I was with. I didn't have a choice. They have your names. And your phone numbers.\"",
      "\"How? Were there cameras or something?\"",
      "\"No, it was because of me. I'm so sorry.\"",
      "What had she gone and done? No one was supposed to know about any of their stupidity. And now something really, really bad was going to happen\u2014she could feel it. Something she couldn't control. She wanted to open her mouth wide to scream\u2014to scream impossibly loudly again, like last time.",

      "The wisest souls say that pure mountain air makes us all go a little mad. A wind\u2014lawless and long-tailed\u2014slices through the snow-stippled Apuan alps and the Apennines with all the wantonness of La Befana, the winter witch. Swifts catch this wind on their wings, carving up the crisp blue morning. Dipping down into the valley, the wind now worries over the murmuring blue tongue of the Serchio river on its journey to the Tyrrhenian Sea. It slips\u2014an unseen spirit\u2014under Devil's bridge. Shivers along the great gray hunch of the Devil's back. Hissing over every ancient stone. Rising from the river, the wind picks up speed, hastening toward the woods. Hurtling toward chestnut trees spaced like the pews of a great Duomo. The wind now weaves between golden leaves. Whispering quick consonants between the branches, borrowing an autumnal aura. Sweet sigh of ripe chestnuts and shed leaves. And here\u2014where the wind steals woodland scents\u2014hides a curiosity. Cloistered by soil, moss, stone and leaf litter, a thing unseen\u2014a thing quite mysterious\u2014lies in waiting.",
      "A thing that sits buried, like old bones.",
      "What lies under the soil has stayed secret. It is an underground barterer. A schemer who has set a trap in the soil. A sylvan swindler. A tormentor.",
      "A tiny god.",
      "Swelling to irresistible bulk, it has ripened into a knobbled fruit of corruption. And now the time has come. The tiny god releases a lusty sigh, soundlessly unfurling a phantom into the wind.",
      "No more visible than the notes of nightingale song.",
      "No more audible than a wordless wish.",
      "The tiny god has released a cipher.",
      "The breath of the tiny god is whisked away by the breeze, slipping through the damp woodland of chestnut worship. Deeper into the woods, the breath in the breeze paints the pupils of a fallow deer into great glistening lakes. Fur stiffens along a back freckled in the white of first snow. The doe salivates in answer to the call of the stranger she can smell but cannot see. Her nostrils flutter, messages flood her bloodstream. But the breath blows on.",
      "Now a wild sow lifts her moist snout from the leaf litter and inhales a slip of the wind. Instantly intoxicated, her muddy snout snuffing. The grunting sow is aroused into a frenzy. Bristled legs stab at the soil as she arranges them to assume her stance, ready to receive the boar she smells. Turning her head toward her tail, she hunts for him, but\u2014and here is the trick, here is the olfactory deception\u2014there is no boar and the breeze blows on through the woods, fanning the sensual scent along with it.",
      "See-through scarves of scent curl from the forest and swirl toward a beautiful medieval village, perched upon a peak. Its tallest point an 11th century bell tower with memories of steel swords and shields. The wind, pickled with flavors of the forest, ridden by the breath of the tiny god, tickles trees of olive and cyprus. Until it dangles its string of little calamities above cobblestone streets and terracotta roof tiles.",
      "And it settles upon the medieval village like a spell.",

    "summary": "The humble egg is now a source of frustration for millions of shoppers around the U.S, who face soaring prices and shortages. What's going on?",
    "story": [
      "At Market Basket locations in some parts of Massachusetts, customers are being asked to limit their egg purchases\u00a0to two cartons per family. Another shopper on the hunt for eggs, this one in Las Vegas, reported finding\u00a0empty shelves\u00a0at a local grocery store. On social media, a consumer\u00a0accustomed to paying around $2 for a dozen eggs expressed shock over now having to pay more than double that amount.",
      "Egg restrictions, shortages and record-high prices are ruffling feathers at supermarkets across the U.S. as a deadly strain of avian flu\u00a0continues to decimate\u00a0the country's poultry flocks. To the dismay of consumers still struggling to digest soaring food costs, that likely means even higher egg prices in 2025.",
      "\"I think eggs have felt relatively extreme over the past few months,\" Kip Green, co-owner and general manager of Montague Diner in Brooklyn, New York, told CBS News. \"We're fortunate though, we have a great relationships with our purveyors, with farmers. So everybody is trying to help each other out, which is lovely.\"",
      "Like many diners, Montague uses hundreds of eggs a day said Green. Whether served as part of a classic breakfast plate alongside potatoes and toast, or an egg salad sandwich, eggs comprise 40% to 50% of the restaurant's menu, she said.",
      "\"I mean, it's even like, there's some things that you might not even think about, like in our pancake batter or like in our French toast batter, like just things like that. We still use so many eggs.\"",
      "Even so, Green said that she and her team are \"aligned on keeping guests at the forefront,\" which means shielding them from price hikes on eggs.",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it's challenging. Like we, we have to figure out how to make it work,\" she said. \"Eggs are central to us, we are a diner. You have to have an egg plate,\" she said, adding, \"We don't ever want to stop that or to, to make people pay more for something like that. So you figure out how to cut costs elsewhere.\"",
      "The average price of a dozen large, grade-A eggs was $4.15 in December 2024, up 14% from $3.65 in November, federal\u00a0data shows. That's a more than 60% increase from the $2.51 it cost a year ago and 160% more than the $1.41 consumers paid for the same carton in 2019, CBS News' price tracker\u00a0reveals.",
      "By comparison, the overall monthly rate of inflation for food in December was 2.5%, with the cost of food at home rising just 0.3%, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data.",
      "Like a souffl\u00e9, egg prices are rising to impressive heights right before our eyes. When will it end? Not anytime soon, according to the USDA, which\u00a0predicts\u00a0in a recent report that egg prices will shoot up another 20% this year.",
      "Behind rising egg prices and shortages is a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), known as H5N1, that killed 13.2 million commercial egg-laying hens in the month of December alone and continues to depopulate flocks into 2025, according to the USDA. Outbreaks of H5N1 were first detected in the U.S. in 2022 and are considered to be the main driver behind the years-long volatility in egg prices.",
      "H5N1, which has a high mortality rate among infected\u00a0poultry\u00a0and wild birds, is being watched closely by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a potential public health\u00a0threat. So far, the CDC has received one report of a person dying after being hospitalized with severe illness from the virus. Among cattle, the average mortality and culling rate is 2% or less, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. However, officials warn that H5N1 is lethal to cats",
      "For now, the virus remains mostly a thorn in the side of U.S. consumers\u00a0fed up with inflation.",
      "\"For about a year and a half now, the sort of frequency and severity of avian flu outbreaks in the poultry and egg supply chains in the U.S. have sort of just been on the rise in a big way,\" Ricky Volpe, a professor of agribusiness at Cal Poly State University, San Luis Obispo, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone is just sort of hoping that, 'OK, this will be the last one, then we'll get back to normal.' But we keep on not getting back to normal.\"",
      "More than 79.3 million U.S. chickens died in 2022 and 2023 as result of H5N1 infections and related culling, according to a January\u00a0report\u00a0from TD Cowen. In total, H5N1 is estimated to have led to the loss of nearly 139 million birds across the country, including Puerto Rico, according to the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.",
      "Devastating for farmers",
      "The bird flu outbreaks disrupting the nation's egg supplies are a dealing a serious blow to affected farmers. Anytime the virus is found, the entire flock must be slaughtered to help limit the virus' spread. Replenishing supplies is yet another challenge.",
      "\"It takes approximately 19-20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs in newly repopulated barns, and that is but one element of a lengthy recovery process,\" a spokesperson for the American Egg Board said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Bird flu is absolutely devastating to an egg farm. When an egg farm is impacted with HPAI, it must go through a comprehensive and lengthy process involving multiple steps and government approvals before it can begin to repopulate with new flocks and return to producing eggs. This process that can take nine months to more than a year,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "With massive egg farms routinely housing more than 1 million chickens, just a few infections can lead to a supply crunch.",
      "Other factors",
      "Another factor driving up egg prices: a persistent shortage of truck drivers in the U.S. \u2014 a mounting problem as more drivers retire. And with fewer drivers to transport eggs to retailers, wholesalers are forced to raise shipping costs.",
      "\"Refrigerated truck transportation is a major pain point in the food supply chain right now. There's a shortage of drivers, long-haul truck rates are up and eggs are of course very transportation-intensive,\" Volpe said. \"Even before we were dealing with avian flu, the trucks just weren't there to deliver eggs in a timely fashion.\"",
      "For consumers in Colorado, a state law requiring all eggs to be cage-free by January 2025, has added to the soaring price of eggs.",
      "As a partial solution to the nationwide problem, Volpe suggests that retailers source eggs locally wherever possible.",
      "\"[Local suppliers] are pretty well insulated from these systemic issues of avian flu or whatever, so supply is healthy. So it makes sense to augment supply whenever possible locally from local growers who are not facing these significant issues related to bird flu and transportation.\"",
      "Why are egg prices lower in some stores?",
      "Just as retailers use Thanksgiving Day turkey promotions to attract customers, some grocery stores around the country are offering lower egg prices to drive store traffic.",
      "\"You can go on social media and you'll see someone complaining about an $8 dozen of eggs and then someone else will chime in and go 'I just got it for $4.' Well, I absolutely guarantee you that was sold at a loss, and it was sort of a competitive effort to increase foot traffic,\" Volpe said. \"Maybe eggs are sold at a loss, but now you're going to buy your milk and your bread and vegetables, everything else, and those will have the normal profit margins.\"",
      "Translation: If you find a good deal on eggs at a store, you might still end up paying roughly the same cost for your entire basket of groceries as you would somewhere else.",
      "Response from White House",
      "\"There is a lot of reporting out there that is putting the onus on this White House for the increased cost of eggs,\" said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked at her first press briefing on Tuesday what President Trump is doing to address egg prices which have spiked since he took office earlier this month.",
      "\"As far as the egg shortage, what's also contributing to that is that the Biden admin and Department of Agriculture directed the mass killing of 100 million chickens,\" Leavitt, who made no mention of avian flu, said in her response.",
      "Leavitt went on to urge the Senate to move \"swiftly\" to confirm Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees \"including his nominee for the United States Department of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins ... who is leading the economic team here at the White House, on how we can address the egg shortage in this country.\"",
      "Correction:\u00a0This story has been revised because it mistakenly reported that it takes less than six weeks for commercial hens to produce eggs. This is incorrect. It takes 19 to 20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs, according to the American Egg Board. The trade group also notes that it can take more than a year for farms suffering a bird flu outbreak to secure the required government clearance to resume operations.",

      "What Kennedy has described as his \"reluctant entrance into the vaccine debate\" dates back to 2005, when he wrote an article in Rolling Stone exploring supposed evidence for a link between autism and an ingredient that had formerly been used in some vaccines. The article contained numerous scientific and factual errors and was eventually retracted. Decades of research has established there is no such link.",
      "In 2016, Kennedy joined a nonprofit focused on mercury, which later broadened its focus and rebranded to Children's Health Defense. Kennedy chaired the group and served as one of its loudest voices raising doubts about vaccines and fighting against vaccine requirements and approvals.",

      "The interruption had sparked outcry from state governments, nonprofits and lawmakers in the wake of the Trump administration's\u00a0move to freeze spending\u00a0across the federal government. After legal challenges were filed against the funding freeze, a federal judge issued a stay\u00a0temporarily halting\u00a0the move until she can hear arguments in the case.",
      "State Medicaid agencies, federally funded\u00a0Head Start\u00a0early education programs and\u00a0community health centers\u00a0had been among those cut off from access to the\u00a0Payment Management Services\u00a0web portal, or PMS, run by the Department of Health and Human Services, which handles billions of dollars of payments every year.",
      "\"We have confirmed no payments have been affected \u2014 they are still being processed and sent. We expect the portal will be back online shortly,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt   said in a\u00a0post\u00a0on X.",

      "There was widespread confusion after Medicaid and other programs discovered they were locked out of the federal health payment system. Spokespeople for HHS and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have not responded to requests for comment, amid the ongoing\u00a0communications \"pause\"\u00a0imposed by the Trump administration at the department.",
      "A spokesperson for the National Association of Medicaid Directors said they had also sought an explanation.",
      "\"My staff has confirmed reports that Medicaid portals are down in all 50 states following last night's federal funding freeze.

      "\"Any pause in federal funding of Medicaid \u2014 the largest source of federal funding received by states \u2014 would be disastrous for states as they need to draw down federal funds to meet their financial obligations to the health care providers and health plans serving Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries,\" Alker said.",
      "Health centers warn of \"irreversible\" consequences",
      "Even as the payment systems come back online, those who rely on the grants say they worry that new \"delays\" on payments imposed by the Trump administration could inflict permanent damage on stretched-thin health care systems.",
      "The HHS website currently warns that due \"to Executive Orders regarding potentially unallowable grant payments, PMS is taking additional measures to process payments. Reviews of applicable programs and payments will result in delays and/or rejections of payments.\"",
      "In a statement ahead of the lockout, HHS\u00a0announced\u00a0it would be reevaluating \"all programs, regulations, and guidance to ensure Federal taxpayer dollars are not being used to pay for or promote elective abortion\" following a previous\u00a0executive order.",
      "\"Even with the best of intentions, these types of funding freezes can do tremendous harm. And could be irreversible to some communities.

Without the money, she warned many health centers facing already slim margins could be forced to trim staff or close their doors.",
      "\"When the system's down, and there's no one to talk to to understand what they need to do, and then on top of that there's an uncertain time to the delay, it's paralyzing,\" said Pears Kelly.",
      "In a\u00a0statement, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association warned that health centers could face \"significant disruption\" to operations even with a \"temporary funding pause.\"",
      "\"For many patients, Title X-funded health centers serve as their sole source of health care.

      "The implications of the federal grant pause go beyond HHS, but the full effects are still unknown.",
      "It's unclear whether the National School Lunch Program, which reimburses schools and school districts each month for the meals they serve children, will still receive funding through the U.S. Department of Agriculture if the freeze takes effect. The program feeds about 28 million American schoolchildren each month.",
      "Diane Pratt-Heavner, director of media relations at the School Nutrition Association, said her organization is asking the USDA for more information.",

    "title": "How are H5N9 and H5N1 different? What to know after California bird flu outbreak",
    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 16:28:23 -0500",
    "summary": "A different strain of H5N9 has shown up in U.S. birds before.",
    "story": [
      "A California duck farm made headlines this week after the World Organization of Animal Health published a report by U.S. authorities that a strain of bird flu that scientists call H5N9 had been found among sick birds in the flock.",
      "This is far from the first time that H5N9 has been found in birds around the country. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it was the first time that H5N9 had been found in American poultry sick with \"highly pathogenic avian influenza,\" meaning it caused severe disease.",
      "\"Clinical signs included increased mortality. State officials have quarantined the affected premises,\" the USDA said of the flock.",
      "What is H5N9 and how is it different from H5N1?",
      "Scientists classify bird flu viruses by which kind of two key proteins are inside of them: the hemagglutinin, like H5 or H3, and the neuraminidase, like N1 or N9.",
      "Different blends of those two proteins alongside many other mutations elsewhere in the virus can affect how sick people and animals get and how it spreads.",
      "H5N1 has been the dominant grouping of strains fueling this past year's outbreaks in the U.S., with different variants of that virus spreading in wild birds, poultry flocks, dairy cattle, pets and into at least 67 confirmed human cases.",
      "A spokesperson for the department said that scientists believe the H5N9 was the result of a \"reassortment,\" where H5N1 was able to\u00a0genetically mix\u00a0with other influenza viruses inside of a duck.",
      "\"The finding was not unexpected, as it is not uncommon to see reassortments and ducks are reservoir hosts for influenza A viruses,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Both H5N9 and H5N1 were found to be infecting ducks at the farm, the USDA said.",
      "\"The H5N1 virus is widely circulating across North America, and these viruses can reassort in species that are susceptible to influenza viruses,\" said S. Mark Tompkins, director of the Center for Influenza Disease and Emergence Research at the University of Georgia. He agreed that it would not be \"terribly surprising\" to see a reassortment emerge to infect poultry.",
      "\"H5N1 reassorts with other avian influenza viruses quite frequently and even the current H5 HA protein that is infecting dairy cows and commercial poultry farms in the US has been shown to reassort,\"\u00a0Andy Pekosz, professor of microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University, wrote in an email.",
      "Has H5N9 been seen in the U.S. before?",
      "H5N9 has been seen before in U.S. birds, but often it results in less severe symptoms, called \"low pathogenic avian influenza\" by veterinarians.",
      "\"H5N9 viruses have been detected in North American wild birds in 2023 and 2024, and before the current outbreak,\" said Tompkins.",
      "Some of the\u00a0earliest records\u00a0of H5N9 around the world date back to turkeys infected in Wisconsin in the 1960s, which U.S. officials\u00a0reported had\u00a0\"mild respiratory symptoms and a severe drop in egg production.\"",
      "The California duck farm's strain of H5N9 is different from those earlier cases because this time it is closely related to a newer variant of the H5N1 virus. That variant is called H5N1 D1.1, the USDA spokesperson said, which has emerged over the past year to dominate U.S. cases in wild birds and poultry.",
      "\"The combination H5N9 is not new and other versions, like H5N5 also exist. Just because this was now detected, doesn't mean trouble necessarily,\" said virologist Florian Krammer, professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in an email.",
      "Krammer pointed to recent detections of the H5N5\u00a0strain spreading from Europe, and then jumping from birds to be able to infect mammals across Canada as prompting more worry for him.",
      "\"It's not really surprising, because we have a history of three years of H5N1 undergoing reassortments that would typically burn out and not emerge as a major one,\" said David Swayne, a private veterinarian and former director of the USDA's Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory.",
      "Swayne said that past H5N9 outbreaks have been dead ends, in the handful of times they have been found to be causing severe disease in ducks.",
      "\"So far, I have not heard of any evidence to say this H5N9 has some kind of fitness that is better than the H5N1. If it doesn't have that, it can't outcompete,\" said Swayne.",
      "Is H5N9 a bigger risk to humans than H5N1?",
      "As with H5N1, H5N9 in birds would still need to achieve some key mutations before it is able to spread efficiently among humans.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday they have found no evidence of human-to-human transmission of bird flu in the U.S. to date. Most cases were blamed on direct contact with sick animals, except for three that have befuddled investigators who failed to identify a likely source.",
      "It is unclear whether authorities followed up with workers at the Merced County farm about potential human infections. A spokesperson for the county did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "If H5N9 gains a foothold in humans, people may possibly have less immunity to the virus than they do to H5N1.",
      "\"The seasonal, human H1N1 virus has an NA protein that is related, but different from the bovine H5N1 NA protein. There is some cross-recognition of avian H5N1 NA in the human population because of this,\" said Pekosz.",
      "Where was the California H5N9 outbreak?",
      "The USDA said the virus was detected at a \"commercial duck meat\" farm in California's Merced County, in an outbreak that started on Nov. 23, 2024.",
      "A total of 118,954 birds were culled at the duck farm by Dec. 2 to stamp out the virus, in an effort to curb the risk of further bird flu spread.",
      "More than 3 million birds have been culled at farms in this California county over the past year due to bird flu outbreaks, the most of any county in the state. California has been hit hard by this past year's bird flu outbreaks, which have resulted in record cullings across the egg industry.",
      "Scientists say ducks are especially susceptible to harboring influenza viruses without being sick, making them common mixing vessels for bird flu strains.",
      "\"Unless you have very tight biosecurity, it is very hard to raise ducks without many low path influenza viruses,\" said Swayne.",
      "Swayne said ducks often need the lowest dose of virus to be infected with bird flu viruses, compared to other poultry, like chickens. One way the virus can spread onto farms is when they are raised outside, mixing with wild ducks.",
      "\"If you look at the natural history, wild ducks are the reservoir of genes for all influenza virus. There's probably an adaptation with the virus. These viruses infect without showing overt clinical disease, they spread very rapidly between the adults to the juveniles,\" said Swayne.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Caroline Kennedy, the cousin of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., sent a blistering letter to senators on Tuesday \u2014 a day before his confirmation hearings \u2014 that described him as a \"predator\" whose actions \"have cost lives.\"",
      "In the letter to committee leaders, the former ambassador to Australia urged senators to reject his nomination as health and human services secretary, alleging that he \"preys on the desperation of parents and sick children,\" as well as his own family members.",
      "\"It's no surprise that he keeps birds of prey as pets because he himself is a predator,\" the two-page letter said. \"His basement, his garage, and his dorm room were the centers of the action where drugs were available, and he enjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in the blender to feed his hawks. It was often a perverse scene of despair and violence.\"",
      "Family members who followed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. down the path of substance abuse, Caroline Kennedy wrote, \"suffered addiction, illness and death, while Bobby has gone on to misrepresent, lie, and cheat his way through life.\"",
      "She also said that while her cousin has discouraged parents from vaccinating their children, he has vaccinated his own.",
      "\"Even before he fills this job, his constant denigration of our health care system and the conspiratorial half-truths he has told about vaccines, including in connection with Samoa's deadly 2019 measles outbreak, have cost lives,\" Caroline Kennedy wrote.",
      "She also read her letter to the senators in a social media post on X.",
      "His \"crusade against vaccination\" serves to enrich him financially, she said. His financial disclosures\u00a0showed\u00a0RFK Jr. still intends to receive legal fees from Wisner Baum, a firm suing the maker of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Gardasil over its alleged failure to warn consumers about its risks.",
      "\"In other words,\" she said, \"he is willing to enrich himself by denying access to a vaccine that can prevent almost all forms of cervical cancer and which has been safely administered to millions of boys and girls.\" She went on to say that while she was ambassador to Australia, she learned it was one of the top three cancers afflicting women in a majority of countries.",
      "Caroline Kennedy also excoriated RFK Jr. over his presidential campaign: \"It also wasn't easy to remain silent last year when Bobby expropriated my father's image and distorted President Kennedy's legacy to advance his own failed presidential campaign \u2014 and then groveled to Donald Trump for a job. Bobby continues to grandstand off my father's assassination, and that of his own father. It is incomprehensible that someone who is willing to exploit their own painful family tragedies for publicity would be in charge of American life-and-death situations.\"",
      "Her cousin, she said, is \"addicted to attention and power.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's controversial pick is set to appear Wednesday before the Senate Committee on Finance, which will decide whether to advance his nomination. On Thursday, he is scheduled to testify before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faces opposition from both sides of the aisle. Conservatives groups have expressed concern about his past statements in support of abortion rights, though he has reassured them that he would follow Mr. Trump's promise to defer the issue to states. Democrats and vaccine experts have condemned him for spreading misleading claims on a range of vaccines, including the COVID-19 and polio shots.",

    "story": [
      "An Alabama woman passed a major milestone Saturday to become the longest-living recipient of a pig organ transplant \u2013 healthy and full of energy with her new kidney for 61 days and counting.",
      "\"I'm superwoman,\" Towana Looney told The Associated Press, laughing about outpacing family members on long walks around New York City as she continues her recovery. \"It's a new take on life.\"",
      "Looney's vibrant recovery is a morale boost in the quest to make\u00a0animal-to-human transplants a reality. Looney the\u00a0fifth American\u00a0given a\u00a0gene-edited pig organ.",
      "\"If you saw her on the street, you would have no idea that she's the only person in the world walking around with a pig organ inside them that's functioning,\" said Dr. Robert Montgomery of NYU Langone Health, who led Looney's transplant.",
      "Montgomery called Looney's kidney function \"absolutely normal.\" Doctors hope she can leave New York \u2013 where she's temporarily living for post-transplant checkups \u2013 for her Gadsden, Alabama, home in about another month.",
      "\"We're quite optimistic that this is going to continue to work and work well for, you know, a significant period of time,\" he said.",
      "Why scientists are using pig organs for transplants",
      "Scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike to address a severe shortage of transplantable human organs. More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list, most who need a kidney, and thousands die waiting.",
      "Pig organ transplants so far have been \"compassionate use\" cases, experiments the Food and Drug Administration allows only in special circumstances for people out of other options.",
      "And the handful of hospitals trying them are sharing information of what worked and what didn't, in preparation for the world's first formal studies of xenotransplantation, expected to begin sometime this year. United Therapeutics, which supplied Looney's kidney, recently asked the Food and Drug Administration for permission to begin a trial.",
      "How Looney fares is a \"very precious experience,\" said Dr. Tatsuo Kawai of Massachusetts General Hospital, who led the world's first pig kidney transplant last year and works with another pig developer, eGenesis.",
      "Looney was far healthier than the prior patients, Kawai noted, so her progress will help inform the next attempts.",
      "\"We have to learn from each other,\" he said.",
      "Towana Looney's transplant story",
      "Looney donated a kidney to her mother in 1999. Later pregnancy complications caused high blood pressure that damaged her remaining kidney, which eventually failed, something incredibly rare among living donors. She spent eight years on dialysis before doctors concluded she'd likely never get a donated organ \u2013 she'd developed super-high levels of antibodies abnormally primed to attack another human kidney.",
      "So Looney, 53, sought out the pig experiment. No one knew how it would work in someone \"highly sensitized\" with those overactive antibodies.",
      "Discharged just 11 days after the Nov. 25 surgery, Montgomery's team has closely tracked her recovery through blood tests and other measurements. About three weeks after the transplant, they caught subtle signs that rejection was beginning \u2013 signs they'd learned to look for thanks to a 2023 experiment when a pig kidney worked for 61 days inside a deceased man whose body was donated for research.",
      "Montgomery said they successfully treated Looney and there's been no sign of rejection since \u2013 and a few weeks ago she met the family behind that deceased-body research.",
      "\"It feels really good to know that the decision I made for NYU to use my brother was the right decision and it's helping people,\" said Mary Miller-Duffy, of Newburgh, New York.",
      "Looney in turn is trying to help others, serving as what Montgomery calls an ambassador for people who've been reaching out to her through social media, sharing their distress at the long wait for transplants and wondering about pig kidneys.",
      "One, she said, was being considered for a xenotransplant at another hospital but was scared, wondering whether to proceed.",
      "\"I didn't want to persuade him whether to do or not to do it,\" Looney said.",
      "Instead, she asked if he was religious and urged him to pray, to \"go off your faith, what your heart tells you.\"",
      "\"I love talking to people, I love helping people,\" she added. \"I want to be, like, some educational piece\" for scientists to help others.",
      "There's no way to predict how long Looney's new kidney will work but if it were to fail she could receive dialysis again.",
      "\"The truth is we don't really know what the next hurdles are because this is the first time we've gotten this far,\" Montgomery said. \"We'll have to continue to really keep a close eye on her.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 19:44:42 -0500",
    "summary": "Less than two weeks into his second term, President Trump may be poised to deploy steep tariffs against key U.S. trading partners.",
    "story": [
      "On the day of his inauguration, President Trump threatened steep new tariffs against key U.S. trading partners. Now he may be primed to deliver.",
      "Mr. Trump said Jan. 20 that he could announce 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1, while China could face a 10% duty. Economists have warned that stiff tariffs\u00a0could reawaken inflation on a range of consumer goods and slow economic growth. Here's what experts have to say.",
      "Why is Trump threatening to hit countries with tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump has threatened tariffs against multiple nations for a range of reasons. He said he is specifically\u00a0targeting Canada, Mexico\u00a0and China with tariffs to compel them to take action to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S.",
      "Before Mr. Trump returned to power, he also had threatened tariffs of up to\u00a060% on Chinese goods\u00a0imported into the U.S., a measure experts say is intended to advance American interests in negotiating better trade terms with Beijing, as well as throttle the illegal entry of fentanyl into the country.",
      "In a show of how his administration uses tariff threats to pressure countries on other issues, Mr. Trump last week proposed potential 25% levies against Colombia unless it agreed to receive deportations of unauthorized immigrants. Colombia ultimately agreed to receive the immigrants,\u00a0and the tariffs were withheld.",
      "Colombia's about-face suggests that Canada and Mexico could also reach agreement with the U.S. and avert a painful trade war. To that end, Howard Lutnick, Mr. Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, said at his confirmation hearing Wednesday that Canada and Mexico could avoid tariffs by closing their borders to fentanyl.",
      "\"As far as I know, they are acting swiftly, and if they execute it, there will be no tariff,\" Lutnick told senators.",
      "Even so, Mr. Trump's brandishing of potential tariffs \u2014 even if they are never imposed \u2014 highlights his willingness to use tough trade measures to punish even the country's closest allies unless they make concessions.",
      "\"As we have previously noted, trade policy will be transactional over the next four years with protectionist measures used to extort trade, immigration and other political concessions,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said in a research note.",
      "What exactly is Trump planning?",
      "Rather than targeting individual countries, the Trump administration could also opt to impose a blanket tariff on a range of countries in Asia, South America, Europe and other regions, experts say. But it remains unclear what tariffs could be deployed, how they might be structured and the possible timeline for deploying them.",
      "\"I think we have to proceed on the assumption that some kinds of tariffs are going to be imposed on the United States' major trading partners,\" Brett House, professor of economics at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"In the end, there is a lot that gets announced by the president on social media that does not come to pass. I don't take it as bluffing, so much as a storm of possibilities, and it's hard to tell which bit of that storm is going to be pursued most aggressively, and most immediately.\"",
      "What's clear, by contrast, is that the new administration is picking up where Mr. Trump left off in his first term in using trade policy as an instrument of both economic and foreign policy. That is likely to lead to a period of uncertainty and volatility, said John Lash, group vice president of product strategy at supply-chain software firm E2open.",
      "\"A lot of alternatives are still possible,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch in an interview. \"We don't know, but game theory would suggest the president would implement tariffs in some form against Mexico and Canada \u2014 not blanket tariffs, but on a select number of imports from both nations... because otherwise his bluff is going to be called.\"",
      "On how soon any tariffs could take effect, Daco notes that Mr. Trump could move quickly by claiming authority under a 1977 law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.",
      "\"When he said he'll impose tariffs on Feb. 1, it is still an open question as to what means would be used. Do you want to implement tariffs immediately, as threatened against Colombia over the weekend, or are you threatening with a deadline to obtain concessions?,\" Daco said.",
      "Would the U.S. face retaliation?",
      "Almost certainly, economists say. If Trump officials move ahead with tariffs on its northern neighbor, \"We anticipate Canada would then respond in kind by also implementing a 25% across-the-board tariff on U.S. imports,\" Satyam Panday, chief U.S. and Canada economist with S&P Global Ratings, said in an email.",
      "Elijah Oliveros-Rosen, chief emerging markets economist at S&P Global Ratings, predicted Mexico also would fire back with targeted tariffs. \"In the case of Mexico, we think it's very unlikely the government would place tariffs on U.S.-manufactured imports, given most are intermediate goods eventually exported to the U.S. Therefore, we expect the Mexican government could impose tariffs on agricultural and food imports, but not manufacturing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said that strengthening the U.S.' stance on trade issues will help protect American workers and lead to a resurgence of domestic manufacturing. Yet such policies could come at the cost of damaging critical relationships with other nations around the world, said Douglas Irwin, a U.S. trade policy expert and professor of economics at Dartmouth College.",
      "What is the risk to American consumers?",
      "Irwin and other economists say tariffs are all but certain to lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers. That's because companies that end up on the hook typically pass added costs along to consumers in order to protect their bottom lines.",
      "\"The notion this this administration has been adhering to is somewhat surprising \u2014 the idea that if you implement gradual tariffs over time, such as in 5% increments, that these are less inflationary,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This idea is misguided, because if you have incremental price increases month after month, if anything that leads to higher inflation expectations. It leads to higher inflation on a month-to-month basis.\"",
      "If Mr. Trump's tariffs are implemented in full, including a universal 10% tax on all goods, consumer price inflation could rise by between 3% and 4%, according to an analysis this week from Capital Economics. To be sure, analysts with the investment advisory firm expect Mr. Trump to stop short of imposing a blanket tariff and instead pick his targets.",
      "\"Nevertheless, imposing any of these suggested tariffs would generate a rebound in consumer price inflation this year, taking it further above target and making it harder for the Fed to resume loosening monetary policy,\" the firm said.",

To the dismay of consumers still struggling to digest soaring food costs, that likely means even higher egg prices in 2025.",
      "\"I think eggs have felt relatively extreme over the past few months,\" Kip Green, co-owner and general manager of Montague Diner in Brooklyn, New York, told CBS News. \"We're fortunate though, we have a great relationships with our purveyors, with farmers. So everybody is trying to help each other out, which is lovely.\"",
      "Like many diners, Montague uses hundreds of eggs a day said Green. Whether served as part of a classic breakfast plate alongside potatoes and toast, or an egg salad sandwich, eggs comprise 40% to 50% of the restaurant's menu, she said.",
      "\"I mean, it's even like, there's some things that you might not even think about, like in our pancake batter or like in our French toast batter, like just things like that. We still use so many eggs.\"",
      "Even so, Green said that she and her team are \"aligned on keeping guests at the forefront,\" which means shielding them from price hikes on eggs.",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it's challenging. Like we, we have to figure out how to make it work,\" she said. \"Eggs are central to us, we are a diner. You have to have an egg plate,\" she said, adding, \"We don't ever want to stop that or to, to make people pay more for something like that. So you figure out how to cut costs elsewhere.\"",
      "The average price of a dozen large, grade-A eggs was $4.15 in December 2024, up 14% from $3.65 in November, federal\u00a0data shows. That's a more than 60% increase from the $2.51 it cost a year ago and 160% more than the $1.41 consumers paid for the same carton in 2019, CBS News' price tracker\u00a0reveals.",
      "By comparison, the overall monthly rate of inflation for food in December was 2.5%, with the cost of food at home rising just 0.3%, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data.",
      "Like a souffl\u00e9, egg prices are rising to impressive heights right before our eyes. When will it end? Not anytime soon, according to the USDA, which\u00a0predicts\u00a0in a recent report that egg prices will shoot up another 20% this year.",
      "Behind rising egg prices and shortages is a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), known as H5N1, that killed 13.2 million commercial egg-laying hens in the month of December alone and continues to depopulate flocks into 2025, according to the USDA. Outbreaks of H5N1 were first detected in the U.S. in 2022 and are considered to be the main driver behind the years-long volatility in egg prices.",
      "H5N1, which has a high mortality rate among infected\u00a0poultry\u00a0and wild birds, is being watched closely by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a potential public health\u00a0threat. So far, the CDC has received one report of a person dying after being hospitalized with severe illness from the virus. Among cattle, the average mortality and culling rate is 2% or less, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. However, officials warn that H5N1 is lethal to cats",
      "For now, the virus remains mostly a thorn in the side of U.S. consumers\u00a0fed up with inflation.",
      "\"For about a year and a half now, the sort of frequency and severity of avian flu outbreaks in the poultry and egg supply chains in the U.S. have sort of just been on the rise in a big way,\" Ricky Volpe, a professor of agribusiness at Cal Poly State University, San Luis Obispo, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone is just sort of hoping that, 'OK, this will be the last one, then we'll get back to normal.' But we keep on not getting back to normal.\"",
      "More than 79.3 million U.S. chickens died in 2022 and 2023 as result of H5N1 infections and related culling, according to a January\u00a0report\u00a0from TD Cowen. In total, H5N1 is estimated to have led to the loss of nearly 139 million birds across the country, including Puerto Rico, according to the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.",
      "Devastating for farmers",
      "The bird flu outbreaks disrupting the nation's egg supplies are a dealing a serious blow to affected farmers. Anytime the virus is found, the entire flock must be slaughtered to help limit the virus' spread. Replenishing supplies is yet another challenge.",
      "\"It takes approximately 19-20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs in newly repopulated barns, and that is but one element of a lengthy recovery process,\" a spokesperson for the American Egg Board said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Bird flu is absolutely devastating to an egg farm. When an egg farm is impacted with HPAI, it must go through a comprehensive and lengthy process involving multiple steps and government approvals before it can begin to repopulate with new flocks and return to producing eggs. This process that can take nine months to more than a year,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "With massive egg farms routinely housing more than 1 million chickens, just a few infections can lead to a supply crunch.",
      "Other factors",
      "Another factor driving up egg prices: a persistent shortage of truck drivers in the U.S. \u2014 a mounting problem as more drivers retire. And with fewer drivers to transport eggs to retailers, wholesalers are forced to raise shipping costs.",
      "\"Refrigerated truck transportation is a major pain point in the food supply chain right now. There's a shortage of drivers, long-haul truck rates are up and eggs are of course very transportation-intensive,\" Volpe said. \"Even before we were dealing with avian flu, the trucks just weren't there to deliver eggs in a timely fashion.\"",
      "For consumers in Colorado, a state law requiring all eggs to be cage-free by January 2025, has added to the soaring price of eggs.",
      "As a partial solution to the nationwide problem, Volpe suggests that retailers source eggs locally wherever possible.",
      "\"[Local suppliers] are pretty well insulated from these systemic issues of avian flu or whatever, so supply is healthy. So it makes sense to augment supply whenever possible locally from local growers who are not facing these significant issues related to bird flu and transportation.\"",
      "Why are egg prices lower in some stores?",
      "Just as retailers use Thanksgiving Day turkey promotions to attract customers, some grocery stores around the country are offering lower egg prices to drive store traffic.",
      "\"You can go on social media and you'll see someone complaining about an $8 dozen of eggs and then someone else will chime in and go 'I just got it for $4.' Well, I absolutely guarantee you that was sold at a loss, and it was sort of a competitive effort to increase foot traffic,\" Volpe said. \"Maybe eggs are sold at a loss, but now you're going to buy your milk and your bread and vegetables, everything else, and those will have the normal profit margins.\"",
      "Translation: If you find a good deal on eggs at a store, you might still end up paying roughly the same cost for your entire basket of groceries as you would somewhere else.",
      "Response from White House",
      "\"There is a lot of reporting out there that is putting the onus on this White House for the increased cost of eggs,\" said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked at her first press briefing on Tuesday what President Trump is doing to address egg prices which have spiked since he took office earlier this month.",
      "\"As far as the egg shortage, what's also contributing to that is that the Biden admin and Department of Agriculture directed the mass killing of 100 million chickens,\" Leavitt, who made no mention of avian flu, said in her response.",
      "Leavitt went on to urge the Senate to move \"swiftly\" to confirm Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees \"including his nominee for the United States Department of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins ... who is leading the economic team here at the White House, on how we can address the egg shortage in this country.\"",
      "Correction:\u00a0This story has been revised because it mistakenly reported that it takes less than six weeks for commercial hens to produce eggs. This is incorrect. It takes 19 to 20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs, according to the American Egg Board. The trade group also notes that it can take more than a year for farms suffering a bird flu outbreak to secure the required government clearance to resume operations.",

      "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014\u00a0Activists are calling for a nationwide boycott of Target stores following the company's decision to roll back its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",
      "The company announced on Jan. 24 that it would end its DEI goals that were previously set to increase Black employees' representation and advancement, improve Black shoppers' experiences and promote Black-owned businesses. They are also pulling back on efforts to include hiring and promoting women, minorities, LGBTQ+ people and veterans.",
      "Activists held a press conference at Target headquarters in downtown Minneapolis Thursday morning.",
      "\"For decades, Target has benefitted from nearly unfettered support from Minnesota residents, families and consumers all around the country. In the past, Target was known for its diversity initiatives and reputation for supporting diverse communities,\" said civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong. \"Now Target has shown its true face by deciding to roll back its focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion by putting profits and politics over people.\"",
      "Armstrong encouraged Minnesotans to start boycotting Target stores indefinitely starting Saturday, Feb. 1.",
      "\"We do not believe it is a coincidence that Target made this decision after the holiday shopping season and roughly one week before the start of Black History Month,\" said Monique Cullars-Doty, co-founder of Black Lives Matter Minnesota.",
      "Speakers at Thursday's event made two requests: for employees to speak up and for shoppers to shop elsewhere.",
      "The fact Target actually increased DEI efforts after George Floyd's murder is making the company's decision that much more unbelievable for people like Jaylani Hussein, spokesperson for CAIR-MN.",
      "\"If you would have told me in those summers and months to come here today, talking about Target reversing its decision, I would personally say I couldn't believe it,\" said Hussein. He speculated that Target would reverse course by the end of February, which is Black History Month.",
      "On the other side of the boycott, Black business owners like Tabitha Brown \u2014 who sells kitchenware and has had her products highlighted in Target stores under the company's previous DEI initiatives \u2014 said in an Instagram video that she understands the anger. However, she asked for those who may consider a boycott to reconsider.",
      "\"If we all decide to boycott and be like 'no we're not spending no money at these organizations,'\" said Brown. \"So many of us will be affected and our sales would drop our business would be hurt.\"",
      "\"We remain focused on driving our business by creating a sense of belonging for our team, guests and communities through a commitment to inclusion,\" Target said in its initial statement explaining the rollback. \"Belonging for all is an essential part of our team and culture, helping fuel consumer relevance and business results.\"",
      "The decision raised questions about the future of Target's philanthropic commitments.\u00a0 A company spokesperson told the Associated Press that the \"recent update does not impact Target Foundation giving\" but added that, \"as always, the foundation will continue to evaluate how it best supports organizations, coalitions and networks.\"",
      "Shortly after Target's announcement, Twin Cities Pride, a longtime partner, said the company would not be welcome at this year's Pride celebration and renounced $50,000 in funding. Less than 24 hours later, Twin Cities Pride said community donations had filled the gap.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 12:48:00 -0500",
    "summary": "With tax season underway, here's what you need to know about tracking your tax refund and your new 2025 tax brackets.",
    "story": [
      "Tax season is now underway, with the IRS accepting returns for all taxpayers as of Jan. 27. That's prompting many people to turn to the \"Where's my refund?\" app from the tax agency to track when they'll get their check.",
      "Americans are expected to file about 140 million returns before the April 15 deadline. Last year, about two-thirds of taxpayers got a refund, with the average check at about $3,100,\u00a0according\u00a0to IRS data.",
      "A household's tax refund may represent their biggest check for the entire year, with many consumers planning to use the money for debt repayment, emergency savings or a big purchase. To be sure, while a large refund may feel like a financial windfall, it actually represents income that taxpayers have overpaid to the IRS throughout the year.",
      "That's why some financial experts describe refund checks as tax-free loans to the U.S. government. Yet other experts note that tax refunds can act as a form of forced savings that a household might not otherwise be able to accomplish, allowing those taxpayers to reap the benefit in their annual refund.",
      "Whatever the case might be, tracking your refund can be done through the IRS' \"Where's my refund\" app, which the agency has sought to improve over the last few years. Here's what to know.",
      "How does \"Where's my refund?\" work?",
      "The IRS operates the \"Where's my refund?\" service on its website, but taxpayers can also use a mobile app called IRS2Go\u00a0on their phones or other devices. Both services will provide information about your 2024 return about 24 hours after you e-file, the IRS says.",
      "However, people who file paper returns will need to wait about 4 weeks for their information to appear on \"Where's my refund?\" or the IRS2Go app.",
      "Both services require taxpayers to enter information to be able to track their refunds:",
      "Either your Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification numberFiling status, such as single filer or married filing jointly\u00a0The exact whole dollar amount of your expected refund from your original 2024 tax return",
      "Either your Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification number",
      "Filing status, such as single filer or married filing jointly",
      "The exact whole dollar amount of your expected refund from your original 2024 tax return",
      "The IRS tracking services will then show you information on whether the agency has received your tax return, if the refund has been approved and when the money is scheduled to land in your account.",
      "When will I get my tax refund?",
      "That depends on whether you've file electronically or sent in a paper tax return, as well as if the IRS identifies any problems with your return.",
      "People who e-filed their returns typically receive their refunds in less than 21 days. In other words, a taxpayer who filed their 1040 on Jan. 27 could receive their payment by Feb. 17, if all goes smoothly.",
      "However, the IRS opened its Free File service on Jan. 10, which is a program offered through tax software companies for taxpayers with adjusted gross income of $84,000 or less in 2024. Those using Free File could be on tap to receive their refunds by Jan. 31.",
      "What can delay your tax refund?",
      "Filing a paper return can delay your refund because it requires IRS employees to process them, which takes more time than e-filed returns, which are largely handled by computers.",
      "Claiming either the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) can also slow down a tax refund. That's because, by law, the IRS can't issue refunds for returns that have claimed those tax credits before mid-February.",
      "\"The IRS expects most EITC/ACTC-related refunds to be available in taxpayer bank accounts or on debit cards by March 3 if they chose direct deposit and there are no other issues with their tax return,\" the agency said on Monday.",
      "Some issues can also trip up tax refunds, such as if there are math errors on your return, missing or incorrect Social Security numbers or misspelled names, according to the IRS. While these might be innocent mistakes, it can cause the IRS to flag your return and delay your refund.",
      "What's my new 2025 tax bracket?",
      "The IRS has set new tax brackets for 2025, but that won't impact the return you'll file by April 15, since that 1040 reflects your 2024 income and taxes.",
      "Each year, the IRS adjusts its tax brackets and dozens of other provisions to account for inflation. The idea is to shield taxpayers from \"bracket creep\" \u2014 when workers are pushed into higher tax bands due to the impact of cost-of-living adjustments aimed at offsetting inflation \u2014 without a change in their standard of living.",
      "This year's tax brackets are adjusted 2.8% higher from 2024, representing the smallest jump in several years. Because inflation jumped during the pandemic, the bracket adjustments reached 7% in 2023\u00a0and\u00a05.4% in 2024.",

      "Wednesday's report also showed persistent inflationary pressure at the end of the 2024. The Federal Reserve's favored inflation gauge \u2014 called the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE \u2014 rose at a 2.3% annual pace last quarter, up from 1.5% in the third quarter and above the Fed's 2% target. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation was 2.5%, up from 2.2% in the July-September quarter.",
      "A drop in business inventories shaved 0.93 percentage points off fourth-quarter growth.",
      "But a category within the GDP data that measures the economy's underlying strength rose at a healthy 3.2% annual rate from July through September, slipping from 3.4% in the third quarter. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending.",

      "President Donald Trump has inherited a healthy economy. Growth has been steady and unemployment low \u2014 4.1% in December.",
      "On Wednesday, the Fed left its benchmark interest rate unchanged after making three cuts since September. With the economy rolling along, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters, \"we do not need to be in a hurry'' to make more cuts. The Fed is also cautious because progress against inflation has stalled in recent months after falling from four-decade highs hit in mid-2022.",
      "The European Central Bank cut its benchmark rate by a quarter point Thursday, underlining the contrast between more robust growth in the U.S. economy and stagnation in Europe, which recorded zero growth at the end of last year.",
      "The U.S. economic outlook has become more cloudy, however. Trump has promised to cut taxes and ease regulations on business, which could speed GDP growth. But his plan to impose big taxes on imports and to deport millions of immigrants working in the United States illegally could mean slower growth and higher prices.",
      "Trump said last week that he would lower oil prices and then \"demand'' lower interest rates \u2013 a topic he said he'd take up with Powell. But the Fed chair deflected questions about Trump's comments Wednesday and said he'd had no contact with the president.",

      "Powell also described the economy as \"in quite a good place,\" citing growing GDP, solid job gains and a low unemployment rate, as well as signs of inflationary pressures easing. \"We don't need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,\" he added.",
      "\"Pressing the pause button,\" noted Lindsay Rosner, head of multisector fixed-income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"[T]he FOMC will want to see further progress in the inflation data to deliver the next rate cut highlighted by the fact they removed the reference on inflation making progress.\"",

      "In the meantime, inflation-weary consumers won't get much relief from still-high borrowing costs, especially if the Fed holds off on additional rate cuts later in 2025, as many economists and Wall Street analysts forecast. With the Fed hitting the pause button, it's unlikely that consumers will see lower borrowing costs on credit cards or other forms of debt, even as more households struggle to pay their bills.",
      "\"[L]ower- and middle-income households are facing mounting pressure, as evidenced by an increase in credit card and auto loan delinquencies,\" Joe Gaffoglio, CEO of Mutual of America Capital Management, said in an email.",
      "When will the Fed cut rates?",
      "The Fed may hold off on cutting rates until its May 7 meeting, according to economists polled by financial-data firm FactSet. That means the central bank is expected to hold rates steady at its next meeting on March 19.",
      "\"If the Fed doesn't resume cutting in the next few months, however, we suspect the window will have closed,\" Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics said in a report. \"While markets are still pricing in second half rate cuts, our view is that a flurry of tariffs will put a stop to that, as inflation rebounds to 3%.\"",
      "Asked about the possible impact of Mr. Trump's economic plans, Powell demurred, noting that while the Fed is monitoring the new administration's policies, it's too early for the central bank to make an assessment of their possible impact. Mr. Trump has vowed to enact a broad tariff of 10% on all imports, as well as to imposed\u00a025% tariffs on Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1.",
      "\"We need to let those policies be articulated before we can even begin to make that a plausible assessment of what their implications for the economy will be,\" he said. \"We don't know what's going to be tariffed, we don't know for how long or how much, what countries, we don't know about retaliation.\"",
      "Asked by CBS News' Richard Escobedo about economic uncertainty created by Mr. Trump's plan to deport undocumented immigrants, Powell responded that the administration's efforts are not yet showing up in economic data.",
      "\"Businesses that are dependent on immigrant labor are saying that it's suddenly gotten harder to get people,\" the Fed chair said. \"But again, you don't see that in the aggregate data, but yes, you hear it anecdotally.\"",
      "While inflation has subsided from a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022, it\u00a0rose 2.9% in December on a year-over-year basis due to higher prices on gasoline, which rose 4.4% from the prior month, as well as food and housing.",
      "In its statement, the Fed described the labor market as \"solid,\" with an unemployment rate that has \"stabilized at a low level in recent months.\" Even so, the Fed is closely monitoring the labor market for signs of weakness, with the central bank pointing to a rise in the jobless rate last fall as one reason why it opted to cut rates at the time.",
      "\"The Fed will keep their options open in case a sudden weakening materializes in the months to come\" in the labor market, noted Bankrate chief financial analyst Greg McBride in an email.",
      "As for when the next rate cut might come, it's unclear from the Fed's statement, he added.",
      "\"They gave no indication in their post-meeting statement that a resumption of rate cuts is likely at the next meeting in March,\" McBride said. \"It will take a run of good inflation data to get us there, whenever that may be.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 16:02:41 -0500",
    "summary": "The Fed held off on another rate cut at its Jan. 29 meeting. Here's what it means for your finances.",
    "story": [
      "Borrowers hoping for more financial relief from the Federal Reserve may have a wait on their hands, as the central bank is hit the pause button on additional rate cuts at its Jan. 29 meeting.",
      "The Fed held its benchmark rate steady on Wednesday at its current range between 4.25% to 4.5%, a move that was forecast by a majority of economists polled by FactSet. Most economists also predict the Fed will hold off on cutting at its March 19 meeting, which means the next rate cut might not occur until the central bank's May 7 meeting, FactSet data shows.",
      "The January pause marks an end, at least temporarily, to the Fed's flurry of rate cuts that started in September 2024 which have pushed down the federal funds rate by one percentage point. That's helped trim borrowing costs for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other debt, providing some respite to inflation-pinched consumers and businesses.",
      "But in December, the Fed had signaled that it expected fewer cuts\u00a0in 2025 than it had earlier projected, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell pointing to inflation that remains above the central bank's goal of an annual 2% rate. Economists say it's likely the Fed wants to take a wait-and-see approach to the Trump administration's policies such as adding new tariffs and widespread deportations of immigrants, which could both prove inflationary.",
      "\"The reason why the Fed isn't jumping the gun at lowering the rates faster and further is that, on one hand, inflation is not gone. They looked carefully at the data, and it is still stubbornly above target, so there is concern if you lower rates further, inflation would tick up again,\" Erasmus Kersting, a professor of economics at Villanova University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Secondly, he added, \"Tariffs or mass deportations are expected to be inflationary. For that reason, the Fed is also right to be careful about lowering rates.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the rate pause by the fed.",
      "When did the Fed make its rate decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve announced its rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on Jan. 29. It will be followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m. EST.",
      "How will a pause on rate cuts impact my money?",
      "The Fed cut its benchmark rate three times last year, kicking off with a jumbo 0.5 percentage point reduction in September. That was followed by two consecutive\u00a00.25 percentage point cuts: one at its November meeting and a second at its December meeting.",
      "The pause in early 2025 means that consumers can't expect additional near-term relief on borrowing costs, experts say.",
      "\"Anyone hoping for the Fed to ride in as the cavalry and rescue you from high interest rates anytime soon is going to be really disappointed,\" said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, in an email. \"That's true whether you're talking about mortgages, auto loans, credit cards or most anything else.\"",
      "Because credit card rates and other borrowing costs aren't likely to change, consumers should work on getting their higher-interest debt under control, Schulz added. Turning to a 0% balance transfer credit card or consolidating credit card debt with a personal loan can prove helpful with lowering interest payments, he noted.",
      "If there's a bright side, it's for savers, given that they should still be able to find solid rates on high-yield savings accounts, even though they've declined since the Fed began trimming its benchmark rate last year, Schulz said. Some savings accounts are still paying above 4%, down from about 5% a year ago.",
      "\"Returns on high-yield savings accounts have fallen from their record levels as the Fed has moved to lower rates. However, as the Fed pauses, that decline should slow as well,\" he said.",
      "When will mortgage rates come down?",
      "One of the disappointments for house hunters, as well as homeowners who want to refinance into lower rates, has been stubbornly high mortgage rates. Despite the Fed's three rate cuts last year, the average 30-year home loan remains near 7%, near 25-year highs.",
      "Mortgage rates haven't declined despite the Fed's cuts because home loans are based on a number of factors besides the federal funds rate, including broader economic trends and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond.",
      "Given concerns from economists that President Trump's plans could prove inflationary, mortgage rates might not come down anytime soon, experts said.",
      "\"The general consensus is that rates will likely remain unchanged until the market has more clarity around potential policy impacts as it relates to immigration, taxes and tariffs,\" noted Austin Walker, CEO of A. Walker & Co., a housing finance company.",
      "Will interest rates go down under President Trump?",
      "Last week at the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Trump said he would \"demand that interest rates drop immediately, and likewise, they should be dropping all over the world.\"",
      "It's unlikely that Mr. Trump could influence the Fed to lower rates, as the central bank is an independent institution that bases its decisions on economic data, rather than orders from elected officials, experts say.",
      "Rates are set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which consists of 12 members \u2014 seven members come from the Fed's Board of Governors; four stem from the eleven Reserve Bank presidents, who each serve one-year terms on a rotating basis, and one FOMC member is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Powell, meanwhile, has said he won't step down if Mr. Trump, who has previously criticized Powell's performance, asks him to resign, adding that the president doesn't have the power to fire or demote the Fed chair. His term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "At the same time, economists are forecasting more rate cuts in 2025, but not until May or even later, according to FactSet polling. But one wild card is whether inflation could tick higher in early 2025 due to the Trump administration's policies.",
      "\"Importantly, the outlook is clouded by heightened policy uncertainty as a new administration takes office,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco in an email. Daco added he is forecasting three 0.25 percentage point cuts this year \u2014 in March, June and September. \"This year, we expect the Fed will tread carefully.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 14:59:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump executive order that reclassifies career civil servants risks politicizing thousands of government jobs, critics say.",
    "story": [
      "From meat inspectors to border patrol officers, many Americans who work for the federal government could soon see their jobs reclassified into at-will positions, meaning they can be dismissed for nearly any reason.",
      "In a related development, the White House expects up to 10% of federal employees to quit in September in a program meant to\u00a0end work-from-home practices, senior administration officials told CBS News.",
      "Depending on future court rulings and how effective the Trump administration proves to be in overriding existing federal regulations, an executive order signed by President Trump revives a policy from his first administration known as Schedule F. The Jan. 20\u00a0directive\u00a0creates a new employment classification for many career civil servants, effectively stripping them of job protections.",
      "Likely to impact tens of thousands of civil servants, and potentially more, the order defines policymaking positions to include mundane tasks such as viewing and circulating proposed government regulations.",
      "\"We think this order affects at least 50,000 people who are currently protected, but the number could be much bigger,\" Nick Bednar, a University of Minnesota Law School associate professor, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Some scholars think it could reach into the hundreds of thousands. At the end of the first term, when the Trump administration sought to reclassify positions, it included executive assistants, toxicologists and scientists \u2014 it's not clear who this doesn't reach.\"",
      "\"Individuals in these policymaking positions don't have the same due process protections as other employees. They can be more easily removed,\" Bednar added. \"There are 2.8 million civilian employees in the federal government. Most, or the vast majority, enjoy some kind of protection from removal.\"",
      "For now, it remains unclear how far the Trump administration plans to go in implementing the order, said Steve Lenkart, executive director of the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE-IAM), a union representing 100,000 government workers.",
      "\"Technically, if you're a maintenance person pushing a broom on the floor, you are executing a policy,\" said Lenkart in offering an example of how virtually any government worker could be defined as being engaged in work that falls under Schedule F.",
      "\"President Trump has the executive power to make decisions to implement a government that reflects the will of the American people,\" Harrison Fields, principal deputy press secretary at the White House, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"If an individual in the administration is working on policy, then they should align with President Trump's mission of putting America first.\"",
      "Hit to morale?",
      "President Trump is not unique in looking to have a stronger hand over the federal workforce, according to Bednar.",
      "\"A common strategy of presidents is trying to politicize federal employment positions so they have greater control over executive branch hiring and firing,\" said Bednar, who lists Dwight Eisenhower and Jimmy Carter among previous presidents who have sought to exert such influence. Still, he noted \"we haven't seen something that tries to reach this deep into the career staff.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump's Schedule F plan and other administration orders aimed a reshaping the federal workplace are being challenged in court, the Trump administration may succeed in its goal of downsizing government, regardless of whether it wins on the legal front, Bednar said.",
      "\"Even if the lawsuits slow down this process, there are many civil servants who might leave government fearing continuing to work in the Trump administration \u2014 employee moral is really affected,\" he said. \"They want a smaller government, and they view this as an opportunity to pursue that.\"",
      "Bednar also cautions that a smaller government workforce could hinder some Trump administration policy goals, including fewer agents to patrol U.S. borders and reduced staffing in immigration courts, adding to the current backlog.",
      "The case for and against Schedule F",
      "Mr. Trump originally implemented the Schedule F policy in 2020 as his first term was nearing an end, but it was repealed after former President Joe Biden took office. Mr. Trump said last week that the revived order is necessary to ensure that federal workers in roles that affect government policy remain accountable to the public.",
      "\"In recent years ... there have been numerous and well-documented cases of career federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership,\" Mr. Trump's order states. \"Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service, beginning with positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character.\"",
      "But critics of Schedule F argue it undermines the traditional principles behind civil service, which emphasize hiring based on professional qualifications. Should Schedule F survive legal challenges, they say, millions of government workers hired based on merit could be fired at will, including if they are deemed insufficiently loyal to Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Is this really about making government more efficient and smaller, or targeting regulatory and law enforcement people?\" asked Lenkart, who noted that the number of workers employed in the executive branch has remained roughly the same for more than 70 years even as the nation's population has doubled.",
      "Unions representing public workers have blasted Schedule F. The policy is among a slew of executive orders \"designed to intimidate and attack nonpartisan civil servants under the guise of increasing efficiency,\" Randy Erwin, national president of the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0last week. \"However, these orders will do the exact opposite.\"",
      "Members of the 100-year-old NFFE are employed\u00a0by\u00a0dozens of federal agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration and Social Security Administration.",
      "On Wednesday, the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) filed suit against the Trump administration, saying it was exceeding its authority in rolling back protections for workers.",
      "\"We can stop the efforts to fire hundreds of thousands of experienced, hard-working Americans who have dedicated their careers to serving their country and prevent these career civil servants from being replaced with unqualified political flunkies loyal to the president, but not the law or Constitution,\" AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in a statement.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union also filed a suit to block Schedule F, calling it \"contrary to congressional intent.\" The\u00a0complaint, filed Jan. 20 in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, argues that Mr. Trump's order reinstating Schedule F \"wrongly applies employment rules for political appointees to career staff, deprives federal employees of due process rights that they were promised when they were hired, and ignores Office of Personnel Management regulations.\"",

    "story": [
      "Update: The White House Office of Management and Budget on Wednesday, Jan. 29, rescinded a memo ordering a federal funding freeze less than two days after it caused chaos and stoked fear that the directive could adversely affect millions of Americans.",
      "A White House memo ordering a broad freeze on federal grants and loans by 5 p.m. Tuesday left ordinary Americans who depend on such aid, as well as seasoned budget experts, scratching their heads.",
      "The memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) suspending the federal funding was vague in its wording, causing confusion within federal assistance programs, at nonprofits and among Americans receiving government aid. Adding to the whiplash, a federal judge on Tuesday\u00a0temporarily blocked the freeze, and the Trump administration walked back the memo on Wednesday.",
      "\"In light of the injunction, OMB has rescinded the memo to end any confusion on federal policy created by the court ruling and the dishonest media coverage,\" said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday. \"The executive orders issued by the president on funding reviews remain in full force and effect and will be rigorously implemented by all agencies and departments. This action should effectively end the court case and allow the government to focus on enforcing the president's orders on controlling federal spending.\"",

      "Trump administration rescinds federal funding freeze memo after chaos",
      "Before OMB abruptly reversed course, experts had questioned the policy, saying it was poorly thought out and implemented.",
      "\"If this was being undertaken pursuant to the executive orders on [diversity, equity and inclusion], why would the administration issue such broad, unclear and confusing directions?\" Tad DeHaven, a policy analyst focusing on economic and fiscal policy issues at the libertarian Cato Institute, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I don't really understand it, and I think even people who are in positions of power don't really understand it,\" added Wendy Edelberg, director of The Hamilton Project at Brookings, a liberal-leaning public policy research group.",
      "What programs aren't affected by the funding freeze?",
      "The memo, from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), indicated that Social Security and Medicare programs would be exempt from the suspension in federal funding. Additional guidance released Tuesday further specified that \"any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause.\"",
      "\"In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause,\" the updated guidance said.",
      "The memo adds that funds for small businesses, farmers, Pell grants, Head Start, rental assistance and other similar programs are also exempt.",
      "But even if the order ends up being more narrowly tailored, it could still have serious financial implications for the millions of Americans who receive federal assistance, experts said.",
      "\"If it's resolved quickly, the aggregate economic effects for the first quarter will be modest, but it will matter a whole lot to people on the other side of these expected payments,\" Edelberg said. \"It could be the difference between having a job and not, getting evicted or affording food \u2014 and the economic numbers won't fully reflect how individuals are going to feel this.\"",
      "Here's what to know about who may be affected by the proposed pause in federal funding.",
      "Will I still get SNAP benefits?",
      "The freeze does not apply to all federal financial assistance, according to an Office of Management and Budget memo on Tuesday. The agency indicates that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, better known as food stamps, are excluded, specifying that \"... any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause and exempted from this review process.\"",
      "\"In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause,\" the memo reads.",
      "SNAP serves roughly 41 million low-income Americans.",
      "Yet while the program appears to be exempt from the freeze, \"You are still going to be really worried in the near term whether the federal government is going to make good on those promises,\" Edelberg said. \"And that kind of uncertainty is not good for the economy.\"",
      "Are meals for seniors affected?",
      "The Older Americans Act Nutrition Program, a federal initiative that supports community-based senior nutrition programs like Meals on Wheels, could be affected by the proposed funding pause.",
      "If the order includes the Older Americans Act, it \"would halt service to millions of vulnerable seniors who have no other means of purchasing or preparing meals,\" Meals on Wheels said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lack of clarity is creating chaos for Meals on Wheels providers not knowing whether they should be serving meals today.\"",
      "Is housing assistance at risk?",
      "The OMB memo added that rental assistance and other similar programs will not be paused. Still, the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) expressed concern that Department of Housing and Urban Development programs could be covered by the freeze.",
      "\"Even a short pause in funding could cause significant harm to low-income families and their communities,\" NLIHC Interim President and CEO Renee Willis said in a\u00a0statement. \"The longer the freeze continues, the greater the risk that low-income households receiving federal rental assistance could face eviction, and in the worst cases, homelessness \u2014 homeless shelters may be forced to close their doors, and nonprofit organizations may have to lay off staff.\"",
      "Are student loans affected?",
      "The federal funding freeze does not apply to student loans and Pell grants, according to the Department of Education. The funding pause \"only applies to discretionary grants at the Department of Education,\" DOE spokesperson Madi Biedermann said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Still, an advocate for students with government loans said they are worried about the impact of the freeze.",
      "\"Any kind of freeze to federal financial aid across the board is incredibly harmful to working families just trying to pay for college,\" Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at Student Borrower Protection Center, told CBS MoneyWatch, adding that \"Lots of questions remain about what the freeze applies to and what programs it does not,\"",
      "Meanwhile, many student borrowers rely on different kinds of government assistance to cover costs beyond tuition, Ba\u00f1ez noted.",
      "\"There are other types of federal work-study grants that go directly to colleges and universities, and supplemental education opportunities that go to some of the lowest-income students. People really rely on federal financial aid, and you could see families having to drop out of college or figure out how they will cover this gap,\" she said.",
      "The OMB memo also indicated that Head Start, a preschool program serving nearly 800,000 low-income children that receives federal health funds, is not impacted by the pause.",
      "But the National Head Start Association (NHSA) said that the OMB memo has already \"created panic among Head Start grant recipients who are currently not able to draw down any funds.\"",
      "\"While we understand that this is an evolving story, this disruption, at best, will slow down Head Start agencies' ability to pay hundreds of thousands of staff, contractors, and small businesses who support Head Start operations in every corner of the country,\" NHSA Executive Director Yasmina Vinci said in a statement. \"At worst, this means that hundreds of thousands of families will not be able to depend on the critical services and likely will not be able to work.\"",
      "Medicaid systems go down",
      "Despite the updated guidance issued Tuesday stating that programs including Medicaid were excluded from the funding pause, state Medicaid programs on Tuesday\u00a0said they were locked out\u00a0of the Department of Health and Human Services system used to track and disburse money.",
      "The White House late Tuesday pointed to an \"outage\" for blocking a range of organizations and agencies from accessing the online systems responsible for tapping federal health dollars.",

This year, new year hopes for prosperity are of even greater importance, as China braces itself for Trump 2.0.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 12:17:52 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has said he will \"demand\" lower interest rates, raising questions about his ability to influence the Federal Reserve.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump had a message last week for the Federal Reserve while at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland: He plans to \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\"",
      "Mr. Trump may be in for disappointment. The Federal Reserve widely expected to keep its benchmark rate steady when it announces its latest interest rate decision today at 2 p.m. Eastern Time. Economists aren't penciling in a 2025 reduction until at least May, according to economists polled by financial data service FactSet.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has over the years steadfastly defended the central bank's independence. Most recently, he underlined at a New York Times event in December that insulating the Fed from political influence is \"for the benefit of all Americans,\" allowing it to make decisions based on economic data rather than at the behest of elected officials. The Fed's independence allows it to pursue its dual mandate \u2014 to keep inflation low and the labor market at full employment \u2014 without political pressure, economists concur.",
      "\"We know monetary policy needs to be enacted with a democratic mandate underpinning it, with a day-to-day remove from politics,\" Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Interest rates may need to be raised but it may be inconvenient for political interests, and [the central bank] may need to move quickly to lower rates\" in case of an economic downturn.",
      "While the Fed is an independent agency, it is accountable to Congress and the public, with its chair and other officials testifying before Congress regularly. Its dual mandate was also established by Congress, as well as its structure of staggered appointments for Fed officials, designed to make the agency less vulnerable to pressures \"that could lead to undesirable outcomes,\" according to the Fed.",
      "What happens when a central bank isn't independent?",
      "Those \"undesirable outcomes\" can be seen in nations where central bankers are more vulnerable to political influence, economists say.",
      "That's because interest rates remain the most potent weapon that a central bank can wield against surging inflation \u2014 a tool that the Federal Reserve turned to in 2022 to tame the hottest U.S. inflation in 40 years. But elected officials sometimes decide that higher borrowing costs are politically inconvenient, because they make it more expensive for businesses to expand or for consumers to make purchases.",
      "In cases where a central bank isn't independent, officials may succeed in pressuring a central bank to keep a lid on rates.",
      "Experts point to Turkey as an example of what can occur when political interests dictate a central bank's monetary policies. Since 2010, its central bank has increasingly come under pressure from President Erdo\u011fan to keep its interest rates low, even as inflation surged during the pandemic, according to the non-partisan Centre for Economic Policy Research.",
      "Instead of hiking rates as Turkey's inflation rate topped 80% in October 2022 on an annual basis, the nation's central bank cut its benchmark rate several times in 2022 and 2023. While the bank reversed course and hiked rates starting in mid-2023, inflation there has proved tough to tame, with prices rising by 44% in December 2024.",
      "By comparison, the highest U.S. inflation rate during the post-pandemic period was in June 2022, when inflation hit 9.1% on an annual basis in June 2022. In the face of the Fed's rate hikes, inflation has cooled since then, deflating to 2.9% on an annual basis last month.",
      "\"The Fed has done really well \u2014 they have raised the rates enough to try to slowly squeeze inflation out of the market,\" noted Erasmus Kersting, a professor of economics at Villanova University. The Fed has \"done all that while avoiding a recession \u2014 that is a delicate needle to thread.\"",
      "Could Mr. Trump influence the Fed?",
      "Questions about Mr. Trump's ability to influence the Federal Reserve or shake up its leadership are intensifying amid the president's statements about his desire for lower interest rates. During his 2024 election campaign, Mr. Trump had insisted that as president he should have a \"say\" in the Fed's interest rate policies.",
      "\"I think that, in my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman,\" Mr. Trump said in August.",
      "For his part, Powell said last year that he would not resign\u00a0even if asked to do so by Mr. Trump, adding that under the law presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "However, Mr. Trump has recently fired several government officials in ways that critics say violate the law, such as his administration's firing of more than a dozen federal inspectors general on Friday. Federal law requires the White House to give Congress a full month of warning and case-specific details before firing a federal inspector general.",
      "Removing Powell wouldn't necessarily change the Fed's monetary policy decisions, given that rates are set by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Seven members are from the Fed's Board of Governors; four are assigned from the 11 Reserve Bank presidents, who each serve one-year terms on a rotating basis; and one FOMC member is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Interfering with the Fed could have consequences, both legally and for the stock market, experts said.",
      "\"Should any president attempt to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve without cause other than doing the job they were appointed and confirmed to do, I expect there to be swift legal challenges,\" noted Tim Stretton at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government watchdog. \"I suspect the market would also react negatively. Markets like stability, and this level of unprecedented interference in the Federal Reserve would be anything but stable.\"",
      "Asked what advice he would give Mr. Trump about dealing with the Fed, Columbia Business School's House said, \"Stop talking.\"",
      "He added, \"Let the Fed conduct its business consistent with its mandate, and it'll be more likely to get interest rates down.\"",

    "story": [
      "As Chinese AI application DeepSeek attracts hordes of American users, Trump administration officials, lawmakers and cybersecurity experts are expressing concern that the technology could pose a threat to U.S. national security.",
      "DeepSeek's introduction in the U.S. on Monday saw it quickly become the most downloaded free application in the country on Apple's app store. The rollout also rocked Wall Street as investors struggled to compute the sudden appearance of a low-cost, open-source generative AI tool able to compete with leading artificial intelligence apps such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Shares of Nvidia, the U.S. manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, plummeted 17%, chopping roughly $600 billion off its market value \u2014 a record single-day drop for a U.S. stock.",
      "That explosive debut was branded a \"wake-up call\" by President Trump on Monday. Addressing reporters on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the National Security Council (NSC) would examine the potential national security implications around DeepSeek's launch, noting that the administration would seek to \"ensure American AI dominance.\"",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "Some lawmakers also weighed in with concerns about the application's access to U.S. users.",
      "\"The U.S. cannot allow Chinese Communist Party models such as DeepSeek to risk our national security and leverage our technology to advance their AI ambitions,\" Rep. John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said Tuesday in a statement shared on social media. \"We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek's AI infrastructure.\"",
      "The spotlight on DeepSeek comes amid rising tensions over trade, technology and other issues between the two superpowers. The U.S. has already imposed significant export controls on China in an effort to rein in Beijing's production of semiconductors used in developing advanced AI, with the most recent curbs coming in\u00a0December.",
      "\"At the President's direction, the NSC and others in the U.S. government work in many ways to address concerns involving AI, China and data security,\" agency spokesperson Brian Hughes told CBS News in an email. \"As the President has underscored, U.S. policy is to ensure that the United States leads the world in AI.\"",
      "Security threat for users",
      "While the calls from Moolenaar could be the first inkling of a possible congressional crackdown, Ross Burley \u2014 a co-founder of the nonprofit Centre for Information Resilience \u2014 warned that DeepSeek's emergence in the U.S. raises data security and privacy issues for users. Chinese law grants Beijing broad authority to access data from companies based in China.",
      "\"More and more people will use it, and that will open the door to more and more personal data just being given away to the [Chinese Communist Party] and being sent basically to mainland China to be able to inform them of their activities,\" Burley told CBS News.",
      "\"What they'll use it for is behavior change campaigns, disinformation campaigns, for really targeted messaging as to what Western audiences like, what they do,\" he added.",
      "DeepSeek, which is based in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, notes in its privacy policy that the personal information it collects from users is held \"on secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Under that\u00a0policy, the company says it collects information including users' \"device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, and system language.\" DeepSeek also collects \"service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs,\" according to the company.",
      "A key difference from TikTok",
      "The fact that DeepSeek's servers are based in mainland China differentiates it from TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform that Congress had sought to ban on national security grounds before President Trump signed an executive order last week directing the Justice Department to not enforce the law for a period of 75 days.",
      "In an effort to mitigate U.S. regulatory concerns, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in 2022 moved all of its U.S. data to infrastructure owned by American software maker Oracle.",
      "The legislation banning TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April \u2014 grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on tech platforms owned by countries regarded as U.S. adversaries.",
      "Under that law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content; has more than 1 million monthly active users; is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country; and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "But DeepSeek may be seen as less of a threat given that, unlike TikTok, it is an open-source large language model, according to Matt Sheehan, a China fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\"[A] lot of these open-source apps, open-source models, you can actually sort of use them directly on other platforms. Perplexity is a major U.S. AI company, and they're currently using a version of DeepSeek that you can use that doesn't have the data privacy or security threats,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Advancing censorship?",
      "One issue that DeepSeek users face outside of China: censorship. For example, a CBS News analysis of the application found that DeepSeek did not return any results for a prompt seeking information bout the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre in Beijing.",
      "Burley of the Centre for Information Resilience thinks such suppression of information on an app being downloaded by millions of users will pressure policymakers to act.",
      "\"I think it's incumbent on Western governments \u2014 the U.K., Canada, the U.S. \u2014 to look and see if it is wise for the Apple store and the Android store to host this large language model when it is so clearly being curated to push Chinese narratives and censorship,\" he said.",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 17:19:32 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has painted a bullseye on diversity, equity and inclusion. But what exactly is DEI, and what has it achieved?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the U.S. government is renewing debate over what DEI is and whether it has benefited workers and companies.",
      "DEI has its roots in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which barred employment discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion and other criteria. In the following decades, a range of policies have sought to root out bias in hiring, promote fairness in the workplace and open career pathways for people of color and for women, while also expanding to include sexual orientation and gender identity.",
      "This push gained momentum after the 2020 murder of George Floyd, as politicians and social activists pressed companies to do their part in confronting systemic racism. But Mr. Trump's Jan. 20\u00a0order, issued on his first day back in office, criticized DEI as \"illegal and immoral,\" while the following day a memo from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management called for all federal DEI employees to be placed on leave.",
      "What is DEI in the workplace?",
      "DEI is often misperceived as focusing only on race, according to DEI experts. But such initiatives comprise many practices that aim to uplift different marginalized groups in the workplace. For example, a policy that accommodates working parents, such as flexible work hours, could qualify as DEI. So could establishing affinity groups based on shared identities, like sexual orientation.",
      "Many critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. Other opponents of the policies go further, arguing that DEI itself promotes racism.",
      "But DEI defenders say that policies that seek to foster diversity and inclusion within organizations aren't in conflict with those that seek to reward the most talented or hardest-working employees.",
      "\"DEI enhances merit by saying, 'How do we find the best people for the job or make sure we are promoting the best people?'\" David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NYU School of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And that means thinking about barriers and biases that might be getting in the way of considering the full talent pool.\"",
      "In defining DEI, Glasgow described \"diversity\" as a commitment to diversifying personnel within an institution so that U.S. workplaces better represent the population at large. \"It's about engaging in effective outreach to places that might be overlooked and making sure hiring and promotion systems aren't screening out women or people of color from being considered,\" he said.",
      "Meanwhile, when designed and implemented effectively, DEI programs are not discriminatory, according to Jessica Fulton, vice president of Policy at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonprofit that aims to improve African-Americans' socioeconomic status.",
      "\"These policies don't actually dictate who gets hired. They are ways to open doors to people who might not have access or aren't as well-connected in an industry or occupation,\" she explained.",
      "The equity piece of DEI seeks to level the playing field for groups of workers who have historically been underrepresented in a given field or who, compared with their white or male peers, are underpaid for doing the same work.",
      "\"It could mean making sure women are able to enter traditionally male-dominated occupations, like construction or technology,\" Fulton said. \"It's about addressing issues around equal pay for equal work, making sure people feel safe in the workplace so they don't feel discrimination when they come to work, because workers who don't feel safe are not the most productive.\"",
      "Corporations also commonly aim to develop inclusion policies that help people from diverse backgrounds feel safe within a given workplace and its culture, she explained. They are intended to be, and often are, inclusive of everyone and not just members of marginalized communities, according to Fulton.",
      "\"It is also making sure they can put certain policies in place to make sure their workers stick around and keep working. It is about building a great team and being able to treat that team well and retain the folks they hire,\" Fulton said.",
      "Given the recent backlash against DEI, though, a number of corporations are moving away from such inclusion policies, noting that they could pose a legal risk. That's after many major U.S. employers already ditched their DEI programs in response to pressure from anti-diversity activists. Among them are Ford,\u00a0Harley Davidson,\u00a0McDonald's, Meta and more.",
      "How is success measured?",
      "Many corporate executives have soured on DEI in recent years because of the perception that such policies don't enhance a company's performance, said Daniel Snell, co-founder of Arrival, a UK-based consulting firm focused on corporate leadership and culture. Other leaders, while recognizing the value of promoting diversity and inclusion, argue that DEI is inadequate for redressing what are at bottom much broader socioeconomic issues.",
      "Glasgow of NYU Law concedes that it can be hard to determine if DEI programs are succeeding or otherwise clearly assess their outcomes. \"It's difficult to measure certain DEI interventions, like the effectiveness of implicit bias training in the workplace,\" he said. \"It also depends on what you are trying to achieve.\"",
      "One tool employers use to try to gauge the efficacy of DEI policies are internal surveys that ask workers whether they feel like they can be themselves in the office, believe they are respected by their peers, and feel that their opinions matter. When it comes to a company's mentorship and promotion policies, employers will also monitor if members of a particular group of workers, such as veterans and Black employees, are quitting shortly after being hired \u2014 patterns that can yield insights into a workplace's equity and inclusiveness.",
      "By contrast, if over time more women or people of color ascend to leadership positions, that could be viewed as a company achieving its goal of building a workplace that's more representative of its job applicant pool.",
      "Corporate DEI programs aren't altruistic, experts emphasize, pointing to at least some empirical evidence showing that such efforts can help companies adapt to change, support innovation and even boost the bottom line.",
      "\"The point of diversity and inclusion is that companies, the government, universities, all do better when there are diverse participants in management and throughout the enterprise,\" said Michael Posner, director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. \"The objective of this is not to set quotas or say we are going to take unqualified people because they fit a certain characteristic, like gender or race, but to create opportunity and try to overcome historic barriers to entry.\"",
      "In one noted study, McKinsey found that companies in the top quartile for the gender diversity of their boards of director are 27% more likely to outperform financially than those in the bottom quartile. In separate research, the consulting firm in 2024 found that women's representation at work over the past decade has increased at every level of corporate management \u2014 women today make up 29% of C-suite level positions, up from 17% in 2015.",
      "\"[A] lot of the language and framing right now of DEI as illegal and discriminatory obscures who it's really for, which is all of us, and to the benefit of companies,\" Fulton told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "On Monday, DeepSeek's rollout roiled shares of AI stalwarts such as Nvidia, the high-flying manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, and Dutch company ASML, another chipmaker. The Chinese company's tech is raising questions about whether demand for Nvidia's chips could take a hit, as well as whether investors are overvaluing tech stocks that have been buoyed by the promise of AI, from Meta to Microsoft, experts said.",
      "\"DeepSeek has taken the market by storm by doing more with less,\" said Giuseppe Sette, president at AI market research firm Reflexivity, in an email. \"This shows that with AI the surprises will keep on coming in the next few years.\"",
      "DeepSeek's latest app comes just days after President Trump announced a new $500 billion venture\u00a0with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, dubbed Stargate, which he touted as ensuring \"the future of technology\" in the U.S.",
      "AI-related stocks took a hit on Monday, with Nvidia shares tumbling 17%, shedding $600 billion in value and marking the single-biggest one-day loss for a company in stock market history, according\u00a0to CNBC. ASML sank 6%, while Broadcom, another semiconductor stock, also slumped 17%.",
      "Some energy-related stocks also plunged on Monday on investor worries that the new tech could require less energy to run, translating into lower demand from the tech sector. GE Vernova, which makes wind and gas turbines, plunged 21%, while electricity generator Vistra slumped 28%.",
      "The tech-heavy Nasdaq index slumped 3%, or 612 points, while the S&P 500 declined 1.5%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7%.",
      "Despite the sharp drop on the Nasdaq, it's far from the worst day for the index during the past five years. The worst one-day decline since Jan. 27, 2020, came on March 16, 2020, when the index plunged more than 12% as COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy.",
      "What is DeepSeek?",
      "DeepSeek is a private Chinese company founded in July 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a graduate of Zhejiang University, one of China's top universities, who funded the startup via his hedge fund,\u00a0according to the MIT Technology Review. Liang has about $8 billion in assets, Ives wrote in a Jan. 27 research note.",
      "Liang, who had previously focused on applying AI to investing, had bought a \"stockpile of Nvidia A100 chips,\" a type of tech that is now banned from export to China. Those chips became the basis of DeepSeek, the MIT publication reported.",
      "Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius, told investors in a note that DeepSeek makes legitimate breakthroughs as an AI tool, including better learning and more efficient use of memory, although he expressed skepticism about the \"amount of chips used.\"",
      "Is DeepSeek available in the U.S.?",
      "The company's AI app is available in Apple's App store, as well as online at its website. The service is free and as of Monday morning was the top download on Apple's store, although some people were having trouble signing up for the app.",
      "On its Chinese site, DeepSeek blamed \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its service, requiring it to temporarily limit new registrations. \"Existing users can log in as usual,\" the company said in the post, which was dated shortly after midnight Jan. 28 in China's local time.",
      "The company released its latest AI model on Jan. 20, which is causing Wall Street to reappraise the AI sector.",
      "\"Last week DeepSeek launched a model that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta's Llama 3.1 and was #1 on Apple's App Store over the weekend,\" Wedbush's Ives wrote. \"DeepSeek built the model using reduced capability chips from Nvidia. which is impressive and thus has caused major agita for U.S. tech stocks with massive pressure on Nasdaq this morning.\"",
      "How is DeepSeek different than other AI apps?",
      "DeepSeek is an open-source large language model that relies on what is known as \"inference-time computing,\" which Sette said in layman's terms means \"they activate only the most relevant portions of their model for each query, and that saves money and computation power.\"",
      "Some experts praised DeepSeek's performance, with noted tech investor Marc Andreessen writing\u00a0on X on Jan. 24, \"DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen \u2014 and as open source, a profound gift to the world.\"",
      "David Sacks, a venture capitalist named by Mr. Trump to help oversee AI and cryptocurrency policy, said on social media Monday that DeepSee's app \"shows that the AI race will be very competitive.\"",
      "However, Ives said he's skeptical the service will gain ground with major U.S. businesses.",
      "\"No U.S. Global 2000 is going to use a Chinese startup DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases,\" Ives wrote. \"At the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia.\"",
      "Are there privacy issues with DeepSeek?",
      "Some experts are raising concerns about the personal data that DeepSeek is collecting, given that the company stores data from users \u2014 including their date of birth, keystrokes, text or audio inputs, uploaded files, chat history and other data \u2014 on servers located in China, according to its privacy policy.",
      "That echoes some of the issues raised with TikTok, another company with Chinese ownership that sparked worries about the supposed risks its ties to China posed to national security. Last year, Congress passed a law\u00a0banning\u00a0 TikTok in the U.S. as long as it is under Chinese ownership, although that is now in flux after President Trump signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0directing the Justice Department to not enforce the ban for 75 days.",
      "What does DeepSeek mean for Nvidia and other tech companies?",
      "Wall Street is trying to assess the long-term impact of a low-cost AI tool from China that rivals ChatGPT and other so-called generative AI apps. It also raises questions about whether Silicon Valley is overspending on tech advancements in the AI sector, noted Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, in an email.",
      "\"The fact that this technology is supposed to take less energy and is more cost-effective than U.S.-based models has U.S. technology investors very concerned,\" Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, said.",
      "It's also unclear what type of pushback or reaction could come from the White House, given that Mr. Trump has raised the possibility of placing new tariffs on Chinese imports, although he also gave the Chinese-owned TikTok a reprieve by ordering the Justice Department not to enforce a looming ban.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts think Monday's stock selloff is an overreaction, noting that the enormous demand for AI will continue lifting key players in the sector.",
      "\"It's one thing to train a [large language] model for less money, but accommodating the huge demand for the consumption of all this AI technology is still going to require massive amounts of infrastructure,\" Adam Crisafulli of VitalKnowledge said in a report.",
      "Analysts at Bernstein Research also noted that while DeepSeek's technology looks promising, it likely isn't revolutionary, suggesting that Monday's investment rout is overblown.",
      "What is Nvidia saying about DeepSeek?",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Nvidia offered praise for DeepSeek.",
      "\"DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of test-time scaling,\" the company said in an email. \"DeepSeek's work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export-control compliant.\"",
      "But, Nvidia added, AI inference, or using AI models to make decisions or predictions, \"requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.\"",

      "Workers at a Whole Foods Market in Pennsylvania voted to unionize on Monday, becoming the first group of employees to pull off a labor win at the Amazon-owned grocery store chain.",
      "Employees at the Philadelphia store at 21st Street and Pennsylvania Avenue cast 130 votes \u2014 or about 57% of the ballots cast \u2014 in favor of joining a local chapter of The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union for the purposes of collective bargaining. According to the National Labor Relations Board, which oversaw the election, 100 workers rejected the motion.",
      "\"This fight is far from over, but today's victory is an important step forward,\" said Wendell Young IV, the president of UFCW Local 1776. \"We are ready to bring Whole Foods to the bargaining table to negotiate a fair first contract that reflects the workers' needs and priorities.\"",
      "The results mark the first successful entry of organized labor into Amazon's grocery business, which includes Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh and the Amazon Go convenience stores. Amazon, which purchased Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion, has tried to fend off organizing efforts in its stores as well as by delivery drivers and warehouse workers.",
      "Nearly three years ago, Amazon warehouse workers in the New York City borough of Staten Island voted to be represented in labor negotiations by a fledgling union that has since affiliated with the Teamsters. But Amazon has refused to come to the bargaining table.",
      "Employees at the Whole Foods store, located in the center of Philadelphia, started organizing early last year, Young said. They teamed up with UFCW Local 1776 in the late summer, and in November petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to hold an official election.",
      "The local union said the store workers hoped a successful vote would help them secure higher wages, more affordable health care coverage, child care support, greater work-life balance and better working conditions.",
      "In a statement after the votes were counted Monday night, Whole Foods said it \"is proud to offer competitive compensation, great benefits, and career advancement opportunities to all Team Members.\"",
      "\"We are disappointed by the outcome of this election, but we are committed to maintaining a positive working environment in our Philly Center City store,\" the company added.",
      "The company said it provides store employees with a competitive average hourly wage and other benefits, such as 401(k) plans and \"on-demand\" mental health support. It did not disclose its average hourly rate, but some online job postings show store employees can earn $16 per hour or higher.",
      "After the union filed the election petition, workers at the Philadelphia store were given free snacks, and the company repainted their break rooms, according to Young.",
      "Earlier this month, UFCW Local 1776 filed unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB against the company, accusing it of firing one worker in retaliation for union activities and alleging that supervisors told employees they would get paid more if they rejected the union bid. Whole Foods disputed the worker was fired in retaliation.",
      "The union has also accused Whole Foods of withholding region-wide wage increases from employees at the Philadelphia store because of the union activities.",
      "The company acknowledges it did not offer wage increases to workers at the store, even though it did so at a number of other stores as part of a quarterly review. Whole Foods maintains it would have been illegal to make wage adjustments in the lead-up to the union election, an argument Young disputed.",
      "The company said it was delaying the pay bumps until after the election to avoid the appearance of trying to influence the vote with raises.",
      "Seattle-based Amazon has resisted union organizing efforts by its workers. Amazon delivery drivers went on strike in a handful of U.S. cities before Christmas to exert pressure on the the company to recognize them as unionized employees or to meet demands for an inaugural labor contract.",

      "The proposal, submitted last week, is a revision of a prior plan the artificial intelligence startup had presented to TikTok's parent ByteDance on Jan. 18, a day before the law that bans TikTok went into effect.",
      "The first proposal, which ByteDance hasn't responded to, sought to create a new structure that would merge San Francisco-based Perplexity with TikTok's U.S. business and include investments from other investors.",
      "The new proposal would allow the U.S. government to own up to half of that new structure once it makes an initial public offering of at least $300 billion, said the person, who was not authorized to speak about the proposal. The person said Perplexity's proposal was revised based off of feedback from the Trump administration.",

      "ByteDance and TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Under the plan, ByteDance would not have to completely cut ties with TikTok, a favorable outcome for its investors. But it would have to allow a \"full U.S. board control,\" the person said.",
      "Under the proposal, the China-based tech company would contribute TikTok's U.S. business without the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app, according to a document seen by the Associated Press.",
      "The proposal seems to mirror a strategy Steven Mnuchin, treasury secretary during President Donald Trump's first term, discussed Sunday on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures \u2014 that a new investor in TikTok could simply \"dilute down\" the Chinese ownership and satisfy the law. Mnuchin has previously expressed interest in investing in the company.",
      "\"But the technology needs to be disconnected from China,\" he added. \"It needs to be disconnected from ByteDance. There's absolutely no way that China would ever let us have something like that in China.\"",

      "Under a bipartisan law passed last year, TikTok was to be banned in the United States by Jan. 19 if it did not cut ties with ByteDance. The Supreme Court upheld the law, but Mr. Trump then issued an executive order to halt enforcement of the law for 75 days.",
      "Mr. Trump, on Air Force One, noted that Ellison lives \"right down the road\" from his Mar-a-Lago estate, but added, \"I never spoke to Larry about TikTok. I've spoken to many people about TikTok and there's great interest in TikTok.\"",
      "TikTok briefly shut down in the U.S. a week ago, but went back online after Mr. Trump said he would postpone the ban. Mr. Trump had unsuccessfully attempted a U.S. ban of the platform during his first term. But he has since reversed his position and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters during last year's presidential election.",
      "TikTok CEO Shou Chew attended Mr. Trump's inauguration Jan. 20, along with some other tech leaders who've been forging friendlier ties with the new administration.",
      "Congress voted to ban TikTok in the U.S. out of concern that TikTok's ownership structure represented a security risk. The Biden administration argued in court for months that it was too much of a risk to allow a Chinese company to control the algorithm that fuels what people see on the app. Officials also raised concerns about user data collected on the platform.",
      "However, to date, the U.S. hasn't provided public evidence of TikTok handing user data to Chinese authorities or allowing them to tinker with its algorithm.",

    "summary": "This data point is one of several key mysteries investigators are exploring as they seek to explain what caused the nation's worst air disaster in more than a decade, aviation experts said.",
    "story": [
      "The military Black Hawk helicopter that crashed into a passenger plane near Reagan National Airport Wednesday appears to have been flying above the permitted altitude, publicly available flight data analyzed by CBS News shows.",
      "This data point is one of several key mysteries investigators are exploring as they seek to explain what caused the nation's worst air disaster in more than a decade, aviation experts said.",
      "\"That's the $64 million question that needs to be answered,\" said Greg Feith, a former senior air safety investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board, in an interview with CBS News.",
      "The permitted flight ceiling on the Potomac River near Reagan National Airport is 200 feet \u2013 a crucial ceiling for keeping the heavy flow of military helicopters safely clear of the steady commercial aircraft traffic into and out of the nation's capital.",
      "Data from FlightRadar24, which tracks and records aircraft data for most flights across the U.S., showed the helicopter's last estimated altitude was about 400 feet when it crashed. The jet's altitude was about 375 to 400 feet, according to data from FlightAware and FlightRadar24.",
      "\"They're military pilots; they're familiar with the routes,\" Feith said. \"Why is it on this day, on that flight, they were [as much as] 150 to 200 feet higher than they knew they should be?\"",
      "Steven B. Wallace, a former director of accident investigations for the Federal Aviation Administration, told CBS News he believes investigators will direct attention to the altitude of the Black Hawk.",
      "\"I don't want to speculate on the cause, but I can speculate what's going through the mind of the investigators,\" Wallace said. \"I think that is very likely going to be the focus.\"",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said the investigation is examining if the aircraft was at the right altitude at the time. NTSB investigators have not so far disclosed the helicopter's altitude in their briefings, and said their working groups will evaluate \"pre-impact course and altitude.\"",
      "The Army helicopter's deviation above the flight ceiling is one of several similar near collisions involving helicopters at Reagan National that date back more than a decade.",
      "A near midair collision between an airplane and a helicopter in July 2015 occurred 400 feet off the ground on approach to the same runway being used in Wednesday's crash \u2013 Runway 33 \u2014 according to a CBS News Data Team review of anonymous reports to NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System.",
      "The pilot's report said the aircraft \"came within very close contact of another aircraft.\"",
      "\"This occurred about 400 feet off the ground to the point where the pilot monitoring had to take the controls to make a correction in order to prevent it from becoming a midair collision,\" the 2015 report said.",
      "Two years earlier, in May of 2013, a pilot reported problems with a helicopter while circling to land on Runway 33. That is a shorter runway intended for smaller aircraft, like American Airlines 5342. Pilots who land there told CBS News they want to be at the \"floor,\" or lowest altitude during their approach because they need to hit the beginning of the runway to have maximum distance to stop.",
      "\"As we continued our approach; Tower instructed the helicopter to 'make a right 360 for a jet on a 2 mile final for Runway 33; and to report him in sight,\" the pilot wrote.",
      "\"The Tower then asked the helicopter if he had us in sight. He replied 'yes'; and the Tower told him to maintain visual separation,\" the report said. \"As we began our turn from base to final; the helicopter made what looked like a right turn directly into our flight path.\"",
      "The pilot reported having to execute a hard right turn and abort the approach to avoid a collision. \"I'm not sure how close we came to the helicopter since it was on the left side of the aircraft; but I would guess it was only a few hundred feet,\" the report said.",
      "CBS News' review of the NASA safety data identified at least nine near midair collisions at the airport since 2005, including three involving helicopters.",
      "Feith said he believes investigators from the NTSB and the military will be examining the altimeters in the helicopter to see if they malfunctioned, checking for any wind impact that could have hindered the pilot's ability to hold the helicopter at 200 feet, and exploring whether or not the crew should have been using night vision goggles.",
      "He said the flight recorders on both aircraft will be helpful in determining what happened. Authorities reported that they had been recovered from the Potomac River on Thursday.",
      "\"If they had been at 200 feet, there wouldn't have been an issue because the plane typically would've been 400 to 500 feet off the ground,\" Feith said. \"Those two RJ [regional jet] pilots didn't know what hit them until the helicopter hit them.\"",

    "story": [
      "Sen. Tammy Duckworth is calling for patience as the NTSB and FAA investigate the cause of the tragic collision of a Black Hawk helicopter and American Airlines flight Wednesday night, but she is also pursuing information about how it occurred.",
      "She told CBS News' Nikole Killion in an interview Thursday that she's requested a transcript of the air traffic control instructions and responses from the pilots.",
      "\"What I did learn was that air traffic control did contact and speak with the helicopter crew twice, and they acknowledged the instructions twice,\" Duckworth said. \"I also am asking for the flight path of both aircraft up until the moment of the impact.\"",
      "The Illinois Democrat will have more insight than many of her colleagues \u2014 she is an Iraq\u00a0War veteran and was a Black Hawk pilot before an RPG downed her helicopter during an Iraq deployment in 2004, costing Duckworth both of her legs and partial use of her right arm.",
      "Duckworth says she's certain that the soldiers who were piloting the Black Hawk Wednesday night were well trained because otherwise, \"they wouldn't be out there in this special airspace \u2014 the airspace around Washington, D.C.\" She noted that they were in the SFRA \u2014the Washington, D.C., metropolitan Special Flight Restricted Area. It's a circular 30-nautical-mile area around Washington, D.C., which also surrounds the Flight-Restricted Zone, a smaller area encompassing Reagan National Airport.\"",
      "\"You don't get to fly in that without additional flight training,\" Duckworth said.",
      "The Illinois Democrat described what the crew would have been doing in the cockpit as the Black Hawk flew Wednesday night.",
      "\"The crew members would have split up the crew duties. One person would have been flying \u2014 actually, physically flying the aircraft, which takes, you know, all of your four limbs to do it,\" she told Killion. \"You're controlling the direction of the aircraft with your right hand, the power that's going into the engines with your left hand, you're controlling the nose and the tail of the aircraft, with your two feet.\" This pilot would have been trying to \"stick to the route,\" while the other pilot would be talking with air traffic control.",
      "\"Everybody's looking outside the aircraft to try to find that other aircraft that you are near,\" Duckworth said. \"The crew chief in the back is also doing the same thing. They're looking out of the aircraft as well, spotting any traffic that's nearby, conveying that information. So, the crew would be talking to each other while also listening to the air traffic controller.\"",
      "At the same time, the crew would also be \"listening to the air traffic controller talking to other aircraft, so that you have situational awareness of everything else that's going on,\" she said.",
      "The helicopter would have had a ceiling, what Duckworth referred to as a \"hard deck\" in the restricted area where the Black Hawk was flying.",
      "\"They're not allowed to go above 200 feet mean sea level,\" she said. \"So, they were flying pretty low above the Potomac River at the time, while looking up trying to spot out of this very busy night sky the landing airplane.\"",
      "Killion asked whether this was the kind of flight that would require night-vision goggles, or NVGs.",
      "\"My understanding is that they were not using NVGs,\" Duckworth replied. She said that in an area where there are a lot of lights, they're \"not as useful a tool,\" and are really more suited to \"a combat situation in the dark.\" Around the airport, \"with that much ambient light, they were on visual flight rules, and they were operating well within the parameters for which they have been trained, and the aircraft was designed to operate in,\" Duckworth said.",
      "She said the helicopter would have had its lights on, so the plane would have been able to see it. But airplanes that are coming in for a landing have the right of way.",
      "\"They would have been looking towards the runway and landing on the runway,\" she said. \"That's the job of the crew within the American Airlines Flight \u2026 they were on a short final to land.\"",
      "\"I'm sure they would have been looking out, but they don't have the same visibility in that aircraft \u2014 looking out those two little windows that they have \u2014 as the helicopter would have had, with plexiglass.\" She explained that the helicopter crew \"would have been basically sitting in a plexiglass bubble in the Black Hawk with plexiglass above your head, underneath your feet and out the two sides.\"",
      "\"So the helicopter \u2014 they would have had a better visual command than the American Airlines Flight, which was landing, looking to the runway,\" Duckworth said.",
      "Asked about Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's description of the collision as an \"elevation\" issue, and President Trump's suggestion that the helicopter could have gone up or down to get out of the way of the plane, Duckworth responded, \"We have to let NTSB and FAA do their jobs \u2026 Neither the president nor Mr. Hegseth are pilots, as far as I know, and I think that amateur speculation is not what is needed at this point.\"",

Obama, Biden and the Democrats put policy first,\" Mr. Trump said. \"The FAA's website states they include hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, epilepsy, severe intellectual disability, psychiatric disability, and dwarfism.\" Mr. Trump added that people in those categories would be \"qualified\" for controller positions, even though the agency's statement does not say that.",
      "The president continued, \"Brilliant people have to be in those positions.\"",
      "It has been longstanding FAA policy \u2014 including before, during and after Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 to include people with disabilities in recruitment. However, there is no evidence that these initiatives have compromised air safety or had any relation to the crash Wednesday night. The cause of the collision remains under investigation.",

      "Before Mr. Trump took office last week, there was a \"Diversity and Inclusion\" page on the FAA's website, which stated the FAA had a \"special emphasis in recruiting and hiring\" people with the list of disabilities Trump cited.",

      "Mr. Trump was also asked why the \"Diversity and Inclusion\" policy was not changed on the FAA's website throughout his first administration. He said, \"I did change it. I changed the Obama policy, and we had a very good policy. And then Biden came in and he changed it.\" It's unclear precisely what policy he was referring to.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 19:44:42 -0500",
    "summary": "Less than two weeks into his second term, President Trump may be poised to deploy steep tariffs against key U.S. trading partners.",
    "story": [
      "On the day of his inauguration, President Trump threatened steep new tariffs against key U.S. trading partners. Now he may be primed to deliver.",
      "Mr. Trump said Jan. 20 that he could announce 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1, while China could face a 10% duty. Economists have warned that stiff tariffs\u00a0could reawaken inflation on a range of consumer goods and slow economic growth. Here's what experts have to say.",
      "Why is Trump threatening to hit countries with tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump has threatened tariffs against multiple nations for a range of reasons. He said he is specifically\u00a0targeting Canada, Mexico\u00a0and China with tariffs to compel them to take action to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S.",
      "Before Mr. Trump returned to power, he also had threatened tariffs of up to\u00a060% on Chinese goods\u00a0imported into the U.S., a measure experts say is intended to advance American interests in negotiating better trade terms with Beijing, as well as throttle the illegal entry of fentanyl into the country.",
      "In a show of how his administration uses tariff threats to pressure countries on other issues, Mr. Trump last week proposed potential 25% levies against Colombia unless it agreed to receive deportations of unauthorized immigrants. Colombia ultimately agreed to receive the immigrants,\u00a0and the tariffs were withheld.",
      "Colombia's about-face suggests that Canada and Mexico could also reach agreement with the U.S. and avert a painful trade war. To that end, Howard Lutnick, Mr. Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, said at his confirmation hearing Wednesday that Canada and Mexico could avoid tariffs by closing their borders to fentanyl.",
      "\"As far as I know, they are acting swiftly, and if they execute it, there will be no tariff,\" Lutnick told senators.",
      "Even so, Mr. Trump's brandishing of potential tariffs \u2014 even if they are never imposed \u2014 highlights his willingness to use tough trade measures to punish even the country's closest allies unless they make concessions.",
      "\"As we have previously noted, trade policy will be transactional over the next four years with protectionist measures used to extort trade, immigration and other political concessions,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said in a research note.",
      "What exactly is Trump planning?",
      "Rather than targeting individual countries, the Trump administration could also opt to impose a blanket tariff on a range of countries in Asia, South America, Europe and other regions, experts say. But it remains unclear what tariffs could be deployed, how they might be structured and the possible timeline for deploying them.",
      "\"I think we have to proceed on the assumption that some kinds of tariffs are going to be imposed on the United States' major trading partners,\" Brett House, professor of economics at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"In the end, there is a lot that gets announced by the president on social media that does not come to pass. I don't take it as bluffing, so much as a storm of possibilities, and it's hard to tell which bit of that storm is going to be pursued most aggressively, and most immediately.\"",
      "What's clear, by contrast, is that the new administration is picking up where Mr. Trump left off in his first term in using trade policy as an instrument of both economic and foreign policy. That is likely to lead to a period of uncertainty and volatility, said John Lash, group vice president of product strategy at supply-chain software firm E2open.",
      "\"A lot of alternatives are still possible,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch in an interview. \"We don't know, but game theory would suggest the president would implement tariffs in some form against Mexico and Canada \u2014 not blanket tariffs, but on a select number of imports from both nations... because otherwise his bluff is going to be called.\"",
      "On how soon any tariffs could take effect, Daco notes that Mr. Trump could move quickly by claiming authority under a 1977 law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.",
      "\"When he said he'll impose tariffs on Feb. 1, it is still an open question as to what means would be used. Do you want to implement tariffs immediately, as threatened against Colombia over the weekend, or are you threatening with a deadline to obtain concessions?,\" Daco said.",
      "Would the U.S. face retaliation?",
      "Almost certainly, economists say. If Trump officials move ahead with tariffs on its northern neighbor, \"We anticipate Canada would then respond in kind by also implementing a 25% across-the-board tariff on U.S. imports,\" Satyam Panday, chief U.S. and Canada economist with S&P Global Ratings, said in an email.",
      "Elijah Oliveros-Rosen, chief emerging markets economist at S&P Global Ratings, predicted Mexico also would fire back with targeted tariffs. \"In the case of Mexico, we think it's very unlikely the government would place tariffs on U.S.-manufactured imports, given most are intermediate goods eventually exported to the U.S. Therefore, we expect the Mexican government could impose tariffs on agricultural and food imports, but not manufacturing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said that strengthening the U.S.' stance on trade issues will help protect American workers and lead to a resurgence of domestic manufacturing. Yet such policies could come at the cost of damaging critical relationships with other nations around the world, said Douglas Irwin, a U.S. trade policy expert and professor of economics at Dartmouth College.",
      "What is the risk to American consumers?",
      "Irwin and other economists say tariffs are all but certain to lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers. That's because companies that end up on the hook typically pass added costs along to consumers in order to protect their bottom lines.",
      "\"The notion this this administration has been adhering to is somewhat surprising \u2014 the idea that if you implement gradual tariffs over time, such as in 5% increments, that these are less inflationary,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This idea is misguided, because if you have incremental price increases month after month, if anything that leads to higher inflation expectations. It leads to higher inflation on a month-to-month basis.\"",
      "If Mr. Trump's tariffs are implemented in full, including a universal 10% tax on all goods, consumer price inflation could rise by between 3% and 4%, according to an analysis this week from Capital Economics. To be sure, analysts with the investment advisory firm expect Mr. Trump to stop short of imposing a blanket tariff and instead pick his targets.",
      "\"Nevertheless, imposing any of these suggested tariffs would generate a rebound in consumer price inflation this year, taking it further above target and making it harder for the Fed to resume loosening monetary policy,\" the firm said.",

    "story": [
      "The Senate confirmed Doug Burgum as interior secretary late Thursday after President Trump tapped the North Dakota billionaire to spearhead the Republican administration's ambitions to boost fossil fuel production.",
      "The vote was 79-18. More than half of Senate Democrats joined all 53 Republicans in voting for Burgum.",
      "Burgum, 68, is an ultra-wealthy software industry entrepreneur who came from a small North Dakota farming community, where he worked at his family's grain elevator.",
      "He served two terms as governor of the oil-rich state and launched a presidential campaign in 2023, but dropped out months later and quickly endorsed Trump.",
      "Trump also picked Burgum to chair a new National Energy Council that's tasked with achieving American \"energy dominance.\" He would have a seat on the National Security Council \u2014 a first for the interior secretary.",
      "His directive from Mr. Trump is to make it even easier for energy companies to tap fossil fuel resources, including from public lands. That raised alarms among environmentalists and some Democrats as greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels bake the planet.",
      "Burgum eagerly assisted the energy industry during his time as governor, when he was also profiting from the lease of family land to oil companies, according to records obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "During his confirmation hearing, Burgum said the U.S. can use energy development as leverage to promote peace and to lower consumer costs.",
      "He raised concerns about the reliability of renewable power sources promoted under former President Joe Biden, and said the U.S. needs to generate more electricity from sources such as coal and nuclear that can run constantly.",
      "Democrats in response accused the Trump administration of abandoning an \"all of the above\" energy policy to favor fossil fuels.",
      "\"They said wind is dead on the offshore. They are trying to do as much of this as possible to create demand for coal, for fossil gas,\" Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz said during a Thursday floor speech.",
      "Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate, said Burgum would rightfully prioritize energy innovation over regulation.",
      "\"He's going to take the common-sense action of unlocking our lands for oil and for gas production,\" Barrasso said. He added that more than 600,000 acres of land in Wyoming have been approved for energy production but were not offered for development by the Biden administration.",
      "The U.S. currently produces more crude oil than any nation in history, according to the Energy Information Administration. More cost-effective technology in recent decades drove drilling booms in states including New Mexico, Texas and North Dakota, where vast expanses of rural farmland have been industrialized by oil and gas companies.",
      "The booms brought billions of dollars in tax revenue to state and federal governments. But burning those fuels is also unleashing immense volumes of carbon dioxide that scientists say is warming the planet.",
      "The Interior Department has jurisdiction over a half-billion acres of federal land and vast areas offshore. Those areas produce about one-quarter of U.S. oil annually.",
      "The interior secretary also oversees the National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management and other subagencies.",
      "Burgum succeeds Deb Haaland, who under Biden sharply scaled back oil and gas sales and promoted solar and wind projects on federal lands.",
      "Trump made energy development a centerpiece of his first term and is again vowing to abolish restrictions on the industry that are intended to protect the environment and public health.",
      "Burgum, during his hearing earlier this month before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee, suggested to lawmakers that carbon dioxide from fossil fuels could be captured to neutralize their contribution to global warming.",
      "Carbon-capture skeptics say the technology is untested at scale and allows the fossil-fuel industry to continue largely unchanged even as climate change becomes increasingly urgent.",
      "During Haaland's tenure at the Interior Department, officials also reversed actions taken during Trump's first term that weakened protections for imperiled species while making it easier for private developers to pursue projects on public lands.",
      "Republicans in Congress have said they plan to again seek changes to rules on endangered species and they want Burgum to help.",
      "Burgum says federal lands can be used for many purposes including recreation, logging and oil and gas production that can lift local economies.",
      "\"Not every acre of federal land is a national park or a wilderness area,\" he told lawmakers.",

    "story": [
      "As first responders searched the Potomac River Thursday following the nation's deadliest airline crash in nearly a quarter of a century, the agency tasked with regulating civilian air travel was without a Senate-approved head.",
      "President Trump moved Thursday, appointing Christopher Rocheleau, a 22-year FAA veteran, as acting administrator of the agency. Mr. Trump described\u00a0 Rocheleau as \"highly respected.\"",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration's most recent administrator, Michael Whitaker, resigned when President Trump took office last week. Whitaker held the job for 15 months, with the last few marred by criticism from prominent Trump supporter and now-White House official Elon Musk, who chafed at the agency's oversight of his company SpaceX.",
      "Mr. Trump formally appointed Rocheleau with a memo he signed in the Oval Office Thursday afternoon.",
      "\"He's a very capable guy,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Who is Christopher Rochelau?",
      "Rocheleau is in his third stint at the FAA. He was appointed by Mr. Trump as deputy administrator last week, and took on the title acting administrator Thursday morning, hours after an American Airlines jet with 64 people on board and an Army helicopter carrying three collided. Rocheleau most recently was chief operating officer of the National Business Aviation Association. Prior to that job, which he began in 2022, he was the FAA's deputy associate administrator for aviation safety. The U.S. Air Force veteran previously worked for the Transportation Security Administration.",
      "Why did Whitaker step down?",
      "Whitaker announced in December that he was stepping down. He was among many agency heads who stepped down as the new White House administration took shape, but did not publicly attribute his resignation to the incoming administration nor Elon Musk. The role of FAA administrator is a Senate-confirmed role, with a five year term. Whitaker was unanimously confirmed in October 2023, filling a role that had been run by acting administrators since March 2022,",
      "What did Musk say about Whitaker?",
      "Musk openly complained about Whitaker and the FAA, after the agency imposed $600,000 in fines on SpaceX related to missions launched with unapproved changes. Musk accused the agency of \"harassing SpaceX about nonsense.\" Musk posted on his social media site in September that Whitaker \"needs to resign.\"",
      "What is an acting administrator?",
      "Rocheleau will be the agency's fourth acting administrator since 2018, taking the helm of the agency without Senate confirmation. The last seven years have been a tumultuous time for the FAA, which faced criticism of its oversight after two Boeing crashes in 2018 and 2019, and later dealt with the rise in unruly passenger behavior amid and following COVID-19 era mask regulations, as well as airline staff shortages and technology glitches.",
      "What about the Transportation Secretary?",
      "Former Rep. Sean Duffy was sworn in as Secretary of Transportation on Tuesday, after being confirmed by the Senate in a 77-22 vote. The Department of Transportation includes the FAA. Duffy posted on social media Thursday that, \"I want the families of the victims to know that they have my word: I will not rest until you have the truth.\"",
      "\"I will find answers to how this happened. I have directed every relevant agency to immediately investigate what went wrong, and I will not tolerate delays or bureaucratic excuses,\" Duffy wrote. \"If there was negligence, incompetence, or failure anywhere in the system, we will find it\u2014and I will fix it.\"",

      "Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said that figure \"suggests the economy remains strong, particularly given the fourth-quarter disruptions,'' including a strike at Boeing and the aftermath of two hurricanes.",
      "President Donald Trump has inherited a healthy economy. Growth has been steady and unemployment low \u2014 4.1% in December.",
      "On Wednesday, the Fed left its benchmark interest rate unchanged after making three cuts since September. With the economy rolling along, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters, \"we do not need to be in a hurry'' to make more cuts. The Fed is also cautious because progress against inflation has stalled in recent months after falling from four-decade highs hit in mid-2022.",
      "The European Central Bank cut its benchmark rate by a quarter point Thursday, underlining the contrast between more robust growth in the U.S. economy and stagnation in Europe, which recorded zero growth at the end of last year.",
      "The U.S. economic outlook has become more cloudy, however. Trump has promised to cut taxes and ease regulations on business, which could speed GDP growth. But his plan to impose big taxes on imports and to deport millions of immigrants working in the United States illegally could mean slower growth and higher prices.",
      "Trump said last week that he would lower oil prices and then \"demand'' lower interest rates \u2013 a topic he said he'd take up with Powell. But the Fed chair deflected questions about Trump's comments Wednesday and said he'd had no contact with the president.",
      "Trump has also tried to reshape the federal government, offering buyouts to workers and issuing a memo Monday night freezing federal grants, then rescinding the memo Wednesday after a public outcry.",
      "Citing the \"squeeze'' on the federal government, Ashworth wrote in a commentary, \"we wouldn't be surprised to see a reversal in the first quarter. As a starting point, we expect first-quarter GDP growth to slow marginally below 2%.''",

    "summary": "Kash Patel is a staunch Trump ally and a former federal prosecutor and national security official.",
    "story": [
      "Kash Patel, President Trump's nominee to serve as FBI director, is set to appear Thursday on Capitol Hill for a high-stakes confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee amid calls from Republicans for massive reforms in FBI leadership and concerns from Democrats about his fitness to lead the nation's top law enforcement agency.",
      "Patel \u2014 a staunch Trump ally and former federal prosecutor and national security official \u2014 was announced by\u00a0Mr. Trump in December\u00a0to take the helm at the agency that has long been a target of the president's ire.\u00a0 The FBI director at the time, Christopher Wray, appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term, then announced his departure from the top job despite having not yet served the full ten-year term. He told 60 Minutes his decision was prompted in part by a desire to transition \"in an orderly way\" and \"not thrust the FBI deeper into the fray.\"",
      "Presidents have the power to replace FBI directors as they see fit and many past directors have not served full 10-year terms.",
      "Patel previously served in intelligence and defense roles in Mr. Trump's first term and held a position on the National Security Council and as chief of staff to the secretary of defense.",
      "An FBI whistleblower alleged that while serving in government, Patel violated firmly entrenched protocols to keep hostage rescue operations under wraps until the captives are safely in U.S. hands and their families have been notified, CBS News previously reported. In a letter obtained by CBS News, Sen. Dick Durbin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote that Patel, while serving on the National Security Council during the first Trump term, \"broke protocol regarding hostage rescues by publicly commenting without authorization on the then-in-progress retrieval of two Americans held captive by Iranian-backed militants in Yemen in October 2020.\"",
      "A source close to Patel pushed back on the allegations and Democrats' criticism, telling CBS News, \"Mr. Patel was a public defender, decorated prosecutor and accomplished national security official that kept Americans safe. He has a track record of success in every branch of government, from the courtroom to congressional hearing room to the situation room. There is no veracity to this anonymous source's complaints about protocol.\"",
      "A former Justice Department prosecutor, Patel has been highly critical of leadership within the organization and he has alleged recent cases against Mr. Trump were politically weaponized against the president and Republicans, allegations officials within the agency have previously denied.",
      "In 2023, Patel published a book titled \"Government Gangsters\" in which he alleged the \"FBI has become so thoroughly compromised that it will remain a threat to the people unless drastic measures are taken.\" And he has pledged to take on government officials and members of the media who he said \"lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections.\"",
      "The FBI came under increased scrutiny from Mr. Trump and his allies in 2022, when FBI agents executed a court-authorized search warrant at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. The search exposed what had been an ongoing federal probe into Trump's handling of classified records after he left office. The president has long denied wrongdoing and alleged the FBI and Justice Department were targeting him because of political considerations.",
      "If confirmed by the Senate, Patel would be the third FBI director to work under a Trump administration and would take over the nation's chief federal law enforcement apparatus amid years of intense criticism from Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill. He would report to the U.S. Attorney General. Trump's pick for that role, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, cleared a critical committee vote on Wednesday and is likely to be confirmed for her post in the coming days.",
      "Many Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee, including chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa, have applauded Patel's nomination as a step toward needed reform.",
      "\"The common sense that we have in the Midwest \u2013 we need more of it in Washington, D.C. and I think the [nominees] are going to bring it in, and Kash is one of them,\" Grassley said\u00a0on a recent podcast.",
      "Democrats, however, have been outspoken in their opposition to Patel's nomination and pointed to his past as a reason for concern.",
      "To be confirmed, Patel will first have to receive a majority of votes from within the GOP-led Senate Judiciary Committee, after which his nomination would be presented to the full Senate for a vote.",

      "Adams said the two had no discussion about a possible pardon or anything else regarding his criminal case.",
      "\"To be clear, we did not discuss my legal case, and those who suggest the mayor of the largest city in the nation shouldn't meet with the incoming president to discuss our city's priorities because of inaccurate speculation or because we're from different parties clearly care more about politics than people,\" Adams said in a statement after that meeting.",
      "Adams then abruptly canceled plans to\u00a0mark Martin Luther King, Jr. Day\u00a0in New York City to instead\u00a0attend Trump's inauguration after a last-minute invitation.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously said he thought Adams has been treated unfairly and has said he would consider pardoning Adams. If the case was dismissed, Adams would not have to be pardoned.",
      "Another thing that makes the the timing of this revelation unusual is that prosecutors in Manhattan just recently filed paperwork indicating they had uncovered \"additional criminal conduct\" by the mayor. Adding yet another layer of intrigue is word of the meeting comes as Adams has scaled back his public schedule this week due to health concerns, according to the mayor's office, and as Adams' attorney Alex Spiro was in court to have a closed door, sealed meeting about discovery in the case.",

      "\"None of us canceled MLK events to go to a Trump inauguration, and none of us are trying to get a pardon,\" he said.",
      "This year's crop of mayoral candidates made it clear that indictment or no indictment, they will demand answers from Adams during the campaign.",

      "His order on K-12 schools declares that federal money cannot be used on the \"indoctrination\" of children, including \"radical gender ideology and critical race theory.\" It says civil rights laws barring discrimination based on sex and race would be used to enforce the order, calling critical race theory an \"inherently racist policy.\"",
      "Examples cited in the order include a policy at Harrisonburg City Public Schools in Virginia requiring teachers to use students' preferred names and pronouns. Another policy at Madison Metropolitan School District in Wisconsin says schools should \"disrupt the gender binary\" by teaching students to embrace different gender identities, according to the order.",
      "The Education Department's Office for Civil Rights investigates allegations of civil rights violations and can impose sanctions up to a total loss of federal money, though that penalty has almost never been used and must be approved by a judge.",

The federal government provides billions of dollars to schools every year, though the vast majority of their money comes from state and local sources.",
      "The measure taps into a wave of conservative anger that has taken aim at classroom lessons that some see as too liberal. A growing number of Republican states have adopted laws or rules barring the teaching of critical race theory or \"divisive concepts\" in public schools and universities.",

      "The term \"critical race theory\" is sometimes used by conservatives as a catchall for subjects they don't want to be taught in the classroom, though, in reality, it refers to a complex academic and legal framework centered on the idea that racism is embedded in the nation's systems.",
      "Mr. Trump's plan to fight antisemitism would \"marshal all federal resources\" and bring immediate action from the Justice Department to investigate and punish offenders on U.S. campuses. It calls for the deportation of nonresidents who \"violate our laws,\" citing previous threats by Mr. Trump to revoke student visas for international students who attended pro-Palestinian protests.",
      "Trump's action promises to \"protect law and order, quell pro-Hamas vandalism and intimidation, and investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist, anti-American colleges and universities.\"",
      "It drew swift backlash from civil rights groups who said campus protests have mostly been peaceful and are protected by constitutional free speech rights.",
      "Edward Ahmed Mitchell, national deputy director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the action is discriminatory and wrongly characterizes protesters as \"pro-jihadist\" or \"pro-Hamas.\"",
      "\"These college students were Jewish, Muslim, Black, Palestinian and various other races who were simply protesting what they viewed as a genocide in Gaza,\" Mitchell said. \"They are no different than the students who protested Vietnam or segregation or apartheid in South Africa.\"",
      "Tensions over the Israel-Hamas war led to emotional demonstrations on U.S. campuses, including a wave of pro-Palestinian tent encampments that led to some 3,200 arrests.",
      "The Biden administration opened more than 100 investigations into alleged antisemitism and Islamophobia at schools and universities after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel.

    "summary": "Neither the White House nor any federal agency has provided evidence for a plan to spend $50 million on condoms for Gaza.",
    "story": [
      "Both President Trump and his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, have claimed that the administration has stopped a plan to spend $50 million on condoms for Gaza as part of the new administration's reevaluation of federal funding.",
      "\"We identified and stopped $50 million being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas,\" he said Wednesday. \"They've used them as a method of making bombs.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of State said in 2021 that Hamas and other militant groups have a history of launching incendiary balloons toward Israel. Previous photos taken by The Associated Press in 2020 show masked men attaching incendiary devices to gas-filled condoms and balloons.",
      "However, neither Trump nor officials in his administration have provided evidence of the program they are referring to or whether Hamas has used condoms as a weapon in its war with Israel. The Office of Management and Budget and the U.S. Agency of International Development (USAID) have not responded to questions from CBS News. Available figures from the State Department show that previous shipments for contraception, including condoms, to the Middle East cost far less than $50 million.",
      "Without specifying whether she was referring to a program that included the $50 million figure, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that a federal pause in foreign assistance included preventing $102 million in \"unjustified funding\" to a contractor in Gaza, \"including money for contraception.\"",
      "In an email to reporters, Bruce added that the administration stopped $102 million in funding to the International Medical Corps for Gaza.",
      "In a news release, the International Medical Corps, a global aid organization based in Los Angeles, responded that it has received about $68 million from USAID since Oct. 7, 2023, and has used the funding to operate two field hospitals in Gaza.",
      "\"No US government funding was used to procure or distribute condoms,\" the organization's statement said.",
      "The latest available report online on contraceptives and condom shipments from USAID, from fiscal year 2023, states that the agency's only shipment of contraceptives to the Middle East since fiscal year 2019 was made to Jordan and cost $45,680. The shipment contained injectable and oral contraceptives, not condoms.",
      "According to USAID reports, shipments of contraceptives to the Middle East do not happen annually. In the decade before fiscal year 2023, there were only two shipments, including one in fiscal year 2019 and one in fiscal year 2013. In fiscal year 2019, USAID spent a total of $1.1 million on contraceptives for Yemen, with condoms comprising 4% of the total value.",
      "It is unclear whether there were any planned contraceptive shipments to Gaza for fiscal year 2025. But the total value of all contraceptives shipped from the U.S. from USAID was $60 million in fiscal year 2023, which included shipments to 23 countries.",

    "summary": "Tulsi Gabbard, President Trump's pick to be director of national intelligence, faces a narrow path to confirmation amid concerns on a number of issues.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard's nomination to be President Trump's director of national intelligence is in peril as she faces skepticism from senators ahead of her confirmation hearing Thursday.",
      "Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii and combat veteran, faces a narrow path to confirmation amid concerns over her decision to meet with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in 2017, her past push to pardon National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden, her views on Ukraine and her previous opposition to renewing a key government surveillance authority, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.",
      "If confirmed, the 43-year-old who has no background in intelligence, would be tasked with overseeing the nation's 18 spy agencies.",
      "Last week, two sources told CBS News that Gabbard's nomination is at risk of being blocked and called the situation \"fluid.\" Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine are among the Republicans concerned about her nomination, they said.",
      "Collins sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee and could tip the scale against her. Gabbard cannot afford to lose a single Republican vote on the panel, which has nine GOP members and eight Democrats. Collins said Wednesday she is still undecided.",
      "\"I do not make a decision on nominees until after the hearing is concluded,\" she said.",
      "Collins said Monday she's seeking clarity from Gabbard about her position on Section 702. Gabbard, who sought to repeal the controversial law that authorizes the U.S. government to collect the communications of foreigners abroad without a warrant, has since reversed her stance. In a\u00a0statement to Punchbowl earlier this month, Gabbard said she now supports the surveillance authority, calling it \"crucial\" to protecting national security.",
      "\"My prior concerns about FISA were based on insufficient protections for civil liberties, particularly regarding the FBI's misuse of warrantless search powers on American citizens. Significant FISA reforms have been enacted since my time in Congress to address these issues,\" she said. \"If confirmed as DNI, I will uphold Americans' Fourth Amendment rights while maintaining vital national security tools like Section 702 to ensure the safety and freedom of the American people.\"",
      "Collins said Gabbard's response to her questions have been \"hedged and unclear.\"",
      "Gabbard's secret trip to Syria in 2017 in which she met with Assad is expected to be another focus of Thursday's hearing. Gabbard's trip faced an outcry from her fellow lawmakers, who argued it legitimized the brutal dictator. Assad fled the country in December 2024 after his regime was toppled.",
      "\"When the opportunity arose to meet with him, I did so because I felt that it's important that if we profess to truly care about the Syrian people, about their suffering, then we've got to be able to meet with anyone that we need to if there is a possibility that we can achieve peace,\" she said in 2017.",
      "She also doubted whether the Assad regime was behind a chemical weapons attack on its own civilians, which international weapons experts said originated from Syrian government sites.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who is not a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday said he would be paying attention to Gabbard's hearing.",
      "\"I tend to vote for almost everybody at both parties, but I want to see how the hearing goes,\" Graham said. \"Why did you go to Syria? What did you do regarding the Assad [regime]? Why do you think Edward Snowden should be held as a hero? I certainly don't.\"",
      "In 2020, Gabbard called for the dismissal of charges against Snowden, who leaked a trove of information on the U.S. government's top-secret mass surveillance programs. Snowden, who was charged with espionage in 2013, has been living in exile in Russia.",
      "Gabbard drew further ire after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, when she made statements that were viewed by some as parroting Russian propaganda.",
      "\"This war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden Admin/NATO had simply acknowledged Russia's legitimate security concerns regarding Ukraine's becoming a member of NATO, which would mean US/NATO forces right on Russia's border,\" she\u00a0wrote at the time.",
      "Republican Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas said Wednesday he expects Gabbard's potential confirmation vote to be \"really close.\"",
      "\"I still have confidence,\" he said. \"I think that she's an outsider, that she's a disrupter.\"",

    "summary": "The EPA chief will help President Trump fulfill his pledge to roll back major environmental regulations.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican-controlled Senate on Wednesday confirmed Lee Zeldin to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, a key role to help President Trump fulfill his pledge to roll back major environmental regulations, including those aimed at slowing climate change and encouraging use of electric vehicles.",
      "The vote was 56-42 in Zeldin's favor.",
      "Zeldin, a former Republican congressman from New York, is a longtime Trump ally and served on Mr. Trump's defense team during his first impeachment. He voted against certifying Mr. Trump's 2020 election loss to former President Joe Biden.",
      "Zeldin, 44, said during his confirmation hearing that he has a moral responsibility to be a good steward of the environment and pledged to support career staff who have dedicated themselves to the agency's mission to protect human health and the environment.",
      "Zeldin repeatedly declined to commit to specific policies, however, promising instead not to prejudge outcomes before arriving at EPA. When asked by Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska whether he would roll back programs that promote electric cars \u2014 a program Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized \u2014 Zeldin stayed vague but acknowledged he has heard Republican complaints.",
      "Mr. Trump led efforts to dismantle more than 100 environmental protections during his first term and has promised to do so again, targeting what he falsely labels an electric vehicle \"mandate\" and \"green new scam\" approved by Democrats.",
      "Mr. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, has vowed to overturn Biden's biggest climate accomplishments, including tailpipe regulations for vehicles and slashed pollution from power plants fired by coal and natural gas. Mr. Trump has already moved to oust career staff at EPA and other agencies, remove scientific advisers and close an office that helps minority communities that disproportionately struggle with polluted air and water.",
      "Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island called Zeldin the wrong man for the job.",
      "\"We need an EPA administrator who will take climate change seriously, treat the science honestly and stand up where necessary to the political pressure that will be coming from the White House, where we have a president who actually thinks (climate change) is a hoax, and from the huge fossil fuel forces that propelled him into office with enormous amounts of political money and who now think they own the place,\" Whitehouse said in a Senate speech.",
      "Mr. Trump is \"under the thumb of the fossil fuel industry,\" Whitehouse said, adding that the EPA administrator \"has to be truthful and factual and support and defend our environment and our safety from climate change.''",
      "He has nothing against Zeldin personally, Whitehouse added, \"but the likelihood of him standing against that fossil fuel bulldozer that is coming at him is essentially zero. And in that context, this is very much the wrong guy.\"",
      "Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said Zeldin will return the EPA to its original mission of protecting America's air, water and land \u2014 without \"suffocating the economy.\"",
      "Barrasso called Zeldin \"a lifelong public servant\" and a seasoned lawyer with a sharp legal mind and over 20 years of military service.",
      "Zeldin will continue Mr. Trump's \"mission to roll back punishing, political regulations\" at the EPA, \"cut red tape\" and oversee \"a new wave of creativity and innovation,'' Barrasso said.",
      "\"For the last four years, the so-called experts at the Environmental Protection Agency went on a reckless regulatory rampage,'' Barrasso said, referring to the Biden administration. \"They saddled American families and businesses with higher costs and heavy-handed restrictions. They bowed to climate extremism and ignored common sense.\"",
      "Zeldin \"will right the ship and restore balance at the EPA,'' Barrasso said, citing likely actions to repeal Biden-era rules on tailpipe emissions and power plants, along with eliminating federal subsidies for electric vehicles.",
      "The League of Conservation Voters, a national environmental advocacy group, has panned Zeldin's lifetime environmental record, giving him a 14% score. Like all Republicans at the time, he voted against the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act aimed at boosting renewable energy and manufacturing and fighting climate change.",
      "Zeldin supported a bill to reduce harmful forever chemicals, called PFAS, that would have required the EPA to set limits on substances in drinking water. He also was a leading proponent of the 2020 Great American Outdoors Act, which used oil and gas royalties to help the National Park Service tackle its massive maintenance backlog. He's also supported local conservation efforts on Long Island.",
      "Zeldin said at his Jan. 16 hearing that he wants to collaborate with the private sector \"to promote common-sense, smart regulation that will allow American innovation to continue to lead the world.\"",
      "The EPA under his leadership \"will prioritize compliance as much as possible,\" Zeldin said. \"I believe in the rule of law and I want to work with people to ensure they do their part to protect the environment.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 16:33:51 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve opted to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged in its first policy meeting since President Trump's inauguration.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it will leave its benchmark rate unchanged, hitting the brakes on lowering borrowing costs for individuals and businesses after a flurry of rate cuts starting last fall.",
      "The Fed said it will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The decision comes after the central bank trimmed rates three times starting in September 2024, which has pushed down the federal funds rate \u2014 the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 by one percentage point.",
      "The pause, the Fed's first rate decision since President Trump returned to office on Jan. 20, comes as economists predict the central bank is likely to take a wait-and-see approach to the president's economic policies, given that some, such as higher tariffs, could prove inflationary.",
      "The Fed's decision to keep rates steady reflects stubborn U.S. inflation, which remains close to 3% on an annual basis. That has fueled concerns that additional rate cuts could reignite price increases, making it more difficult to get to the Fed's 2% target. Notably, the Fed removed a line from its December statement expressing its belief that inflation \"has made progress\" toward its goal. Yet Powell struck a more dovish tone in a press conference to discuss the Fed's decision.",
      "\"Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well-anchored, as reflected in a broad, broad range of surveys of households, businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets,\" he said.",
      "Powell also described the economy as \"in quite a good place,\" citing growing GDP, solid job gains and a low unemployment rate, as well as signs of inflationary pressures easing. \"We don't need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,\" he added.",
      "\"Pressing the pause button,\" noted Lindsay Rosner, head of multisector fixed-income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"[T]he FOMC will want to see further progress in the inflation data to deliver the next rate cut highlighted by the fact they removed the reference on inflation making progress.\"",

      "In the meantime, inflation-weary consumers won't get much relief from still-high borrowing costs, especially if the Fed holds off on additional rate cuts later in 2025, as many economists and Wall Street analysts forecast. With the Fed hitting the pause button, it's unlikely that consumers will see lower borrowing costs on credit cards or other forms of debt, even as more households struggle to pay their bills.",
      "\"[L]ower- and middle-income households are facing mounting pressure, as evidenced by an increase in credit card and auto loan delinquencies,\" Joe Gaffoglio, CEO of Mutual of America Capital Management, said in an email.",
      "When will the Fed cut rates?",
      "The Fed may hold off on cutting rates until its May 7 meeting, according to economists polled by financial-data firm FactSet. That means the central bank is expected to hold rates steady at its next meeting on March 19.",
      "\"If the Fed doesn't resume cutting in the next few months, however, we suspect the window will have closed,\" Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics said in a report. \"While markets are still pricing in second half rate cuts, our view is that a flurry of tariffs will put a stop to that, as inflation rebounds to 3%.\"",
      "Asked about the possible impact of Mr. Trump's economic plans, Powell demurred, noting that while the Fed is monitoring the new administration's policies, it's too early for the central bank to make an assessment of their possible impact. Mr. Trump has vowed to enact a broad tariff of 10% on all imports, as well as to imposed\u00a025% tariffs on Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1.",
      "\"We need to let those policies be articulated before we can even begin to make that a plausible assessment of what their implications for the economy will be,\" he said. \"We don't know what's going to be tariffed, we don't know for how long or how much, what countries, we don't know about retaliation.\"",
      "Asked by CBS News' Richard Escobedo about economic uncertainty created by Mr. Trump's plan to deport undocumented immigrants, Powell responded that the administration's efforts are not yet showing up in economic data.",
      "\"Businesses that are dependent on immigrant labor are saying that it's suddenly gotten harder to get people,\" the Fed chair said. \"But again, you don't see that in the aggregate data, but yes, you hear it anecdotally.\"",
      "While inflation has subsided from a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022, it\u00a0rose 2.9% in December on a year-over-year basis due to higher prices on gasoline, which rose 4.4% from the prior month, as well as food and housing.",
      "In its statement, the Fed described the labor market as \"solid,\" with an unemployment rate that has \"stabilized at a low level in recent months.\" Even so, the Fed is closely monitoring the labor market for signs of weakness, with the central bank pointing to a rise in the jobless rate last fall as one reason why it opted to cut rates at the time.",
      "\"The Fed will keep their options open in case a sudden weakening materializes in the months to come\" in the labor market, noted Bankrate chief financial analyst Greg McBride in an email.",
      "As for when the next rate cut might come, it's unclear from the Fed's statement, he added.",
      "\"They gave no indication in their post-meeting statement that a resumption of rate cuts is likely at the next meeting in March,\" McBride said. \"It will take a run of good inflation data to get us there, whenever that may be.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The White House Office of Management and Budget on Wednesday walked back a memo that ordered a freeze on federal assistance, less than two days after the directive led to chaos and confusion around the country as to what programs would be impacted.",
      "The latest two-line memo from acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget Matthew Vaeth states that the earlier directive is rescinded. It directs those with questions about implementing President Trump's executive orders to contact the general counsels at their agencies.",
      "\"In light of the injunction, OMB has rescinded the memo to end any confusion on federal policy created by the court ruling and the dishonest media coverage,\" said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday. \"The executive orders issued by the president on funding reviews remain in full force and effect and will be rigorously implemented by all agencies and departments. This action should effectively end the court case and allow the government to focus on enforcing the president's orders on controlling federal spending.\"",
      "She said Mr. Trump will take more action in the coming weeks and months to address federal funding.",
      "The White House sent shockwaves when it issued the guidance late Monday that requested agencies temporarily pause \"to the extent permitted by law\" grant, loan or federal financial assistance programs that were implicated by Mr. Trump's executive orders. The executive orders listed include those involving immigration, energy, diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs, and gender ideology.",
      "The memo, from Vaeth, noted that $3 trillion was spent on federal assistance programs in 2024. It directed agencies to submit to the White House budget office by Feb. 10 detailed information on the programs, projects or activities subject to the funding freeze. The pause was set to take effect by 5 p.m. Tuesday.",
      "The full scope of the directive was not clear, and it left nonprofits, small businesses, universities and other entities scrambling to determine whether they would be impacted, and congressional offices faced an onslaught of questions from constituents and organizations fearing they would lose federal dollars.",
      "While the White House's memo stated Medicare or Social Security benefits would not be impacted, state Medicaid agencies, federally-funded Head Start early education programs and community health centers said they were cut off from accessing a web portal run by the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later clarified there was an \"outage\" that affected the portal, and said no payments were affected.",
      "In addition to sowing confusion, the memo sparked numerous lawsuits, including from a coalition of nonprofits and Democratic state attorneys general. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., swiftly convened a hearing on a request from the nonprofit groups to temporarily block enforcement of the freeze, and agreed Tuesday to issue a brief pause to fully consider the matter.",
      "At a hearing Wednesday in the case brought by the Democratic attorneys general, a federal judge in Rhode Island indicated he is likely to grant their request to temporarily block the funding freeze, but was unclear as to the scope of such an order given the White House's rescission of the memo.",
      "U.S. District Judge John McConnell said the states have \"clearly\" shown they would be irreparably harmed by the halting of federal assistance. He cited an affidavit from the director of the Rhode Island Department of Administration, which said the state has been awarded more than $5 billion in federal financial assistance \u2014 more than one-third of its fiscal year 2025 budget.",
      "McConnell said the initial memo ordering the freeze was \"hugely ambiguous and broad and potentially chaotic.\" He directed the states to submit a proposed temporary restraining order, which the Justice Department will have 24 hours to respond to.",
      "\"While the piece of paper may not exist, there is sufficient evidence that the defendants collectively are acting consistent with that directive,\" he said.",
      "Democrats, meanwhile, lambasted the move by Mr. Trump's administration and accused him of depriving states, cities, towns, schools and hospitals of billions of dollars in federal support.",
      "\"This decision is lawless, dangerous, destructive, cruel. It's illegal, it's unconstitutional,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said during a news conference Tuesday.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Wednesday signed the Laken Riley Act, which aims to expand the federal government's mandate to detain immigrants who are in the country illegally, marking the first legislation signed in Mr. Trump's new term.",
      "The Laken Riley Act, named after a 22-year-old nursing student who was murdered by an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant last year, expands mandatory detention to include noncitizens convicted of or charged with burglary, larceny, theft or shoplifting, as well as those who admit to committing those crimes. It also empowers state attorneys general who claim their states or residents have been harmed by immigration policies to sue the federal government.",
      "The House approved the legislation last week, sending the measure to the president's desk after the Senate expanded its scope to include the assault of a law enforcement officer and crimes that result in the death \"or serious bodily injury of another person\" as grounds for mandatory detention. The legislation passed both the House and Senate with bipartisan support, despite pushback from some Democrats.",
      "Ahead of the signing, Mr. Trump called it a \"very important law\" and said he was \"proudly\" signing it.",
      "\"We will keep Laken's memory alive in our hearts forever,\" Mr. Trump said. \"With today's action, her name will also live forever in the laws of our country.\"",
      "Though the measure stalled last year in the Democratic-controlled Senate, Democrats have appeared more willing to engage on the measure following their losses in the 2024 election, where immigration was a key issue.",
      "Still, the legislation has prompted questions among some Democrats, including whether Immigration and Customs Enforcement could fully enforce this new mandate without more funding.",
      "The bill signing comes as Mr. Trump has signed a slew of executive actions since taking office targeting border security as part of a dramatic crackdown on illegal immigration \u2014 from attempting to terminate birthright citizenship to tasking the military with border enforcement and moving to designate cartels and gangs as terrorist groups to shutting down asylum and refugee admissions.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is reversing the Biden administration's decision to extend the Temporary Protected Status program for Venezuelans\u200b in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration is reversing the Biden administration's decision to extend the Temporary Protected Status program for Venezuelans in the U.S., casting a cloud of uncertainty over the hundreds of thousands of migrants enrolled in the policy, according to a Department of Homeland Security notice obtained by CBS News.",
      "Under the move, some Venezuelan migrants with TPS could lose their ability to live and work in the U.S. lawfully as early as this spring. Migrants whose TPS lapses could face deportation by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, which the Trump administration has charged with carrying out the largest deportation effort in American history.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revoked an order issued earlier this month by her predecessor, Alejandro Mayorkas, that would have extended the Venezuela TPS program for 18 months, through October 2026. TPS allows migrants from countries beset by war, environmental disasters and other crises to work and live in the U.S. legally on a temporary basis.",
      "The Biden administration made two TPS designations for Venezuelans, one in 2021 and the other in 2023, citing the country's economic collapse under the repressive rule of President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "The decision by the Trump administration means that Venezuelans who applied for TPS under the 2021 designation will be able to keep their work permits and deportation protections through September. Those who applied under the 2023 designation will continue to have TPS through at least early April.",
      "Noem has until Saturday, Feb. 1, to decide whether to terminate or extend the 2023 designation, meaning that another announcement could happen soon. If no formal decision is made by then, the designation will be automatically extended by six months.",
      "Roughly 600,000 Venezuelans have protected status, making the Venezuela TPS program the largest of its kind, according to DHS figures. Venezuelans made up a significant portion of migrants crossing the U.S. southern border illegally during the historic migration wave there in the earlier years of the Biden administration.",
      "While hundreds of thousands have come to the U.S., millions of other Venezuelans have settled in countries like Colombia. In all, nearly 8 million Venezuelans have fled their homeland in recent years, according to United Nations figures.",
      "Noem announced her move to scale back the Venezuela TPS program on Fox News on Wednesday morning, after it was reported by The New York Times late Tuesday.",
      "The Biden administration used TPS at an unprecedented scale, making hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees from crisis-stricken countries like Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti and Ukraine eligible for the status.",
      "Some of those programs are likely to be scaled back by Trump administration officials, who argue TPS designations have been extended too often, despite the temporary nature of the policy.",

      "\"You're seeing an absolute epic boom in industry, because the reality is that China today is probably more productive than any economy has ever been,\" research analyst Louis-Vincent Gave told CBS News. He said the world's second largest economy is now better insulated for a trade war with the U.S.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 12:17:52 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has said he will \"demand\" lower interest rates, raising questions about his ability to influence the Federal Reserve.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump had a message last week for the Federal Reserve while at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland: He plans to \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\"",
      "Mr. Trump may be in for disappointment. The Federal Reserve widely expected to keep its benchmark rate steady when it announces its latest interest rate decision today at 2 p.m. Eastern Time. Economists aren't penciling in a 2025 reduction until at least May, according to economists polled by financial data service FactSet.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has over the years steadfastly defended the central bank's independence. Most recently, he underlined at a New York Times event in December that insulating the Fed from political influence is \"for the benefit of all Americans,\" allowing it to make decisions based on economic data rather than at the behest of elected officials. The Fed's independence allows it to pursue its dual mandate \u2014 to keep inflation low and the labor market at full employment \u2014 without political pressure, economists concur.",
      "\"We know monetary policy needs to be enacted with a democratic mandate underpinning it, with a day-to-day remove from politics,\" Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Interest rates may need to be raised but it may be inconvenient for political interests, and [the central bank] may need to move quickly to lower rates\" in case of an economic downturn.",
      "While the Fed is an independent agency, it is accountable to Congress and the public, with its chair and other officials testifying before Congress regularly. Its dual mandate was also established by Congress, as well as its structure of staggered appointments for Fed officials, designed to make the agency less vulnerable to pressures \"that could lead to undesirable outcomes,\" according to the Fed.",
      "What happens when a central bank isn't independent?",
      "Those \"undesirable outcomes\" can be seen in nations where central bankers are more vulnerable to political influence, economists say.",
      "That's because interest rates remain the most potent weapon that a central bank can wield against surging inflation \u2014 a tool that the Federal Reserve turned to in 2022 to tame the hottest U.S. inflation in 40 years. But elected officials sometimes decide that higher borrowing costs are politically inconvenient, because they make it more expensive for businesses to expand or for consumers to make purchases.",
      "In cases where a central bank isn't independent, officials may succeed in pressuring a central bank to keep a lid on rates.",
      "Experts point to Turkey as an example of what can occur when political interests dictate a central bank's monetary policies. Since 2010, its central bank has increasingly come under pressure from President Erdo\u011fan to keep its interest rates low, even as inflation surged during the pandemic, according to the non-partisan Centre for Economic Policy Research.",
      "Instead of hiking rates as Turkey's inflation rate topped 80% in October 2022 on an annual basis, the nation's central bank cut its benchmark rate several times in 2022 and 2023. While the bank reversed course and hiked rates starting in mid-2023, inflation there has proved tough to tame, with prices rising by 44% in December 2024.",
      "By comparison, the highest U.S. inflation rate during the post-pandemic period was in June 2022, when inflation hit 9.1% on an annual basis in June 2022. In the face of the Fed's rate hikes, inflation has cooled since then, deflating to 2.9% on an annual basis last month.",
      "\"The Fed has done really well \u2014 they have raised the rates enough to try to slowly squeeze inflation out of the market,\" noted Erasmus Kersting, a professor of economics at Villanova University. The Fed has \"done all that while avoiding a recession \u2014 that is a delicate needle to thread.\"",
      "Could Mr. Trump influence the Fed?",
      "Questions about Mr. Trump's ability to influence the Federal Reserve or shake up its leadership are intensifying amid the president's statements about his desire for lower interest rates. During his 2024 election campaign, Mr. Trump had insisted that as president he should have a \"say\" in the Fed's interest rate policies.",
      "\"I think that, in my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman,\" Mr. Trump said in August.",
      "For his part, Powell said last year that he would not resign\u00a0even if asked to do so by Mr. Trump, adding that under the law presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "However, Mr. Trump has recently fired several government officials in ways that critics say violate the law, such as his administration's firing of more than a dozen federal inspectors general on Friday. Federal law requires the White House to give Congress a full month of warning and case-specific details before firing a federal inspector general.",
      "Removing Powell wouldn't necessarily change the Fed's monetary policy decisions, given that rates are set by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Seven members are from the Fed's Board of Governors; four are assigned from the 11 Reserve Bank presidents, who each serve one-year terms on a rotating basis; and one FOMC member is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Interfering with the Fed could have consequences, both legally and for the stock market, experts said.",
      "\"Should any president attempt to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve without cause other than doing the job they were appointed and confirmed to do, I expect there to be swift legal challenges,\" noted Tim Stretton at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government watchdog. \"I suspect the market would also react negatively. Markets like stability, and this level of unprecedented interference in the Federal Reserve would be anything but stable.\"",
      "Asked what advice he would give Mr. Trump about dealing with the Fed, Columbia Business School's House said, \"Stop talking.\"",
      "He added, \"Let the Fed conduct its business consistent with its mandate, and it'll be more likely to get interest rates down.\"",

      "Acting U.S. Attorney Hayden O'Byrne made the request to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit on Wednesday, which lawyers for Nauta and de Oliveira do not oppose. It's likely the Atlanta-based appeals court will grant the request, bringing the case initially brought by former special counsel Jack Smith to a close.",
      "Nauta and de Oliveira were charged alongside Mr. Trump in 2023 with allegedly helping obstruct the Justice Department probe into the president's handling of sensitive government documents after the end of his first term in January 2021.",
      "The prosecution was brought by Smith, who resigned as special counsel before Mr. Trump returned to the White House. The special counsel claimed the president unlawfully held onto sensitive government after returning to his South Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, after leaving the White House four years ago, and accused Nauta and de Oliveira of working with Mr. Trump to conceal information from the Justice Department.",
      "The three co-defendants pleaded not guilty. The charges were then dismissed by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon last July on the grounds that Smith was unlawfully appointed. The special counsel appealed the decision to the 11th Circuit.",
      "Following Mr. Trump's election in November, Smith successfully sought to remove him from the case because of a longstanding Justice Department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president. But the appeal was continuing as to Nauta and de Oliveira.",
      "The former special counsel accused the two allies of Mr. Trump of attempting to interfere with the federal probe. Their attorneys fought the charges and resisted the Justice Department's previous efforts to keep the cases moving forward on appeal after Mr. Trump's election win.",
      "Should the judges agree to close the case, a major impediment to the public release of Smith's report summarizing the classified documents investigation would be eliminated. Former Attorney General Merrick Garland agreed to keep the volume of Smith's report that dealt with the case under seal as the appeal progressed. Now, with the case on the verge of dismissal and Mr. Trump's administration in power, it remains unclear whether the volume of the report will be released to the public.",
      "The first volume of Smith's report, which involved his investigation and prosecution of Mr. Trump stemming from alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of presidential power after the 2020 election, was made public just before the president returned to office.",
      "Mr. Trump has returned to office with a pledge to end the so-called \"weaponization\" of the Justice Department. He has since fired roughly a dozen department employees\u00a0who worked with Smith on the prosecutions of the president.",
      "Nauta's lawyer, Stanley Woodward, is now serving as a White House lawyer. CBS News previously reported that de Oliveira's attorney, John Irving, is under possible consideration for a top job within the Justice Department although a final decision has yet to be made.",
      "Irving said in a statement that \"Carlos should never have been charged in the first place, and I have zero doubt that he would have been acquitted at trial. It's nice to see the Justice Department using better judgment these days.\"",

    "story": [
      "Asteroid samples fetched by NASA hold not only the pristine building blocks for life but also the salty remains of an ancient water world, scientists reported Wednesday.",
      "The findings provide the strongest evidence yet that asteroids may have planted the seeds of life on Earth and that these ingredients were mingling with water almost right from the start.",
      "\"That's the kind of environment that could have been essential to the steps that lead from elements to life,\" said the Smithsonian Institution's Tim McCoy, one of the lead study authors.",
      "NASA's Osiris-Rex spacecraft returned 122 grams (4 ounces) of dust and pebbles from the near-Earth asteroid Bennu, delivering the sample canister to the Utah desert in 2023 before swooping off after another space rock. It remains the biggest cosmic haul from beyond the moon. The two previous asteroid sample missions, by Japan, yielded considerably less material.",
      "Small amounts of Bennu's precious black grains \u2014 leftovers from the solar system's formation 4.5 billion years ago \u2014 were doled out to the two separate research teams whose studies appeared in the journals Nature and Nature Astronomy. But it was more than enough to tease out the sodium-rich minerals and confirm the presence of amino acids, nitrogen in the form of ammonia and even parts of the genetic code.",
      "Some if not all of the delicate salts found at Bennu \u2014 similar to what's in the dry lakebeds of California's Mojave Desert and Africa's Sahara \u2014 would be stripped away if present in falling meteorites.",
      "\"This discovery was only possible by analyzing samples that were collected directly from the asteroid then carefully preserved back on Earth,\" the Institute of Science Tokyo's Yasuhito Sekine, who was not involved in the studies, said in an accompanying editorial.",
      "Combining the ingredients of life with an environment of sodium-rich salt water, or brines, \"that's really the pathway to life,\" said McCoy, the National Museum of Natural History's curator of meteorites. \"These processes probably occurred much earlier and were much more widespread than we had thought before.\"",
      "NASA's Daniel Glavin said one of the biggest surprises was the relatively high abundance of nitrogen, including ammonia. While all of the organic molecules found in the Bennu samples have been identified before in meteorites, Glavin said the ones from Bennu are valid \u2014 \"real extraterrestrial organic material formed in space and not a result of contamination from Earth.\"",
      "Bennu \u2014 a rubble pile just one-third of a mile (one-half of a kilometer) across \u2014 was originally part of a much larger asteroid that got clobbered by other space rocks. The latest results suggest this parent body had an extensive underground network of lakes or even oceans, and that the water evaporated away, leaving behind the salty clues.",
      "Sixty labs around the world are analyzing bits of Bennu as part of initial studies, said the University of Arizona's Dante Lauretta, the mission's chief scientist who took part in both studies.",
      "Most of the $1 billion mission's cache has been set aside for future analysis. Scientists stress more testing is needed to better understand the Bennu samples, as well as more asteroid and comet sample returns. China plans to launch an asteroid sample return mission this year.",
      "Many are pushing for a mission to collect rocks and dirt from the potentially waterlogged dwarf planet Ceres in the main asteroid belt. Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus also beckon as enticing water worlds. Meanwhile, NASA has core samples awaiting pickup at Mars, but their delivery is on hold while the space agency studies the quickest and cheapest way to get them here.",

    "story": [
      "A palm-sized mammal that lives underground in California  has been caught alive on camera for the first time.",
      "Three undergraduate students came up with an idea to capture the elusive Mount Lyell shrew, native to the Eastern Sierra Nevada region, as part of their fall 2024 project. Vishal Subramanyan, Prakrit Jain and Harper Forbes laid out over 100 traps last November and checked them every two hours, for three days and four nights, to photograph the tiny creatures.",
      "\"The hardest part of getting the photos was one, they're incredibly fast cuz they're always running around,\" Subramanyan told CBS News.",
      "Another reason the Mount Lynell shrews had never been captured alive on camera is that they have an incredibly fast metabolism, Subramanyan said. He and Jain were already taking photos of small mammals for their mammalogy class when they learned that this particular animal had never been photographed before, so they devised a plan.",
      "Researchers have set up similar pitfall traps to capture the shrews, but if they're left in the trap for more than two hours, they'll simply starve to death. That's why Subramanyan, Jain and Forbes had to check their traps every two hours.",
      "To take the photos, the students set up a white background on the bottom of a box, using glass on the top so they could photograph through it. They also had a terrarium with soil and mealworms for the shrews.",
      "The tiny mammals are active through day and night because they have to constantly feed on insects and arachnids to survive. Another challenge in getting the photos were cold fingers, Subramanyan said.",
      "Temperatures in the mountain fell to 15 degrees during the expedition funded with the help of Cal Academy. Subramanyan was part of the organization's inaugural California Creators for Nature program that aims to engage people on social media in conversations about nature, climate and environmental justice.",

      "In addition to helping raise awareness about the small mammals facing threats from climate change \u2014 with 89% projected loss of its habitat by the 2080s, according to UC Berkeley \u2014 the students said the photos will be entered into scientific databases, and they will help make it easier for researchers to identify species of the shrews.",
      "The shrews are \"highly prolific predators\" that can eat several times their body mass on a daily basis, Jain said. He noted they also serve as an important part in the food chain for other predators such as snakes, owls and wild cats.",

      "Satellite imagery suggested that unlike previous \"megabergs,\" this rogue was not crumbling into smaller chunks as it plodded through the Southern Ocean, Andrew Meijers, a physical oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey, told AFP on Friday.",
      "He said predicting its exact course was difficult but prevailing currents suggested the colossus would reach the shallow continental shelf around South Georgia in two to four weeks.",
      "But what might happen next is anyone's guess, he said.",
      "It could avoid the shelf and get carried into open water beyond South Georgia, a British overseas territory some 870 miles east of the Falkland Islands.",
      "Or it could strike the sloping bottom and get stuck for months or break up into pieces.",
      "Meijers said this scenario could seriously impede seals and penguins trying to feed and raise their young on the island. The island hosts 1.3 million pairs of Chinstrap penguins \u2014 one of the world's largest colonies \u2014 about 5 million seals, and 65 million breeding birds.",
      "\"Icebergs have grounded there in the past and that has caused significant mortality to penguin chicks and seal pups,\" he said.",
      "Roughly 1,550 square miles across, the world's biggest and oldest iceberg, known as A23a, calved from the Antarctic shelf in 1986. Before its calving in 1986, the colossal iceberg hosted a Soviet research station. falley",
      "It remained stuck for over 30 years before finally breaking free in 2020, its lumbering journey north sometimes delayed by ocean forces that kept it spinning in place. In 2023, the British Antarctic Survey posted a time-lapse of satellite imagery, showing the iceberg's movement.",
      "\"Game of Thrones-esque\" iceberg",

The legendary\u00a0shipwreck was discovered\u00a0off the coast of Antarctica in 2022.",

      "\"The iceberg is moved by that water flow, so the chances of it hitting are not that high,\" though chunks could, he said.",
      "Another scientist, glaciologist Soledad Tiranti currently on an Argentinian exploration voyage in the Antarctic, said that icebergs such as A23a \"are so deep that before reaching an island or mainland they generally get stuck\" on the seabed.",
      "It is summer in South Georgia and resident penguins and seals along its southern coastline are foraging in the frosty waters to bring back food to fatten their young.",
      "\"If the iceberg parks there, it'll either block physically where they feed from, or they'll have to go around it,\" said Meijers.",
      "\"That burns a huge amount of extra energy for them, so that's less energy for the pups and chicks, which causes increased mortality.\"",
      "The seal and penguin populations on South Georgia have already been having a \"bad season\" with an outbreak of bird flu \"and that (iceberg) would make it significantly worse,\" he said.",
      "As A23a ultimately melted it could seed the water with nutrients that encourage phytoplankton growth, feeding whales and other species, and allowing scientists to study how such blooms absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",
      "While icebergs are natural phenomena, Meijers said the rate at which they were being lost from Antarctica was increasing, likely due to human induced climate change.",

    "story": [
      "Starliner astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore took a stroll outside the International Space Station on Thursday, marking their 239th day in orbit by carrying out a task originally planned for a spacewalk last summer. In the process, Williams became the world's most experienced female spacewalker, logging more than 62 hours outside the lab over nine excursions across multiple missions.",
      "Her latest outing began at 7:43 a.m. EST when she and Wilmore switched their spacesuits to battery power and headed out to retrieve a faulty S-band antenna assembly mounted on an external storage platform. Two earlier attempts to retrieve the unit were unsuccessful.",
      "The device wasn't designed for spacewalk retrieval and it took Williams and Wilmore longer than had been planned to get the job done. But thanks to improvisation and muscle power, the third time was the charm.",
      "\"The team has just been incredible,\" Williams radioed from the Quest airlock when the five-hour 26-minute EVA came to an end. \"I know we were not the first, we weren't even the second crew to do this, but somehow, with all of their great work, we were able to get it done.\"",
      "Added Wilmore: \"This is probably the most involved spacewalk that probably every discipline in the ISS program was sweating as much as Suni and I were. Fantastic job, coming up with the next plan, and the next plan, and the next plan. And it worked! So, outstanding.\"",
      "After the antenna retrieval, Wilmore collected swabs from nearby vents to help researchers determine if any microbial life from inside the station had managed to make it outside and survive in the space environment. A third task, prepping a spare robot arm joint for possible use if arm repairs are ever needed, was deferred to a future spacewalk.",
      "Going into Thursday's spacewalk, or EVA, Williams had logged 56 hours and 40 minutes outside the station during eight previous outings while Wilmore had chalked up 25 hours and 35 minutes of EVA time during four excursions.",
      "With her latest spacewalk, Williams moved past retired astronaut Peggy Whitson's mark of 60 hours and 21 minutes of spacewalk time to become the world's most experienced female spacewalker, moving up to number four overall.",
      "Stuck aboard the station since last June because of NASA concerns about the safety of their Starliner capsule, Williams and Wilmore are now planning to return to Earth around the end of March aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ship that carried two other station fliers \u2014 Crew 9 commander Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov \u2014 to the lab last September.",
      "That Crew Dragon was launched with two empty seats specifically to carry Williams and Wilmore back to Earth at the end of the Crew 9 mission, originally planned for late February. But an extra month was tacked on later to give SpaceX more time to complete pre-flight checks of the Crew 10 Dragon, which will be making its maiden flight.",

    "summary": "A NASA spacecraft has returned asteroid samples that hold not only the pristine building blocks for life but also the salty remains of an ancient water world.",
    "story": [
      "Asteroid samples fetched by NASA hold not only the pristine building blocks for life but also the salty remains of an ancient water world, scientists reported Wednesday.",
      "The findings provide the strongest evidence yet that asteroids may have planted the seeds of life on Earth and that these ingredients were mingling with water almost right from the start.",
      "\"That's the kind of environment that could have been essential to the steps that lead from elements to life,\" said the Smithsonian Institution's Tim McCoy, one of the lead study authors.",
      "NASA's Osiris-Rex spacecraft returned 122 grams (4 ounces) of dust and pebbles from the near-Earth asteroid Bennu, delivering the sample canister to the Utah desert in 2023 before swooping off after another space rock. It remains the biggest cosmic haul from beyond the moon. The two previous asteroid sample missions, by Japan, yielded considerably less material.",
      "Small amounts of Bennu's precious black grains \u2014 leftovers from the solar system's formation 4.5 billion years ago \u2014 were doled out to the two separate research teams whose studies appeared in the journals Nature and Nature Astronomy. But it was more than enough to tease out the sodium-rich minerals and confirm the presence of amino acids, nitrogen in the form of ammonia and even parts of the genetic code.",
      "Some if not all of the delicate salts found at Bennu \u2014 similar to what's in the dry lakebeds of California's Mojave Desert and Africa's Sahara \u2014 would be stripped away if present in falling meteorites.",
      "\"This discovery was only possible by analyzing samples that were collected directly from the asteroid then carefully preserved back on Earth,\" the Institute of Science Tokyo's Yasuhito Sekine, who was not involved in the studies, said in an accompanying editorial.",
      "Combining the ingredients of life with an environment of sodium-rich salt water, or brines, \"that's really the pathway to life,\" said McCoy, the National Museum of Natural History's curator of meteorites. \"These processes probably occurred much earlier and were much more widespread than we had thought before.\"",
      "NASA's Daniel Glavin said one of the biggest surprises was the relatively high abundance of nitrogen, including ammonia. While all of the organic molecules found in the Bennu samples have been identified before in meteorites, Glavin said the ones from Bennu are valid \u2014 \"real extraterrestrial organic material formed in space and not a result of contamination from Earth.\"",
      "Bennu \u2014 a rubble pile just one-third of a mile (one-half of a kilometer) across \u2014 was originally part of a much larger asteroid that got clobbered by other space rocks. The latest results suggest this parent body had an extensive underground network of lakes or even oceans, and that the water evaporated away, leaving behind the salty clues.",
      "Sixty labs around the world are analyzing bits of Bennu as part of initial studies, said the University of Arizona's Dante Lauretta, the mission's chief scientist who took part in both studies.",
      "Most of the $1 billion mission's cache has been set aside for future analysis. Scientists stress more testing is needed to better understand the Bennu samples, as well as more asteroid and comet sample returns. China plans to launch an asteroid sample return mission this year.",
      "Many are pushing for a mission to collect rocks and dirt from the potentially waterlogged dwarf planet Ceres in the main asteroid belt. Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus also beckon as enticing water worlds. Meanwhile, NASA has core samples awaiting pickup at Mars, but their delivery is on hold while the space agency studies the quickest and cheapest way to get them here.",

They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!\"",
      "For his part, Musk had written in an earlier post on his own social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding that \"we will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's post made it sound like Musk himself would be going to space, adding to widespread confusion about what was being planned, in part because the astronauts in question, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and co-pilot Sunita Williams, are not \"stranded\" in any conventional sense, and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "They could return to Earth anytime NASA so decides, riding down in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule that carried two station crew members to orbit last September with two empty seats specifically for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "They blasted off aboard the Starliner capsule last June 5 for a presumed eight-to-10-day mission. It was the first piloted flight of a Starliner, a key step toward beginning service as an operational alternative to SpaceX's Crew Dragon.",
      "But the flight was marred by propellant leaks and pressurization problems with the Starliner's propulsion system.",
      "After multiple extensions to carry out tests and analyses, NASA managers decided on Aug. 24 to leave Wilmore and Williams aboard the station for an extended stay, bringing the Starliner down under remote control, without its crew, on Sept. 7. There were no major problems.",
      "The decision to keep Wilmore and Williams aloft on the station was made by NASA management based on a risk assessment and a desire to minimize long-range disruption to the carefully choreographed schedule of crew rotation and cargo delivery missions.",
      "In any case, in the wake of NASA's decision, SpaceX launched a four-seat Crew Dragon spacecraft to the space station on Sept. 28 with just two crew members aboard \u2014 NASA's Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov \u2014 leaving two seats available for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "NASA opted to carry out a normal long-duration stay by Hague and Gorbunov, who launched with an expectation of returning to Earth at the end of February with Wilmore and Williams. All of that was known last September.",
      "The return flight was later delayed an additional month or so to give SpaceX more time to ready a new Crew Dragon capsule for launch on its maiden flight to ferry a replacement crew \u2014 Crew 10 \u2014 to the station.",
      "As it now stands, Crew 9 commander Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams are expecting to return to Earth at the end of March. By that point, the two Starliner astronauts will have logged around 300 days in space. Both astronauts have said they understood NASA's decision to extend their mission.",
      "As the founder of SpaceX, Musk was certainly aware of those decisions when they were made and the rationale behind them. There have been no reports of any direct involvement of the Biden administration in the decisions to extend the Starliner crew's stay in space, and Musk offered no criticisms of NASA's decision at the time.",
      "As for what returning the Starliner crew to Earth \"as soon as possible\" might mean, the only obvious answer would be to bring Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams down ahead of schedule. They would not need anyone to come get them.",
      "But an early departure would leave a single U.S. astronaut behind on the space station: Don Pettit, who launched to the lab last year aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft along with two Russian crewmates.",
      "NASA would then have just one astronaut on board the station to operate the multi-module U.S. segment of the lab, likely halting research in its tracks until Crew 10 could arrive aboard the next Crew Dragon.",
      "Rumors indicate the Crew 10 Dragon could be facing additional delays. NASA could opt to move the next station crew to a Crew Dragon earmarked for a commercial trip to the station carrying a crew sponsored by Houston-based Axiom Space. That might move the Crew 9 return up a few days, but not by any significant amount.",

John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said Tuesday in a statement shared on social media. \"We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek's AI infrastructure.\"",
      "The spotlight on DeepSeek comes amid rising tensions over trade, technology and other issues between the two superpowers. The U.S. has already imposed significant export controls on China in an effort to rein in Beijing's production of semiconductors used in developing advanced AI, with the most recent curbs coming in\u00a0December.",
      "\"At the President's direction, the NSC and others in the U.S. government work in many ways to address concerns involving AI, China and data security,\" agency spokesperson Brian Hughes told CBS News in an email. \"As the President has underscored, U.S. policy is to ensure that the United States leads the world in AI.\"",
      "Security threat for users",
      "While the calls from Moolenaar could be the first inkling of a possible congressional crackdown, Ross Burley \u2014 a co-founder of the nonprofit Centre for Information Resilience \u2014 warned that DeepSeek's emergence in the U.S. raises data security and privacy issues for users. Chinese law grants Beijing broad authority to access data from companies based in China.",
      "\"More and more people will use it, and that will open the door to more and more personal data just being given away to the [Chinese Communist Party] and being sent basically to mainland China to be able to inform them of their activities,\" Burley told CBS News.",
      "\"What they'll use it for is behavior change campaigns, disinformation campaigns, for really targeted messaging as to what Western audiences like, what they do,\" he added.",
      "DeepSeek, which is based in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, notes in its privacy policy that the personal information it collects from users is held \"on secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Under that\u00a0policy, the company says it collects information including users' \"device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, and system language.\" DeepSeek also collects \"service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs,\" according to the company.",
      "A key difference from TikTok",
      "The fact that DeepSeek's servers are based in mainland China differentiates it from TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform that Congress had sought to ban on national security grounds before President Trump signed an executive order last week directing the Justice Department to not enforce the law for a period of 75 days.",
      "In an effort to mitigate U.S. regulatory concerns, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in 2022 moved all of its U.S. data to infrastructure owned by American software maker Oracle.",
      "The legislation banning TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April \u2014 grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on tech platforms owned by countries regarded as U.S. adversaries.",
      "Under that law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content; has more than 1 million monthly active users; is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country; and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "But DeepSeek may be seen as less of a threat given that, unlike TikTok, it is an open-source large language model, according to Matt Sheehan, a China fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\"[A] lot of these open-source apps, open-source models, you can actually sort of use them directly on other platforms. Perplexity is a major U.S. AI company, and they're currently using a version of DeepSeek that you can use that doesn't have the data privacy or security threats,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Advancing censorship?",
      "One issue that DeepSeek users face outside of China: censorship. For example, a CBS News analysis of the application found that DeepSeek did not return any results for a prompt seeking information bout the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre in Beijing.",
      "Burley of the Centre for Information Resilience thinks such suppression of information on an app being downloaded by millions of users will pressure policymakers to act.",
      "\"I think it's incumbent on Western governments \u2014 the U.K., Canada, the U.S. \u2014 to look and see if it is wise for the Apple store and the Android store to host this large language model when it is so clearly being curated to push Chinese narratives and censorship,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Chinese startup DeepSeek has debuted an AI app that challenges OpenAI's ChatGPT and other U.S. rivals, sending a shock through Wall Street.",
    "story": [
      "A Chinese artificial intelligence company called DeepSeek is grabbing America's attention \u2014 and sending a shock wave through Wall Street \u2014 due to its new tech, which some experts say rivals that of OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "DeepSeek is also catching investors off guard because of the low development costs for its AI app, which Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives pegged at only $6 million. By comparison, OpenAI, Google and other major U.S. companies are on track to invest a total of roughly $1 trillion in AI over the coming years, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "On Monday, DeepSeek's rollout roiled shares of AI stalwarts such as Nvidia, the high-flying manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, and Dutch company ASML, another chipmaker. The Chinese company's tech is raising questions about whether demand for Nvidia's chips could take a hit, as well as whether investors are overvaluing tech stocks that have been buoyed by the promise of AI, from Meta to Microsoft, experts said.",
      "\"DeepSeek has taken the market by storm by doing more with less,\" said Giuseppe Sette, president at AI market research firm Reflexivity, in an email. \"This shows that with AI the surprises will keep on coming in the next few years.\"",
      "DeepSeek's latest app comes just days after President Trump announced a new $500 billion venture\u00a0with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, dubbed Stargate, which he touted as ensuring \"the future of technology\" in the U.S.",
      "AI-related stocks took a hit on Monday, with Nvidia shares tumbling 17%, shedding $600 billion in value and marking the single-biggest one-day loss for a company in stock market history, according\u00a0to CNBC. ASML sank 6%, while Broadcom, another semiconductor stock, also slumped 17%.",
      "Some energy-related stocks also plunged on Monday on investor worries that the new tech could require less energy to run, translating into lower demand from the tech sector. GE Vernova, which makes wind and gas turbines, plunged 21%, while electricity generator Vistra slumped 28%.",
      "The tech-heavy Nasdaq index slumped 3%, or 612 points, while the S&P 500 declined 1.5%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7%.",
      "Despite the sharp drop on the Nasdaq, it's far from the worst day for the index during the past five years. The worst one-day decline since Jan. 27, 2020, came on March 16, 2020, when the index plunged more than 12% as COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy.",
      "What is DeepSeek?",
      "DeepSeek is a private Chinese company founded in July 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a graduate of Zhejiang University, one of China's top universities, who funded the startup via his hedge fund,\u00a0according to the MIT Technology Review. Liang has about $8 billion in assets, Ives wrote in a Jan. 27 research note.",
      "Liang, who had previously focused on applying AI to investing, had bought a \"stockpile of Nvidia A100 chips,\" a type of tech that is now banned from export to China. Those chips became the basis of DeepSeek, the MIT publication reported.",
      "Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius, told investors in a note that DeepSeek makes legitimate breakthroughs as an AI tool, including better learning and more efficient use of memory, although he expressed skepticism about the \"amount of chips used.\"",
      "Is DeepSeek available in the U.S.?",
      "The company's AI app is available in Apple's App store, as well as online at its website. The service is free and as of Monday morning was the top download on Apple's store, although some people were having trouble signing up for the app.",
      "On its Chinese site, DeepSeek blamed \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its service, requiring it to temporarily limit new registrations. \"Existing users can log in as usual,\" the company said in the post, which was dated shortly after midnight Jan. 28 in China's local time.",
      "The company released its latest AI model on Jan. 20, which is causing Wall Street to reappraise the AI sector.",
      "\"Last week DeepSeek launched a model that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta's Llama 3.1 and was #1 on Apple's App Store over the weekend,\" Wedbush's Ives wrote. \"DeepSeek built the model using reduced capability chips from Nvidia. which is impressive and thus has caused major agita for U.S. tech stocks with massive pressure on Nasdaq this morning.\"",
      "How is DeepSeek different than other AI apps?",
      "DeepSeek is an open-source large language model that relies on what is known as \"inference-time computing,\" which Sette said in layman's terms means \"they activate only the most relevant portions of their model for each query, and that saves money and computation power.\"",
      "Some experts praised DeepSeek's performance, with noted tech investor Marc Andreessen writing\u00a0on X on Jan. 24, \"DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen \u2014 and as open source, a profound gift to the world.\"",
      "David Sacks, a venture capitalist named by Mr. Trump to help oversee AI and cryptocurrency policy, said on social media Monday that DeepSee's app \"shows that the AI race will be very competitive.\"",
      "However, Ives said he's skeptical the service will gain ground with major U.S. businesses.",
      "\"No U.S. Global 2000 is going to use a Chinese startup DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases,\" Ives wrote. \"At the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia.\"",
      "Are there privacy issues with DeepSeek?",
      "Some experts are raising concerns about the personal data that DeepSeek is collecting, given that the company stores data from users \u2014 including their date of birth, keystrokes, text or audio inputs, uploaded files, chat history and other data \u2014 on servers located in China, according to its privacy policy.",
      "That echoes some of the issues raised with TikTok, another company with Chinese ownership that sparked worries about the supposed risks its ties to China posed to national security. Last year, Congress passed a law\u00a0banning\u00a0 TikTok in the U.S. as long as it is under Chinese ownership, although that is now in flux after President Trump signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0directing the Justice Department to not enforce the ban for 75 days.",
      "What does DeepSeek mean for Nvidia and other tech companies?",
      "Wall Street is trying to assess the long-term impact of a low-cost AI tool from China that rivals ChatGPT and other so-called generative AI apps. It also raises questions about whether Silicon Valley is overspending on tech advancements in the AI sector, noted Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, in an email.",
      "\"The fact that this technology is supposed to take less energy and is more cost-effective than U.S.-based models has U.S. technology investors very concerned,\" Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, said.",
      "It's also unclear what type of pushback or reaction could come from the White House, given that Mr. Trump has raised the possibility of placing new tariffs on Chinese imports, although he also gave the Chinese-owned TikTok a reprieve by ordering the Justice Department not to enforce a looming ban.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts think Monday's stock selloff is an overreaction, noting that the enormous demand for AI will continue lifting key players in the sector.",
      "\"It's one thing to train a [large language] model for less money, but accommodating the huge demand for the consumption of all this AI technology is still going to require massive amounts of infrastructure,\" Adam Crisafulli of VitalKnowledge said in a report.",
      "Analysts at Bernstein Research also noted that while DeepSeek's technology looks promising, it likely isn't revolutionary, suggesting that Monday's investment rout is overblown.",
      "What is Nvidia saying about DeepSeek?",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Nvidia offered praise for DeepSeek.",
      "\"DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of test-time scaling,\" the company said in an email. \"DeepSeek's work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export-control compliant.\"",
      "But, Nvidia added, AI inference, or using AI models to make decisions or predictions, \"requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.\"",

The Associated Press, whose style guidance many news organizations typically follow, said it will call the Gulf of Mexico by its original name while acknowledging the name Gulf of America. The AP will also refer to Denali as Mount McKinley, since Mr. Trump's position gives him authority to alter geographical names of places inside the country.",
      "The Gulf of Mexico first appeared on a world map roughly 400 years ago, as Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum pointed out during a briefing earlier this month where she derided what was at the time Mr. Trump's proposal to rename the ocean basin that shares near-equal lengths of coastline with her country and the U.S. Citing one of Mexico's founding documents that dates to the early 1800s and preceded the nation's constitution, Sheinbaum sarcastically suggested renaming North America \"Am\u00e9rica Mexicana,\" which translates to \"Mexican America.\"",
      "Denali's name comes from the Koyukon Indigenous residents of Alaska who are native to area around the mountain. Subject to dispute over the decades, the U.S. designated it Mount McKinley in the early 1900s to commemorate a slain president.

      "\"That's the $64 million question that needs to be answered,\" said Greg Feith, a former senior air safety investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board, in an interview with CBS News.",
      "The permitted flight ceiling on the Potomac River near Reagan National Airport is 200 feet \u2013 a crucial ceiling for keeping the heavy flow of military helicopters safely clear of the steady commercial aircraft traffic into and out of the nation's capital.",
      "Data from FlightRadar24, which tracks and records aircraft data for most flights across the U.S., showed the helicopter's last estimated altitude was about 400 feet when it crashed. The jet's altitude was about 375 to 400 feet, according to data from FlightAware and FlightRadar24.",
      "\"They're military pilots; they're familiar with the routes,\" Feith said. \"Why is it on this day, on that flight, they were [as much as] 150 to 200 feet higher than they knew they should be?\"",
      "Steven B. Wallace, a former director of accident investigations for the Federal Aviation Administration, told CBS News he believes investigators will direct attention to the altitude of the Black Hawk.",
      "\"I don't want to speculate on the cause, but I can speculate what's going through the mind of the investigators,\" Wallace said. \"I think that is very likely going to be the focus.\"",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said the investigation is examining if the aircraft was at the right altitude at the time. NTSB investigators have not so far disclosed the helicopter's altitude in their briefings, and said their working groups will evaluate \"pre-impact course and altitude.\"",
      "The Army helicopter's deviation above the flight ceiling is one of several similar near collisions involving helicopters at Reagan National that date back more than a decade.",
      "A near midair collision between an airplane and a helicopter in July 2015 occurred 400 feet off the ground on approach to the same runway being used in Wednesday's crash \u2013 Runway 33 \u2014 according to a CBS News Data Team review of anonymous reports to NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System.",

      "\"This occurred about 400 feet off the ground to the point where the pilot monitoring had to take the controls to make a correction in order to prevent it from becoming a midair collision,\" the 2015 report said.",
      "Two years earlier, in May of 2013, a pilot reported problems with a helicopter while circling to land on Runway 33. That is a shorter runway intended for smaller aircraft, like American Airlines 5342. Pilots who land there told CBS News they want to be at the \"floor,\" or lowest altitude during their approach because they need to hit the beginning of the runway to have maximum distance to stop.",
      "\"As we continued our approach; Tower instructed the helicopter to 'make a right 360 for a jet on a 2 mile final for Runway 33; and to report him in sight,\" the pilot wrote.",
      "\"The Tower then asked the helicopter if he had us in sight. He replied 'yes'; and the Tower told him to maintain visual separation,\" the report said. \"As we began our turn from base to final; the helicopter made what looked like a right turn directly into our flight path.\"",
      "The pilot reported having to execute a hard right turn and abort the approach to avoid a collision. \"I'm not sure how close we came to the helicopter since it was on the left side of the aircraft; but I would guess it was only a few hundred feet,\" the report said.",
      "CBS News' review of the NASA safety data identified at least nine near midair collisions at the airport since 2005, including three involving helicopters.",
      "Feith said he believes investigators from the NTSB and the military will be examining the altimeters in the helicopter to see if they malfunctioned, checking for any wind impact that could have hindered the pilot's ability to hold the helicopter at 200 feet, and exploring whether or not the crew should have been using night vision goggles.",
      "He said the flight recorders on both aircraft will be helpful in determining what happened. Authorities reported that they had been recovered from the Potomac River on Thursday.",

They're looking out of the aircraft as well, spotting any traffic that's nearby, conveying that information. So, the crew would be talking to each other while also listening to the air traffic controller.\"",
      "At the same time, the crew would also be \"listening to the air traffic controller talking to other aircraft, so that you have situational awareness of everything else that's going on,\" she said.",
      "The helicopter would have had a ceiling, what Duckworth referred to as a \"hard deck\" in the restricted area where the Black Hawk was flying.",
      "\"They're not allowed to go above 200 feet mean sea level,\" she said. \"So, they were flying pretty low above the Potomac River at the time, while looking up trying to spot out of this very busy night sky the landing airplane.\"",
      "Killion asked whether this was the kind of flight that would require night-vision goggles, or NVGs.",
      "\"My understanding is that they were not using NVGs,\" Duckworth replied. She said that in an area where there are a lot of lights, they're \"not as useful a tool,\" and are really more suited to \"a combat situation in the dark.\" Around the airport, \"with that much ambient light, they were on visual flight rules, and they were operating well within the parameters for which they have been trained, and the aircraft was designed to operate in,\" Duckworth said.",
      "She said the helicopter would have had its lights on, so the plane would have been able to see it. But airplanes that are coming in for a landing have the right of way.",
      "\"They would have been looking towards the runway and landing on the runway,\" she said. \"That's the job of the crew within the American Airlines Flight \u2026 they were on a short final to land.\"",
      "\"I'm sure they would have been looking out, but they don't have the same visibility in that aircraft \u2014 looking out those two little windows that they have \u2014 as the helicopter would have had, with plexiglass.\" She explained that the helicopter crew \"would have been basically sitting in a plexiglass bubble in the Black Hawk with plexiglass above your head, underneath your feet and out the two sides.\"",
      "\"So the helicopter \u2014 they would have had a better visual command than the American Airlines Flight, which was landing, looking to the runway,\" Duckworth said.",
      "Asked about Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's description of the collision as an \"elevation\" issue, and President Trump's suggestion that the helicopter could have gone up or down to get out of the way of the plane, Duckworth responded, \"We have to let NTSB and FAA do their jobs \u2026 Neither the president nor Mr. Hegseth are pilots, as far as I know, and I think that amateur speculation is not what is needed at this point.\"",

    "summary": "Dick Button, winner of two Olympic gold medals and five consecutive world championships, has died at the age of 95.",
    "story": [
      "Dick Button was more than the most accomplished men's figure skater in history. He was one of his sport's greatest innovators and promoters.",
      "Button, winner of two Olympic gold medals and five consecutive world championships, died Thursday, said his son, Edward, who did not provide a cause. He was 95.",
      "As an entrepreneur and broadcaster, Button promoted skating and its athletes, transforming a niche sport into the showpiece of every Winter Olympics.",
      "\"Dick was one of the most important figures in our sport,\" Scott Hamilton said. \"There wasn't a skater after Dick who wasn't helped by him in some way.\"",
      "Button's impact began after World War II. He was the first U.S. men's champion \u2014 and his country's youngest at age 16 \u2014 when that competition returned in 1946. Two years later, he took the title at the St. Moritz Olympics, competing outdoors. He performed the first double axel in any competition and became the first American to win the men's event.",
      "According to the Philadelphia Skating Club and Humane Society, Button was a member from 1946-1952. Button is now in the club's Hall of Fame.",
      "\"By the way, that jump had a cheat on it,\" Button told the U.S. Olympic Committee website. \"But listen, I did it and that was what counted.\"",
      "That began his dominance of international skating, and U.S. amateur sports. He was the first figure skater to win the prestigious Sullivan Award in 1949 \u2014 no other figure skater won it until Michelle Kwan in 2001.",
      "In 1952, while a Harvard student, he won a second gold at the Oslo Games, making more history with the first triple jump (a loop) in competition. Soon after, he won a fifth world title, then gave up his eligibility as an amateur. All Olympic sports were subject to an amateur/professional division at the time.",
      "\"I had achieved everything I could have dreamed of doing as a skater,\" said Button, who earned a law degree from Harvard in 1956. \"I was able to enjoy the Ice Capades (show) and keep my hand in skating, and that was very important to me.\"",
      "With the Emmy Award-winning Button as the TV analyst, viewers got to learn not only the basics but the nuances of a sport foreign to many as he frankly broke down the performances. He became as much a fixture on ABC's \"Wide World of Sports\" as Jim McKay and the hapless ski jumper tumbling down the slope.",
      "\"Dick Button is the custodian of the history of figure skating and its quintessential voice,\" 1988 Olympic champion Brian Boitano said in Button's autobiography. \"He made the words 'lutz' and 'salchow' part of our everyday vocabulary.\"",
      "After a 1961 plane crash killed the entire U.S. figure skating team on the way to the world championships, which then were canceled, Button persuaded ABC Sports executive Roone Arledge to televise the 1962 event on \"Wide World.\" That's when he joined the network as a commentator.",
      "Button's death coincided with another tragedy in the skating world, Wednesday night's crash of an American Airlines flight that collided with an Army helicopter and plummeted into the Potomac River outside Washington, D.C., killing everyone on board. Two teenage figure skaters, their mothers, and two former world champions who were coaching at the Skating Club of Boston were among the 14 people killed from the skating community.",
      "Button skated for the Boston club and remained close to it for the rest of his life. The trophy room at the club is named in his honor.",
      "He also provided opportunities for skaters to make money after their competitive careers. He ran professional events he created for TV for years, attracting many top names in the sport \u2014 Hamilton, Torvill and Dean, Kristi Yamaguchi, Kurt Browning and Katarina Witt.",
      "Button's Candid Productions, formed 1959, also produced such made-for-TV programs as \"Battle of the Network Stars.\" He also dabbled in acting, but the rink was his realm.",
      "\"Dick Button created an open and honest space in figure skating broadcasting where no topic or moment was off-limits,\" said Johnny Weir, the three-time U.S. champion and current NBC Sports figure skating analyst. \"He told it like it was, even when his opinion wasn't a popular one. His zingers were always in my mind when I would perform for him, and I wanted to make him as happy and proud as I would my coaches.",
      "\"I think that is something very special about commentating figure skating. As an athlete, we rarely have an opportunity to speak, and we rely on the TV voices to tell our story for us. Nobody could do it like Mr. Button.\"",

    "summary": "Initiatives aimed at expanding the workforce existed under President Trump's first term, including a program that aimed to recruit and train qualified individuals with disabilities, including veterans, for careers in air traffic operations.",
    "story": [
      "In a Thursday press briefing, President Trump criticized his predecessor for his management of the Federal Aviation Administration and suggested, without evidence, that diversity initiatives at the agency could be to blame for a deadly crash between a passenger plane and an Army helicopter in Washington, D.C.",
      "\"I put safety first. Obama, Biden and the Democrats put policy first,\" Mr. Trump said. \"The FAA's website states they include hearing, vision, missing extremities, partial paralysis, complete paralysis, epilepsy, severe intellectual disability, psychiatric disability, and dwarfism.\" Mr. Trump added that people in those categories would be \"qualified\" for controller positions, even though the agency's statement does not say that.",
      "The president continued, \"Brilliant people have to be in those positions.\"",
      "It has been longstanding FAA policy \u2014 including before, during and after Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 to include people with disabilities in recruitment. However, there is no evidence that these initiatives have compromised air safety or had any relation to the crash Wednesday night. The cause of the collision remains under investigation.",
      "Air traffic controllers must undergo extensive training and meet rigorous standards, including physical and mental fitness tests. They cannot have a history of mental disorders or physical conditions that could interfere with their duties, according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which is the chief human resources agency for the federal government.",
      "Before Mr. Trump took office last week, there was a \"Diversity and Inclusion\" page on the FAA's website, which stated the FAA had a \"special emphasis in recruiting and hiring\" people with the list of disabilities Trump cited.",
      "The FAA has a range of roles beyond air traffic controllers, and its website does not indicate that these hires would be eligible for air traffic controller positions.",
      "Additionally, the policy has been on the FAA's website since at least February 2013, including throughout Trump's first term. The policy page was recently removed from the website, archives show.",
      "The head of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, which is the controllers' union, said in a letter to its members that at this time it would be \"premature to speculate on the root cause of this accident.\"",
      "Federal investigators have also said it is too early to determine the cause or what factors may have contributed to the crash. It was the first major commercial airline crash in the United States since 2009.",
      "When asked by a reporter how he could come to the conclusion that diversity had something to do with the crash, Mr. Trump replied, \"Because I have common sense.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was also asked why the \"Diversity and Inclusion\" policy was not changed on the FAA's website throughout his first administration. He said, \"I did change it. I changed the Obama policy, and we had a very good policy. And then Biden came in and he changed it.\" It's unclear precisely what policy he was referring to.",
      "Records show that initiatives aimed at expanding the workforce existed under President Trump's first term, including a program launched in 2019 that aimed to recruit and train qualified individuals with disabilities, including veterans, for careers in air traffic operations.",
      "This month, President Trump signed\u00a0a memorandum titled \"Keeping Americans Safe in Aviation\" which directed the FAA to end all diversity, equity and inclusion or DEI initiatives. He issued similar orders across the federal government.",
      "In response to Mr. Trump's claims on Thursday, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a post on X, \"As families grieve, Trump should be leading, not lying. We put safety first, drove down close calls, grew Air Traffic Control, and had zero commercial airline crash fatalities out of millions of flights on our watch.\"",
      "Nick Daniels, the head of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said, \"America's highly trained and skilled air traffic controllers all do amazing work every day keeping the nation's passengers and cargo moving safely and efficiently to their destinations.

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 19:44:42 -0500",
    "summary": "Less than two weeks into his second term, President Trump may be poised to deploy steep tariffs against key U.S. trading partners.",
    "story": [
      "On the day of his inauguration, President Trump threatened steep new tariffs against key U.S. trading partners. Now he may be primed to deliver.",
      "Mr. Trump said Jan. 20 that he could announce 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1, while China could face a 10% duty. Economists have warned that stiff tariffs\u00a0could reawaken inflation on a range of consumer goods and slow economic growth. Here's what experts have to say.",
      "Why is Trump threatening to hit countries with tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump has threatened tariffs against multiple nations for a range of reasons. He said he is specifically\u00a0targeting Canada, Mexico\u00a0and China with tariffs to compel them to take action to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S.",
      "Before Mr. Trump returned to power, he also had threatened tariffs of up to\u00a060% on Chinese goods\u00a0imported into the U.S., a measure experts say is intended to advance American interests in negotiating better trade terms with Beijing, as well as throttle the illegal entry of fentanyl into the country.",
      "In a show of how his administration uses tariff threats to pressure countries on other issues, Mr. Trump last week proposed potential 25% levies against Colombia unless it agreed to receive deportations of unauthorized immigrants. Colombia ultimately agreed to receive the immigrants,\u00a0and the tariffs were withheld.",
      "Colombia's about-face suggests that Canada and Mexico could also reach agreement with the U.S. and avert a painful trade war. To that end, Howard Lutnick, Mr. Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, said at his confirmation hearing Wednesday that Canada and Mexico could avoid tariffs by closing their borders to fentanyl.",
      "\"As far as I know, they are acting swiftly, and if they execute it, there will be no tariff,\" Lutnick told senators.",
      "Even so, Mr. Trump's brandishing of potential tariffs \u2014 even if they are never imposed \u2014 highlights his willingness to use tough trade measures to punish even the country's closest allies unless they make concessions.",
      "\"As we have previously noted, trade policy will be transactional over the next four years with protectionist measures used to extort trade, immigration and other political concessions,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said in a research note.",
      "What exactly is Trump planning?",
      "Rather than targeting individual countries, the Trump administration could also opt to impose a blanket tariff on a range of countries in Asia, South America, Europe and other regions, experts say. But it remains unclear what tariffs could be deployed, how they might be structured and the possible timeline for deploying them.",
      "\"I think we have to proceed on the assumption that some kinds of tariffs are going to be imposed on the United States' major trading partners,\" Brett House, professor of economics at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"In the end, there is a lot that gets announced by the president on social media that does not come to pass. I don't take it as bluffing, so much as a storm of possibilities, and it's hard to tell which bit of that storm is going to be pursued most aggressively, and most immediately.\"",
      "What's clear, by contrast, is that the new administration is picking up where Mr. Trump left off in his first term in using trade policy as an instrument of both economic and foreign policy. That is likely to lead to a period of uncertainty and volatility, said John Lash, group vice president of product strategy at supply-chain software firm E2open.",
      "\"A lot of alternatives are still possible,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch in an interview. \"We don't know, but game theory would suggest the president would implement tariffs in some form against Mexico and Canada \u2014 not blanket tariffs, but on a select number of imports from both nations... because otherwise his bluff is going to be called.\"",
      "On how soon any tariffs could take effect, Daco notes that Mr. Trump could move quickly by claiming authority under a 1977 law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.",
      "\"When he said he'll impose tariffs on Feb. 1, it is still an open question as to what means would be used. Do you want to implement tariffs immediately, as threatened against Colombia over the weekend, or are you threatening with a deadline to obtain concessions?,\" Daco said.",
      "Would the U.S. face retaliation?",
      "Almost certainly, economists say. If Trump officials move ahead with tariffs on its northern neighbor, \"We anticipate Canada would then respond in kind by also implementing a 25% across-the-board tariff on U.S. imports,\" Satyam Panday, chief U.S. and Canada economist with S&P Global Ratings, said in an email.",
      "Elijah Oliveros-Rosen, chief emerging markets economist at S&P Global Ratings, predicted Mexico also would fire back with targeted tariffs. \"In the case of Mexico, we think it's very unlikely the government would place tariffs on U.S.-manufactured imports, given most are intermediate goods eventually exported to the U.S. Therefore, we expect the Mexican government could impose tariffs on agricultural and food imports, but not manufacturing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said that strengthening the U.S.' stance on trade issues will help protect American workers and lead to a resurgence of domestic manufacturing. Yet such policies could come at the cost of damaging critical relationships with other nations around the world, said Douglas Irwin, a U.S. trade policy expert and professor of economics at Dartmouth College.",
      "What is the risk to American consumers?",
      "Irwin and other economists say tariffs are all but certain to lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers. That's because companies that end up on the hook typically pass added costs along to consumers in order to protect their bottom lines.",
      "\"The notion this this administration has been adhering to is somewhat surprising \u2014 the idea that if you implement gradual tariffs over time, such as in 5% increments, that these are less inflationary,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This idea is misguided, because if you have incremental price increases month after month, if anything that leads to higher inflation expectations. It leads to higher inflation on a month-to-month basis.\"",
      "If Mr. Trump's tariffs are implemented in full, including a universal 10% tax on all goods, consumer price inflation could rise by between 3% and 4%, according to an analysis this week from Capital Economics. To be sure, analysts with the investment advisory firm expect Mr. Trump to stop short of imposing a blanket tariff and instead pick his targets.",
      "\"Nevertheless, imposing any of these suggested tariffs would generate a rebound in consumer price inflation this year, taking it further above target and making it harder for the Fed to resume loosening monetary policy,\" the firm said.",

      "The vote was 79-18. More than half of Senate Democrats joined all 53 Republicans in voting for Burgum.",
      "Burgum, 68, is an ultra-wealthy software industry entrepreneur who came from a small North Dakota farming community, where he worked at his family's grain elevator.",
      "He served two terms as governor of the oil-rich state and launched a presidential campaign in 2023, but dropped out months later and quickly endorsed Trump.",
      "Trump also picked Burgum to chair a new National Energy Council that's tasked with achieving American \"energy dominance.\" He would have a seat on the National Security Council \u2014 a first for the interior secretary.",
      "His directive from Mr. Trump is to make it even easier for energy companies to tap fossil fuel resources, including from public lands. That raised alarms among environmentalists and some Democrats as greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels bake the planet.",
      "Burgum eagerly assisted the energy industry during his time as governor, when he was also profiting from the lease of family land to oil companies, according to records obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "During his confirmation hearing, Burgum said the U.S. can use energy development as leverage to promote peace and to lower consumer costs.",
      "He raised concerns about the reliability of renewable power sources promoted under former President Joe Biden, and said the U.S. needs to generate more electricity from sources such as coal and nuclear that can run constantly.",
      "Democrats in response accused the Trump administration of abandoning an \"all of the above\" energy policy to favor fossil fuels.",
      "\"They said wind is dead on the offshore. They are trying to do as much of this as possible to create demand for coal, for fossil gas,\" Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz said during a Thursday floor speech.",

      "\"He's going to take the common-sense action of unlocking our lands for oil and for gas production,\" Barrasso said. He added that more than 600,000 acres of land in Wyoming have been approved for energy production but were not offered for development by the Biden administration.",
      "The U.S. currently produces more crude oil than any nation in history, according to the Energy Information Administration. More cost-effective technology in recent decades drove drilling booms in states including New Mexico, Texas and North Dakota, where vast expanses of rural farmland have been industrialized by oil and gas companies.",
      "The booms brought billions of dollars in tax revenue to state and federal governments. But burning those fuels is also unleashing immense volumes of carbon dioxide that scientists say is warming the planet.",
      "The Interior Department has jurisdiction over a half-billion acres of federal land and vast areas offshore. Those areas produce about one-quarter of U.S. oil annually.",
      "The interior secretary also oversees the National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management and other subagencies.",
      "Burgum succeeds Deb Haaland, who under Biden sharply scaled back oil and gas sales and promoted solar and wind projects on federal lands.",

      "Burgum, during his hearing earlier this month before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee, suggested to lawmakers that carbon dioxide from fossil fuels could be captured to neutralize their contribution to global warming.",
      "Carbon-capture skeptics say the technology is untested at scale and allows the fossil-fuel industry to continue largely unchanged even as climate change becomes increasingly urgent.",
      "During Haaland's tenure at the Interior Department, officials also reversed actions taken during Trump's first term that weakened protections for imperiled species while making it easier for private developers to pursue projects on public lands.",

    "title": "Trump appoints new FAA administrator after vacancy during deadly plane crash",
    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 16:10:43 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump appointed Christopher Rocheleau, a 22-year FAA veteran, as acting administrator of the agency.",
    "story": [
      "As first responders searched the Potomac River Thursday following the nation's deadliest airline crash in nearly a quarter of a century, the agency tasked with regulating civilian air travel was without a Senate-approved head.",
      "President Trump moved Thursday, appointing Christopher Rocheleau, a 22-year FAA veteran, as acting administrator of the agency. Mr. Trump described\u00a0 Rocheleau as \"highly respected.\"",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration's most recent administrator, Michael Whitaker, resigned when President Trump took office last week. Whitaker held the job for 15 months, with the last few marred by criticism from prominent Trump supporter and now-White House official Elon Musk, who chafed at the agency's oversight of his company SpaceX.",
      "Mr. Trump formally appointed Rocheleau with a memo he signed in the Oval Office Thursday afternoon.",
      "\"He's a very capable guy,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Who is Christopher Rochelau?",
      "Rocheleau is in his third stint at the FAA. He was appointed by Mr. Trump as deputy administrator last week, and took on the title acting administrator Thursday morning, hours after an American Airlines jet with 64 people on board and an Army helicopter carrying three collided. Rocheleau most recently was chief operating officer of the National Business Aviation Association. Prior to that job, which he began in 2022, he was the FAA's deputy associate administrator for aviation safety. The U.S. Air Force veteran previously worked for the Transportation Security Administration.",
      "Why did Whitaker step down?",
      "Whitaker announced in December that he was stepping down. He was among many agency heads who stepped down as the new White House administration took shape, but did not publicly attribute his resignation to the incoming administration nor Elon Musk. The role of FAA administrator is a Senate-confirmed role, with a five year term. Whitaker was unanimously confirmed in October 2023, filling a role that had been run by acting administrators since March 2022,",
      "What did Musk say about Whitaker?",
      "Musk openly complained about Whitaker and the FAA, after the agency imposed $600,000 in fines on SpaceX related to missions launched with unapproved changes. Musk accused the agency of \"harassing SpaceX about nonsense.\" Musk posted on his social media site in September that Whitaker \"needs to resign.\"",
      "What is an acting administrator?",
      "Rocheleau will be the agency's fourth acting administrator since 2018, taking the helm of the agency without Senate confirmation. The last seven years have been a tumultuous time for the FAA, which faced criticism of its oversight after two Boeing crashes in 2018 and 2019, and later dealt with the rise in unruly passenger behavior amid and following COVID-19 era mask regulations, as well as airline staff shortages and technology glitches.",
      "What about the Transportation Secretary?",
      "Former Rep. Sean Duffy was sworn in as Secretary of Transportation on Tuesday, after being confirmed by the Senate in a 77-22 vote. The Department of Transportation includes the FAA. Duffy posted on social media Thursday that, \"I want the families of the victims to know that they have my word: I will not rest until you have the truth.\"",
      "\"I will find answers to how this happened. I have directed every relevant agency to immediately investigate what went wrong, and I will not tolerate delays or bureaucratic excuses,\" Duffy wrote. \"If there was negligence, incompetence, or failure anywhere in the system, we will find it\u2014and I will fix it.\"",

      "A Michigan priest had his license revoked by the Anglican Catholic Church after he mimicked a straight-arm gesture performed by Elon Musk\u00a0during a speech earlier this month that some have interpreted as a Nazi salute.",
      "Calvin Robinson, who is listed as the priest-in-charge of St. Paul's Anglican Catholic Church in Grand Rapids, Michigan, performed the gesture at the end of a Jan. 25 speech at the National Pro-Life Summit in Washington, D.C.",
      "On Wednesday, the Anglican Catholic Church posted a statement that said Robinson's \"license in this Church has been revoked\" after he made a \"gesture that many have interpreted as a pro-Nazi salute.\"",
      "\"While we cannot say what was in Mr. Robinson's heart when he did this, his action appears to have been an attempt to curry favor with certain elements of the American political right by provoking its opposition,\" the statement read. \"Mr. Robinson had been warned that online trolling and other such actions (whether in service of the left or right) are incompatible with a priestly vocation and was told to desist. Clearly, he has not, and as such, his license in this Church has been revoked. He is no longer serving as a priest in the ACC.",
      "\"Furthermore, we understand that this is not just an administrative matter. The Holocaust was an episode of unspeakable horror, enacted by a regime of evil men. We condemn Nazi ideology and anti-Semitism in all its forms. And we believe that those who mimic the Nazi salute, even as a joke or an attempt to troll their opponents, trivialize the horror of the Holocaust and diminish the sacrifice of those who fought against its perpetrators. Such actions are harmful, divisive, and contrary to the tenets of Christian charity.\"",
      "Musk's gesture that Robinson was mimicking came in a Jan. 20 speech during celebrations of Donald Trump's presidential inauguration. Musk slapped his hand on his chest, extended his arm straight out and up with his palm facing down and said, \"My heart goes out to you.\"",
      "At the close of Robinson's Jan. 25 speech, he quoted Musk, saying \"my heart goes out to you,\" before mimicking his straight-arm motion.",
      "In a statement posted to his Facebook page, Robinson said \"in case it needs saying: I am not a Nazi,\" and that the gesture was a \"joke.\"",

      "Pennsylvania state police said Wednesday that the gun used in the Vermont shooting was purchased by a person of interest in the Dec. 31, 2022, killings of Richard and Rita Zajko, who were shot to death in their Chester Heights home. Both Youngblut and the buyer were in frequent contact with someone who was detained as part of the Pennsylvania investigation and is a person of interest in another killing in California, U.S. Attorney Michael Drescher said in a court filing.",

      "Records reveal possible connections",
      "Meanwhile, more information has been discovered from police and court records.",
      "Jack LaSota is currently facing charges of obstructing law enforcement and disorderly conduct in Pennsylvania. Authorities won't say whether those charges are related to the Zajko deaths, but court records show that police were searching for a gun used in two killings when they arrested LaSota 12 days later at a hotel about 10 miles from the scene of the killings.",
      "LaSota also has connections to some of the key players in the California case.",
      "In 2019, LaSota and three others were arrested while protesting an event hosted by the Center for Applied Rationality at a camping retreat in Occidental, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. In 2022, two of the others, Emma Borhanian and Jeffrey Leatham, were accused of attacking their landlord with a sword in Vallejo. The landlord, Curtis Lind, survived the November 2022 attack but was stabbed to death Jan. 17.",
      "Maximilian Snyder was charged this week\u00a0with that killing. In November, someone with the same name applied for a marriage license with a Teresa Youngblut in Kirkland, Washington. Snyder's attorney declined to comment on the charges.",
      "LaSota may have been present during the 2022 landlord attack, according to court documents that also suggest LaSota had been falsely reported dead three months earlier.",
      "On Aug. 19, 2022, the U.S. Coast Guard responded to a report that LaSota had fallen out of a boat in San Francisco Bay and conducted a search but didn't find a body, according to documents included in a civil rights lawsuit LaSota and others had filed after their 2019 arrest. An obituary was published, and LaSota's mother confirmed the death to LaSota's criminal defense attorney. But months later, a prosecutor emailed the attorney and said LaSota was contacted by police in Vallejo and was \"alive and well\" at the site of a crime on or about Nov. 13, the date Lind was attacked.",
      "Jerold Friedman, who represented LaSota in the civil case, said Thursday that he verified the Coast Guard report at the time and that he doesn't recall the last time he was in contact with LaSota. The attorney who represented LaSota in the 2019 criminal case did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. A phone message was left at the office of the lawyer listed as representing him in the current Pennsylvania case.",
      "Though authorities have not publicly identified the person who bought the gun used in Vermont, the VTDigger news site reported that federal authorities issued an alert to firearms dealers seeking information about purchases made by Michelle Jacqueline Zajko and describing her as a person of interest in the Vermont shooting.",
      "According to a public records database, a Michelle Zajko was registered to vote in 2016 at the same home address in Pennsylvania as Richard and Rita Zajko.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump spoke in the White House press briefing room Thursday morning in the aftermath of the deadly\u00a0plane crash in the Potomac River in Washington, D.C., and sought to point blame for the tragedy on DEI initiatives and the Biden administration. The collision of a regional jet and a U.S. Army helicopter late Wednesday was the first major commercial plane crash in the U.S. in more than a decade.",
      "\"I speak to you this morning in an hour of anguish for our nation,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "He said the \"massive search and rescue operation\" that began overnight was \"leveraging every asset at our disposal,\" and that responders have done a \"phenomenal job.\"",
      "\"The work has now shifted to a recovery mission,\" he said. \"Sadly, there are no survivors.\"",
      "\"We are in mourning, this has really shaken a lot of people.\"",
      "The president pledged to support the families affected by the crash, saying \"we're all searching for answers.\"",
      "\"We do not know what led to this crash, but we have some very strong opinions and ideas,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We'll find out how this disaster occurred and we'll ensure that nothing like this ever happens again.\"",
      "The briefing comes after American Eagle Flight No. 5342, which took off from Wichita, Kansas, with 60 passengers and four crew members on board, collided Wednesday night with an Army Black Hawk helicopter carrying three soldiers near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.",
      "Mr. Trump said he was immediately appointing an acting commissioner to the Federal Aviation Administration, Christopher Rocheleau. Mr. Trump noted that the collision happened on a \"very clear night\" and that \"for some reason, adjustments weren't made.\"",
      "He criticized the Biden administration and attacked diversity initiatives, claiming that he had increased standards for those who work within aviation.",
      "\"I put safety first. Obama, Biden and the Democrats put policy first,\" Mr. Trump claimed.",
      "He took aim at what he claimed was an \"FAA diversity push includes focus on hiring people with severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities. That is amazing, and then it says FAA says people with severe disabilities are most underrepresented segment of the workforce, and they want them in, and they want them. They can be air traffic controllers. I don't think so,\" he said.",
      "\"Brilliant people have to be in those positions,\" he said. \"....And you need a very special talent, and a very special genius, to be able to do it.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, also at the briefing, seemed to suggest that hires made based under DEI policies played a role in the crash, but acknowledged it is not clear at this point in the investigation where fault may lie.",
      "Asked directly how he came to the conclusion that diversity had something to do with the crash, Mr. Trump replied, \"because I have common sense.\"",
      "The president's comments drew harsh criticism from the top Democrat in the Senate. \"It's one thing for internet pundits to spew off conspiracy theories, it's another for the president of the United States to throw out idle speculation as bodies are still being recovered and families still being notified,\" Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. \"It just turns your stomach.\"",
      "The president was joined at the briefing by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who was sworn in Wednesday. Duffy outlined the \"whole of government response\" to the crash so far, committing to \"get to the bottom of this investigation \u2014 not in three years, not in four years, but as quickly as possible.\"",
      "\"What happened yesterday shouldn't have happened. It should not have happened,\" Duffy said. \"And when Americans take off in airplanes, they should expect to land at their destination.\"",
      "Duffy said that the Transportation Department would not accept excuses and would take responsibility to implement reforms so that \"these mistakes do not happen again.\"",
      "Hegseth also spoke at the briefing, reiterating that the administration would determine what happened.",
      "Hegseth said the three soldiers aboard the Black Hawk were a young captain, a staff sergeant and a CW-2 chief warrant officer whom he said were on a \"routine annual retraining\" for a \"continuity of government\" mission.",
      "\"The military does dangerous things, it does routine things, on a regular basis,\" Hegseth said. \"Tragically last night a mistake was made.\"",
      "He acknowledged that there was \"some sort of an elevation issue\" that the Defense Department and Army have begun investigating.",
      "Hegseth pledged that the department will have \"the best and brightest in every position possible,\" and echoed Mr. Trump in taking a swipe at diversity, declaring, \"The era of DEI is gone at the Defense Department.\"",
      "Emergency crews continued their search efforts at the crash site Thursday morning. District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services Chief John Donnelly said at an earlier news briefing that 27 bodies had been recovered from the plane and one from the helicopter.",
      "The president's news conference lasted more than 30 minutes.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a statement Wednesday night that he had been fully briefed on the crash, and said, \"Thank you for the incredible work being done by our first responders.\"",

In the past, Target was known for its diversity initiatives and reputation for supporting diverse communities,\" said civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong. \"Now Target has shown its true face by deciding to roll back its focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion by putting profits and politics over people.\"",
      "Armstrong encouraged Minnesotans to start boycotting Target stores indefinitely starting Saturday, Feb. 1.",
      "\"We do not believe it is a coincidence that Target made this decision after the holiday shopping season and roughly one week before the start of Black History Month,\" said Monique Cullars-Doty, co-founder of Black Lives Matter Minnesota.",
      "Speakers at Thursday's event made two requests: for employees to speak up and for shoppers to shop elsewhere.",
      "The fact Target actually increased DEI efforts after George Floyd's murder is making the company's decision that much more unbelievable for people like Jaylani Hussein, spokesperson for CAIR-MN.",
      "\"If you would have told me in those summers and months to come here today, talking about Target reversing its decision, I would personally say I couldn't believe it,\" said Hussein. He speculated that Target would reverse course by the end of February, which is Black History Month.",
      "On the other side of the boycott, Black business owners like Tabitha Brown \u2014 who sells kitchenware and has had her products highlighted in Target stores under the company's previous DEI initiatives \u2014 said in an Instagram video that she understands the anger. However, she asked for those who may consider a boycott to reconsider.",
      "\"If we all decide to boycott and be like 'no we're not spending no money at these organizations,'\" said Brown. \"So many of us will be affected and our sales would drop our business would be hurt.\"",
      "\"We remain focused on driving our business by creating a sense of belonging for our team, guests and communities through a commitment to inclusion,\" Target said in its initial statement explaining the rollback. \"Belonging for all is an essential part of our team and culture, helping fuel consumer relevance and business results.\"",
      "The decision raised questions about the future of Target's philanthropic commitments.\u00a0 A company spokesperson told the Associated Press that the \"recent update does not impact Target Foundation giving\" but added that, \"as always, the foundation will continue to evaluate how it best supports organizations, coalitions and networks.\"",
      "Shortly after Target's announcement, Twin Cities Pride, a longtime partner, said the company would not be welcome at this year's Pride celebration and renounced $50,000 in funding. Less than 24 hours later, Twin Cities Pride said community donations had filled the gap.",

    "summary": "With tax season underway, here's what you need to know about tracking your tax refund and your new 2025 tax brackets.",
    "story": [
      "Tax season is now underway, with the IRS accepting returns for all taxpayers as of Jan. 27. That's prompting many people to turn to the \"Where's my refund?\" app from the tax agency to track when they'll get their check.",
      "Americans are expected to file about 140 million returns before the April 15 deadline. Last year, about two-thirds of taxpayers got a refund, with the average check at about $3,100,\u00a0according\u00a0to IRS data.",
      "A household's tax refund may represent their biggest check for the entire year, with many consumers planning to use the money for debt repayment, emergency savings or a big purchase. To be sure, while a large refund may feel like a financial windfall, it actually represents income that taxpayers have overpaid to the IRS throughout the year.",
      "That's why some financial experts describe refund checks as tax-free loans to the U.S. government. Yet other experts note that tax refunds can act as a form of forced savings that a household might not otherwise be able to accomplish, allowing those taxpayers to reap the benefit in their annual refund.",
      "Whatever the case might be, tracking your refund can be done through the IRS' \"Where's my refund\" app, which the agency has sought to improve over the last few years. Here's what to know.",
      "How does \"Where's my refund?\" work?",
      "The IRS operates the \"Where's my refund?\" service on its website, but taxpayers can also use a mobile app called IRS2Go\u00a0on their phones or other devices. Both services will provide information about your 2024 return about 24 hours after you e-file, the IRS says.",
      "However, people who file paper returns will need to wait about 4 weeks for their information to appear on \"Where's my refund?\" or the IRS2Go app.",

      "The IRS tracking services will then show you information on whether the agency has received your tax return, if the refund has been approved and when the money is scheduled to land in your account.",
      "When will I get my tax refund?",
      "That depends on whether you've file electronically or sent in a paper tax return, as well as if the IRS identifies any problems with your return.",
      "People who e-filed their returns typically receive their refunds in less than 21 days. In other words, a taxpayer who filed their 1040 on Jan. 27 could receive their payment by Feb. 17, if all goes smoothly.",

      "What can delay your tax refund?",
      "Filing a paper return can delay your refund because it requires IRS employees to process them, which takes more time than e-filed returns, which are largely handled by computers.",
      "Claiming either the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) can also slow down a tax refund. That's because, by law, the IRS can't issue refunds for returns that have claimed those tax credits before mid-February.",
      "\"The IRS expects most EITC/ACTC-related refunds to be available in taxpayer bank accounts or on debit cards by March 3 if they chose direct deposit and there are no other issues with their tax return,\" the agency said on Monday.",
      "Some issues can also trip up tax refunds, such as if there are math errors on your return, missing or incorrect Social Security numbers or misspelled names, according to the IRS. While these might be innocent mistakes, it can cause the IRS to flag your return and delay your refund.",
      "What's my new 2025 tax bracket?",
      "The IRS has set new tax brackets for 2025, but that won't impact the return you'll file by April 15, since that 1040 reflects your 2024 income and taxes.",
      "Each year, the IRS adjusts its tax brackets and dozens of other provisions to account for inflation. The idea is to shield taxpayers from \"bracket creep\" \u2014 when workers are pushed into higher tax bands due to the impact of cost-of-living adjustments aimed at offsetting inflation \u2014 without a change in their standard of living.",
      "This year's tax brackets are adjusted 2.8% higher from 2024, representing the smallest jump in several years. Because inflation jumped during the pandemic, the bracket adjustments reached 7% in 2023\u00a0and\u00a05.4% in 2024.",

      "Tel Aviv \u2014\u00a0Three more Israeli hostages \u2014 two females and an 80-year-old man \u2014 were released in Gaza Thursday as the third hostages-for-prisoners swap agreed to by\u00a0Israel and Hamas\u00a0got underway, but the chaotic nature of the handover of two of the Israelis angered Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the extent that he delayed his country's part of the exchange until later in the day.",
      "Israel did start releasing Palestinian detainees from the Ofer Prison in the occupied West Bank later Thursday, keeping to its part of the third exchange amid the ongoing ceasefire. Buses carrying the what was expected to be 110 prisoners freed on Thursday were seen leaving the prison about two hours after Netanyahu's spokesman said he had \"instructed to delay the release of the terrorists scheduled to be released today \u2014 until the safe exit of our hostages is guaranteed in the next few days.\"",
      "Netanyahu's office released a subsequent statement saying that, following his demand, ceasefire mediators had \"passed a commitment according to which a safe exit will be guaranteed for our abductees who will be released in the next installments. Israel insists that lessons will be learned and that in future times there will be extra care to return our abductees safely.\"",
      "There were some Palestinians among those being released Thursday who had been accused and, in some cases, convicted of serious crimes against Israelis, including murder. Most of the prisoners were being released and allowed to remain in the West Bank, but some were being sent to third countries, according to Israeli officials.",
      "The Israeli military confirmed that five Thai nationals were also released Thursday by militants in Gaza, as had been expected, as part of a separate agreement.",
      "The first Israeli released early Thursday was female soldier Agam Berger, 20. She was handed over in a relatively orderly fashion amid the ruins of the Jabalia Refugee Camp in northern Gaza. Berger was the final hostage from an unarmed, all-female Israeli military unit that had been working to surveil Gaza.",
      "Seven women from Berger's unit were taken hostage during Hamas' Oct. 7 2023 attack on Israel, which saw militants kill about 1,200 people and take a total of 251 others hostage.",
      "Israel's military response to the attack has killed more than 47,300 people, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, and decimated the Palestinian territory, displacing virtually all of its population and causing a wide scale humanitarian crisis.",
      "Berger was escorted by militants out of the back of a destroyed building in Jabalia. Wearing an outfit that resembled green military fatigues, she was handed over to members of the Red Cross. Photos shared later by the Israeli military showed her reunited with her parents.",
      "Two other Israeli hostages released Thursday were Arbel Yehoud, 29, and Gadi Moses, 80, who was the oldest of the hostages. All three of the freed hostages had been transferred from Red Cross care to Israeli forces on Thursday, the Israel Defense Forces confirmed.",
      "In a joint statement, the IDF and the Israeli Security Agency said Yehoud and Moses, along with the Thai nationals, had \"crossed the border into Israeli territory\" and were on their way to a reception point in southern Israel. The statement said Yehoud and Moses would be reunited with their families there, as Berger was earlier, while the five Thai nationals would be met by officials from Thailand's government.",
      "Video showed Yehoud being transferred to the Red Cross, more than an hour after Berger's release, in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis amid scenes of mayhem. Yehoud and Moses had been held by the militant group Islamic Jihad, which is allied with Hamas.",
      "A huge crowd had gathered in Khan Younis to witness the handover, which took place near the home of deceased Hamas commander Yahya Sinwar. Dozens of armed militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad paraded through the area and the handover of the prisoners was chaotic, with armed militants, photographers and civilians crowding around the hostages as they were moved to the waiting Red Cross vehicles.",
      "Netanyahu released a statement condemning the \"shocking scenes,\" calling the crush of people around the hostages \"another proof of the unimaginable cruelty of the terrorist organization Hamas.\"",
      "\"I demand from the mediators to make sure that such threats will not happen again, and to guarantee the safety of our abductees,\" said Netanyahu.",
      "In its own statement posted online, Hamas called the large crowds, \"a message of determination and defiance raised in the face of this barbaric occupier. It says our people will remain on their land, and are determined to accomplish their project of liberation, return, and self-determination.\"",
      "Hamas did not immediately react to Netanyahu's order to delay the release of 110 Palestinians from Israeli prisons.",
      "Netanyahu's order marked the second delay in the hostage and prisoner swap process laid out by the ceasefire agreement that the Israeli leader blamed on Hamas.",
      "Under to the terms of the deal, Yehoud should have been among the four women released during the second exchange, on Jan. 24. After that release last weekend, the terms of the agreement stipulated that Israel would release a number of Palestinian prisoners from jails and allow Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza, across the Netzarim Corridor, which divides the north and south of the enclave.",
      "When Yehoud wasn't among those released last weekend, Israel said it would not allow Palestinians to cross the Netzarim Corridor. After a quick negotiation process, Hamas agreed to carry out Thursday's previously unscheduled hostage release, to include Yehoud.",
      "In anticipation of the release and according to the new agreement, Israel started allowing Palestinians to cross the Netzarim Corridor into northern Gaza on Monday.",
      "Tens of thousands of people have made their way back to the north, most of them on foot, some finding the ruins of their homes and the remains of loved ones, but also reuniting with family members they haven't been able to see in months.",

      "Mario Poceski, a professor of Buddhist studies and Chinese religions at the University of Florida who wrote about Lunar New Year celebrations in The Conversation last year, said holiday traditions typically involve cleaning and decorating the house, shopping for gifts and preparing food for family gatherings, like a traditional dinner held on the eve of the new year.",
      "\"Many of the dishes are assigned symbolic meanings,\" Poceski wrote. \"For instance, dumplings are given the shape of gold ingots to invoke good fortune.\"",
      "Exchanging red envelopes, which contain money, is another popular custom that's carried out each Lunar New Year. The envelopes' red color is featured prominently in decorations for the holiday and represents prosperity and good fortune, Poceski said, adding that older members of the family usually gift them to younger members.",
      "Parades, carnivals and gatherings featuring fireworks, dances and other cultural performances are often staples of Lunar New Year celebrations, as individual residences, shops and markets decorate with lanterns or dragons made from red paper in honor of the holiday.",

      "\"I had nothing to do with people not vaccinating in Samoa,\" he said in an interview\u00a0with documentary producer Scott Hamilton Kennedy. \"I never told anyone not to vaccinate.\"",
      "But some of Kennedy's critics assert he bears a measure of responsibility for the outbreak and that he leveraged the tragedy to promote false claims about the vaccine. Democrats have seized on the episode, even sponsoring advertising that calls out his visit.",
      "What happened in Samoa?",
      "Years before Kennedy trained his focus on vaccine issues in Samoa, the small Pacific island nation had been experiencing low vaccination rates. Medical professionals attributed this to a shortage of doctors and nurses as well as demographic shifts, with more people moving to cities and away from social structures that helped promote childhood vaccinations. By 2017, only about half of 1-year-old Samoan children were fully vaccinated \u2014 far below the 95% coverage needed to prevent community spread and a steep drop from earlier rates that had reportedly reached 90%.",
      "The situation took a tragic turn in July 2018 when two nurses mistakenly combined an expired muscle relaxant with MMR vaccine doses instead of sterile water, leading to the deaths of two children. The nurses were charged with manslaughter, and the government responded by suspending the national vaccination program for 10 months. Vaccination rates for children dropped to 31%.",
      "Naseri, the former Samoan health chief, told CBS News that the government had struggled to implement an effective vaccine program. He said the mishandling of the vaccine and its tragic consequences \"was the last straw.\"",
      "\"It created more hesitancy,\" Naseri said.",
      "Mistrust in vaccines spread across the island like a virus. At the time, even the prime minister issued a statement on Facebook alleging that his grandson had been injured by a vaccine. The temporary suspension of vaccinations corresponded with a growing distrust in modern medicine.",
      "\"I would rather treat them at home with old-fashioned herbal medicines than taking them to see a doctor,\" one mother told local reporters at the time. \"Since children died from these vaccines, I don't trust any medication from the hospital.\"",
      "Patricia Stinchfield, a nurse practitioner and past president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, said she had been monitoring the Samoan vaccine crisis even before the measles outbreak struck. She says the immunization rates had dropped so low the situation was \"a ticking time bomb.\"",
      "It was in the midst of that \"perfect storm,\" Stinchfield said, that Kennedy arrived in Samoa in the summer of 2019. Kennedy has said the purpose of his visit was to pitch a health surveillance system, and that the vaccination pause in 2018 was an opportunity to naturally study an unvaccinated population. His trip was coordinated by a local anti-vaccine advocate known for spreading medical misinformation online.",
      "Dr. Naseri told CBS News he met briefly with Kennedy but their conversation focused on environmental and vaccine safety issues.",
      "In August 2019, two months after Kenendy's visit, an infected traveler from New Zealand arrived in Samoa and the deadly measles virus began its spread. The government officially declared an outbreak on Oct. 16 and a month later declared a state of emergency.",
      "It wasn't until early December that the Samoan government conceded it had mishandled immunizations and launched an aggressive vaccination campaign, making the shots mandatory. Dr. Naseri said that delayed response may have contributed to the high infection and death rates. But finally, the country shut down for two days to allow health workers to vaccinate people at home, quickly achieving 90% coverage.",
      "Hundreds of medical professionals from around the world responded and traveled to Samoa to help with the vaccination efforts, including Hawaii's lieutenant governor, now Gov. Josh Green.",
      "\"The government needed the political will, and the international community backed us up,\" Naseri said.",
      "CBS News visited Samoa during that response and met one parent named Paulo Puelua, who said the measles outbreak took hold of his family in an instant, killing three of his five children. Their mother Fa'oso was so distraught that she had been sleeping on her children's grave, set up in the family's front yard according to Samoan tradition. She told CBS News she felt it was her only way to be close to them now.",
      "Looking back, officials told CBS News they believe the outbreak's high death toll resulted from multiple factors, including widespread malnutrition, reliance on traditional medicine, and an overwhelmed health care system. In rural Samoa, many families share a single sleeping space, making transmission easier, and nearly a quarter of the population lives in poverty, further complicating treatment.",
      "Controversy about RFK Jr.'s role",
      "Dr. Paul Offit is a vaccine specialist and co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine. He's also director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He's been a frequent critic of Kennedy's and believes the nominee for health secretary deserves harsh judgment for how the outbreak unfolded.",
      "Offit says Kennedy had been posting about the two deaths before it was understood what had happened, and blamed the MMR vaccine. When that turned out not to be the case, Kennedy did not correct that false assertion.",
      "\"If he was any kind of man, which he isn't, he should go back to Samoa and apologize to every one of the families where a child died,\" Offit said. \"He's a famous man who goes there and meets with anti-vaccine activists. He gives them credence by going there.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to Kennedy for comment through the organization he led until last month, Children's Health Defense, and did not receive a reply. The group has previously denied his visit played any role in the outbreak.",
      "In interviews, Samoan health officials told CBS News they believe Kennedy's actions were unlikely to have directly influenced what occurred.",
      "\"It is well documented that RFK Jnr's visit to Samoa in 2019 coincided with increased anti-vaccine sentiment, particularly among certain groups,\" Samoa's Ministry of Health said in a statement. \"However, there is no conclusive evidence that his visit directly contributed to the decline in vaccination rates or the subsequent measles outbreak.\"",
      "But in the midst of the island's state of emergency, Kennedy sent a letter to the Samoan prime minister suggesting a defective vaccine may have been responsible for causing infections \u2014 a theory that has been debunked.",
      "\"It is critical that the Samoan Health Ministry determine, scientifically, if the outbreak was caused by inadequate vaccine coverage or alternatively, by a defective vaccine,\" Kennedy wrote in the Nov. 19, 2019 letter. Kennedy's letter partly leans on an idea that appears to have originated from misinformation widely spread on social media during a 2014-2015 measles outbreak at Disneyland that inaccurately said that measles originating from the vaccine had been identified.",
      "Stinchfield says this is impossible based on the weakened nature of the virus in the vaccine. In very rare cases people may exhibit symptoms similar to those associated with measles but no cases have ever been documented of measles being spread as a result.",
      "After the Samoan infections, critics say Kennedy downplayed the outbreak's severity in blog posts and continued to suggest that the vaccine itself was responsible for the high death rate. He was joined by Del Bigtree, a prominent anti-vaccine activist and Kennedy ally, in pushing conspiracy theories surrounding the outbreak.",
      "Stinchfield says the claims they pushed remained unsupported by evidence. And eventually, the Samoan government stopped listening.",
      "Samoa has since achieved high vaccination rates and the World Health Organization says the country has reported no measles cases since 2020. However, vaccine hesitancy remains a challenge globally, with anti-vaccine activists continuing to spread fear and misinformation.",
      "Samoa's Health Ministry says it remains concerned about \"the global spread of vaccine misinformation and the potential consequences of RFK Jnr.'s influence, particularly if he assumes a leadership role in public health policy. The spread of anti-vaccine narratives has already contributed to outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases in multiple countries, reversing decades of progress in immunization efforts.\"",
      "Stinchfield said she believes misinformation spread by Kennedy and others \u2014 in Samoa, and during the years since \u2014 remains acutely dangerous.",
      "\"Their modus operandi is to take a little kernel of truth and spin it around and confuse people, spin it at a time where the fear is already so high,\" she said. \"That is disinformation, a weapon that will harm people, harm children.\"",

      "A soldier who went missing in action during an aquatic mission in World War II has been accounted for, military officials said Tuesday.",
      "U.S. Army Pfc. Robert L. Bryant, 23, was assigned to Company B, in the 4th Ranger Battalion, as part of a group known as Darby's Rangers, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said. The battalion was trained by Colonel William Darby, who also established a battalion that would later grow into the modern-day United States Army Rangers, the military said. The battalion was active in the Mediterranean Theater, which included Italy, northern Africa and the Middle East.",
      "Bryant was one of 170,000 Allied servicemen who f6participated in Operation AVALANCHE, when forces invaded Italy in a series of amphibious landings between Sept. 9 and Sept. 18, 1943. After making his way ashore, Bryant engaged in fighting near the Chiunzi Pass on the Sorrento Peninsula, the DPAA said. On Sept. 23, he was reported missing in action after encountering a four-man patrol near Pietre, Italy.",
      "Bryant's body was not recovered, and German forces never reported him as a prisoner of war, the DPAA said. The War Department declared him non-recoverable on July 19, 1949. A formal telegram informed his parents he was killed in action, according to a local newspaper clipping shared by the DPAA. He was survived by his parents, five brothers and his wife, according to the clipping. He was awarded a posthumous Purple Heart, according to another news clipping. Bryant's name was recorded on the Walls of the Missing at the Sicily-Rome American Cemetery in Nettuno, Italy.",
      "After World War II, the American Graves Registration began working to recover missing American personnel from around the world. In 1947, investigators from the registration found remains in a cemetery in the Italian village of San Nicola. The remains were designated as X-152 Naples, and since the remains could not be associated with nearby casualties, they were interred under that name at the Sicily-Rome American Cemetery.",
      "In 2019, a DPAA historian studying American losses during Operation AVALANCHE compiled multiple records that showed Bryant was likely lost near where the X-152 remains had been discovered. In 2022, the remains were disinterred and sent to the DPAA laboratory for identification.",
      "Scientists with the DPAA used anthropological and dental analysis to study the remains. Mitochondrial DNA analysis and circumstantial evidence were also used to confirm the remains as Bryant's. Descendants of World War II Rangers Inc., Associazione Salerno 1943, and the staff of the National Archives at College Park also provided \"research assistance,\" the DPAA said.",
      "Bryant's surviving family members were informed of his identification. A rosette will be placed next to his name on the Walls of the Missing at the Sicily-Rome American Cemetery to indicate that he has been accounted for, the DPAA said, and he will be buried in April 2025.",

      "When a sleepy lion cub, resembling young Simba from the 2019 \"Lion King\" film, was presented to him in a gold-chained cage in front of thousands of guests who partied late into the night in the eastern megacity of Lahore, pictures spread rapidly online.",
      "Butt captioned a video of the event \"it's raining gifts,\" racking up nearly 10 million views. Faisal Mushtaq, an inspector from the Punjab provincial wildlife department, said authorities learned about the animal through social media.",
      "The cub was given to him by Umar Dolla, who runs another YouTube channel called Lion Hub, the BBC reported. Dolla claimed in court that he was still the animal's legal owner, but the judge ruled it had been seized by Butt, local media reported.",
      "The morning after the wedding, police raided his house, confiscated the cub and kept the newlywed in custody overnight. They said they found the lion cub roaming around the garage. Mushtaq described the animal as \"in a poor condition, as it was very cold.\"",

Nearly 300 of the Roman coins are silver denarii,\u00a0minted between 200 B.C. and 47 A.D. Some of those coins are stamped with unique portraits, including several of Julius Caesar and one with the face of Juba, the king of a Northern African region that is present-day Algeria, according to a news release from the National Museum of Antiquities in the Netherlands.",
      "Also found among the Roman coins were 72 gold aurei, dated from 18 B.C. to 47 A.D. Those coins show no signs of wear and likely came from a pile of freshly minted coins, according to the Cultural Heritage Agency.",
      "Several dozen other coins, made of an alloy of gold, silver and copper, come from what is now Great Britain and were stamped with the face of the Celtic king Cunobelinus, who reigned between 9 and 40 A.D. The king's name was also inscribed on the coins, known as \"staters.\"",
      "Roman soldiers returning home likely carried the coins from Britain to Bunnik, the agency said. The British coins may have been spoils of war, while the Roman coins were likely being carried as currency. They may have been buried to hide them temporarily, or as an offering to the gods, possibly as \"an expression of gratitude to the gods for a safe return from battle,\" the agency said.",
      "The Cultural Heritage Agency said the find shows the importance of the Lower Germanic limes, or a series of fortification points along the border between the Roman Empire's Germanic provinces. The limes existed from 83 to about 260 A.D., according to the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, and separated the empire from Germanic tribes. The coins show that Roman troops returning from Britain used these points as a route to return home.",
      "Three hundred and eighty-one of the 404 coins were purchased by the National Museum of Antiquities. The coins can now be viewed as part of a permanent exhibition at the National Archaeology Collection, the agency said.",

    "summary": "Lawmakers and experts say China's DeepSeek AI app could expose U.S. users to risks and promote censorship.",
    "story": [
      "As Chinese AI application DeepSeek attracts hordes of American users, Trump administration officials, lawmakers and cybersecurity experts are expressing concern that the technology could pose a threat to U.S. national security.",
      "DeepSeek's introduction in the U.S. on Monday saw it quickly become the most downloaded free application in the country on Apple's app store. The rollout also rocked Wall Street as investors struggled to compute the sudden appearance of a low-cost, open-source generative AI tool able to compete with leading artificial intelligence apps such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Shares of Nvidia, the U.S. manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, plummeted 17%, chopping roughly $600 billion off its market value \u2014 a record single-day drop for a U.S. stock.",
      "That explosive debut was branded a \"wake-up call\" by President Trump on Monday. Addressing reporters on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the National Security Council (NSC) would examine the potential national security implications around DeepSeek's launch, noting that the administration would seek to \"ensure American AI dominance.\"",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "Some lawmakers also weighed in with concerns about the application's access to U.S. users.",
      "\"The U.S. cannot allow Chinese Communist Party models such as DeepSeek to risk our national security and leverage our technology to advance their AI ambitions,\" Rep. John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said Tuesday in a statement shared on social media. \"We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek's AI infrastructure.\"",
      "The spotlight on DeepSeek comes amid rising tensions over trade, technology and other issues between the two superpowers. The U.S. has already imposed significant export controls on China in an effort to rein in Beijing's production of semiconductors used in developing advanced AI, with the most recent curbs coming in\u00a0December.",
      "\"At the President's direction, the NSC and others in the U.S. government work in many ways to address concerns involving AI, China and data security,\" agency spokesperson Brian Hughes told CBS News in an email. \"As the President has underscored, U.S. policy is to ensure that the United States leads the world in AI.\"",
      "Security threat for users",
      "While the calls from Moolenaar could be the first inkling of a possible congressional crackdown, Ross Burley \u2014 a co-founder of the nonprofit Centre for Information Resilience \u2014 warned that DeepSeek's emergence in the U.S. raises data security and privacy issues for users. Chinese law grants Beijing broad authority to access data from companies based in China.",
      "\"More and more people will use it, and that will open the door to more and more personal data just being given away to the [Chinese Communist Party] and being sent basically to mainland China to be able to inform them of their activities,\" Burley told CBS News.",
      "\"What they'll use it for is behavior change campaigns, disinformation campaigns, for really targeted messaging as to what Western audiences like, what they do,\" he added.",
      "DeepSeek, which is based in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, notes in its privacy policy that the personal information it collects from users is held \"on secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Under that\u00a0policy, the company says it collects information including users' \"device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, and system language.\" DeepSeek also collects \"service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs,\" according to the company.",
      "A key difference from TikTok",
      "The fact that DeepSeek's servers are based in mainland China differentiates it from TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform that Congress had sought to ban on national security grounds before President Trump signed an executive order last week directing the Justice Department to not enforce the law for a period of 75 days.",
      "In an effort to mitigate U.S. regulatory concerns, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in 2022 moved all of its U.S. data to infrastructure owned by American software maker Oracle.",
      "The legislation banning TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April \u2014 grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on tech platforms owned by countries regarded as U.S. adversaries.",
      "Under that law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content; has more than 1 million monthly active users; is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country; and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "But DeepSeek may be seen as less of a threat given that, unlike TikTok, it is an open-source large language model, according to Matt Sheehan, a China fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\"[A] lot of these open-source apps, open-source models, you can actually sort of use them directly on other platforms. Perplexity is a major U.S. AI company, and they're currently using a version of DeepSeek that you can use that doesn't have the data privacy or security threats,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Advancing censorship?",
      "One issue that DeepSeek users face outside of China: censorship. For example, a CBS News analysis of the application found that DeepSeek did not return any results for a prompt seeking information bout the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre in Beijing.",
      "Burley of the Centre for Information Resilience thinks such suppression of information on an app being downloaded by millions of users will pressure policymakers to act.",
      "\"I think it's incumbent on Western governments \u2014 the U.K., Canada, the U.S. \u2014 to look and see if it is wise for the Apple store and the Android store to host this large language model when it is so clearly being curated to push Chinese narratives and censorship,\" he said.",

It's like, yeah, I came across a dead bear and I thought, I'll eat it. No. I left it in the car. OK, hold on. Now, what do I do with it?

And I think this will be the first time in a long time, at least in the course of my adult life, we have a person who is running HHS, the Department of Health and Human Services, that actually wants to make America healthy again. And that's why I want him in this role. I don't believe that he can be corrupted, and I think that has been the root of America's healthcare crisis for decades,\" Michaels said.",

      "\"So, number one, start with the step goal. I asked for 10,000 steps a day and people are going, \u2018I have no time to do this.\u2019 So hold on and hear me out. I'll take 7,000 steps a day. And the answer is buying a walking pad for a few hundred bucks that you can fold up and put in the closet that has a little platform desk on it. And you can literally stand up, which burns one and a half times the calories of sitting. You can shuffle along at a snail's pace, which is what I do all day long. And over the course of your day, you will hit that step goal. And it doesn't matter if it's hailing cats and dogs outside, because it's an indoor opportunity to move your body while multitasking. So it's affordable, it's accessible, and you can do it while you're doing your day job, right?\" Michaels continued.",

      "\"What I mean by that is if you're going to McDonald's, which of course I don't want you to do, but if you're going there, can you not buy the soda? Right. Can you get the friggin' grilled chicken sandwich instead of the Big Mac and the large fries? People understand that. Use common sense. Get the healthier option and cut half of it and take it home for later. This will save you money.",
      "\"Don't drink calories. How do we cut back on calories? Because we want to use common sense of food choices. Meaning we will remove some of this ultra-processed crap that isn't good for us and will eat less calories, which will help us maintain a healthy body weight.

      "\"Then I would say from there, wherever you can, grab your healthy habits and amplify them.

You should focus on that.",

You know, pick and choose. By all means, but if you can give me a step goal, you can stop drinking calories, you can use common sense with your food choices, and you can really do your best to prioritize your sleep\u2026 That's 90% of the battle.

His work in environmental law helped expose corporations poisoning our water, air, and food supply and his advocacy against Big Pharma's unchecked power made him a rare public figure willing to challenge billion-dollar interests that profit from human suffering.",

      "Michaels continued on X, formerly known as Twitter, \"The media doesn't want you to research these facts for yourself. They want you to accept their cartoon villain version of RFK Jr. without question. Who's panicking?

He killed two FBI agents. That he did, and he went to prison for it and should have. My question to you, though, is, do you think America's safer because President Trump issued these pardons to 1,600 of these criminal defendants, many of whom violently assaulted our police in the Capitol?\"",

      "3. Be cautious of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software: Scammers may use your compromised email or phone number to target you with\u00a0phishing attacks. Be wary of messages asking for personal information or containing suspicious links. To protect yourself, ensure strong antivirus software is installed on all your devices.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Monitor your accounts: Given the scope of this breach, regular monitoring of your bank accounts, credit card statements and other financial accounts is critical. Look for unauthorized transactions or suspicious activity and immediately report any issues to your bank or credit card provider.",
      "5. Recognize and report a Social Security scam:\u00a0If your Social Security number is exposed, you could become a target for related scams. Official communication regarding Social Security issues usually comes via mail, not phone calls or emails. Learn more about spotting and reporting scams by visiting the Social Security Administration\u2019s\u00a0scam information page.",
      "6. Invest in identity theft protection:\u00a0Data breaches happen every day, and most never make the headlines, but with an identity theft protection service, you\u2019ll be notified if and when you are affected. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",

      "2. Monitor your statements regularly: One of the best ways to catch credit card fraud early is to keep an eye on your statements. Review your transactions regularly to spot any unfamiliar charges. The sooner you notice something suspicious, the quicker you can report it to your credit card company and prevent further damage.",
      "3. Regularly check your credit report: In addition to monitoring your credit card statements, periodically review your credit report to catch any unauthorized accounts opened in your name.",
      "4. Use strong, unique passwords: Always use strong, unique passwords for your online accounts, especially those that store payment details. Avoid using easily guessable information, and consider using a\u00a0password manager to store and generate secure passwords. This reduces the chances of fraudsters accessing your accounts.",
      "5. Use credit card alerts:\u00a0Set up transaction alerts with your credit card company. This way, you\u2019ll receive a notification via email or text for every transaction made with your card.

If you need to make an online purchase while on the go, consider using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to encrypt your connection and keep your credit card details safe from hackers.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "7. Don't store credit card info on browsers and websites:\u00a0Storing your credit card information on browsers or websites can make it convenient, but it also exposes you to a higher risk of fraud. If your browser or the website\u2019s security gets compromised, hackers could gain access to your saved card details. To stay safe, avoid saving your credit card information and manually enter it each time you make a purchase. If a site offers to save your details for future use, think twice before accepting. It's better to take the extra step to enter your information each time, ensuring your data stays secure.",

      "9. Be wary of phishing attempts and have strong antivirus software: Be cautious of unsolicited emails, texts or phone calls asking for your credit card information. Legitimate companies typically don't request sensitive information through these channels.

    "summary": "Many apps unrelated to location still ask users for tracking permission, and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a lawsuit seeking to end this alleged practice by Allstate.",
    "story": [
      "It's easier than you think to check for tracking software on your device. Tech expert Kurt Knutsson offers you some tips to help stay secure.",
      "Nowadays, almost every app you download asks for location permissions, meaning it wants to track where you are and your movements. For an app like Google Maps, requesting location access makes perfect sense. It's also reasonable for apps like Uber or DoorDash, which rely on location for their services.",
      "However, many apps that have nothing to do with location still ask for it, and we often grant these permissions without thinking twice. When you give an app access to your location, that data is stored and, in some cases, might even be sold. According to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, this practice is not uncommon.",
      "A recent lawsuit filed by Paxton alleges that the insurance company Allstate collected and sold the location data of 45 million Americans' smartphones.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY THE LATEST & GREATEST AIRPODS PRO 2",
      "Illustration of a company tracking customer\u2019s data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Allstate was allegedly collecting and stealing data",
      "In a\u00a0press release, Paxton announced that he had sued Allstate and its subsidiary, Arity, for unlawfully collecting, using and selling data about the location and movements of Texans' cellphones. The data was gathered through secretly embedded software in mobile apps, such as Life360.\u00a0\"Allstate and other insurers then used the covertly obtained data to justify raising Texans\u2019 insurance rates,\" the press release stated.",
      "The insurance provider allegedly collected trillions of miles' worth of location data from more than 45 million Americans nationwide. The data was reportedly used to build the \"world\u2019s largest driving behavior database.\" When customers sought a quote or renewed their coverage, Allstate and other insurance companies allegedly used the database to justify raising car insurance premiums.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Paxton claims the actions violated the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act. The lawsuit alleges customers were not clearly informed their data was being collected and did not consent to the practice.",
      "\"Our investigation revealed that Allstate and Arity paid mobile apps millions of dollars to install Allstate\u2019s tracking software,\" said Paxton.\u00a0\"The personal data of millions of Americans was sold to insurance companies without their knowledge or consent in violation of the law. Texans deserve better and we will hold all these companies accountable.\"",
      "We reached out to Allstate and Arity for comments.

Last year, Paxton sued General Motors for allegedly collecting and selling the private driving data of more than 1.5 million Texans to insurance companies without their knowledge or consent. In addition to insurance companies, data brokers are frequent buyers of customer data. Critics say these brokers fail to adequately protect the information, leaving it vulnerable to hackers. Earlier this month,\u00a0hackers claimed to have breached Gravy Analytics, a major location data broker and the parent company of Venntel, which is known for selling smartphone location data to U.S. government agencies.",

      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "5 ways to stay safe from unwanted tracking",
      "1. Avoid installing the insurance company\u2019s app:\u00a0Many insurance companies encourage users to download their apps to \"simplify\" claims, payments or policy management. However, these apps often collect and track your location data under the guise of improving their services. If the app is not absolutely essential, manage your account through the company\u2019s website or contact customer service directly instead.",
      "2. Don\u2019t give location permissions unnecessarily:\u00a0When an app requests location access, ask yourself whether it genuinely needs this information to function. For example, a weather app may need approximate location data, but a flashlight app does not.\u00a0 Always choose \"Deny\" or \"Allow only while using the app\" unless absolutely necessary. Most modern devices also allow you to provide an approximate location rather than a precise one, which is a safer option when location access is unavoidable.",
      "3. Review and manage app permissions regularly:\u00a0Over time, you may forget which apps have been granted permissions. Regularly go through your device\u2019s app settings to check and adjust permissions. On most devices, you can access this under\u00a0settings >\u00a0privacy >\u00a0app permissions (specific steps vary by operating system). Revoke access for any apps that don\u2019t need it or seem suspicious.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Turn off location services when not in use:\u00a0Keep location services off when you don\u2019t need them. This reduces the chances of apps or devices tracking you passively in the background. For tasks like mapping or food delivery, turn location services on temporarily, then turn them off when you\u2019re done. For added security, avoid connecting to\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks, which can also be used to track your location indirectly.",
      "5. Use privacy-focused tools and apps: Invest in tools designed to safeguard your privacy. Virtual private networks (VPNs) can mask your location online and prevent unwanted tracking while browsing.\u00a0 VPNs will also protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "BEWARE OF ENCRYPTED PDFS AS THE LATEST TRICK TO DELIVER MALWARE TO YOU",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "If Allstate is indeed unlawfully collecting and selling people\u2019s location data, Attorney General Paxton is right to hold them accountable by filing a lawsuit. In an era where cybercriminals exploit every opportunity to scam individuals, companies that fail to protect customer data are unacceptable and should face consequences. Data has become the new oil, and everyone seems eager to exploit it \u2014 often at the expense of ordinary people. Businesses that prioritize profits over privacy erode trust and put consumers at risk, making it crucial to enforce strict accountability for such practices.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 22:45:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Investigators are beginning to explore how an American Airlines jet and Black Hawk Army helicopter collided over Reagan Washington National Airport.",
    "story": [
      "The skies on Wednesday night were clear. The pilots were in communication with air traffic control, and officials said American Eagle Flight 5342 was on a standard descent to the runway in the busy airspace above the nation\u2019s capital. Yet somehow, the passenger jet and an Army helicopter collided midair, bursting into flames and plunging into the Potomac River in the first major fatal commercial plane crash in the United States in 16 years.",
      "Federal investigators are now searching for answers in what is expected to be a lengthy process. A number of factors, both technological and human-driven, could have played a role in the deadly accident, aviation experts say, including whether multilayered systems designed to stop collisions functioned properly.",
      "\u201cEverything, unfortunately, lined up for this accident to happen,\u201d said Kenneth Byrnes, a pilot and chairman of the flight training department at Embry\u2011Riddle Aeronautical University.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board is leading the investigation, which will also involve the Federal Aviation Administration and the Army. The painstaking process will include the collection of evidence from the scene, reviews of radio traffic and data on aircraft flight paths, communications with air traffic controllers and interviews with those controllers. Such investigations can take a year or longer to reach a conclusion, and the NTSB is the only agency authorized to provide an official cause for the crash.",
      "\u201cWe look at the human, the machine and the environment,\u201d NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy told reporters Thursday. \u201cWe will look at all the humans that were involved in this accident. We will look at the aircraft. We will look at the helicopter. We will look at the environment in which they were operating in. That is standard.\u201d",
      "Officials cautioned that it is still too early to speculate about what led to the crash that killed all 64 on board the American Eagle jet and all three crew members on the Army Black Hawk helicopter.",
      "Aviation experts say that the focus for investigators will likely be on several elements, including an automated system that should have warned the plane\u2019s pilot that another aircraft was close by; the pilots\u2019 communications with air traffic controllers; and any visual obstructions that could have prevented the pilots from seeing each other. They will also investigate any missteps by the pilots, though two aviation experts told NBC News that there was nothing pointing in that direction.",
      "The disaster \u2014 the first major fatal commercial plane crash in the United States since 2009 \u2014 happened just before 9 p.m. ET Wednesday as the American Eagle jet, a regional aircraft owned by American Airlines, was descending into Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, where airline pilots routinely navigate tight and crowded airspace.",
      "While commercial jets have a safety system called the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System, or TCAS, that gives pilots verbal cues when they are in danger of colliding with another aircraft, most military helicopters are not equipped with the same technology, said Jimmie Cummings, a spokesperson for the Army Combat Readiness Center. He said the chopper in the crash did not have it.",
      "Regardless, there are limitations to TCAS. One is that the system reduces the number of alerts it issues as a plane descends in order to avoid false alarms from other aircraft on the ground. The American Eagle\u2019s last recorded altitude was at 375 feet, according to the aircraft tracking website FlightAware."

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 19:27:17 GMT",
    "summary": "Even though the investigation is ongoing and few details have been released, Trump quickly cast blame for the deadly midair collision that happened Wednesday night.",
    "story": [
      "Just 11 days into his presidency, Donald Trump has been confronted with a national tragedy that claimed dozens of lives after a passenger jet carrying 64 people collided midair with an Army helicopter in the Washington, D.C., region Wednesday night.",
      "His response bypassed the usual playbook that presidents typically follow after a tragedy, just as his campaign broke from political norms time and again.",
      "Without waiting for a full investigation \u2014 or a list of the victims \u2014 the president began pointing fingers and going on the attack. Rather than using it as a moment to forgo political combat and and focus on the victims, he took the opportunity to push his agenda against diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts.",
      "His approach moved attention away from recovery efforts, victims and the investigation into the crash to a debate over one of his biggest political targets. And while Trump faced criticism for his handling of the moment, it was in line with how he has eschewed the way traditional politicians operate.",
      "Trump quickly put out a social media post casting blame for the accident Wednesday night, before many facts were known.",
      "At a White House press briefing Thursday, he read through a more traditional speech expressing condolences, but then launched into remarks that felt more like something from a campaign rally, calling a Democratic official \u201ca disaster,\u201d castigating his predecessors and going after DEI \u2014 despite any evidence so far that these policies contributed to the midair collision.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been an investigator for 35 years, investigating aircraft accidents, and when you talk about standards, what we just saw does not meet the published international standards of providing information in the wake of an accident,\u201d Jeff Guzzetti, a former investigator for the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board, told MSNBC.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be political here, but the information that came out ... it was not accurate. It undermined the honesty of the investigation,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve never seen something like this, where a government official circumvented the time-honored tradition of aircraft accident investigation. And you know, just personally, I think it\u2019s appalling that these comments, political comments, were being made in the wake of the tragedy like this.\u201d",
      "Trump was joined by two members of his Cabinet, newly confirmed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.",
      "During his remarks, Hegseth disclosed the ranks of the three service members who were killed in the military helicopter. It was a break from longtime Pentagon policy, which is that no information about any service member killed in the line of duty be disclosed for 24 hours after all next of kin have been notified.",
      "Duffy \u2014 who does not have a background in transportation but gained fame as a reality-TV star before becoming a congressman from Wisconsin \u2014 just started as transportation secretary on Wednesday. He struggled through a separate Thursday-morning press briefing, telling reporters the obvious line, \u201cIt is not standard to have aircraft collide. I want to be clear on that.\u201d",
      "Trump opened the press briefing Thursday by thanking federal agencies and first responders, and acknowledging there were likely no survivors.",
      "\u201cThis was a dark and excruciating night in our nation\u2019s capital,\u201d he said during the sober remarks.",
      "From there, Trump\u2019s rhetoric became more political. He blamed former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, along with \u201cthe Democrats,\u201d for supporting past diversity programs within the FAA.",
      "\u201cI do want to point out that various articles that appeared prior to me entering office \u2026 the FAA diversity push includes focusing on hiring people with severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201d",
      "His comments came as rescue workers continue to search for dozens of bodies in the Potomac River.",
      "Trump was asked by reporters how he could know that diversity programs helped cause the tragic crash after just one day, and responded, \u201cBecause I have common sense.\u201d",
      "\u201cFAA employees with disabilities did not cause last night\u2019s tragic plane crash,\u201d the American Association of People with Disabilities said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation into the crash is still ongoing. It is extremely inappropriate for the President to use this tragedy to push an anti-diversity hiring agenda. Doing so makes all Americans less safe.\u201d",
      "At one point, a reporter asked Trump whether he was getting ahead of the investigation by casting blame even before the names of the victims are known.",
      "\u201cNo, I don't think so at all. The names of the people \u2014 you mean the names of the people that are on the plane? You think that\u2019s going to make a difference? They are a group of people that have lost their lives,\u201d Trump said, adding that a list would be released soon.",
      "Trump also took direct aim at Pete Buttigieg, who served as Biden\u2019s transportation secretary.",
      "\u201cThat guy\u2019s a real winner. \u2026 He\u2019s a disaster\u201d Trump said, unprompted. \u201cHe was a disaster as a mayor. He ran his city into the ground, and he\u2019s a disaster.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s just got a good line of bulls---,\u201d Trump added.",
      "Buttigieg responded on X, calling Trump\u2019s press conference \u201cdespicable.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs families grieve, Trump should be leading, not lying,\u201d he posted. \u201cWe put safety first, drove down close calls, grew Air Traffic Control, and had zero commercial airline crash fatalities out of millions of flights on our watch,\u201d he wrote.",
      "John Cox, a pilot and the president and CEO of Safety Operating Systems LLC,\u00a0told MSNBC there was \u201cno foundation\u201d for Trump\u2019s comments about FAA diversity programs.",
      "\u201cOne thing that has to be remembered is that there are standards for everyone in aviation, notably in a safety critical position, be it pilots, be it flight attendants, be it dispatchers, be it air traffic controllers,\u201d he said.",
      "He also said the National Transportation Safety Board is the only agency allowed to release information about an investigation, according to an International Civil Aviation Treaty \u2014 meaning that Trump, Hegseth and Duffy should not have been doing so.",
      "In addition to DEI programs among air traffic controllers, Trump also blamed a \u201cpilot problem\u201d in the helicopter and bad eyesight \u2014 \u201cI can\u2019t imagine people with 20/20 vision not seeing what\u2019s happening up there.\u201d",
      "\u201cBecause it was visual, it was a very clear night,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt was cold, but clear and clear as you could be.\u201d",
      "Officials have so far given no formal cause for the midair collision.",
      "Trump, however, also said he was \u201cnot blaming the [air traffic] controller,\u201d and said the American people should not be afraid to fly.",
      "\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI would not hesitate to fly.\u201d",
      "Both Duffy and Hegseth backed up Trump on the diversity issue during the White House press briefing.",
      "\u201cYou made an important point that when we deal with safety, we can only accept the best and the brightest in positions of safety that impact the lives of our loved ones, our family members,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cAnd I think you make a really important point on that, Mr. President. That is the motto of your presidency, the best and the brightest, the most intelligent coming into these spaces.\u201d",
      "Hegseth said that hiring practices should be \u201ccolorblind and merit-based.\u201d",
      "During the press conference, Trump also appointed Christopher Rocheleau as acting FAA commissioner, a position that had been vacant. He did not speak during the press conference.",
      "Diversity in the aviation industry was put in the spotlight by many conservatives early last year when a panel blew off an Alaska Airlines plane at 16,000 feet.",
      "After that incident, many right-wing commentators and political figures began to baselessly point to DEI as a major issue in the airline industry.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure this has nothing to do with mandated Diversity Equity and Inclusion practices in the airline industry!!!\u201d Donald Trump Jr. posted on X in response to a post about a wheel falling off a Boeing 757. \u201cWheels don\u2019t just fall off planes without gross incompetence in the equation!\u201d",
      "Trump said the order he signed shortly after taking office was to \u201crestore the highest standards\u201d at the FAA. It primarily takes aim at DEI programs at the agency.",
      "\u201cTheir policy was horrible, and their politics was even worse,\u201d Trump said of past Democratic administrations that included diversity programs. \u201cSo, as you know, last week, long before the crash, I signed an executive order restoring our highest standards for air traffic controllers and other important jobs.\u201d",
      "The aviation industry has had a shortage of air traffic controllers for years, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u00a0projects there will be about 18,000 pilot jobs opening\u00a0up each year through 2033. Aviation experts told NBC News that DEI is not a problem in an industry where there are very few Black pilots, and there is absolutely no proof that promoting diversity has led to safety issues."

      "Nancy Kerrigan stepped to the microphone at the Boston Skating Club in Norwood, Massachusetts, visibly shaken.",
      "Just hours earlier she had heard the news of Wednesday night\u2019s tragedy, in which 64 people aboard a commercial airliner died after it collided with a military helicopter midair near Reagan Washington National Airport.",
      "Six of those victims were affiliated with the Boston club: two coaches, two skaters and two mothers, according to CEO Doug Zeghibe. He said the group was returning home from the National Development Camp associated with the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita, Kansas.",
      "Kerrigan, a two-time Olympic figure skating medalist and alum of the club, spoke with tears running down her face.",
      "Follow along for live coverage",
      "\u201cWe just wanted to be here and be part of our community,\u201d Kerrigan said. \u201cI feel for the athletes, the skaters, the families, but anyone that was on that plane \u2014 not just the skaters. It\u2019s such a tragic event. We\u2019ve been through tragedies before as Americans, as people, and we are strong. It\u2019s how we respond to it. My response was to be with people I care about and I love and I needed to support.\u201d",
      "Boston Skating Club is among the nation\u2019s top figure skating programs. It dates back to 1912, making it the third-oldest figure skating club in continuous existence in the U.S.",
      "This is not the first time the organization has been at the center of an airplane accident.",
      "Zeghibe said Wednesday\u2019s crash evoked painful memories from 1961, when Sabena Flight 548 \u2014 a plane carrying 72 people including all 18 members of the U.S. figure skating team and 16 others accompanying them \u2014 crashed on approach. There were no survivors.",
      "\u201cAlmost half of everybody on board that plane (in 1961) were from this club. It had long, long reaching implications for the skating club and for the sport in this country, because when you lose coaches like this, you lose the future of the sport as well,\u201d Zeghibe said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time in redeveloping it. I personally feel that this club, the Skating Club of Boston, has just now, almost 60 years later, been coming out of the shadow of that 1961 crash. So this is particularly devastating.\u201d",
      "Kerrigan is just one of dozens of Olympic, world, North American and U.S. champions produced over the years at the program.",
      "She won a bronze medal at the 1992 Winter Olympics and the silver at the 1994 Winter Olympics. Just before the latter event, an assailant struck Kerrigan\u2019s knee with a police baton after a practice session at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Detroit. It was later revealed the attacker was hired by Jeff Gillooly, the husband of Kerrigan\u2019s rival Tonya Harding.",
      "Kerrigan recovered and was able to compete in the Olympics, earning second place behind Oksana Baiul.",
      "\u201cGoing through something tragic, not like this but myself, the community stood behind me,\u201d she said Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for that and so it\u2019s my turn now to hopefully be here.\u201d",
      "Zeghibe identified the skaters as Spencer Lane and Jinna Han and their moms, Christine Lane and Jin Han. Officials said the two coaches were former Russian world champions Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov.",
      "Zeghibe called Han a \u201cgreat performer, a great competitor, and off the ice, a great kid.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Han family, we watched Jin just grow up here from just a tiny little tike into this amazingly mature 13-year-old,\u201d Zeghibe said. \u201cWe talk a lot about the athletes, but I think we\u2019re going to miss their moms as much. Just really good people.\u201d",
      "Elin Schran, the founder of Joy Skate Productions who works closely with Boston Skating Club, recalled Lane \u201cbeaming\u201d after competing in his first professional show last December in Cambridge.",
      "\u201cHe came to me smiling, ear to ear, saying, \u2018I get it now. I understand,\u201d she said. \u201cHe started to discover this connection with the audience and that joy that he was giving to other people through his gift.\u201d",
      "Shishkova, 52, and Naumov, 55, won the pairs figure skating event at the 1994 World Championship and had been living in the U.S. since 1998, after their retirement from competitive skating, according to Russian state news agency Tass.",

      "Tenley Albright, a two-time world champion in 1953 and 1955, and Boston Skating Club alum, spoke in front of a rink Thursday with no skaters on it. She said the quiet scene behind her was abnormal because the ice is typically filled with athletes at that time.",
      "\u201cI really can\u2019t believe that it happened, because I picture them right here,\u201d Albright said, pointing to the rink. \u201cThe coaches always stood at that entrance. The skaters just flew all over the ice, doing remarkable things, inspiring all of us. To us, it\u2019s just terrible, sad and we just feel we need to be together.\u201d",

      "The drug, Journavx, or suzetrigine, was approved to treat moderate to severe acute, or short-term, pain in adults. Experts say the drug, which is billed as nonaddictive, could reduce the number of opioids patients are prescribed after surgery or be used by patients who can\u2019t take other pain medications \u2014 though several told NBC News they would like to see more research.",
      "In a statement, Dr. Jacqueline Corrigan-Curay, the acting director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, called the approval \u201can important public health milestone in acute pain management.\u201d",
      "Michael Schatman, a clinical instructor in the department of anesthesiology, perioperative care and pain medicine at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, said: \u201cI think in acute pain this drug has great promise. This is something that could be opioid-sparing, and we need more tools in our armory for pain.\u201d",
      "Although the number of patients going home from surgery with opioids has declined in recent years, many patients still leave the hospital with prescriptions. Despite the risks, opioids are extremely effective at treating pain, which has left doctors and patients with few options when acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, aren\u2019t enough.",

During the process, the brain also floods with the neurotransmitter dopamine, creating feelings of euphoria and activating the brain\u2019s reward system. That\u2019s why opioids can be incredibly addictive.",
      "Vertex\u2019s drug works in a completely different way, by blocking the pain signal from traveling to the brain in the first place. The signal is triggered by sodium molecules rushing into the nerve ending, sending the message onward to the brain.",
      "Suzetrigine is a sodium channel blocker, the same type of drug as lidocaine. Lidocaine, a local anesthetic, works by blocking all sodium channels in the area it\u2019s applied to \u2014 for example, the gums during dental work. A sodium channel blocker taken as a pill, such as suzetrigine, must be much more precise, as sodium channels are found throughout the body and are critical for heart and brain function. Suzetrigine blocks nerve pulses from just one sodium channel, called NaV1.8, from reaching the brain and being interpreted as pain.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time we have had something that targets a specific sodium channel,\u201d said Rosenquist, who wasn't involved with the research on the drug.",
      "The process also doesn\u2019t stimulate opioid receptors or produce any feelings of euphoria, he said.",
      "\u201cRight now all the evidence suggests this has no addiction potential at all,\u201d Rosenquist said. \u201cIt\u2019s no different than Tylenol or ibuprofen in terms of addiction potential.\u201d",
      "Tummy tucks and bunion surgery",
      "In phase 3 clinical trials by the drugmaker, researchers looked at how well the drug worked after surgery. Patients who had undergone either tummy tucks or bunion surgery were given either suzetrigine every 12 hours; an opioid, hydrocodone, plus Tylenol every six hours; or a placebo for 48 hours after the operations.",
      "Some of the patients who got suzetrigine also took ibuprofen as a so-called rescue medication \u2014 that is, if they were still experiencing pain after their suzetrigine doses.",
      "\u201cThe results we have now do not tell us a lot about how much of a rescue medication was used,\u201d said Dr. David Rind, chief medical officer at the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), a nonprofit group that evaluates the cost, safety and efficacy of drugs. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if they would have had higher pain reduction if they had just taken an NSAID from the start.\u201d",
      "Both tummy tuck and bunion surgery patients who got suzetrigine reported about a 50% reduction in their pain after 48 hours, similar to the reduction in pain reported by patients who got the opioid plus Tylenol.",
      "About 50% of people in the tummy tuck group and about 30% in the bunion surgery group reported some kind of side effect, most commonly headache, constipation or nausea, but, except for constipation, the side effects were less common in patients who got suzetrigine compared with an opioid.",
      "The dose of hydrocodone was also smaller than what is typically given after surgery, \u201cso it\u2019s hard to know exactly what to make of the results,\u201d Rind said.",
      "In another phase 3 study, patients taking suzetrigine for either surgery or acute pain rated how well they thought it worked. Participants took it every 12 hours for 14 days or until their pain subsided. In that study, 82% of surgical patients and 91% of nonsurgical patients said suzetrigine was good, very good or excellent at treating their pain. About 37% experienced some kind of adverse event, but most were mild, including headache, constipation, nausea, falling or having rashes.",
      "Dr. Todd Bertoch, chief medical officer for pain research at CenExel JBR Clinical Research in Salt Lake City, led the phase 3 trials for suzetrigine in people who had undergone either tummy tucks or or bunion surgery.",
      "While the clinical trial showed the drug could be effective as a solo treatment for pain \u2014 though it was more effective when patients combined it with ibuprofen \u2014 suzetrigine is meant to be used as part of a step-up approach, after Tylenol and NSAIDs, Bertoch said.",
      "\u201cIf I still have pain after that, I\u2019m kind of stuck. My next step is an opioid,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal is to make the next step not an opioid, and that\u2019s what suzetrigine does.\u201d",
      "Suzetrigine could also be used in patients for whom Tylenol or NSAIDs aren\u2019t safe, such as those with kidney or liver disease, he added.",
      "Questions remain, but doctors see promise",
      "In a report last month by ICER, a panel of experts rated the current data on suzetrigine as \u201cpromising but inconclusive.\u201d By the group\u2019s definition, that means it is moderately certain the drug would provide a small or substantial benefit to patients and a small \u2014 but not zero \u2014\u00a0chance of negative health consequences.",
      "How much potential risk of harm is tolerable depends on the type of drug it is, Rind said. For example, it\u2019s widely accepted that cancer drugs have harsh side effects but not enough to outweigh the potential benefit of treating an often fatal disease.",
      "In those situations, \u201cyou are willing to accept a higher risk,\u201d Rind said. \u201cWith a new pain reliever, it really has to be incredibly safe to be OK, and we really will not know that until it\u2019s on the market and used by lots of people.\u201d",
      "New drugs like suzetrigine should be tried first in people who can\u2019t take other pain medications, he said. For example, someone who has a history of both gastrointestinal bleeding, which makes taking NSAIDs dangerous, and addiction, which would deter a doctor from prescribing opioids, would be a good candidate for suzetrigine.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of people like that. It\u2019s not like that is a tiny segment of the population,\u201d Rind said.",
      "Despite remaining questions about the drug\u2019s efficacy and long-term safety, Rind said the physicians he has spoken with are excited about the drug.",
      "\u201cWe have heard from pretty much every pain expert we talked to about how excited they are to have a new class of pain drugs in a space where there hasn\u2019t been a new class of drugs in a very long time,\u201d he said.",
      "Schatman, of NYU Grossman School of Medicine, said suzetrigine does seem safe and effective for short-term use; however, he voiced concerns that Vertex doesn\u2019t have longer-term safety data. (Schatman is the senior medical adviser for Apurano Pharma, a German biotech company, and he is working on a similar drug for chronic pain.)",
      "\u201cThere is relatively strong safety data for short-term use, and that is what the FDA requires,\u201d he said, but there is no set definition for how long acute pain lasts. Vertex isn\u2019t pursuing the FDA\u2019s approval for suzetrigine to treat chronic pain \u2014 a phase 2 clinical trial looking at suzetrigine for sciatica found that it performed no better than a placebo at reducing pain after 12 weeks \u2014 but it is common for doctors to prescribe acute pain medications off-label for chronic pain. That, he said, is worrying.",
      "\u201cMy biggest concern is that we have drugs that are demonstrating as effective for acute pain that all of a sudden extrapolate the data to chronic pain,\u201d he said.",
      "Because suzetrigine blocks pain signals in the peripheral nervous system \u2014 the nerves that carry signals to the central nervous system \u2014 the drug most likely won\u2019t work for chronic pain, which is usually based in the central nervous system, said Dr. Holly Geyer, a hospital internal medicine practitioner at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.",
      "Rosenquist said that even if further studies show suzetrigine doesn\u2019t block acute pain better than opioids, he believes it is still likely to have a place in pain management.",
      "\u201cYou have this tool that you can give to people in instances where they are discharged, they are in that recovery process, we are asking them to do rehab or walking or stuff like that, and would have gone home with an opioid,\u201d he said. \u201cThe step-up approach is a reasonable way to approach this. It could play a role in reducing the overall exposure to opioids.\u201d",
      "Whether doctors reach for the drug will most likely depend on its cost, Schatman and Rosenquist said. Rind, of ICER, said it is likely to depend on both how Vertex prices the new drug and in what contexts, if any, private insurers cover it.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is NSAIDs, generic opioids and acetaminophen are cheap,\u201d Schatman said, adding that he hopes suzetrigine is priced in a way that allows patients to access it."

      "The Summary",
      "The Biden administration proposed a ban on menthol cigarettes but never finalized it.The Trump administration has withdrawn the proposal, so menthol appears likely to remain in cigarettes.The American Lung Association is criticizing Biden\u2019s inaction, saying the ban could have saved lives.",
      "The Biden administration proposed a ban on menthol cigarettes but never finalized it.",
      "The Trump administration has withdrawn the proposal, so menthol appears likely to remain in cigarettes.",
      "The American Lung Association is criticizing Biden\u2019s inaction, saying the ban could have saved lives.",
      "When Joe Biden\u2019s administration announced its intent to ban menthol cigarettes, the medical community welcomed the news, anticipating that it could save hundreds of thousands of lives over several decades and encourage more people to quit smoking.",
      "Though flavored cigarettes have been banned in the U.S. since 2009, menthol is the lone exception. The flavor improves the taste of cigarettes and reduces the feeling of throat irritation, which can make the cigarettes particularly addictive.",
      "The Biden administration announced its interest in banning menthol cigarettes in 2021, then proposed a formal rule the next year. Public health experts anticipated that the rule would be finalized in the summer of 2023, but the deadline came and went. The administration then postponed the decision until spring 2024, at which point it said it needed even more time.",
      "Biden left office without\u00a0finalizing the rule, and the Trump administration withdrew the proposal last week. Menthol appears poised to remain in cigarettes indefinitely.",
      "The American Lung Association \u2014 the country\u2019s leading authority on lung health \u2014 on Wednesday criticized Biden for the missed opportunity.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really disappointed in former President Biden and him bowing to tobacco industry pressure,\u201d said Thomas Carr, the association\u2019s director of national policy.",
      "In its annual \u201cState of Tobacco Control\u201d report, published Wednesday, the American Lung Association said Biden\u2019s inaction will result in continued death and disease from smoking, which kills more than 490,000 people each year in the U.S.",
      "The report describes Biden\u2019s failure to finalize the menthol ban as a glaring example of the tobacco industry \u201ctaking more aggressive actions at the federal and state level to protect its profits.\u201d",
      "A representative for Biden\u2019s office declined to comment. But last year, after the administration delayed the ban indefinitely, Xavier Becerra, Biden\u2019s health secretary, said in a statement:",
      "\u201cThis rule has garnered historic attention and the public comment period has yielded an immense amount of feedback, including from various elements of the civil rights and criminal justice movement. It\u2019s clear that there are still more conversations to have, and that will take significantly more time.\u201d",
      "Massachusetts, California and Washington, D.C., already prohibit the sale of menthol cigarettes, and Oregon and Washington state are weighing similar bans.",
      "The main argument against a menthol ban has focused on the potential for it to encourage unlicensed distribution of menthol cigarettes in communities of color, which some social justice advocates have said could lead to negative interactions with police. Around 80% of Black adults who smoke used menthol cigarettes as of 2020.",
      "\u201cThis ban would have been yet another extension of the war on drugs, further undermining the relationships with our communities that are absolutely essential to our ability to fight crime,\u201d said Diane Goldstein, executive director of the Law Enforcement Action Partnership, a nonprofit that supports drug policy and criminal justice reforms. Such comparisons between a menthol ban and the war on drugs allude to the increased incarcerations for nonviolent drug offenses that came out of the drug policy agenda, particularly among people of color.",
      "Sarah Mills, who studies racial disparities in tobacco use, said the idea that banning menthol cigarettes would hurt Black communities has come at least in part from the tobacco industry. Reporting from the Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post has found that Big Tobacco companies donated to Black activists or civil rights organizations, which in turn lobbied against a menthol ban. The Law Enforcement Action Partnership is among the groups that have received funds from tobacco companies.",
      "\u201cOverpolicing is a very serious issue for Black and other communities, and the tobacco industry should not be using this serious issue to advance their own policy agenda,\u201d said Mills, an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who wasn\u2019t involved in the American Lung Association report.",
      "Mills\u2019 research has also shown that advertisements and promotions for menthol cigarettes in stores selling tobacco products are more common in neighborhoods with a greater share of Black residents.",
      "During the election, the possibility of a menthol ban became a talking point in Republican messaging. The conservative nonprofit group Building America\u2019s Future set aside millions for ads criticizing the ban, which primarily targeted Black voters in swing states. One warned that Democrats are \u201ccoming after your menthol cigarettes.\u201d",
      "Mills lamented the Trump administration\u2019s decision to withdraw the proposal.",
      "\u201cThis is devastating for public health,\u201d she said. \u201cMy hope is that cities and states continue to move forward with implementing local and statewide bans.\u201d",
      "However, two major cigarette companies, Altria and Reynolds American, said they support the Trump administration\u2019s decision.",
      "\u201cWe are pleased that the new Administration recognizes prohibitionary policies don\u2019t work. There are more effective ways to transition adult smokers away from cigarettes,\u201d Luis Pinto, vice president of communications at Reynolds American, said in a statement.",
      "David Sutton, an Altria representative, said that \u201ccriminalizing menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars would lead to serious consequences, including an illicit market and undermining public health and underage tobacco prevention efforts.\u201d",
      "In the absence of a menthol ban, Carr said, the federal government could take other actions to reduce the health risks associated with smoking. The American Lung Association report calls on the Food and Drug Administration to finalize rules for a tracking system that would identify counterfeit or smuggled tobacco products. It also calls on Congress to pass legislation requiring e-cigarette manufacturers to pay fees to the FDA that would help fund the agency\u2019s regulatory activities.",
      "The FDA would not comment, citing a temporary pause in communications implemented by the Trump administration as part of its transition. Trump\u2019s acting health secretary, Dr. Dorothy Fink, directed federal health agencies last week to halt public messaging until Feb. 1."

      "\u201cYou have to physically touch most of your patients, and I had some nerves initially that folks would be uncomfortable,\u201d she said. However, in the eight years since she came out, she said she\u2019s been \u201coverwhelmingly, pleasantly surprised at every single turn.\u201d",

      "\u201cOur service should not be contingent on who holds political power at the time.\u201d",
      "Army RESERVE Lt. Nicolas Talbott",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday barring trans people from serving openly and enlisting in the military. The policy argues that the medical and mental health care that some trans people need to treat gender dysphoria \u2014 the medical term for the distress caused by a misalignment between one\u2019s gender identity and sex at birth \u2014 is inconsistent with the military\u2019s high standards for\u00a0 \u201ctroop readiness, lethality and cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity and integrity.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s unclear exactly how the order will affect the thousands of trans service members like Stehlik. Unlike a similar policy Trump issued in 2017 during his first term, this order says being trans fundamentally \u201cconflicts with a soldier\u2019s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one\u2019s personal life.\u201d",
      "\u201cA man\u2019s assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member,\u201d the order states.",
      "NBC News spoke to trans service members who could be affected by the order, and they all communicated a similar plan of action: They will continue doing their jobs, and they plan to fight the order.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just resolved,\u201d said Stehlik, who is stationed at Fort Campbell on the border of Kentucky and Tennessee, when asked how she\u2019s felt since Trump signed the order Monday. Stehlik was commissioned as an officer after graduating from West Point in 2008.",
      "In the summer of 2018, just after she came out, Stehlik was deployed to treat soldiers in Afghanistan for nine months. She said that experience, combined with patches she wears on her uniform that show she went to specialized combat training schools, helps her patients trust her and make her good at her job.",
      "\u201cTrans folks are every bit as ready and every bit as deployable as anyone else,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to meet the same physical fitness standards, the same medical standards to be deployable. And even as we speak, there are trans service members deployed all around the world in harm\u2019s way, having already met those standards to deploy.\u201d",
      "Six trans service members and two trans people who want to enlist sued the Trump administration Tuesday over the executive order.",
      "Nicolas Talbott, a second lieutenant who has served in the Army Reserves for almost a year, said he joined the lawsuit because he fears the worst-case scenario: that Trump\u2019s executive order will force all trans service members out of the military completely.",

      "Talbott was a plaintiff in a lawsuit against the 2017 Trump ban, which prevented Talbott from enlisting then. He said he decided to join the suit filed Tuesday because \u201cit\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe ultimate goal is that we don\u2019t want trans people or any other minority member of the military to have to face this every single time a new politician is elected into office,\u201d he said. \u201cOur service should not be contingent on who holds political power at the time.\u201d",
      "Like Talbott, this isn\u2019t Navy Cmdr. Emily Shilling\u2019s first go-round with a trans military ban. Shilling \u2014 who emphasized she was not speaking on behalf of the Navy or the Pentagon\u00a0 \u2014 came out in 2019, two days after the first Trump ban took effect. As a result of the ban, she told NBC News in 2021, she was forced to live a double life: She was living as a trans woman in her personal life, but at work she had to continue serving as her birth sex.",
      "After Biden signed an executive order in 2021 allowing trans people to serve openly, she began to thrive, she said. She was promoted to commander, and she fought for and won her medical clearance to fly high-performance jets again, which she said set a precedent that allowed other trans service members to do the same.",
      "Since Monday, she said, she\u2019s felt like she\u2019s on a mission. In addition to serving for nearly two decades, she is also the president of Sparta, an advocacy organization for trans members of the military and veterans. She said she would like to have conversations with officials at the Pentagon or the White House about what real trans Americans and service members look like.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve served openly for nearly a decade, and we\u2019ve been able to show that all of the original arguments for why transgender service should not be made open are all just false,\u201d she said. \u201cOur medical costs are minimal. Our time being down is minimal, and the effect on unit cohesion, morale, it\u2019s nonexistent.\u201d",
      "Since last week, Trump has issued a number of executive orders targeting trans rights. Hours after his inauguration, he signed an order declaring that the U.S. government will recognize only two sexes, male and female, and that \u201cthese sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality,\u201d resulting in the State Department freezing all passport applications requesting a sex-marker change."

      "The mother said she waited five hours for her son to finish his appointment but instead, she saw him being escorted out by immigration officers.",
      "Her son has lived in the U.S. since he was 6 years old, she said, and despite reporting to his appointment, he was not given a fair chance to fight a deportation order placed against him.",
      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t give us the opportunity to at least tell us, \u2018Look, you have a deportation order, we want you to be removed by February or something,\u2019\u201d the mother said.",
      "On any given year, thousands of undocumented immigrants across the country regularly report to ICE. These routine appointments help immigration officials keep track of those who are not a priority for deportation as immigrants seek legal alternatives to remain in the U.S.",
      "Immigration officials also have in place additional supervision programs that allow them to keep tabs on undocumented people through GPS ankle monitors, by phone and other types of monitoring. According to ICE, there are nearly 179,000 people being monitored through these programs nationwide.",
      "Two New York-based immigration attorneys whose names are being withheld to protect their clients said they started noticing a shift after Trump was elected president in November. People in the state who have long been enrolled in one of these immigration supervision programs, or have been checking in with ICE once or twice a year, were asked to report sooner and, in dozens of cases since, they said, their clients ended up being detained and deported.",
      "The ICE Field Office in New York City did not comment and referred NBC News to ICE's national office, which did not immediately respond.",
      "'A lot of fear'",
      "There are immigrants who go to ICE check-ins who don\u2019t have deportation orders and are in the process of trying to adjust their immigration status. Others may have such orders, but are appealing them or are not aware they have a deportation order until they show up to their routine check-in.",
      "That's what happened to a mother who got deported this week alongside her young daughter, a day after reporting to her check-in, one of the attorneys said.",
      "The mother had not been informed that she had lost an appeal in her immigration case before she showed up to her scheduled appointment with her daughter. Instead, she learned about it during the check-in and, by then, the mother couldn't do much to fight her case, the attorney said.",
      "A recent memo from the Trump administration expanded immigration officials\u2019 \u201cenforcement discretion\" powers. This allows them to bypass regular immigration law and speed up deportations of anyone with a removal order, regardless of whether they are considered a priority or not.",
      "The attorneys said they are expecting to see more of these cases across the nation. Currently, nearly 1.4 million people have pending deportation orders. Anecdotally, the New York immigration attorneys said they have seen an increase in the number of people who have been ordered removed without a hearing. They say this means more immigrants may be showing up to their ICE check-ins without knowing they may have a deportation order.",
      "Yet immigrants don\u2019t have much of a choice: Failure to show up for a routine ICE appointment hurts their chances of remaining in the U.S. and can even lead to a deportation order.",
      "They want to comply and go the appointments, according to one attorney, \u201cbut there\u2019s a lot of fear, obviously, a lot of anxiety.\u201d",
      "Maria Bilbao, a campaign coordinator for the American Friends Service Committee in Florida, is part of the\u00a0Miramar Circle of Protection. The coalition of community members gathers outside the ICE field office in the city of Miramar every Wednesday to provide support to immigrants showing up to routine appointments.",
      "On Wednesday morning, Bilbao met a Colombian woman and a Cuban man who showed up to their routine ICE check-in in Miramar and were told to report to the immigration supervision office in Delray Beach instead, where the 30-year-old Venezuelan immigrant was detained on Monday.",
      "The immigration supervision office in Delray Beach is not an ICE field office; it's run by a private company contracted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and ICE to operate an \u201cintensive supervision appearance program\" meant to serve as an alternative to detention.",
      "But according to Bilbao, \u201cwhat\u2019s happening now is strange.\" Instead of routine supervisory visits, \"they are being detained more often,\u201d she said in Spanish.",
      "In the eight years Bilbao has been assisting immigrants with their ICE check-in appointments, she had rarely heard of people being detained for deportation at that facility.",
      "The ICE Field Office in Miami didn't respond to NBC News\u2019 email asking how many people were detained Monday in Delray Beach and whether or not those detained are facing deportation. An NBC Miami reporter witnessed at least six people being taken into custody that day.",
      "One woman who accompanied her cousin to his routine appointment at Delray Beach on Monday morning, and saw him removed by immigration authorities, told NBC Miami she believed her cousin was \u201ctricked into coming to see their immigration officer, as they\u2019ve done time and time again \u2014 but this time they were caught by surprise and taken away,\" she said.",
      "In response to the allegations, Garrett Ripa, the acting assistant director of ICE Field Operations in Miami,\u00a0told NBC Miami \u201cthere\u2019s no truth to that.\u201d",
      "When asked if undocumented immigrants would be detained or deported regardless of whether or not they have a criminal record, Ripa said, \u201cEvery individual in the United States that is either removable or inadmissible from the United States, regardless of whether they have a crime or not, is potentially an individual that we could take an enforcement action against.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow, does that necessarily mean that we\u2019re going to take that person into immigration custody? Not necessarily, there are other avenues we can explore,\u201d he said.",
      "'It's a nightmare'",
      "People being detained during their ICE check-ins is not new. It has happened under various previous administrations, including during Trump\u2019s first term in 2017, which Bilbao said led to the creation of the\u00a0Miramar Circle of Protection.",
      "\"Back then, we called them 'silent raids,'\" Bilbao said.",
      "\"So, we expected something like that to happen again this time around,  because it is the easiest way for them to deport people,\" she said. \"It's a nightmare.\"",
      "On Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated Trump's promise to carry out \u201cthe largest deportation program in American history.\u201d",
      "\"If you are an individual, a foreign national, who illegally enters the United States of America, you are by definition a criminal,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Being undocumented is considered a civil offense,\u00a0not a crime. But it\u2019s considered a crime when an undocumented immigrant who was previously deported re-enters the United States without permission.",
      "The woman who saw her cousin being detained in Delray Beach on Monday said \u201cthese people aren\u2019t bad people, these people aren\u2019t criminals. ... The person, my family member, they took away today, is not a criminal. He has never been to jail.\u201d"

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 10:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Vice President JD Vance has earned a unique privilege inside the White House \u2014 free rein to hire whom he wants, with no interference from President Donald Trump or his top aides.",
    "story": [
      "Vice President JD Vance has earned a unique privilege inside the White House \u2014 free rein to hire whom he wants, with no interference from President Donald Trump or his top aides.",
      "The dynamic, as five people in or close to the administration explained it to NBC News, reflects the trust that the term-limited Trump has in Vance, his 40-year-old understudy who is widely expected to run for president himself in 2028.",
      "All but two of the first 11 senior staffers Vance hired as vice president worked on his 2022 campaign for the Senate in Ohio, in his Senate office after he won that race or both.",
      "\u201cThe Trump team is an A-team in every sense of the word,\u201d Jai Chabria, Vance\u2019s longest-serving political adviser, said in an interview. \u201cThey had every opportunity to push people around or shove people around. They didn\u2019t. They decided to build a team with JD\u2019s team ... and in the process, they got a loyal bunch that\u2019s ready to go through the wall for the president.\u201d",
      "Jacob Reses, who was Vance\u2019s chief of staff in the Senate, now holds that position in the vice president\u2019s office. Bryan Gray, who held senior roles on Vance\u2019s Senate campaign and staff, is in place as Reses\u2019 deputy. Vance also installed his long-running communications team of William Martin, Luke Schroeder and Taylor Van Kirk in similar positions in his new office.",
      "Other Vance veterans who have followed him from his 2022 campaign or his Senate office include national security adviser Andy Baker, domestic policy director Ben Moss, operations director Abby Delahoyde and Patrick McAllister, his longtime personal aide.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s something that says a lot about JD and the people who work with JD,\u201d said a Republican strategist who has worked closely with Trump and Vance and was granted anonymity to discuss internal dynamics. \u201cIt\u2019s unique to have someone who retains staff the way JD has retained staff the last few years. I think JD at his core is a loyal guy, and that\u2019s a lot of it. But he also has a very talented staff.\u201d",
      "Also on staff are former Federal Election Commission Chair Sean Cooksey, as counsel to Vance, and Shannon Fisher, a former Republican National Committee aide who will be second lady Usha Vance\u2019s chief of staff after having assisted her during the presidential campaign. Buckley Carlson, announced this week as Vance\u2019s deputy press secretary, has no history with him. His father, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, is a Vance ally who pushed for Trump to select him as his running mate last summer.",
      "Vance\u2019s core trio of political strategists \u2014 Chabria, Andy Surabian and Luke Thompson \u2014 are not on the vice presidential payroll, but they remain close as outside advisers. All three are expected to be key players in any moves Vance might make toward his own White House bid.",
      "Surabian, a senior adviser to Donald Trump Jr., one of Vance\u2019s leading advocates for the vice presidency, has long been close to Trump world and was the chief strategist on the vice presidential campaign.\u00a0Trump and Vance also have shared a pollster, Tony Fabrizio, who remains close to both.",
      "Meanwhile, Vance also has a key ally on Trump\u2019s staff. James Braid, who was a deputy chief of staff in his Senate office, directs the White House Office of Legislative Affairs.",
      "\u201cVice President Vance has assembled a top notch team that works seamlessly with President Trump\u2019s team, and that\u2019s why the Administration has already been so successful,\u201d White House communications director Steven Cheung wrote in a statement to NBC News. \u201cThere is complete synergy and trust on all levels.\u201d",
      "Past presidents and their staffs have a history of micromanaging or undermining vice presidents and theirs. Former President Joe Biden\u2019s advisers, for example, kept away some of former Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 longtime allies. Trump\u2019s first term featured tensions with then-Vice President Mike Pence, who, unlike Vance, had no previous relationship with Trump.",
      "Pence brought aides with him from Indiana, where he had been governor, but he also made efforts to cultivate Trump advisers like Corey Lewandowski. Pence\u2019s 2019 hiring of Katie Waldman, who soon afterward married Trump aide Stephen Miller, was viewed partly as a \u201cstrategic decision\u201d to grow closer with Miller, a former Pence aide recalled.",
      "\u201cIt was a sign of good faith, and there was access there,\u201d said the former aide, who was granted anonymity to share candid observations. \u201cBut that comes with its risks: that the Trump people could also learn what we were doing.\u201d",
      "Trump and Pence had an irreconcilable split on Jan. 6, 2021, after Pence refused to interfere with the certification of Trump\u2019s re-election loss to Biden. Rioters, egged on by Trump, chanted \u201cHang Mike Pence\u201d as they stormed the Capitol.",
      "From the start, Trump\u2019s relationship with Vance has been stronger than what he had with Pence.",
      "They have been close since the 2022 Senate race, which Vance won with Trump\u2019s endorsement, and they bonded further in 2023 during Trump\u2019s visit to the site of a toxic train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.",
      "The fact that Vance was able to choose his staff, rather than have one chosen for him, \u201c1,000%\u201d illustrates that Trump and his team see no need to meddle in the vice president\u2019s office, said the political strategist who has worked closely with both men.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of that has to do with some of the interlocking relationships between both sides,\u201d this person said. \u201cThe fact that JD and senior people around JD also had relationships with Team Trump and that JD himself built a relationship with Trump and the people around Trump \u2014 I think that allowed for them to have that type of trust in JD\u2019s team.\u201d",
      "The no-meddling approach dates to last year\u2019s presidential campaign, which was an audition of sorts for Vance aides. Trump\u2019s team was responsible for only one hire on the vice presidential campaign staff: director of operations Nick Luna, whose role was announced before Trump selected Vance as his running mate. Vance otherwise had wide latitude to bring along his own people, including Reses, Martin, Schroeder and Van Kirk.",
      "With Surabian at the helm, Chabria and Thompson also frequently traveled with Vance and dialed in for strategy sessions. Chabria directed Vance\u2019s debate preparations, which Trump\u2019s team made no effort to micromanage. Jason Miller, a senior Trump adviser, participated at the Vance team\u2019s invitation, not at the Trump team\u2019s insistence, two sources familiar with the effort said.",
      "The harmony surprised Chabria, who said he had researched past vice presidential campaigns to prepare himself for any tension points that might arise between the blended Trump and Vance staffs.",
      "\u201cThe fact that the senior staff had the trust in us \u2014 it was unbelievable to me, because I don\u2019t know that any other campaign would have afforded that,\u201d Chabria said.",
      "The former Pence aide observed that the relationships Vance\u2019s team enjoys with Trump\u2019s \u201care much deeper\u201d than what Pence and Trump had at the start of their term. Vance, this person noted, also is operating on a different timeline with regard to his own political future, meaning strategists like Surabian have \u201cway more value\u201d outside the administration. Chabria, Surabian and other Vance advisers, for example, are already exercising their political muscles by assisting in Trump ally Vivek Ramaswamy\u2019s soon-to-launch campaign for governor in Ohio.",
      "While Pence had to concentrate on a re-election campaign with Trump before he began to fully entertain thoughts of a White House bid, Vance will most likely need to be ready to launch for 2028 soon after next year\u2019s midterm elections if he plans to run for president.",
      "\u201cThe official office needs to be staffed with the best people that can help him effectuate those Capitol Hill goals and the communications goals,\u201d the former Pence aide said. \u201cAnd then the people on the outside are going to be important, from a planning and strategic perspective in conjunction with the chief of staff, to make sure Vance is traveling to the right places.\u201d"

      "The two are among at least four\u00a0people\u00a0who have been brought into the FBI to advise its director, the current and former officials said. At least two of the\u00a0new advisers are retired FBI agents, one of whom, Tom Ferguson, was an aide to Rep. Jim Jordan,\u00a0R-Ohio, a staunch Trump ally and vocal FBI critic.",

      "It\u2019s not clear who facilitated the arrival of the new advisers or what areas they are focusing on. A spokesperson for Kash Patel, President Donald Trump's pick for FBI director, did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did the FBI. Patel's Senate confirmation hearing is Thursday.",
      "Former FBI officials said the new advisers\u00a0have sparked\u00a0concerns that people with ties to partisan political figures will be helping run the country\u2019s most powerful law enforcement agency.\u00a0While some FBI officials briefed on the arrangement are hopeful that it could result in needed reforms, others fear a compromise of the bureau\u2019s decades-old tradition of distancing itself from politics.",
      "Unlike the Justice Department, the FBI has no political appointees other than its director, whom the president picks for what is supposed to be a 10-year term.\u00a0Much as is the case at the CIA, nearly everyone else who works at the FBI is a career civil servant.",
      "That structure was created after the death in 1972 of longtime FBI director J.

      "\u201cThat\u2019s absolutely needed,\u201d he said. \u201cThings have gotten too headquarters-centric, and when headquarters is in D.C., the natural thing that happens in D.C. is that things get political.\u201d",
      "However,\u00a0D\u2019Amico said, it is not normal to have\u00a0people with ties to partisan political figures\u00a0on the seventh\u00a0floor, as FBI employees call the director\u2019s office.",
      "\u201cThis will have to be done very carefully,\u201d D\u2019Amico said. \u201cHow does that chain of command work?\u00a0You have to be very careful that it doesn\u2019t become like the Russian political officer on a Russian nuclear sub, enforcing party discipline.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker on Thursday denied allegations by six women that he engaged in inappropriate behavior during massage therapy sessions.",
      "Six women identified only by initials spoke to The Baltimore Banner about their allegations, which span Tucker's rookie season in 2012 through 2016. Five of them allege that Tucker requested a massage of his pelvic region or his inner thighs while he had erections before he intentionally exposed his penis.",
      "Two women allege Tucker brushed them with\u00a0his exposed penis, and three of them said he left what they believe to be ejaculate on the table, the Banner reported.",
      "According to the reporting, \"several therapists said Tucker\u2019s behavior was so egregious that they ended his sessions early or refused to work on him again.\"",
      "Tucker, in a statement released on social media, called the allegations \"unequivocally false.\" He said he always sought to conduct himself with the \"utmost professionalism.\"",
      "\"I have never before been accused of misconduct of any kind, and I have never been accused of acting inappropriately in front of a massage therapist or during a massage therapy session or during other bodywork,\" Tucker wrote.",
      "He denied that he was dismissed from a session or told he was not welcome at any place of business. Tucker said the Banner article skewed \"innocuous\" or \"ambitious\" interactions out of proportion.",
      "Two spa businesses in Baltimore told the Banner that Tucker had been banned immediately after complaints were lodged against him.",
      "Some of the women said they took extra measures to keep Tucker covered. A woman identified only as \"J\" told the Banner that she tucked him \"like a baby\" but that he repeatedly repositioned himself so she would brush against his genitals.",
      "\"I did hundreds of massages and I never ever had someone else do that,\" she said.",
      "Michael Belsky, an attorney representing four of the women, told the Banner that his clients' allegations are \"voluminous, very similar and very troubling.\"",
      "\"Each of my clients has expressed profound, long-lasting impact as a result of these allegations,\" he said.",
      "Belsky did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night.",
      "Tucker could face discipline under the NFL's personal conduct policy. League spokesman Brian McCarthy said the NFL takes the \u201callegation seriously and will look into the matter.\u201d",
      "The Baltimore Ravens said in a statement, \"We take any allegations of this nature seriously and will continue to monitor the situation.\u201d",
      "Tucker, 35, is regarded as one of the greatest field goal kickers in NFL history. His 89.1% conversion rate is the best of all time, and he ranks 12th with 417 career field goals. His 66-yard field goal in 2021 is the longest successful kick in league history.",
      "Drafted by Baltimore in 2012, Tucker has made the Pro Bowl seven times, and he helped the Ravens win the Super Bowl after the 2012 season."

      "U.S. figure skating icon Dick Button, who won consecutive Olympic gold medals on the ice before he became the voice of the sport on television, died Thursday, U.S. Figure Skating said.",
      "He was 95.",
      "The Associated Press first reported Button's death, citing his son, Edward, who did not reveal a cause.",
      "U.S. Figure Skating, already reeling from the deaths of more than a dozen up-and-coming competitors in a midair collision over the Potomac River near Washington, D.C., on Wednesday night, later confirmed the news of Button's death in North Salem, New York.",
      "\"U.S. Figure Skating mourns the loss of the legendary Dick Button,\" it said in a statement. \"The two-time Olympic champion\u2019s pioneering style & award-winning television commentary revolutionized figure skating. His legacy will live on forever. We extend our deepest condolences to his family & loved ones.\"",
      "Scott Hamilton, who won gold in 1984, posted of picture of he and Button with the emoji of a broken heart, shortly after word of his death spread.",
      "An 18-year-old Button first came to prominence in 1948, winning Olympic gold in St. Moritz, Switzerland, by being the first skater to land a double axel in competition.",
      "He followed up the groundbreaking effort by sticking the first-ever triple loop and innovating the \u201cButton camel,\u201d now called the flying camel spin, in his gold-medal-winning effort in Oslo, Norway, in 1952.",
      "No man would win back-to-back individual gold medals until Japan's Yuzuru Hanyu\u00a0won it all in 2014 and repeated in 2018.",
      "Button graduated from Harvard University in 1952 and got his law degree there in 1955.",
      "When he was done with competition, Button kept skating with the Ice Capades and Holiday on Ice.",
      "But Button's lasting legacy came, not with skates, but with microphones and cameras.",
      "He commented on figure skating for CBS in 1960 at the Olympics in Squaw Valley, California.",
      "Audiences reveled in Button's wit and brutal honesty, making him an Olympic staple. For generations of Americans, Button's voice was synonymous with the sport itself.",
      "He provided figure skating analysis for NBC at the Winter Games in 2006 in Turin, Italy, and 2010 in Vancouver, British Columbia, before he was inducted into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame in 2015.",
      "\u201cNo other figure skater embodies the sport as much as Dick Button. He is, and always will be, the godfather of this sport,\u201d NBC Sports figure skating analyst Tara Lipinski, an Olympic gold medalist, said in Button's Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame profile.",
      "Lipinski's broadcasting partner, Johnny Weir, said Button's blunt takes set him apart.",
      "\u201cDick Button created an open and honest space in figure skating broadcasting where no topic or moment was off-limits,\u201d Weir said. \"He told it like it was, even when his opinion wasn\u2019t a popular one.\"",
      "Button is survived by\u00a0his longtime partner and spouse, Dennis Grimaldi,\u00a0and two children, Edward Button and Emily Button, U.S. Figure Skating said."

    "story": [
      "Miami Heat point guard Terry Rozier is under investigation in connection with a sports betting scandal, the NBA said Thursday, months after former Toronto Raptors center Jontay Porter was banned for life in a gambling scandal.",
      "The league was alerted to suspicious betting surrounding Rozier in March 2023. Rozier, then a member of the Charlotte Hornets, was playing the New Orleans Pelicans, NBA spokesman Mike Bass confirmed in a statement.",
      "\"The league conducted an investigation and did not find a violation of NBA rules,\" Bass said.\u00a0\"We are now aware of an investigation by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of New York related to this matter and have been cooperating with that investigation.\u201d",
      "The U.S. attorney\u2019s office declined to comment. The NBA Players Association and Rozier's agent did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The Wall Street Journal first reported the probe.",
      "Alarms were raised after an unusually high number of wagers were placed on Rozier to go under statistical benchmarks, multiple sources told the Journal. The firm tasked with monitoring gambling activity, U.S. Integrity, alerted the NBA and sportsbooks.",
      "Rozier, whose career earnings exceed $100 million, left with a sore right foot after having scored only five points, according to the NBA game highlights.",
      "The Journal reported that the investigation is part of the same federal probe into sports betting that was opened into Porter.",
      "Porter pleaded guilty last year to conspiracy to commit wire fraud for purposefully leaving two games to help people to win big bets that he would do badly. He admitted in court that he agreed to the scheme to help settle his gambling debts.",
      "\"I know what I did was wrong, unlawful, and I am deeply sorry,\u201d he said last year.",
      "Porter, who has not yet been sentenced, faces roughly three to four years in prison, in addition to fines and potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in restitution.",
      "The NBA banned Porter for life in April.",
      "\u201cThere is nothing more important than protecting the integrity of NBA competition for our fans, our teams and everyone associated with our sport, which is why Jontay Porter\u2019s blatant violations of our gaming rules are being met with the most severe punishment,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said at the time.",
      "The NBA Players Association pledged that it would provide him with the resources he needed but also supported the league's policy on gambling. The union said at the time that the guidelines are \"paramount to maintaining the integrity of our athletes and protecting the future of the sports.\"",
      "Sports gambling has been on the rise since the Supreme Court overturned a ban on sports betting in 2018, with a particular surge in the early days of the 2020 Covid pandemic. Last year, NBC News reported a rise in calls to gambling addiction hotlines in at least three states.",
      "Some have also raised concerns that legalization of sports betting will lead to more issues of match fixing. In a 2023 series for Bloomberg, columnist Thomas O'Brien said the surge in gambling apps would only deepen the age-old problem.",
      "While match fixing has always been around, it is now more frequent and widespread, analysts say, because the advent of online gambling and mobile devices allows \"almost anyone, anywhere, to bet,\" O'Brien wrote."

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 11:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "AI and new technology could soon make the chain gang obsolete, with an advanced system known as \u201cHawk-Eye\u201d aspiring to make the game faster and more accurate.",
    "story": [
      "For more than 100 years, football has been officiated using a simple chain 10 yards long. The so-called chain gang has been the sport\u2019s judge and jury, ruling whether a ball traveled the number of yards needed for a team to get a first down \u2014 and four more chances to score.",
      "But artificial intelligence and new technology could soon make the chain gang obsolete, with an advanced system known as Hawk-Eye aspiring to make the game faster and more accurate by mashing together high-tech software with a lot of cameras.",
      "In the 2024-25 preseason, the NFL tested Sony\u2019s Hawk-Eye to make calls on \u201cline to gain,\u201d the officiating term for measuring the 10 yards a team needs to advance the ball to get a first down.",
      "Hawk-Eye uses up to 60 cameras, including those used for broadcasts, to piece together every possible angle on a given football play. That\u2019s useful for referees who use it to scrub through the action frame by frame when they\u2019re making play calls, but Sony and the NFL are now taking it one step further.",
      "Using feeds from six cameras with 8K resolution (four times as many pixels as a 4K camera), Hawk-Eye can now pinpoint the ball\u2019s start and finish using artificial intelligence and determine whether it traveled the necessary 10 yards. Every NFL stadium is equipped to use Hawk-Eye for line to gain.",
      "\u201cWe did a lot of due diligence with the NFL to make sure that we\u2019ve chosen the right cameras and the right placement of the cameras to make sure that our accuracy was where it needed to be,\u201d said Dan Cash, managing director of Sony\u2019s Hawk-Eye.",
      "Doing so would reduce the time it takes for the chain gang to haul the bright orange markers onto the field and gauge whether the ball passed the line to gain. The tech could cut down on controversial calls in matchups when inches can be all the difference.",
      "In last weekend's AFC conference title game between the Buffalo Bills and the Kansas City Chiefs, Buffalo quarterback Josh Allen rushed forward on fourth-and-inches early in the fourth quarter. Though it appeared he may have gotten the first down, officials ruled he did not.",
      "Kansas City got the ball back and scored a touchdown on their next drive. The Chiefs would win 32-29 and advance to the Super Bowl.",
      "During the regular season, Washington Commanders fans were up in arms after officials ruled that tight end Zach Ertz was short of a first down, securing the Pittsburgh Steelers a win.",
      "And in an infamous 2017 matchup between the Oakland Raiders and the Dallas Cowboys, then-NFL official Gene Steratore not only summoned the chain gang but also used an index card to rule that the ball did touch the line necessary for the Cowboys to earn a first down.",
      "\u201cHere we are, across the bay from Silicon Valley, the high-tech capital of the world, and you got an index card that determines whether it\u2019s a first down or a fourth down,\u201d \u201cNFL on NBC\u201d play-by-play sportscaster Al Michaels said on the broadcast.",
      "About seven years later, that high tech is now coming to the game.",
      "NFL Deputy Chief Information Officer Aaron Amendolia said Hawk-Eye will also help make calls 40 seconds faster than pulling out the chains.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to get much more accurate on what we\u2019re showing as far as measurements, but we\u2019re also going to have a faster-moving game,\u201d Amendolia said.",
      "Fred Gaudelli, the executive producer of \u201cNFL on NBC,\u201d said that makes for a better TV-viewing experience.",
      "\u201cAs attention spans become shorter and people have more distractions in life, the quicker you can get things done and get to a final answer. I think it\u2019s better for the broadcast and it\u2019s better for the audience,\u201d he said.",
      "Football fanatics could notice a new element to their TV-viewing experience, as well, with Hawk-Eye feeding graphics that re-create ball positioning to show viewers exactly where the ball is relative to the line to gain.",
      "If that sounds familiar, it\u2019s because Sony Hawk-Eye is the same technology used in tennis. The U.S. Open uses Sony Hawk-Eye to gauge whether a ball was out of bounds, and it re-creates the action in an animatic graphic for viewers to see.",
      "A preseason game between the Detroit Lions and the New York Giants fully deployed Hawk-Eye to determine whether a first down had been earned. Although Hawk-Eye was able to generate the image showing that the ball was indeed short, critics pointed out it took a while.",
      "\u201cAre we going to use it if it takes this long?\u201d Giants preseason analyst Phil Simms asked on the broadcast.",
      "There\u2019s also the nostalgia factor with the chain gang, which some players aren\u2019t willing to let go of.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a part of the game,\u201d Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce said on the \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast.",
      "The line-to-gain technology, wasn\u2019t used in the regular season and isn\u2019t being used for the current postseason, will be tested again next preseason.",
      "\u201cWe need to have the right results,\u201d Amendolia said, \u201cand when we do, we\u2019ll scale it up and out.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Germany\u2019s opposition conservatives won parliamentary approval on Wednesday for a proposal to drastically restrict migration with the help of votes from the Alternative for Germany (AfD), breaking a taboo on cooperation with the far-right.",
      "The proposal is non-binding but the role of the\u00a0AfD\u00a0in passing them is symbolically important in Germany, which faces a national election on Feb. 23 in which the far-right party is tipped to emerge as the second largest after the conservatives.",
      "Friedrich Merz, the leader of Germany\u2019s CDU/CSU conservative bloc, is keen to seize the initiative on migration policy, which has shifted sharply back into focus after an Afghan asylum seeker was arrested over\u00a0deadly stabbings\u00a0last week.",
      "Merz presented two non-binding motions\u00a0in parliament calling for heightened security measures and the closure of German land borders to irregular migration,\u00a0prompting hours of emotionally charged debate in the Bundestag lower house.",
      "With Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens opposed to the motions, however, Merz\u00a0knew he would have\u00a0to rely on support of the\u00a0AfD.\u00a0The land border measure passed with a slim majority of just three votes, while the security proposal was rejected.",
      "Critics\u00a0including Scholz\u00a0argue that\u00a0Merz\u2019s tactics\u00a0shatter the taboo among mainstream parties\u00a0against\u00a0working with the\u00a0AfD\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a party that is monitored by German security services on suspicion of being right-wing extremist\u00a0\u2014\u00a0in an effort to keep it from power.",
      "\u201cSince the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany over 75 years ago, there has always been a clear consensus among all democrats: We do not make common cause with the extreme right,\u201d Scholz\u00a0said\u00a0in a speech to parliament.",
      "\u201cYou have broken this basic consensus of our republic in the heat of the moment,\u201d he told Merz.",
      "Scholz warned of a possible future coalition between the conservatives and the\u00a0AfD\u00a0after the election, even though Merz\u2019s party currently rules out such a scenario.",
      "Germany\u2019s Catholic and Protestant churches warned in a letter to parliament that cooperating with the far-right damaged the country\u2019s democracy \u2014\u00a0a rebuke\u00a0likely to sting Merz\u2019s Christian Democrats whose name evokes their religious links.",
      "Abdassamad El Yazidi, head of the Central Council of Muslims, accused politicians of \u201cchasing the positions of the far-right on immigration\u201d.",
      "\u201cGroups with migrant backgrounds are being stigmatized. It\u2019s not just immoral but dangerous to social cohesion in our country,\u201d he said.",
      "Merz\u2019s move is likely to make coalition building after the election much trickier. Some senior SPD and Greens politicians said he had proven himself unfit to govern.",
      "Merz, who aims to present a draft bill furthering the migration crackdown on Friday,\u00a0defended Wednesday\u2019s motions by saying\u00a0a decision was not wrong just because the \u201cwrong people\u201d supported it although it pained him to have to rely on the support of the\u00a0AfD.",
      "Merz has accused the SPD and Greens of blocking what he calls a necessary turnaround in asylum policy after the arrival in recent years of millions of asylum seekers fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Afghanistan and Ukraine.",
      "The number of asylum seekers has dropped since Scholz\u2019s government pushed through a series of laws cracking down on migration in recent years and implemented more controls on the borders \u2014 but not enough, says Merz.",
      "Political analysts say that by\u00a0weakening the so-called firewall around the\u00a0AfD,\u00a0Merz\u00a0risks legitimizing the\u00a0far-right party\u00a0while scaring off centrist conservative voters.",
      "Support for the CDU/CSU dropped three points in the days after Merz promised a migration crackdown to 28%, according to a survey by\u00a0pollster Forsa\u00a0published on Tuesday. Scholz\u2019s SPD gained two points to 17%, as did the\u00a0AfD, to 21%.",
      "The\u00a0AfD\u2019s candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, accused mainstream parties on Wednesday of disrespecting German voters\u00a0in their treatment of her party.",

      "Sikorsky, a subsidiary of the aerospace and defense giant Lockheed-Martin, says it has built more than 5,000 of the helicopters for 36 countries.",
      "The Army has said it expects the aircraft to be a key part of its fleet for the next three decades.",
      "The Black Hawk that collided with American Eagle Flight 5342 was from Bravo Company, 12th Aviation Battalion, out of Davison Army Airfield in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and it was on a training mission, the Army said.",
      "Military officials described the three soldiers on the aircraft as a very experienced crew that included an instructor pilot with more than 1,000 flight hours.",
      "The officials said the training mission was a routine annual evaluation of the pilot\u2019s ability to fly at night. The crew was well aware of the route and the rules in the airspace around the airport, the officials said.",
      "The cause of the collision remains unclear and is being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board.",
      "Speaking to MSNBC, retired Army Lt. Col. Darin Gaub said video of the collision appeared to show that the helicopter did not appear to change course, speed or altitude before the crash, indicating the crew may not have known the passenger jet was in its path.",
      "He added that the training mission had fewer crew chiefs than normal to scan the sky for potential dangers. While such missions typically have three, he said, Wednesday's had one.",
      "\"That\u2019s a fact,\" he said. \"It may have bearing in the future. It may not. But it does reduce ability of crew to identify an aircraft in flight at night.\"",
      "Nearly two years ago, two Black Hawk helicopters from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, collided during a training exercise, killing all nine soldiers aboard them.",
      "That crash and a second fatal collision that involved two Apache helicopters in Alaska prompted the Army to ground all aviation except flights on critical missions.",
      "Army Chief of Staff James McConville said the stand-down was necessary to ensure the Army was doing everything possible to prevent accidents.",
      "A review of fatal incidents involving Black Hawk helicopters published by Military.com after the collision in Kentucky found 60 people had died in training incidents over the previous decade.",
      "The review concluded that while that number may appear high, Black Hawks account for the fewest deadly incidents relative to hours flown in the Army's fleet and are involved in far fewer fatal incidents than other helicopters, including the AH-64 Apache and the CH-47 Chinook."

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 21:46:27 GMT",
    "summary": "Sharon Stone learned she was related to King Charlemagne in Finding Your Roots. See her reaction.",
    "story": [
      "As if having royalty in your bloodline was not impressive enough, imagine having roots stemming from the first king of Rome.",
      "On the Season 11 episode of \"Finding Your Roots\" that aired on Jan. 28, actor and former fashion model Sharon Stone discovered just that.",
      "After discussing the paper trail of her parents' bloodline, host Dr. Henry Louis Gates Jr. revealed to Stone that her line of heritage from her father's paternal line extended back over a thousand years to medieval times, making Charlemagne her 38th great-grandfather.",
      "Referred to as the \"father of Europe,\" Charlemagne is one of the most important people in history, according to Gates.",
      "The King of the Franks was the first crowned emperor of the Holy Roman Empire in the year 800, over one thousand years before Stone was even born.",
      "Not only did the line of lineage contain Charlemagne, but also two French kings, making up Stone\u2019s bloodline as a one-of-a-kind royal line.",
      "\"Well if you want to see someone whose mind is completely blown, here it is!\" Stone said after Gates revealed the image of Charlemagne.",
      "Stone had multiple revelations about her family history in the episode, including her DNA test, which revealed she was 43% Scottish. Before the episode, she believed her ancestors were almost exclusively Irish, which Gates concluded could be a result of a migration of Scottish people to Ireland, known as Scotch-Irish people.",
      "Contrasted with the royal lineage in her distant bloodline, Stone's parents did not grow up with financial fortitude. Her mother, Dorothy Larson, was born in 1933 in rural Pennsylvania in extreme poverty. Dorothy Larson's parents, Stone's grandparents, could only afford a two-room house for their five children.",
      "\u201cThere wasn\u2019t time or moments to even think about was there anybody before them; there wasn\u2019t the luxury of imagining \u2018who were your ancestors,\u201d Stone explained to Gates. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to know who your people are. It\u2019s really nice to be able to find that out.\u201d",
      "Larson grew up surrounded in tragedy, with her twin dying at birth due to malnourishment and one of her sisters being struck and killed by a drunk driver, according to Stone. She also grew up with rickets and scurvy, and at age 9 moved in with their local dentist to live as their maid.",
      "Stone's third great-grandfather on her mom's side, George Greggs, also suffered from great hardship. A Pennsylvania Union cavalry soldier in the Civil War and during the Battle of Cedar Creek, Greggs potentially suffered from undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder in the later stages of his life.",
      "With hardship on her mother's side, Stone's dad's upbringing also had unfortunate circumstances. Sharon's grandfather, Joseph Stone, managed a lucrative oil well that passed from heart disease, leaving his wife with no inheritance.",
      "Stone explained she believes she inherited her father's work ethic, who was a tool and dye maker. Stone herself battled career challenges herself, including a bounceback from a life-threatening stroke.",
      "\"It's so grounding to find out for the good and the bad of it,\" Stone explained when learning about her family lineage. \"Because them, you can just see yourself and go 'Oh, that's what I'm made of!'\""

    "story": [
      "Blake Lively's actor brother-in-law Bart Johnson is apologizing for any \"unkind\" things he's said amid Lively's legal battle with her \"It Ends with Us\" co-star and director Justin Baldoni.",
      "Johnson, who is married to Lively\u2019s\u00a0older half-sister Robyn Lively,\u00a0 addressed unspecific past remarks of his Jan. 28 on X, writing, \"Anytime I\u2019ve said anything unkind about someone I\u2019ve regretted it. Fortunately that\u2019s almost never and definitely not when I\u2019m at my best. Regardless if it\u2019s true or not, if it\u2019s my opinion, even if I\u2019m trying to speak truth or stand up for someone, it\u2019s never good.",
      "\"Even in times where it might 'feel' justified and doing the right thing, it makes no difference,\" he continued. \"There\u2019s a better way. It\u2019s below the standard I have for myself and I regret it. \"",
      "The \"High School Musical\" franchise star went on to \"sincerely apologize\" to anyone he \"hurt or let down by saying something that sounds mean.\"",
      "\"I\u2019ll do better. If you follow me you know you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find more than 1 time I\u2019ve criticized anyone on social. It\u2019s not my jam,\" wrote Johnson. \"You can easily find a million times I\u2019ve uplifted, support, encourage and uplifted my family, friends, followers & strangers. That\u2019s what I\u2019m committed to and where I find my happiness. \"",
      "Johnson concluded his message, \"We all have flaws and I\u2019m definitely a work in progress and doing my best to grow and be better.\"",
      "Johnson's comments come on the heels of lawsuits filed by both Lively and Baldoni following the promotion and release of \"It Ends with Us,\" which premiered in theaters in August 2024.",
      "In December 2024, after rumors of a feud between the two actors circulated for months, Lively, who co-starred and was a producer on \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d filed a\u00a0sexual harassment complaint\u00a0against Baldoni.",
      "Lively followed up by filing a lawsuit against Baldoni, his production company Wayfarer Studios, producer Jamey Heath, Baldoni's publicist Jennifer Abel, crisis publicist Melissa Nathan and others connected to Baldoni and the film, alleging\u00a0she was the victim of sexual harassment and\u00a0a subsequent smear campaign, according to court documents obtained by NBC News.",
      "Baldoni countered by suing Lively, her husband, actor Ryan Reynolds, and other defendants for $400 million, accusing them of defamation and other contractual claims, according to court documents obtained by NBC News.",
      "Both actors' lawsuits will be addressed in a trial set for March 9, 2026, in New York.",
      "Months before the actors filed their lawsuits, Johnson defended Lively as she battled a social media backlash that her lawsuit alleges was orchestrated by Baldoni and his team.",
      "After Johnson posted\u00a0a birthday tribute\u00a0to Lively on Instagram in August 2024, he responded to a commenter who accused Lively, who plays a victim of\u00a0domestic abuse in \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d of \u201cpromoting happiness in a domestic violence setting without any regard for any victims.\"",
      "\"I\u2019m really sorry you feel that way. I\u2019m sure you have a huge heart and want the best,\" Johnson replied, in part. \"I can promise you the truth has not come out yet. Blake worked harder on this film than anything I\u2019ve seen her do in my entire life. Because it meant so much to her.\u201d",
      "In December 2024, Johnson also reportedly called Baldoni, who hosts a podcast called \"Man Enough\" that explores modern masculinity and gender roles,\" a \"fraud\" in a since-deleted post on X, reported USA Today.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a fraud. He puts on the \u2018costume\u2019 of a hero, man bun and all. Used all of the trendy catchphrases & buzz words for his podcasts. None of it\u2019s genuine. It\u2019s all theater. And everyone fell for it. For years,\u201d Johnson wrote, according to the publication.",
      "On Jan. 29, a day after he said he regretted making \"unkind\" remarks, Johnson posted and then deleted a response to an X user who accused of him of apologizing in the interest of \u201cavoiding litigation.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow I\u2019m gonna get sued? for what? I find those type of podcasts phony. I do. That\u2019s not a crime,\u201d Johnson wrote, seemingly referring to his earlier remarks about Baldoni's podcast.",
      "\u201cBut I do feel bad rippin on them. That\u2019s literally all I said. But\u2026 Just like you and all the toxic and hatful comments I get from his fans wishing me and my children harm and calling me all the vile names you can imagine, it\u2019s not a crime. People are free to do so and I\u2019m not mad,\u201d he added."

      "Amanda Riley drew people in with a story.",
      "She presented herself as a young woman and mother of two battling an aggressive blood cancer, Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma \u2014 who, despite her devastating diagnosis, was not giving up, according to a press release from the United States District Court, Northern District of California.",
      "Riley documented every step of her cancer journey on social media and various blogs for years. She shared raw photos of herself receiving cancer treatment, including pictures of herself with IVs and chemo ports at the hospital, as well as photos of herself with a bald head, per the release.",
      "Over the course of eight years, Riley, now 39, hosted numerous fundraisers, both in person and online, gathering hundreds of supporters who donated more than $100,000 to fund her life-saving treatments.",
      "Then, the truth came out: it had all been a scam. Riley had never had Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and she had staged her illness for years to solicit donations for her non-existent cancer expenses. Riley pleaded guilty to wire fraud.",
      "A new four-part documentary, \u201cScamanda,\u201d explores how Rileypulled off her elaborate scheme. The series, which premieres Jan. 30 on ABC News with episodes streaming on Hulu the next day, includes interviews with friends and family members victimized for years by Riley\u2019s deception.",
      "Keep reading to learn more about what Riley was convicted of, what she has said about her crime, and where she is now.",
      "What was Amanda Riley convicted of?",
      "Riley pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud in October 2011. She was sentenced in May 2022 to 60 months in prison, and required to pay restitution to her victims.",
      "The wire fraud conviction stems from Riley\u2019s actions between 2012 and 2019, when she feigned having cancer, per the release. She used Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and a personal blog to document her supposed cancer journey, staging fake treatment photographs and forging medical records and physicians\u2019 letters, according to the district court\u2019s filing.",
      "Throughout these years, she aggressively fundraised online and through in-person events \u2014 supposedly to help fund her expensive treatments, but in reality the money went directly to her personal bank accounts, according to the district court\u2019s filing. More than 300 people, whose names were included in\u00a0Riley\u2019s criminal judgment, raised over $105,000 for Riley.",
      "What have Amanda Riley's victims said?",
      "Four people delivered victim impact statements about how Riley\u2019s schemes affected them over the years, per a transcript from a May 2022 court hearing in San Jose.",
      "One statement came from Jessa Gonzalez, the daughter of Riley\u2019s husband, Cory Riley, from his previous marriage.",
      "Gonzalez was 10 years old when Amanda Riley told her she had cancer, and she recalled feeling \u201cterrified\u201d that her stepmom \u201cwouldn\u2019t be around much longer.\u201d",
      "As the years went on, though, Gonzalez said she began to suspect something was off.",
      "\u201cAmanda was always sick, never being able to get out of bed, but I would never see her go to appointments. She had always looked healthy,\u201d she said. \u201cI noticed she would starve herself until she would pass out.\u201d",
      "Gonzalez said she once found an \u201cIV wrapped in Saran wrap\u201d in her little brother\u2019s playroom, and when she brought it to Riley, her stepmother grew defensive.",
      "\u201cShe quickly took it from me and said my little brother took it out of her nightstand,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u00a0 knew better than to question her, as she (would) regularly lash out at me.\u201d",
      "Gonzalez, who was 19 when she delivered her victim impact statement, said Riley\u2019s longterm deception had made her depressed and severely anxious.",
      "\u201cMy hair is falling out from severe stress, and some days I can\u2019t physically function because of how bad she has scarred me,\u201d she said.",
      "Gonzalez\u2019s mother and Cory Riley\u2019s ex-wife, Aletta Souza, also delivered a victim impact statement reflecting on the emotional damage she said Riley had inflicted on her daughter.",
      "\u201cAmanda Riley would tell my daughter she had a few months to live, and then a miracle, she was in remission, and then again dying, and then remission, and on and on. The toll that takes on a child, and that damage caused, is immeasurable,\u201d she said.",
      "The court also heard victim impact statements from Lindsey Wilder, who frequently donated platelets in honor of Riley, and Lisa Berry, a former friend of Riley.",
      "Berry said Riley told her about her cancer diagnosis in 2010, and asked her and her husband to help pay for life-saving blood tests.",
      "\u201cWe gave her the needed money. Within a couple days, she posted glamorous photos of herself taken by a professional photographer,\u201d Berry said. \u201cI became suspicious that the money I had given her was used to pay for this photo shoot.\u201d",
      "Berry said she and her husband began to see through Riley\u2019s lies, which they found especially upsetting considering that Berry\u2019s husband\u2019s first wife had died from cancer after a long battle with the disease.",
      "They eventually cut all ties with Riley, and said they were dismayed to learn that Riley was telling others in 2012 that she had been newly diagnosed with cancer.",
      "\u201cAmanda Riley was faking cancer and scamming on an even larger scale,\u201d Berry said. \u201cMy husband and I were revolted to learn that this was happening all over again.\u201d",
      "As part of her sentence, Riley was ordered to pay restitution of more than $105,000 to hundreds of people who donated to her fraudulent cancer-related fundraisers. A 2022 court document includes a list of every person owed restitution, including several people who donated small amounts of $10 or $25, and others who donated several thousand dollars to Riley.",
      "What has Amanda Riley said about her actions?",
      "Riley delivered a statement at her sentencing hearing on May 3, 2022, according to the same court transcript.",
      "\u201cYour Honor, there aren\u2019t enough words to adequately express how horrific I feel and how sorry I am that this happened,\u201d she said. \u201cMy heart aches every day, thinking that I did something that hurt other people. This is the worst thing I\u2019ve ever done and the worst mistake I could have made.\u201d",
      "She also said she felt \u201cashamed\u201d by her actions, and said she had \u201cbeen dealing with the repercussions of this for years.\u201d",
      "\u201cI threw away my dream career, lost all my friends and family. I went from being a nobody, to being negatively covered in dozens of tabloids and news articles,\u201d she said.",
      "Riley also said it was time to \u201cstep forward and be accountable.\u201d",

Around the same time, she also started trying out a high-protein diet, which can help with weight loss by keeping you feeling more full and satisfied.",
      "And the original \"American Idol\" made headlines in May 2024 when she revealed that she was taking a medication to assist in her weight loss. She explained that she'd had concerns about using such a drug due to problems with her thyroid but eventually decided to try it. She broke the news on her talk show.",

We exhaust ourselves.\"",

      "She added that she didn\u2019t notice how much weight she\u2019d gained prior to starting the medication. But catching a glimpse of herself on camera one day prompted her to pause and ask herself \u201cWho the f--k is that?\u201d she recalled.",
      "\"My heaviest, I was like 203, and I\u2019m 5 foot 3 and a half,\" Clarkson continued. \"It\u2019s funny because people assume, \u2018Oh she must\u2019ve been miserable, depressed, whatever,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018No I was not.'\"",
      "\u201cI was never insecure about it, I was happy,\u201d she added.",

      "Clarkson was on the receiving end of criticism from those who said she'd previously claimed she lost weight by walking. \"Here's a point about that,\" Goldberg said. \"A lot of people are taking this shot because the need it. Some people need (their) bodies jumpstarted, some have diabetes, there's lots of reasons. She has been walking, but this has helped.\"",
      "Goldberg went on to point out the hypocrisy of the comments. \"They kick her behind when she's bigger, they kick her behind when she's lost the weight, and now they're kicking her behind because she said it out loud.\"",

And 90% of the time I\u2019m really good at it because a protein diet is good for me anyway. I\u2019m a Texas girl, so I like meat \u2014\u00a0sorry, vegetarians in the world!\"",
      "\u201cBut I still splurge. The other night I had a frozen yogurt with my daughter, and it was magical,\" added the Grammy winner, who shares daughter River Rose, 10, and son Remington, 8, with ex-husband Brandon Blackstock.",

      "\u201cI know the industry loves the weight gone, but for me, it wasn\u2019t really the weight,\u201d Clarkson said at the time.",
      "Back then, to lose the weight, Clarkson focused on a lectin-free diet, she told Extra. Lectins are the proteins that bind carbohydrates. (Talk to a health professional before making any major changes to your diet, such as removing carbs.)",
      "Clarkson read a book about lectins and cut them out of her diet which meant no legumes, beans, whole grains, dairy and certain veggies.",

      "Having\u00a0prediabetes\u00a0means your blood sugar levels are higher than normal but still lower than the range for Type 2 diabetes, according to the\u00a0Cleveland Clinic. Exercise and a healthy diet can help reduce the risk of it progressing.",
      "Kelly Clarkson's weight struggles",
      "Throughout her years in Hollywood, the \"American Idol\" star has had to deal with a lot of commentary about her size.",
      "She told Glamour UK in 2020 that being thin doesn't always give her more confidence, adding that she got her coaching role on \"The Voice\" after gaining some weight.",
      "\u201cI got on the No. 1 television show at my heaviest point, because it was right after I had kids, and it was like they didn\u2019t care,\u201d Clarkson said.",
      "\u201cPaul (Telegdy, chairman of NBC Entertainment) hired me from NBC because he loved my personality, he loved that I connect with people and I\u2019m really raw and real. It had nothing to do with my sex appeal or my look aesthetically. It had to do with me as a person. I think it\u2019s really up to artists to force people to have that mentality.\u201d",
      "Clarkson and TODAY's Jenna Bush Hager bonded over weight struggles when Jenna and her twin sister, Barbara Pierce Bush, appeared on \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\" in November 2023.",

      "The film\u2019s director and editor have defended their use of AI, arguing that the technology was not exploitative, but was merely employed to enhance their sound-editing abilities in post-production.",
      "Keep reading to learn more about the AI controversy surrounding \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d",
      "How exactly was AI used in \u2018The Brutalist\u2019?",
      "Artificial intelligence was used in \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d to enhance the Hungarian accents of stars Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones.",
      "The movie\u2019s editor, D\u00e1vid Jancs\u00f3, said that while Brody and Jones spoke Hungarian in the movie, AI was used at times to tweak their pronunciation of certain difficult vowels.",
      "\u201cI am a native Hungarian speaker and I know that it is one of the most difficult languages to learn to pronounce. \u2026 It\u2019s an extremely unique language,\u201d\u00a0 Jancs\u00f3 said in a recent interview with film technology website RedShark. \u201cWe coached (Brody and Jones) and they did a fabulous job but we also wanted to perfect it so that not even locals will spot any difference.\u201d",
      "Jancs\u00f3 added that he and his team first tried using ADR, or automated dialogue replacement, to fix certain Hungarian sounds. ADR is commonly used in filmmaking, and it involves re-recording pieces of dialogue and syncing them with actors\u2019 visual performances to improve sound quality.",
      "The use of ADR wasn\u2019t successful in \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d Jancs\u00f3 said, and he added that attempts to completely dub Brody and Jones\u2019 dialogue using the voices of other actors \u201cjust didn\u2019t work.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, filmmakers worked with a Ukrainian software company, Respeecher, to generate certain pieces of the stars\u2019 Hungarian dialogue using AI.",
      "Jancs\u00f3 says he even contributed his own voice for some of the pronunciations.",
      "\u201cMost of their Hungarian dialogue has a part of me talking in there. We were very careful about keeping their performances,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s mainly just replacing letters here and there. You can do this in ProTools yourself, but we had so much dialogue in Hungarian that we really needed to speed up the process otherwise we\u2019d still be in post.\u201d",
      "RedShark also reported that Generative AI, or GenAI, was used to create architectural drawings and buildings near the end of the film. However, the film\u2019s director, Brady Corbet, later told Deadline that AI was not used in this way in the movie, and that all images \u201cwere hand-drawn by artists.\u201d",
      "Why was there controversy about the use of AI in 'The Brutalist'?Some viewers have criticized the use of AI in \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d arguing that it undercuts the film\u2019s authenticity.",

      "Another X user argued that Brody \u2014 who won a Golden Globe and has been nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th \u2014 should not be eligible for these accolades because his Hungarian accent was digitally altered.",
      "\u201cMy take on The Brutalist AI thing is it\u2019s a slippery slope to award Adrian Brody knowing his accent was edited with AI,\u201d the user wrote. \u201cIMO altering a performance with AI like that should automatically disqualify someone from these awards shows.\u201d",
      "Others questioned why native Hungarian speakers weren\u2019t cast in the main roles.",
      "\u201cThe brutalist and its actors should\u2019ve become ineligible the minute it came out that AI was used on their voices to help them produce a more authentic\u2019 hungarian accent when there are hungarian actors and speakers in the industry they could\u2019ve used instead,\u201d an X user wrote.",
      "Others on social media defending the film\u2019s use of AI, arguing that enhancing actors\u2019 Hungarian pronunciation did not detract from their performances.",
      "\u201cMy take on Adrien Brody\u2019s AI-helped accent in The Brutalist: it\u2019s complicated. On one hand, it slightly diminishes the detailing, but I can\u2019t say the accent was a deciding factor in his performance\u2019s resonance,\u201d one X user said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t moved by the accent; I was moved by how he conveyed emotion.\u201d",
      "Others argued that using AI to tweak the dialogue in post-production was just a form of clever sound editing.",
      "\u201cI love how the filmmakers went to extra lengths to coach, explore variants of ADR, and then discovered this as the best, subtle and sensitive solution. Brody and Jones don\u2019t seem to have any concerns either \u2014 it\u2019s just good old sound editing, accelerated,\u201d one X user said.",
      "Another X user argued that the film\u2019s use of artificial intelligence was a \u201cgreat example of using AI tools to enhance well-known art creation process, not replace it!\u201d",
      "Ethical questions around the use of AI in the entertainment industry have come to the forefront in recent years.",
      "When writers and actors went on strike in 2023, they demanded stricter regulations around the use of AI, seeking protection for artists whose work or likenesses are used as source material for AI, such as to create AI \u201cdeepfakes.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Thanks to Katy Perry's 4-year-old daughter, Daisy, the \"Fireworks\" singer is planning on implementing an earlier start time for her global \"Lifetimes Tour.\"",
      "While talking with \"Access Hollywood\" host Kit Hoover, Perry said that Daisy made her realize just how important it is to go to bed on time.",
      "She revealed this when Hoover asked Perry if Daisy was going to be on tour with her.",
      "\"She'll be there for a part of it, but\u00a0I think what\u00a0I\u2019m really going to implement is an\u00a0earlier time show,\u201d the \"California Gurls\" singer said. \u201cNow that I understand it \u2014 all the dynamics and all of the\u00a0different variables and layers of bringing your kids out to the show.",
      "\u201cSometimes those shows are on weekdays, and they go to school the next day, and they probably will have some sugar at the show, and they\u2019ll be with their friends, and everybody will be super excited, so it\u2019s going to be an 8:30 show,\u201d Perry said.",
      "Perry noted that her \"vibe\" has changed a lot since becoming a mom, so she's no longer interested in starting her shows around 9 or 9:15 p.m. As a mother, she fully understands how hard it is to get a kid ready for bed.",
      "\"Now, it takes an hour for bedtime, at least. You're like, 'OK, another book, another song. All of it! Do you want a banana now? OK, water, yes! Stuffy? Don't you have six in the bed? There's six stuffies, how many more stuffies?!'\" she joked.",
      "Perry shares Daisy with her fianc\u00e9, Orlando Bloom, and she said their kid is just as \"extroverted\" as she and her beau are.",
      "However, she said she doesn't think that she'll bring Daisy onstage with her during the tour.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s not shy, and she loves to sing. And I literally was checking my phone five minutes ago, and she has a ukulele in her hands. So, she loves music and she loves what mommy does and daddy does, and she loves seeing us happy,\u201d Perry said.",
      "One celebrity who will be delighted to know that Perry is starting her concerts earlier is Jamie Lee Curtis. In 2023, the \u201cHalloween\u201d star spoke to TODAY's Savannah Guthrie and former co-anchor Hoda Kotb about her schedule and said she doesn't enjoy going to events at night.",
      "\u201cI would love to go see Coldplay. I would love it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe problem is, I\u2019m not going to see Coldplay if they start their show at 9:00 and there\u2019s an opening act. I want to hear Coldplay at 1:00 p.m.,\" she said.",
      "Curtis noted that she loves to wake up early so that she can \u201ccontrol the universe in the morning.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the time when my brain is working and it\u2019s really quiet and nobody else is up and around,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only people I bother (are) on the East Coast and they\u2019re still waking up, so it\u2019s perfect.\u201d"

Hamas had not provided the names of the first hostages it planned to free that afternoon, so Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered airstrikes to continue.",

She shared a video with NBC News showing three of her daughters walking down a dusty road carrying yellow plastic jerry cans to collect water. Sama struggles to keep up with the older girls, wiping sweat and dust from her eyes as she approaches the camera.",
      "\u201cShe had been asking for more than two months to eat a banana,\u201d Hanan said. \u201cI took her and bought her a small banana. She wanted pizza, so I bought her a small piece for 2 shekels (55 cents). I told her to eat it in the street so that her siblings wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d",

      "The police in Gaza fall under the Hamas-controlled Interior Ministry, and enforce laws set by the militant group after it took control of the Strip in 2007. Israel considers members of the police force to be Hamas terrorists and legitimate military targets, even though some officers also carry out more mundane duties like traffic enforcement and crime prevention.",
      "So the Israel Defense Forces repeatedly targeted police officers early in its 15-month military campaign, which it launched after Hamas killed 1,200 people and took around 250 hostage in the Oct. 7, terrorist attack, according to Israeli tallies.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Few people understand what may be going through the minds of North Korean soldiers fighting and dying for Russia in the war against Ukraine. But Lee Chul Eun is one of them.",
      "Lee, 38, a North Korean defector and former soldier now living in South Korea, said it is \u201cdevastating\u201d to see troops from the reclusive, communist-ruled North being sent abroad by leader Kim Jong Un, \u201conly to then give up their youth for a land that is not even theirs but the foreign land of Russia.\u201d",
      "He is one of multiple defectors who spoke to NBC News about the training, conditions and mindset of North Korean soldiers, including their willingness to take their own lives if necessary.",
      "Lee said his former colleagues \u201care essentially just sent out to be cannon fodder on the front lines.\u201d",
      "For the first time since they arrived in Russia in the fall, North Korean soldiers have been captured alive by Ukrainian forces, with video and photos showing one man with bandages around his jawline and another with bandaged hands.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who announced the prisoners\u2019 apprehension earlier this month, said they were living proof that North Korea had entered the war, in a major escalation of the yearslong conflict.",
      "The U.S. and allies say there are more than 11,000 North Korean troops fighting in the Russian region of Kursk, where Ukrainian forces launched a cross-border incursion in August. Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang has confirmed the reports.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it is not easy to capture a North Korean soldier,\u201d Ryu Sung Hyu said in an interview in the South Korean capital, Seoul.",
      "All North Korean recruits are taught a song that includes a verse about saving their last bullet for themselves to avoid capture, said Ryu, who served in the North Korean military until 2019, when he escaped to freedom in South Korea.",
      "According to South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service, there was at least one recent incident in which a North Korean soldier, faced with possible capture by Ukrainian forces, tried to detonate a grenade while shouting Kim\u2019s name but was killed before he could succeed.",
      "The South Korean military said last week that North Korea is preparing to send additional troops to Russia after about 300 of its soldiers were killed and 2,700 others were injured. The high casualty rate was due to the soldiers\u2019 poor understanding of modern warfare, as well as the way they were being deployed by Russia, South Korean lawmakers said.",
      "Their willingness to fight and die for Russia could be a major factor in determining the course of the Ukraine war, as well as the level of American military aid to Ukraine under President Donald Trump, who has expressed skepticism over continued U.S. support.Kim is thought to be providing Russian President Vladimir Putin with troops and weapons in hope of receiving technical assistance with his nuclear and ballistic missile programs. His flurry of weapons testing has continued with three launches already this year, including multiple short-range ballistic missiles, a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile and strategic cruise missiles.",
      "Trump drew ire from South Korea on Tuesday after he described the reclusive regime as a \u201cnuclear power,\u201d a phrase that U.S. officials have long refrained from using, as it could signal recognition of North Korea as a nuclear-armed state.",
      "Kim is sending troops to Russia for two reasons, \u201cboth of which are driven by desperation,\u201d said Ahn Chan Il, who served in the North Korean military for over a decade and defected to South Korea in 1979. The first is to earn foreign currency, which is in short supply in North Korea under United Nations sanctions imposed over its weapons programs.The deployment also provides valuable experience for the North Korean military, which has not been deployed overseas since the Vietnam War.",
      "Dorothy Camille Shea, the deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council this month that fighting alongside Russia makes North Korea \u201cmore capable of waging war against its neighbors.\u201d",
      "Lee, who spent five years in the North Korean military, said the troops had been sent to Russia as mercenaries rather than soldiers, noting that they weren\u2019t wearing their uniforms. South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service has said they were given Russian military uniforms and Russian-made weapons, along with forged identification documents.",
      "\u201cEven if they die there it does not matter, because North Korea sent them out without officially recognizing them,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThey were sent there not to bring honor to the country, but to give up their lives and bring back lots of money.\u201d",
      "'No longer a part of the society'",
      "Military service is compulsory in North Korea, which has one of the world\u2019s largest standing armies. Soldiers undergo three months of basic training before being assigned to a unit, said Lee, who came to South Korea in 2016 after swimming for six hours from the North.",
      "\u201cAs soldiers,\u201d Lee said, \u201cthey are told they are individuals who are now no longer a part of the society and their families, and must follow the orders of the supreme leader,\u201d meaning Kim.",
      "They have no trouble believing this, having been indoctrinated by North Korean propaganda from childhood, said Lee.",
      "North Korean soldiers spend most of their time not actually being soldiers but working on farms and construction projects, Lee and others said.",
      "\u201cI think I only fired three bullets per year,\u201d said Lee Hyun-seung, who served in the North Korean military for more than three years. When he moved to a more elite unit, he said, \u201cwe had more like 20 bullets.\u201dAsked whether he thought the North Korean troops could help Russia win the war, Lee \u2014 whose family defected in 2014 and who now lives in the U.S. \u2014 was skeptical.",
      "\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not that sure,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I know their training and I know they are not well trained.\u201d",
      "For North Korean soldiers, who receive food and clothing but are otherwise essentially unpaid, the main enemy is hunger.",
      "North Korea struggles with food shortages as Kim devotes the majority of resources to his weapons programs, meaning that, like most of the broader population, soldiers suffer from malnutrition and can even starve to death.",
      "Meals are made up mainly of plain rice, corn or potatoes, sometimes mixed with grass or even tree bark, said Lee Chun Eul.",
      "He said his feelings about North Korea changed gradually, largely due to his exposure to foreign media that finds its way into the country despite tight government controls \u2014 \u201cJames Bond\u201d was a favorite of his growing up in the 1990s. More recently, the North Korean government has been alarmed by the popularity of South Korean TV dramas, sentencing two teenagers to 12 years of hard labor for watching them.",
      "\u201cWhen I look at North Korean mercenaries sent to Russia, I wonder if they would still have joined if they had watched as much foreign media as I did in North Korea,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI also wonder if the North Korean regime and Kim Jong Un\u2019s dictatorship would still be in place.\u201d",
      "The defectors say they hope the North Korean troops fighting in Russia will take the opportunity to leave like they did.",
      "\u201cWhen North Korean workers, who have lived their entire lives trapped in a restrictive system, experience life abroad, they come to see North Korea as nothing short of a prison,\u201d Ahn said. \u201cOnce they realize what freedom could mean, it\u2019s hard to imagine they wouldn\u2019t consider breaking free to live a freer life.\u201dIn addition to finding freedom, they could provide the U.S. and others with valuable intelligence regarding the North Korean military\u2019s strategies and capabilities, which are often exaggerated by the North Korean government.",
      "Ahn and other North Koreans who defected as soldiers have offered Ukraine their assistance against the North Korean troops.",
      "\u201cHowever, rather than directly participating in the war, our focus is on psychological warfare to change the mindset of North Korean soldiers,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough platforms like YouTube or leaflets, we aim to deliver messages to the North Korean troops, urging them not to die meaningless deaths and instead seek freedom.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, they watch with heavy hearts as casualties mount among North Korean soldiers whose experiences they know only too well.",
      "\u201cThese young people did not go knowing they were going to die,\u201d Lee said, \u201cbut died because they did not know.",
      "Janis Mackey Frayer and Stella Kim reported from Seoul, South Korea, and Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong."

    "summary": "Inside the Auschwitz, Soviet soldiers liberated roughly 7,000 prisoners who had been brutalized by a Nazi regime hell-bent on exterminating the Jewish people.",
    "story": [
      "O\u015aWI\u0118CIM, Poland \u2014 The Soviet Red Army troops who arrived here on Jan. 27, 1945, helped uncover one of the greatest atrocities ever committed by \u2014 and against \u2014 humankind.",
      "Inside the Auschwitz concentration camp complex, the soldiers liberated roughly 7,000 prisoners who had been brutalized by a Nazi regime hell-bent on exterminating the Jewish people. The horrors there defied comprehension.",
      "Eighty years later, some former prisoners returned to mark the 80th anniversary of their deliverance \u2014 a date that is known as International Holocaust Remembrance Day.",
      "In the eyes of so many around the world, the survivors\u2019 very existence is a resounding act of defiance against the world-historic cruelty and vast injustice of Adolf Hitler\u2019s reign of terror. Their stories of survival are also implicit pleas to the world: Never forget humanity\u2019s capacity to commit unthinkable crimes.",
      "Hitler\u2019s regime systematically murdered 6 million Jews during World War II, including roughly 1 million people at Auschwitz. The Nazis also persecuted other peoples, including Poles, the Romani, Soviet prisoners, gay men and mentally and physically disabled people.",
      "The Nazis tried to hide evidence of the genocide they perpetrated, including burning the remains of roughly 900,000 Auschwitz victims who were killed in the gas chambers.",
      "Eva Umlauf was only 2 when she and her mother were liberated from the camp \u2014 too young to remember the actual day. But the Holocaust is etched onto her skin \u2014 A-26,959 tattooed on her left forearm, marking her for life, along with some other Auschwitz survivors.",
      "\u201cYou are just a number,\u201d Umlauf, 82, a pediatrician from Munich, told NBC News, explaining how this number will forever make her feel. \u201cBut this number is not only on the skin. This is deeper.\u201d",
      "For Umlauf, who traveled for the ceremony along with her sister, her son and one of her grandchildren, this was more than a personal journey of memory and reflection. It was a moral responsibility.",
      "\u201cThey have to know that it\u2019s true. You know, because it\u2019s so, so unbelievable, unbelievable that nobody can believe this,\u201d she said.",
      "But even given what has been established about the Third Reich\u2019s crimes against humanity, some of the most vital information has still not been uncovered. Notably, the names of more than a million Jews slaughtered by the Nazis are still unknown, according to Yad Vashem, Israel\u2019s official Holocaust memorial center.",
      "Alexander Avram leads a team at Yad Vashem that has amassed more than 2 million \u201cPages of Testimony\u201d and historical documents to verify more identities. The project is known as the Hall of Names.",
      "\u201cThere are no cemeteries, there are no tombstones \u2026 for most of the Holocaust victims,\u201d Avram told NBC News. \u201cEach additional name that we can recover is, for us, another victory against the Nazis, because the Nazis didn\u2019t [only] want to \u2026 exterminate the Jews physically. They wanted to obliterate even their memory.\u201d",
      "Avram said researchers have started experimenting with artificial intelligence to scour testimonial documents in hope of finding names that might have been overlooked. But that technology is useless without firsthand accounts provided by the shrinking pool of survivors.",
      "The Claims Conference estimates that only 1,000 survivors of Auschwitz are still alive. In that regard, Avram\u2019s team is \u201cin a rush against time,\u201d he said.",
      "The anniversary comes at a troubling and unsettled time. Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack on Israel, Israel\u2019s ensuing war in Gaza and the proliferation of hate speech on social media have fueled a worldwide spike in antisemitism.",
      "In some countries, basic knowledge of the Holocaust is eroding.",
      "The Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, a nonprofit organization that helps Holocaust victims seek compensation, released an eight-country survey last week showing that 46% of adults ages 18-29 in France, for example, \u201chad not heard or weren\u2019t sure if they had heard of the Holocaust prior to taking the survey.\u201d",
      "Nearly half of Americans surveyed were unable to name a single Nazi camp, according to the Claims Conference\u2019s findings, and more than a quarter (26%) of Americans ages 18-29 disagreed with the following statement: \u201cThe Holocaust happened, and the number of Jews who were killed during the Holocaust has been accurately and fairly described.\u201d",
      "World leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, flew in for Monday\u2019s commemoration. Top dignitaries, including Britain's King Charles III, attended, as well.",
      "\u201cWe really believe that this is the last milestone anniversary where we\u2019ll have a visible group of survivors who are still able to tell us their stories,\u201d Pawe\u0142 Sawicki, deputy spokesman for the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum, said in an interview at the camp Saturday.",
      "\u201cThe choice for this year\u2019s anniversary was very simple: We need to put them into the spotlight,\u201d he added.",
      "In recent statements, Western heads of state have tried to underscore the importance of preserving the historical memory of the Holocaust, known in Hebrew as the Shoah.",
      "\u201cI am against turning the page, saying that was long ago,\u201d German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said at a gathering of the Jewish community in Frankfurt this month. \u201cWe keep alive the memory of the civilizational split of the Shoah committed by Germans, which we pass down to each generation in our country again and again.\u201d",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited the grounds of Auschwitz on Jan. 17, describing the \u201csheer horror\u201d he felt there and vowing to fight the rising tide of antisemitism in his country.",
      "Roughly 50 survivors of Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps attended Monday\u2019s commemoration. In recent days, hundreds of visitors from around the world have come to the former camp to pay their respects.",
      "Josh Sesar, 52, of Los Angeles, who made his second trip to Auschwitz on Friday, said he believed it is vital to see the grounds firsthand.",
      "\u201cI think it is not taught enough in school in America, and if you watch the news in America now, you see the philosophies that people are following now and they are happy to pretend that this never happened,\u201d Sesar said.",
      "\u201cIt is scary, because there are not so many survivors left, and so when there [are] no survivors, people even more so try to discredit history,\u201d he added.",
      "Aron Krell, 98, a Holocaust survivor who was imprisoned at Auschwitz and ultimately liberated from the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria, said it is incumbent on Jewish people, educators, historians and other advocates to keep the legacy of the Shoah intact.",
      "In a video interview last week, Krell described his liberation as his \u201csecond birthday.\u201d",
      "\u201cI saw the light again in front of me,\u201d Krell said. \u201cMy second birthday is more important, really, than the first. We always celebrate it: Aron Krell has two birthdays.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 All over Europe, there are signs of a continent steeling itself for the unthinkable.",
      "Lithuania plans to lay mines on its bridges to Russia, ready to detonate should Kremlin tanks try to cross. In the nearby Baltic Sea, NATO ships are hunting Russia\u2019s so-called \u201cShadow Fleet\u201d accused of cutting undersea communications cables. And in Europe\u2019s skies there are plans to construct a vast missile defense system, similar to Israel\u2019s \u201cIron Dome\u201d but with the explicit purpose of shooting down rockets launched by Moscow.",
      "European governments and citizens worry that an emboldened Kremlin may turn his armies their way after Ukraine. There is also widespread nervousness that the new U.S. president \u2014 an isolationist \u2014 has suggested he may not defend America\u2019s historical NATO allies if they are attacked by Russia.",
      "While President Donald Trump this week criticized Vladimir Putin,  Trump has showed few signs of a meaningful shift from that position. On Thursday, he said in an interview with Fox News that Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u201cwas fighting a much bigger entity,\u201d and that \u201che shouldn\u2019t have done that, because we could have made a deal.\u201d",
      "He said little new about NATO or Europe, only reiterating his latest demand for European allies to pay 5% of their GDP toward defense \u2014 more than twice the NATO recommendation \u2014 and lamenting how much more Washington has spent than Brussels toward supporting Ukraine\u2019s defense.",
      "\u201cNATO has to pay more,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous because it affects them a lot more. We have an ocean in between.\u201d",
      "The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. European officials have repeatedly stated that Putin is preparing for a war with the West. For many, this is already happening, with think tank analysts, governments and NATO itself accusing Moscow of \u201chybrid warfare\u201d attacks \u2014 from election interference to trying to crash airliners with firebombs.",
      "\u201cThe Europeans are taking this very seriously,\u201d said retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe between 2014 and late 2017.",
      "In particular, countries in Eastern Europe nearer the Russian border \u201cknow that this is for real, because they live there,\u201d Hodges added. \u201cIt\u2019s only those people who live in Western Europe or the U.S., far away from the Bear, who say: \u2018Come on, this is not going to happen.\u2019\u201d",
      "The core tenet of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is that allies will defend any fellow member under attack. The only time this \u201cArticle 5\u201d promise has been triggered was after 9/11, when Europe helped the United States patrol its skies in an act of solidarity. The main message of that stipulation is that if a country attacks Europe, it will also be at war with Washington, and its intended audience is Russia.",
      "But Trump has repeatedly suggested he would ignore Europe\u2019s distress call.",
      "Plenty of those in Europe\u2019s corridors of power agree that a complacent continent has for too long relied on Washington\u2019s protection. French President Emmanuel Macron, a longtime proponent of European self-reliance,\u00a0said Monday that Trump\u2019s second term should serve as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for the continent.",
      "In comments made at a defense conference on Wednesday, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, agreed with Trump\u2019s assessment of European spending, saying that \u201cRussia poses an existential threat to our security today, tomorrow and for as long as we underinvest in our defense.\u201d",
      "Many of these critics remain nonetheless alarmed.",
      "\u201cWhile every president has complained that European countries don\u2019t do enough, there never was a question about American commitment,\u201d said Hodges. \u201cThis causes a lot of anxiety.\u201d",
      "In the short term, Trump and key members of his incoming administration have vowed to quickly end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, likely impossible without huge territorial concessions from Kyiv. Effectively giving Russia a win would be a signal to the Kremlin that aggression is rewarded and the West has no appetite to intervene, critics say.",
      "\u201cRussia is preparing for a war with the West,\u201d German foreign intelligence chief Bruno Kahl said in a November speech.",
      "For years, experts and government officials have accused Moscow of spreading disinformation, launching cyberattacks and using any other means necessary to meddle in the elections of democratic countries.",
      "Though Moscow denies it. Western officials and experts are near united in agreeing that this campaign only seems to be expanding.",
      "Last month, Finnish authorities seized an oil tanker they suspected of having severed undersea power and internet cables. That was among a spate of incidents that prompted NATO to launch operation \u201cBaltic Sentry,\u201d stepping up maritime patrols.",
      "Meanwhile, Western officials said Russia was responsible for sending two incendiary devices to DHL logistics hubs in Germany and the United Kingdom in July as part of a wider sabotage campaign to possibly start fires aboard North America-bound aircraft.",
      "In response, Europe has reversed decades of military underfunding, with most of its big powers now hitting the NATO guideline of 2% of GDP spent on defense. Spending started to increase in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea, although Trump is widely credited for accelerating it.",
      "On Wednesday, the European Union\u2019s defense commissioner, Andrius Kubilius, announced that Lithuania intends to spend between 5% and 6% of its GDP on defense in the coming years.",
      "Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has focused minds further.",
      "In March, the European Union allocated 500 million euros (around $515 million) to double shell ammunition production to 2 million units per year. And 22 countries have now joined the European Sky Shield Initiative, a continentwide missile defense system designed to protect against Russian attacks.",
      "\u201cEurope must be prepared for the most extreme military contingencies,\u201d a spokesperson for the bloc told NBC News in an email when asked whether the continent was preparing for a worst-case scenario of war with Russia. \u201cPut simply: to prevent war we need to spend more. If we wait more, it\u2019ll cost us more.\u201d",
      "Asked if that change was prompted by Trump\u2019s suggestion he may not defend Europe as well as Putin, the spokesperson referred only to the Russian president, whose war in Ukraine they said \u201cchallenges the international rules-based order itself.\u201d",
      "For its part, Ukraine\u2019s reaction to the re-election and inauguration of Trump has been assiduously diplomatic. On Inauguration Day, Zelenskyy said in a post on X that Trump \u201cis always decisive\u201d and that his second term was an opportunity to \u201cachieve a long-term and just peace.\u201d",
      "Whatever the impetus, \u201cthe mindset has changed big time,\u201d said Vytis Jurkonis, who leads the Lithuanian office of Freedom House, an international pro-democracy group.",
      "\u201cWe need to make it very clear to the Kremlin that any attack against a NATO member is going to cost and have consequences,\u201d said Jurkonis, who also teaches politics at Lithuania\u2019s Vilnius University.",
      "The Baltic countries of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are particularly vulnerable, perched on the Baltic Sea between mainland Russia and the heavily militarized Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.",
      "For decades occupied by the Soviet Union, these now-Westernized states are only now constructing \u201cthe Baltic Defense Line,\u201d a frontier hundreds of miles long dotted with anti-tank trenches and pillboxes. Lithuania has already purchased warehouses full of \u201cdragon\u2019s teeth\u201d \u2014 concrete pyramids designed to stop tanks \u2014 and plans to mine its bridges to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, its defense ministry told NBC News.",
      "Lithuania recently said it would raise defense spending to 5% of GDP, the highest in NATO and far more, proportionally, than Washington\u2019s 3.4%. That\u2019s still lower than Russia, with the Kremlin effectively reordering its economy along a war footing and committing at least 6.2% of its inflation-hit finances to its military.",
      "In western Scandinavia, meanwhile, Norway has updated its emergency preparedness booklet that it hands out to all citizens, telling them how much water, food and other supplies to stockpile in case of \u201cacts of war.\u201d The 20-page document has historically focused on extreme weather and accidents, but its most recent version notes that \u201cwe live in an increasingly turbulent world\u201d and warns that \u201cin the event of an act of war, you may be notified that you should seek shelter.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Swedish church authorities \u2014 on guidance from Sweden\u2019s armed forces \u2014 have begun looking for extra cemetery space should such a conflict reach their shores. And Germany committed around 100 million euros to reinstate public sirens that were removed when the Iron Curtain fell.",
      "And yet there are plenty of observers who believe that Europe is not doing nearly enough.",
      "Western European countries such as Germany, France and the United Kingdom have only committed \u201csmall percentage uplifts to defense budgets, which is nothing like the transformative investment\u201d in Eastern Europe, said Keir Giles, a leading defense analyst at London\u2019s Chatham House think tank.",
      "For Giles, author of \u201cWho Will Defend Europe? An Awakened Russia and a Sleeping Continent,\u201d the problem is that \u201ccountries further away are still pretending that war is something that happens to other people.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s more, efforts are further complicated by the political situation. Europe\u2019s mainstream parties are being challenged by populists, who often mix their vehement opposition to immigration with a softer \u2014 and sometimes even friendly \u2014 stance toward Russia.",
      "That\u2019s a problem for those who argue Russia\u2019s war on Europe has already begun.",
      "\u201cAnybody who isn\u2019t worried hasn\u2019t been paying attention,\u201d said Giles."

      "For the first time in decades, there is not a single woman among the 24 members of the Politburo, the senior leadership of the ruling Chinese Communist Party.\u00a0President Xi Jinping has personally called on women to embrace a \u201cchildbearing culture\u201d as the world\u2019s once-most-populous country struggles with low birth rates.",
      "The government has made no secret of its crackdown on feminist activity. In June, Chinese journalist and #MeToo activist Huang Xueqin was sentenced to five years in prison for subversion.",
      "But even Chinese state media had praise for \u201cHer Story,\u201d a feminist comedy directed by and starring women that was a box-office hit in China late last year. The state-run newspaper People\u2019s Daily lauded the film\u2019s portrayal of the \u201chumorous and absurd\u201d aspects of daily life.",
      "The film has been described as China\u2019s answer to the 2023 hit \u201cBarbie,\u201d openly calling out stereotypes about women, sexuality, single parenting and divorce \u2014 all issues that can be sensitive here.",
      "\u201cHer Story\u201d may be able to get around that in part because its social critique is couched in comedy, said Feng Yuan, the founding director of Beijing Equality, a women\u2019s rights and gender equality nongovernment organization.",
      "In addition to helping evade censors, comedy is a \u201chandy tool to speak out your anger,\u201d she said.",
      "The film tells the story of Wang Tiemei, a newly unemployed single mother of a 9-year-old daughter, and their young female neighbor Xiao Ye in Shanghai. Despite their different personalities, the two women form a strong bond as they navigate personal challenges, including Wang\u2019s abusive ex-husband.",
      "Its frank tone has also inspired discussions about female sexuality akin to those set off by recent U.S. films such as the Nicole Kidman-starring erotic thriller \u201cBabygirl.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty rare to see stories about single moms or just women\u2019s lives in general,\u201d Zhang Tong, 25, said at a Beijing theater last month after seeing \u201cHer Story,\u201d which she called \u201cquite moving.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will help more women, especially young women, understand themselves better and feel empowered to live for themselves,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cHer Story\u201d has made 720 million yuan ($99 million) since its release on Nov. 22, according to the Chinese box office site Maoyan, and has a score of 9.1 out of 10 on Douban, a Chinese film rating site.",
      "Though the film did not crack China\u2019s top 10 highest-grossing films last year, another movie directed by and starring women, \u201cYolo,\u201d topped the list at 3.4 billion yuan ($470 million). Its director, Chinese comedian Jia Ling, also directed the 2021 female-oriented comedy \u201cHi, Mom,\u201d which grossed more than 5.4 billion yuan ($742 million), making her the world\u2019s top-grossing female filmmaker until Greta Gerwig with \u201cBarbie.\u201d",
      "The success of these films marks a shift in the Chinese box office, the second-largest in the world after the United States, where the biggest movies have typically been male-dominated, patriotism-themed blockbusters.",
      "\u201cMy movie delivers something different from others, showing some novelty, so people like it,\u201d Shao Yihui, the director of \u201cHer Story,\u201d told state-run broadcaster CCTV.",
      "Women who perform stand-up comedy in China say they are also offering something different in an industry that only a few years ago was a sea of men.",
      "Wang said her jokes are informed partly by her experience as a woman.",
      "\u201cFor example, earlier I had a bit where I made fun of those awful guys who think everyone in the world is into them,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve also done material on topics like period stigma.\u201d",
      "She cited the influence of Yang Li, who is perhaps the most recognizable female figure in Chinese stand-up comedy. At her peak, she performed in front of millions of viewers on national television, delivering punchlines on the male psyche.",
      "\u201cI think what she and other everyday female comedians talk about, especially from a female perspective, really reflects the current state of society,\u201d Wang said. \u201cTheir material brings attention to issues women face, and you can clearly see how those jokes resonate with people.\u201d",
      "But they don\u2019t resonate with everyone.",
      "In October, Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com ended a promotional campaign featuring Yang after men offended by her ribbing flooded social media with complaints and accused of her of provoking \u201cgender antagonism,\u201d a term also used by Chinese state media to criticize feminism.",
      "As feminists have raised their voices in China, so have those with misogynist views, Feng said, and Yang made for a clear target.",
      "\u201cThey are always looking for some outlet to release their anger,\u201d she said.",
      "Chinese comedians say they have to be mindful of censors as well as fragile egos and cultural sensitivities. In 2023, a Chinese entertainment firm representing a stand-up comic was fined almost $2 million after he was accused of insulting the People\u2019s Liberation Army during a Beijing performance. The entire industry went to ground for more than a year, with stand-up comedy not returning to Chinese television until last fall.",
      "\u201cFor a Chinese audience, a lot of topics, it is kind of like we are not sure if we can laugh at that,\u201d said Nico Toomuch, 34, a stand-up comedian in Beijing.",
      "That hasn\u2019t stopped Toomuch, who has been performing since 2016, from joking about everything from marriage to menstruation and depression \u2014 drawing in part on her strengths as a woman.",
      "\u201cWe are more sensitive, emotional, and we are better at observing things,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we can take a joke, so we can deliver one.\u201d"

      "Putin\u2019s repetition of his claim that Zelenskyy is not Ukraine\u2019s legitimate leader appear to stem in part from the martial law banning elections that Zelenskyy imposed after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion Feb. 24, 2022.",

      "So how did a little-known startup become a global AI sensation?",
      "Based in the Chinese tech hub of Hangzhou, DeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, who is also the founder of a hedge fund called High-Flyer that uses AI-driven trading strategies.",

      "By 2022, High-Flyer had acquired 10,000 of Nvidia\u2019s high-performance A100 graphics processor chips, according to a post that July on the Chinese social media platform WeChat. The U.S. imposed restrictions on sales of those chips to China later that year.",
      "Liang told 36Kr that he acquired the chips mostly because of \u201ccuriosity about the boundaries of AI capabilities\u201d and that he had no particular commercial goal in mind.",
      "The stock market rout took place a week after DeepSeek\u2019s Jan. 20 release of an open-source language model called R1, which met with widespread acclaim in what venture capitalist Marc Andreessen called \u201cAI\u2019s Sputnik moment.\u201d",
      "Investors and the U.S. tech industry were further unnerved later in the week when DeepSeek published a technical report that said the model took only two months and less than $6 million to build, compared with the billions spent by leading U.S. tech companies.",
      "The comparatively small spend by DeepSeek showed \"a lot of optimization and smart, capable engineering that can be implemented and deployed to keep up in this race,\" Kevin Xu, the U.S.-based founder of Interconnected Capital, a hedge fund that invests in artificial intelligence technologies, told NBC News.",

      "New users were quick to note that R1 appeared subject to censorship around topics deemed sensitive in China, avoiding answering questions about the self-ruled democratic island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims is part of its territory, or the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown or echoing Chinese government language. The model appears to operate without such restrictions, however, if it is used not through the DeepSeek website but on servers that host it outside mainland China.",
      "DeepSeek did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.",
