      "The decision stems from a lawsuit filed in Manhattan in 2022 after New York state instituted a one-year window for people to file lawsuits over sexual assault claims even if they took place decades ago.",
      "It marks one of the largest jury awards since the advent of the #MeToo movement, as well as in New York state history, said attorney Brad Beckworth, of the law firm Nix Patterson LLP, in an interview. The plaintiffs, he said, believe such a large verdict will send a message to powerful individuals \u201cwho don't treat women appropriately.\u201d",
      "The court had not yet released documentation of the verdict as of Wednesday night. Beckworth said the verdict included $280 million in compensatory damages and $1.4 billion for punitive damages to the plaintiffs.",
      "\u201cThis verdict is about justice,\u201d Beckworth said in a statement. \u201cBut more importantly, It\u2019s about taking power back from the abusers \u2014 and their and enablers \u2014 and returning it to those he tried to control and silence.\u201d",

      "Toback was nominated for an Oscar for writing 1991\u2032s \u201cBugsy,\u201d and his career in Hollywood has spanned more than 40 years. Accusations that he engaged in years of sexual abuse surfaced in late 2017 as the #MeToo movement gained attention. They were first reported by the Los Angeles Times.",
      "In 2018, Los Angeles prosecutors said the statutes of limitations had expired in five cases they reviewed, and declined to bring criminal charges against Toback.",
      "The plaintiffs then filed a lawsuit in New York a few days after the state's Adult Survivors Act went into effect. The lawyers said they discovered a pattern of Toback attempting to lure young women on the streets of New York into meeting him by falsely promising roles in his films and then subjecting them to sexual acts, threats and psychological coercion.",
      "Mary Monahan, a lead plaintiff in the case, called the jury award \u201cvalidation\u201d for her and the other women.",
      "\u201cFor decades, I carried this trauma in silence, and today, a jury believed me. Believed us. That changes everything,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThis verdict is more than a number \u2014 it\u2019s a declaration. We are not disposable. We are not liars. We are not collateral damage in someone else\u2019s power trip. The world knows now what we\u2019ve always known: what he did was real.\u201d",

      "He also argued that New York's law extending the statute of limitations on sexual abuse cases violated his constitutional rights.",
      "A message sent to an email address listed for him seeking comment was not immediately answered.",
      "In January, the judge in the case entered a default judgment against Toback, who had failed to appear in court when ordered to do so. The judge then scheduled a trial for only damages last month to determine how much Toback had to pay the women.",

      "Smart phones have largely been a bit of a buzzkill for horror films, leading filmmakers to find all kinds of reasons \u2014 dead batteries, no service \u2014 to strand potential prey. But at least since 1949\u2019s \u201cSorry, Wrong Number,\u201d phones have also been a reliable conduit for terror capable of reaching into the home, or your pocket. \u201cDrop,\u201d a silly but suspenseful new thriller, carries on the tradition of \u201cWhen a Stranger Calls\" and \u201cPhone Booth\u201d by situating its tension around mysterious, threatening phone messages.",
      "Violet ( Meghann Fahy ), a widow with a young child, is on her first date in years. After three months of texting, she has hesitantly agreed to finally meet Henry (Brandon Sklenar) for dinner. When they sit down in a fancy restaurant high up a sleek Chicago high-rise, he\u2019s charming and relaxed. But Violet, like countless dates before her, can\u2019t stay off her phone.",
      "In Violet\u2019s case, though, the distraction is legitimate. She keeps getting messages dropped to her phone threatening her son, who\u2019s at home with Violet\u2019s sister (Violett Beane), unless she does what he says, including killing her date. In her home security cameras she can see a man with his face covered brandishing a gun.",
      "\u201cDrop,\u201d directed by Christopher Landon (\u201cHappy Death Day\u201d), doesn\u2019t differ greatly from the large swath of high-concept, low-budget thrillers that regularly flood theaters. But it\u2019s a taut little movie, almost totally set in the restaurant, with a just keen enough sense of plausible and preposterous. It knows to keep the pressure-cooker plot moving while not overstaying its welcome. At a nifty 95 minutes, \u201cDrop\u201d knows when to hang up.",
      "As if adding a digital twist to the old line \u201cThe call is coming from inside the house,\u201d Violet is getting message from an app called DigiDrop that can only be sent from a person within 50 feet. That means everyone in the restaurant \u2014 the bro who bumps into her, the cheesy waiter, the kind bartender \u2014 is a suspect. With her terrorizer watching her every move and prohibiting her from breathing a word to anyone, Violet is stuck rooted to her table when every fiber of her being wants to rescue her son.",
      "A considerable help to the film are the grounded screen presences of Fahy (\u201cThe White Lotus\u201d) and Sklenar (\u201c1923\u201d), both small-screen breakouts who here show movie-star poise. As the plot unspools, there are, naturally, quibbles one could make. Would a mother, with a masked gunman outside her toddler\u2019s door be able to feign interest in a duck salad? Does the highly orchestrated trap laid for her match the motives of the criminal mastermind? And while we're asking questions, could we not someday get a phone-themed thriller titled \u201cButt Dial\u201d?",
      "But if \u201cDrop\u201d is invariably quite a bit less than realistic, it has a whiff of metaphor. Violet isn\u2019t just stepping back into the dating pool as a single mom, she\u2019s trying to shake the past trauma of spousal abuse. Going on a date with Henry, whom she met on an app, is a kind of crap shoot. Will going out with a stranger met online end in love or violence?",
      "You could also read \u201cDrop\u201d as an extreme version of a more ubiquitous scourge. This is a movie where the bad guy, for nearly the duration of the movie, is nothing but text messages. (They are typically flashed large across the screen.) As Violet grows increasingly preoccupied and frantic, she could be just about anyone \u2014 a workaholic after hours, a teenager, a desperate Knicks fan watching the score \u2014 whose attention is held prisoner by her phone. How much of the terror of \u201cDrop\u201d would have existed at all, if she had just put it on silent?",
      "\"Drop,\u201d a Universal Pictures release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for strong violent content, suicide, some strong language and sexual references. Running time: 95 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "\u201cMarvin\u2019s passing is a huge loss for me and our industry writ large.

Marvin never failed to make me laugh, he never stopped smiling. We will miss you Marvin. You will always be in our hearts and your memory will always make us smile.\u201d",
      "Levy's long-standing partnership with Spielberg made him one of the most renowned and respected publicists in Hollywood.

      "\u201cIt was way out of left field for me. I couldn\u2019t have imagined it,\u201d Levy told The Associated Press in 2018. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I could say \u2018Gee, I\u2019d love to get that one day.\u2019 It was not on my to-do list.\u201d",
      "Born in Manhattan on Nov. 16, 1928, Levy was raised on the east side and attended New York University. Though he never set out to be a publicist specifically, he knew he had a way with words.

      "Levy soon found his way to legendary publicists Arthur Canton and Bill Blowitz, and then Columbia Pictures which took him to California. It was during that time that he first started working with Spielberg who was fresh off \u201cJaws.\u201d He was told he was only to concentrate on \u201cClose Encounters.\" By 1982, he went full time with Spielberg and wouldn\u2019t look back.",

      "\u201cThat was the toughest night of my life in terms of the business,\u201d Levy said. But he put on a brave face at the Governor's Ball following the ceremony.",
      "Tom Hanks presented the honorary Oscar to Levy in 2018, noting that it takes, \u201cSomething of a storyteller to get an audience hooked on the story without giving away the story.\u201d",

      "This year, the theme \u2014 \u201cTailored For You\" \u2014 is focused on classic tailoring. As always, the dress code is inspired by the spring exhibit at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. \u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style\u201d is the first Met show to focus exclusively on Black designers, and the first in more than 20 years to have a menswear theme. The show looks at the evolution of Black style over the centuries through the lens of dandyism.",
      "Here are some key things to know as fashion's biggest night approaches:",
      "The gala happens the first Monday in May \u2014 this year, May 5.",
      "Not everyone knows that the gala is actually a fundraiser for the Costume Institute, the only self-funding department at the Met. Last year the evening brought in a whopping sum of more than $26 million to the museum's coffers.",
      "Definitely not. It started in 1948 as a Manhattan society midnight supper \u2013 held at various places like the Waldorf Astoria and the Rainbow Room. It took many years before it turned into a global event and one of the starriest nights of the year.",
      "Each year brings a new group of celebrity co-chairs. This year they are Pharrell Williams, Lewis Hamilton, Colman Domingo, and A$AP Rocky \u2014 along with Anna Wintour, the influential Vogue editor who always oversees the proceedings. NBA superstar LeBron James is honorary chair.",
      "Word on attendees trickles out slowly in the weeks leading up to the event. But this year there\u2019s also a huge additional host committee with stars from various fields. (They don\u2019t have specific host duties, other than showing up and, it goes without saying, looking fabulous.)",
      "It includes athletes Simone Biles and husband Jonathan Owens, Angel Reese and Sha\u2019Carri Richardson; filmmakers Spike Lee, Tonya Lewis Lee and Regina King; and actors Ayo Edebiri, Audra McDonald and Jeremy Pope, and musicians Doechii, Usher, Tyla, Janelle Mon\u00e1e and Andr\u00e9 3000.",
      "Also in the group are author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie; artists Jordan Casteel, Rashid Johnson and Kara Walker; playwrights Jeremy O. Harris and Branden Jacobs-Jenkins; and fashion figures Grace Wales Bonner, Edward Enninful, Dapper Dan and Olivier Rousteing.",
      "The code is meant to be a guide, not a hard rule, and loose interpretation is encouraged. Sometimes, that interpretation extends not only to what guests put on, but what they take off. Lady Gaga did a 16-minute striptease on the gala carpet in 2019. Jared Leto spent the evening in 2023 carrying around his huge cat head, a tribute to Karl Lagerfeld's beloved pet.",
      "Guests enter the museum and walk past an enormous flower arrangement in the museum\u2019s grand lobby \u2013 always a talking point. Often there is an an orchestra playing nearby. At the top of the grand staircase, Wintour and her co-hosts form a receiving line. Guests then head either to cocktails or to view the exhibit. Cocktails are followed by dinner. The most hotly anticipated guests sometimes skip cocktails and even dinner, and arrive around dessert time for maximum impact (we're looking at you, Rihanna).",

      "The band recorded its first album in 1976 and by the following year was touring with such icons as Iggy Pop and David Bowie. It became known as the most commercially successful band to emerge from a fertile New York rock scene that also produced Talking Heads and the Ramones.",

There\u2019s also a five-track 1975 album demo that includes \u201cPlatinum Blonde,\u201d a sort of band mission statement. But Burke\u2019s mark was especially solidified with his rapid, powerful drumming at the start of \u201cDreaming\u201d in 1979.",
      "In 2022, after unearthing a New Wave treasure trove of reel-to-reel tapes, cassettes and records, the band created the box set \u201cBlondie: Against the Odds, 1974-1982,\u201d with 124 tracks and 36 previously unissued recordings, demos, outtakes and remixed versions of Blondie\u2019s initial six studio albums.",
      "Burke reflected on the discovery in an Associated Press article: \u201cWe never would have thought that we would still be here today. Looking back at our archives, it\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d",
      "The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame described Burke in a post Monday on the social platform X as \u201ca versatile and distinctive drummer who played exactly what each song required \u2013 and, when called for, let loose with blistering punk rock energy.\u201d",

      "The sex abuse trial of former \u201cDances with Wolves\u201d actor Nathan Chasing Horse in Nevada has again been postponed",
      "LAS VEGAS -- The sex abuse trial of former \u201cDances with Wolves\u201d actor Nathan Chasing Horse in Nevada has again been postponed.",
      "A judge on Monday moved the start of the trial in state court in Las Vegas to Aug. 4. The 48-year-old had been scheduled to stand trial next week on charges that he sexually abused Indigenous women and girls for years in the Las Vegas area.",
      "Craig Mueller, Chasing Horse's lawyer, said in a motion filed Friday that he needs more time to prepare and interview witnesses. It's the latest in a series of delays since Chasing Horse was arrested and indicted in early 2023.",
      "Chasing Horse has pleaded not guilty to 21 felonies, including sexual assault of a minor under 16, kidnapping and producing and possessing videos of child sexual abuse. If convicted of the sexual assault charges, he could face decades or life in prison.",
      "After starring as Smiles A Lot in the 1990 Oscar-winning film \u201cDances with Wolves,\u201d Chasing Horse began promoting himself as a self-proclaimed Lakota medicine man while traveling around North America to perform healing ceremonies, authorities have said. He was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.",
      "Prosecutors say Chasing Horse used his position to gain access to vulnerable women and girls for decades until his arrest near Las Vegas. He has been jailed ever since, but criminal proceedings were at a standstill for more than a year while Chasing Horse challenged his original indictment.",
      "It was eventually dismissed after the Nevada Supreme Court ruled that prosecutors had abused the grand jury process when they provided a definition of grooming as evidence without any expert testimony. The high court's order, however, left open the possibility for charges to be refiled, and prosecutors quickly took their case before another grand jury.",
      "Chasing Horse was again indicted in October. The indictment added new allegations that he filmed himself having sex with one of his accusers when she was younger than 14. Prosecutors have said the footage, taken in 2010 or 2011, was found on cellphones in a locked safe inside the North Las Vegas home that Chasing Horse is said to have shared with five wives, including the girl in the videos.",
      "His case has been unfolding at the same time lawmakers and prosecutors around the U.S. are funneling more resources into cases involving Native women, including human trafficking and killings.",

      "NEW YORK -- Comic Amber Ruffin has a new spring gig.",
      "PEN America told The Associated Press on Monday that Ruffin will host the free expression organization's gala fundraiser on May 15. The comic had been scheduled as a featured speaker April 26 at the White House Correspondents Association' s annual dinner. But the WHCA rescinded the offer to Ruffin, a blunt critic of President Donald Trump, saying it wanted to focus on journalistic achievement.",
      "In a statement Monday, PEN co-interim CEO Clarisse Rosaz Shariyf praised Ruffin for her \u201cbrilliant social commentary, her satire and exceptional talent.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe is truly emblematic of the talented creators who we need on stages and in writers\u2019 rooms during a time of unprecedented censorship in this country. We\u2019re both delighted and honored to have her with us,\" Shariyf added.",
      "PEN also announced Monday that Wesleyan University President Michael Roth will receive the PEN/Benenson Courage Award for \u201chis unwavering commitment to defending academic freedom, protecting protest rights, and resisting attempts to silence dissent in higher education.\u201d Roth has repeatedly criticized the Trump administration's threats to end research funding for Columbia University, Harvard University and other schools, with issues cited ranging from fighting antisemitism to whether transgender athletes can participate in sports.",
      "Ruffin, whose credits include writing for NBC\u2019s Seth Meyers, last year's host for the PEN gala, has said she was cut from the WCHA event after telling organizers that she had no intentions of being evenhanded. During a Daily Beast podcast last month, Ruffin said she was told \u201cyou need to be equal and be sure that you give it to both sides and I was like, \u2018There\u2019s no way that\u2019s going to happen.'\"",
      "Taylor Budowich, a deputy chief of staff at the White House, has called Ruffin a \u201csecond-rate comedian.\"",

      "NEW YORK -- For 11 seasons, Dr. Henry Louis Gates Jr. has sat across from his guests on the popular PBS series \u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d and led them through secrets in their family tree. On Tuesday, it's his turn.",
      "The Harvard scholar learns a long-buried puzzle about his great-great grandmother, Jane Gates, information which scrambles his ancestry and opens up a new branch that goes back to Ireland.",
      "\u201cI was moved to tears,\u201d Gates tells The Associated Press ahead of the airing. \u201cI used to pass her grave at the Gates' plot in Rose Hill Cemetery and I would say, \u2018Grandma, I\u2019m going to out you. I\u2019m going to tell the world your secret.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d is PBS\u2019s most-watched program on linear TV and the most-streamed non-drama program. Season 10 reached nearly 18 million people across linear and digital platforms and also received its first Emmy nomination.",
      "\u201cThe two subliminal messages of \u2019Finding Your Roots,' which are needed more urgently today than ever, is that what has made America great is that we\u2019re a nation of immigrants,\" says Gates. \u201cAnd secondly, at the level of the genome, despite our apparent physical differences, we\u2019re 99.99% the same.\u201d",
      "Season 11 has featured Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell, Melanie Lynskey, chef Jose Andres, Sharon Stone and Amanda Seyfried, who learned why her paternal third-great-grandfather was murdered.",
      "Gates shares the last episode with Laurence Fishburne, who learns the identity of his biological father. It turns out both men adored jazz, which delighted Dyllan McGee, who helped create and produce \u201cFinding Your Roots.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt underscored how family connections can shape us, even unknowingly, and made me wonder if reconnecting with our past somehow affirms the significance of our own stories by showing us how much each individual on our tree shapes us even when we don\u2019t know it,\u201d she says.",
      "The series started in 2006 under the title \u201cAfrican American Lives,\u201d conceived by Gates in the middle of the night in his bathroom. He invited prominent Black celebrities and traced their family trees into slavery. When the paper trail ran out, they would use DNA to see which ethnic group they were from in Africa.",
      "Challenged by a viewer to open the show to non-Black celebrities, Gates agreed and the series was renamed \u201cFaces of America,\u201d which had to be changed again after the name was taken. Along the way, Gates had a crash course in DNA.",
      "\u201cFor a guy with a PhD in English literature, I think I can do pretty well on the AP genetics exam,\u201d he says, before proving it with a thorough explanation of autosomal DNA.",
      "Over the years, the show has delivered fascinating results, like when Natalie Morales discovered she\u2019s related to one of the legendary pirates of the Caribbean and when former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d star Andy Samberg found his biological grandmother and grandfather. It revealed that RuPaul and U.S. Sen. Cory Booker are cousins, as are Meryl Streep and Eva Longoria.",
      "Guests have included former U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, designer Diane von Furstenberg and \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d author George R. R. Martin.",
      "\u201cI always tell my guests that you\u2019re not responsible for the crazy things your ancestors did. I don\u2019t care what they did. Guilt is not inheritable,\u201d Gates says. \u201cYou have to understand how the people functioned in the past without judging them.\u201d",
      "He and his team \u2014 particularly genetic genealogist CeCe Moore \u2014 have found that traditional family stories passed down through the generations are often filled with a few lies, often to cover up bad behavior.",
      "\u201cI call it where there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s fire. The stories are never accurate, but they\u2019re often close,\u201d says Gates. \u201cThere is a kernel of truth there.\u201d",
      "It took researchers four years to resolve the mystery of who was Gates' great-great grandfather, the man who impregnated Jane Gates. The story she told about her children's father turned out to be not correct.",
      "The researchers show him an 1888 obituary for her and a 1839 ad for her sale. Gates comments that he\u2019s seen a thousand bill of sales like it, but this hit differently. At the end, he looks again at a photo of Jane Gates. \u201cI see a lot of pain in those eyes and now I know why.\u201d",
      "\u201cSomething changed for him that day,\" says McGee. \"I remember him calling me after the reveal saying, 'That was the best day of my life!' It was such a treat for the entire team to be able to give him the gift of a missing link in his family history that he has given hundreds of our guests.\u201d",
      "Gates is a huge advocate that everyone should have their family tree traced and pushes back against the idea that digging up the past is divisive.",
      "\u201cI believe that knowing about our ancestors is fundamental to knowing about ourselves,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only way to deal with the past is to know about the past.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn terms of people who would pretend that the past is irrelevant and we need to look forward, William Faulkner wrote, \u2018The past is never dead. It\u2019s not even past,\u2019\u201d Gates adds. \u201cIt\u2019s still with us, shaping both who we are and the society and our norms under which we function.\u201d",

      "The American Library Association has unveiled the 10 most \u201cchallenged books\u201d of 2024",
      "NEW YORK -- Removing books from library shelves is no longer just a story of objections from a local community or an individual parent, the American Library Association says.",
      "In its new State of American Libraries Report released Monday, the ALA found more than 70% of attempted bans of a given title or titles come from organized groups and elected officials, and just 16% originated with a parent.",
      "The most commonly criticized books, including Maia Kobabe\u2019s \u201cGender Queer\u201d and the late Toni Morrison's \u201cThe Bluest Eye,\u201d can be found on such websites as www.ratedbooks.org and through lists compiled by Moms for Liberty and other conservative activists.",
      "\u201cWe can trace many of the challenges to lists of books that have been distributed by Moms for Liberty and other groups,\" said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, who directs the association's Office for Intellectual Freedom.",
      "As part of its annual report, the ALA unveiled its list of the 10 most \u201cchallenged books\u201d of 2024, starting with George M. Johnson's \u201cAll Boys Aren't Blue,\u201d and also featuring \u201cGender Queer,\u201d \u201cThe Bluest Eye,\u201d Stephen Chbosky's \u201cThe Perks of Being a Wallflower\u201d and John Green's \u201cLooking for Alaska.\u201d",
      "Most of the books listed have LGBTQ+ themes, continuing a yearslong trend. Other objections include references to drug addiction, such as in Ellen Hopkins' \u201cCrank,\u201d and to slavery and sexual abuse, including those in Patricia McCormick's \u201cSold.\u201d",
      "The ALA defines a challenge as a \u201cformal, written complaint filed with a library or school requesting that materials be removed because of content or appropriateness.\u201d The association, which compiles censorship data through media accounts and reports from librarians, has long believed the actual number of challenges is far higher than the numbers cited in its annual studies.",
      "The report comes at an especially perilous time for libraries. The Trump administration is implementing drastic cuts at the Institute of Museum and Library Services, which already is canceling grants to state libraries.",
      "Bans have surged in recent years and several states, from Texas and Florida to Iowa and Utah, have passed laws restricting what school libraries can acquire. While the ALA is reporting a sharp drop in challenges in 2024, down to 821 attempts compared to 1,247 the year before, the number remains far higher than before 2021.",
      "And Caldwell-Stone doesn't believe censorship is declining. Libraries are now more likely to avoid stocking books that are controversial, or may be prohibited by law, she says.",
      "\u201cI spoke to a librarian from Texas who told me she was looking over a political book and wasn't sure if she could add it to the collection,\u201d Caldwell-Stone said. \u201cLibrarians don't want to get prosecuted or otherwise face legal trouble. A lot of librarians are operating under these kinds of threats.\u201d",

      "Regional Mexican music is crossing borders and going global",
      "MEXICO CITY -- At a Mexican military base, Captain Eduardo Barr\u00f3n picks up not a rifle but a microphone. Swaying boot-to-boot, he belts out a song as the sounds of trumpets and accordions roar from a band of a dozen camouflage-clad soldiers.",
      "The rhythmic style \u2014 known as a corrido \u2014 is recognizable to just about every soul in the Latin American nation of 130 million. But Barr\u00f3n\u2019s lyrics diverge sharply from those blaring on speakers across Mexico.",
      "\u201cI still remember the day I joined the military,\u201d he crooned. \u201cThis is a dream my soul longed for, and if I were to live another life, I\u2019d become a soldier again.\u201d",
      "Barr\u00f3n, who performs under the name \u201cEddy Barr\u00f3n,\" began releasing music videos and songs on Spotify last year in coordination with the Mexican military. His lyrics extol the army\u2019s virtues, celebrate proud parents and honor the fallen.",
      "They stand in stark contrast to the controversial narco corridos, a subgenre that has sparked controversy as famed artists pay homage to cartel bosses, portraying them as rebels going against the system.",
      "Faced with the challenge of addressing a musical style that depicts cartel violence, local governments across Mexico have increasingly banned performances and pursued criminal investigations of bands and musicians. Mexico\u2019s president even vowed to reduce the popularity of narco corridos while promoting other, less violent musical styles.",
      "But Barr\u00f3n, 33, is taking a different approach. Instead of censorship, he wants to build upon the momentum with his own military corridos, an effort to both infuse the genre with more socially acceptable lyrics and recruit young people to the military.",
      "\u201cNarco life is in style and they make it sound really pretty \u2026 but the reality is different,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re playing our part to invite young people to join this movement of positive music.\u201d",
      "Barron's military ballads are part of a wider government push spearheaded by Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has proposed that the government promote corridos about \u201clove, falling out of love and peace.\u201d",
      "She even announced a government-sponsored Mexican music competition in the northern state of Durango showcasing music that avoids \u201cglorifying violence, drugs and discrimination against women.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will completely change Mexican music,\u201d she said.",
      "But in a subculture long defined by resistance and putting words to the harsh realities facing the poor, the government's initiatives around the genre have been met with skepticism about official attempts to promote family-friendly narratives.",
      "\u201cI don't think using corridos as a way to incorporate other kinds of narratives, is a bad idea,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Manuel Valenzuela, a Tijuana sociologist who studies the genre. \u201cThere are a lot of songs that sing of peace and love. It\u2019s just that those aren\u2019t the ones that are turning out to be hits \u2026 because we\u2019re living in a moment of aggrieved youth.\u201d",
      "Corridos were born in the 19th century, their classical band instruments and the accordion rooted in German and Polish migration to Mexico. At a time of widespread illiteracy, they were used widely to pass on oral histories.",
      "The ballads took off during the Mexican revolution, when they were used to share stories of war heroes and glory from the conflict.",
      "That is why Barr\u00f3n says he didn\u2019t invent military corridos, but that he\u2019s simply bringing them back.",
      "\u201cCorridos come from the revolution, and we\u2019re doing the same thing as those soldiers and revolutionaries, albeit in a different age, but the result is the same,\u201d he said.",
      "The genre evolved over generations, from singing about smuggling tequila during the 1920\u2019s Prohibition era in corridos tequileros to grappling with the rising wave of cartel violence in Mexico with narco corridos.",
      "\u201cAll the big social issues are told through corridos,\u201d Valenzuela said. \u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor to speak about what we\u2019ve been living through.\u201d",
      "Barr\u00f3n said he would play guitar with his father\u2019s Mexican regional music band as a teenager, and write his own music. He would bring his guitar to play on deployments after he joined the army at 20.",
      "In 2021, he said he began writing his own songs about his time in the military and singing with a military FX Band, named after the type of gun the military uses. But the music never went public.",
      "Around 2023, the genre exploded when artists like Peso Pluma, Fuerza Regida and Natanael Cano began to mix the classic style with trap music in what are known as corridos tumbados. That same year, Peso Pluma bested Taylor Swift as the most streamed artist on YouTube.",
      "A year later, the Mexican army decided to post Barr\u00f3n's music under his artistic name.",
      "The music videos, which have clocked tens of thousands of views on YouTube alone, are layered with images of heavy duty weapons, the Mexican flag, barbed wire and Barr\u00f3n belting out in camouflage and infrared goggles pulled above his military helmet.",
      "Originally intended to entertain troops and boost military recruitment among young Mexicans, Barr\u00f3n's songs took on a different meaning amidst the renewed controversy that has come with the corridos boom.",
      "The musical style has long been criticized for romanticizing cartel violence, but has hit an inflection point in recent years.",
      "Mexican states have implemented performance bans, and prominent artists have received death threats, often claiming to be from rival cartels whose leaders are glorified in their music. And musicians have been forced to cancel shows due to concerns about potential violence.",
      "The controversy intensified last week, after the face of top cartel boss Nemesio Rub\u00e9n \u201cEl Mencho\u201d Oseguera was projected onto a large screen behind the band Los Alegres del Barranco at a music festival in the northern state of Jalisco. The incident, occurring shortly after Oseguera\u2019s cartel was linked to a ranch under investigation as a training camp and body disposal site in Jalisco, sent shockwaves across Mexico.",
      "The performance was met with a cascade of criticisms. Two Mexican states announced criminal investigations, concerts were cancelled and the Trump administration revoked the U.S. visas of band members.",
      "It also marked a hardening in tone by Sheinbaum, who called for an investigation into the concert, adding: \u201cYou can\u2019t justify violence or criminal groups.\u201d",
      "Barr\u00f3n, who opposes a ban on corridos, believes the solution is to continue to sing cloaked in camouflage with the hopes of reclaiming the Mexican music from his childhood from the negative stereotypes that have grown to define it.",
      "He said the army is already planning to release new songs in the coming months.",
      "\"Sadly, we've been stuck with this label of corridos as negative music,\" he said. \u201cA better approach is to reclaim the genre and take a different path to shift the conversation.\u201d",

      "North died Sunday at his home in Lake Butler, Florida, after battling colon cancer, said Laurie Jacobson, a longtime friend, and Bonnie Vent, who was his booking agent.",
      "\u201cHe had a heart as big as a mountain, loved his friends deeply. He called us frequently and ended every conversation with \u2018I love you with all my heart,\u2019\u201d Jacobson wrote in a tribute on Facebook.",

      "The mix-up was discovered in February when the clinic in the city of Brisbane found that the birth parents had one too many embryos in storage, said the provider, Monash IVF, in a statement supplied Friday. Staff discovered an embryo from another patient had been mistakenly thawed and transferred to the birth mother, a spokesperson said.",
      "Australia news outlets reported the baby was born in 2024.",
      "The company, one of Australia\u2019s biggest IVF providers, said an initial investigation had not uncovered any other such errors. Its statement didn\u2019t identify the patients involved or divulge details about the child's custody.",
      "\u201cAll of us at Monash IVF are devastated and we apologise to everyone involved,\u201d said CEO Michael Knaap. \u201cWe will continue to support the patients through this extremely distressing time.\u201d",
      "The \u201chuman error\u201d was made \u201cdespite strict laboratory safety protocols being in place,\u201d the statement said. The company said it had reported the episode to the relevant regulator in the state of Queensland.",
      "Monash IVF opened in 1971 and sees patients in dozens of locations throughout Australia. Last year, the firm settled a class action lawsuit from more than 700 patients, making no admission of liability, after claims its clinics destroyed potentially viable embryos.",
      "The clinic paid a settlement of 56 million Australian dollars ($35 million).",
      "Rare cases of embryo mix-ups have been reported before, including in the United States, Britain, Israel and Europe. A woman in the U.S. state of Georgia in February filed a lawsuit against a fertility clinic after she gave birth to a stranger\u2019s baby.",
      "Krystena Murray realized the error after the baby's birth because she and her sperm donor were both white and the child was Black. Murray said she wanted to raise the baby but voluntarily gave the 5-month-old to his biological parents after she was told she would not win a legal fight for his custody.",
      "In Australia, each state makes its own laws and rules governing the use of IVF, which advocates say puts patients at risk of error or oversight failings. Queensland\u2019s parliament passed its first laws regulating the sector in 2024.",
      "The measures will establish a registry for all people conceived at a clinic and made the destruction of donors\u2019 medical histories illegal. The change followed an official report that lambasted the storage of frozen sperm donations in Queensland, finding nearly half of samples checked were at medium or high risk of misidentification and recommending thousands be destroyed.",
      "Australia\u2019s states and territories \u201cneed to see if their regulations are up to scratch,\u201d the Minister for Social Services Amanda Rishworth told the Today news program Friday.",
      "\u201cConfidence needs to be brought back and it\u2019s imperative that happens.\u201d",

      "Public officials in 16 states and the District of Columbia are suing the Trump administration to restore access to federal pandemic relief funding for schools",
      "Public officials in 16 states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration Thursday to restore access to pandemic relief aid for schools, saying the Education Department's abrupt halt of hundreds of millions of dollars of promised funding will force cuts to vital services.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan by a coalition of 16 Democratic attorneys general, led by New York\u2019s Letitia James, plus Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, also a Democrat. It claims the administration's refusal to release the aid violates federal law because it reversed a prior decision to allow states to access the money through March 2026.",
      "States were notified late last month that the Education Department would not honor deadline extensions granted by the Biden administration to spend the remainder of COVID relief aid approved by by Congress to help schools and students recover from the lasting impacts of the pandemic. Schools were supposed to spend the last of the relief by January but many sought, and were granted, more time.",
      "In announcing the reversal, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said schools had \u201cample time\u201d to spend the money, but the agency would consider requests for extensions for individual projects. The department did not say how much money is left of the total $189 billion approved.",
      "New York state lost access to $134 million, James' office said in a press release. It said the relief funding has supported repairs and improvements to school buildings and the purchase of library books, playground equipment and wheelchair-accessible buses. Districts also relied on the aid for programs and services for homeless students, as well as tutoring for students who fell behind because of missed classroom time.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s latest attack on our schools will hurt our most vulnerable students and make it harder for them to thrive,\u201d James said. \u201cCutting school systems\u2019 access to vital resources that our students and teachers rely on is outrageous and illegal.\u201d",
      "Joining the lawsuit were the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, and the District of Columbia.",

      "Outdoor enthusiasts are worried about the loss of their favorite vistas as President Donald Trump's administration considers weakening a 26-year-old rule designed to improve visibility over national parks and wilderness areas",
      "During a hike in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in 1995, Don Barger climbed Chilhowee Mountain hoping to gaze across the valley below. All he saw was a wall of gray haze.",
      "Today, he said, he can see some 50 miles (80 kilometers) across that same valley to the Cumberland Mountains.",
      "A 26-year-old federal regulation known as the regional haze rule has helped cut down on pollution over national parks, wilderness areas and tribal reservations, restoring some of the nation's most spectacular natural vistas for outdoor lovers like Barger. But conservationists fear those gains may be lost after President Donald Trump's administration announced in March the rule is among dozens of landmark environmental regulations that it plans to roll back.",
      "\u201cIt means a promise that was made to the American public is lost,\u201d Barger, 74, said. \u201cMore and more generations of people are going to grow up as ignorant as I was, not realizing what I'm missing and not seeing.\u201d",
      "Haze forms when small particles of air pollution, such as sulfur dioxide or nitrogen oxides, scatter and absorb sunlight, blurring views and decreasing visibility.",
      "Congress amended the Clean Air Act in 1977 to make restoring and maintaining visibility a goal for 156 national parks, wilderness areas, wildlife refuges and tribal reservations across 36 states. That includes places like the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee; Grand Canyon National Park; Glacier National Park; and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.",
      "After years of drafting and litigation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency adopted regulations known as the regional haze rule in 1999 to implement the amendments.",
      "The rule calls for attaining natural visibility conditions by the year 2064 and mandates that states come up with plans that include limitations on emissions, compliance schedules and monitoring strategies. Older facilities that emit pollution, such as coal-fired power plants, must adopt mitigation technology such as scrubbers or shut down periodically to decrease overall annual emissions.",
      "The states' plans have been plagued with delays as the EPA approves parts of them and rejects others. For example, two big oil- and coal-producing states, North Dakota and Wyoming, and industry groups filed petitions in federal court in January seeking review of EPA decisions rejecting their plans, according to the Harvard Law School's Environmental and Energy Law Program.",
      "The rule works in conjunction with other federal antipollution regulations, but it's been crucial in clearing the skies over national parks and wilderness areas.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of data from a nationwide network of monitoring sites from 1999, when the rule was implemented, through 2023 shows 93% of the parks and wilderness areas have seen improved air quality on clear days. No parks or wilderness areas have seen any notable worsening in visibility.",
      "Visibility in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park was twice as good on a typical clear day in 2023 as it was in 1999, marking the biggest improvement among the national parks.",
      "The EPA estimates that between 2007 and 2018 the rule has cut 500,000 tons of sulfur dioxide and 300,000 tons of nitrous oxides annually. The average visual range has increased from 90 miles to 120 miles (144 kilometers to 193 kilometers) in some western parks and from 50 to 70 miles (80 kilometers to 112 kilometers) in some eastern parks, according to the Harvard program.",
      "Trump's EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, announced March 12 that the agency would look to roll back 31 landmark environmental regulations, including the regional haze rule. Zeldin called the announcement the \u201cmost consequential day of deregulation in American history\u201d and said in an essay published in the Wall Street Journal that the administration is \u201cdriving a dagger through the heart of climate-change religion.\u201d",
      "Asked for comment on the regional haze rule, the EPA said they want to better account for pollution from outside the U.S. and from natural sources and avoid unnecessary burdens for states and industry.",
      "In a cost-benefit analysis of the rule before it took effect, the EPA found it would cost energy producers up to $98 billion by 2025 while providing about $344 billion in benefits such as health care savings.",
      "Producers argue that the haze rule has done its job and it doesn't make sense to continue to impose costs on them.",
      "\u201cThis is a matter of diminishing returns,\u201d said Jonathan Fortner, interim president and CEO of the Lignite Energy Council, which advocates for North Dakota's coal industry. \u201cThe air is clean, the data proves it, and the science backs that up. The rule's being misapplied, not because we disagree with clean air goals, but because we're already there.\u201d",
      "Two federal properties in North Dakota are subject to the rule, the Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge and Theodore Roosevelt National Park. The AP analysis found both sites have seen dramatic visibility improvements over the five years from 2019 to 2023.",
      "EPA officials did not respond to an AP request for a list of power plants that have closed due to the regional haze rule. A number of energy industry groups did not return repeated requests for comment, including the U.S. Energy Association and the National Utility Contractors Association.",
      "Advocates of the rule say eliminating it could lead to reduced tourism and the economic boom visitors bring to national park regions. The National Park Service estimates 325 million people visited national parks in 2023, spending $26.4 billion in gateway communities.",
      "Nothing appears likely to change overnight. Conservationists expect the Trump administration to pursue a rollback through language revisions in the rule, a process that would require a public comment period and would likely trigger court challenges that could last years.",
      "\u201cI've watched the Great Smoky Mountains National Park emerge from the chemical haze that once enshrouded it and was getting worse,\u201d Barger said. \u201cIt's just this visceral sense of place. We had lost it entirely. The Clean Air Act is working and it's a work in progress. You have to stay with it or it doesn't work.\u201d",

      "An internal email obtained by The Associated Press states that FDA leadership are \u201callowing review staff and supervisors to resume telework\u201d at least two days a week. The policy shift was confirmed by three FDA staffers who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal agency matters.",
      "The message was sent Tuesday to some of the FDA\u2019s hundreds of drug reviewers. Staffers said a similar policy was communicated to reviewers who handle vaccines, biotech drugs, medical devices and tobacco products\u2014 although not always in writing.",
      "It\u2019s the latest example of the Trump administration\u2019s chaotic approach to overhauling the federal health workforce, which has included firings, a scramble to rehire some employees, and then additional layoffs last week of an estimated 3,400 staffers, or more than 15% of the agency\u2019s workforce. When FDA employees were called back to the agency's Maryland headquarters last month they confronted overflowing parking lots, crowded offices and broken or missing supplies.",
      "A spokeswoman for Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the administration is returning to \u201cpre-COVID telework arrangements for reviewers, whose read and write work output is tracked in 15-minute increments to ensure productivity and accountability.\u201d",
      "While many agencies switched to telework during the pandemic, the FDA began embracing the practice nearly two decades earlier. The flexibility was seen as a competitive perk for recruiting employees who can often earn more working in industry.",
      "Last week's cuts included entire offices focusing on FDA policy and regulations, most of the agency\u2019s communication staff and teams that support food inspectors and investigators. Senior officials overseeing tobacco, new drugs, vaccines and other products have also been dismissed or forced to resign. Staffers have described rank-and-file employees \u201cpouring\u201d out of the agency.",
      "Former FDA Commissioner Dr. David Kessler called the cuts \"devastating, haphazard, thoughtless and chaotic\" during a House hearing on Wednesday.",
      "When Kennedy announced plans to eliminate 10,000 staffers across the federal health workforce, he noted that FDA medical reviewers and safety inspectors wouldn't be impacted.",
      "In February, HHS was forced to recall some probationary employees who were fired, including hundreds of medical reviewers at FDA, whose salaries are largely funded by industry fees, not federal dollars.",
      "But last week\u2019s cuts combined with resignations and retirements have raised a new threat: that FDA funding could fall so low that it short circuits a long-standing system in which companies help fund much of the agency's operations.",
      "Nearly half the FDA's nearly $7 billion budget comes from fees collected from drug, device and tobacco companies. The agency uses the money to hire thousands of extra staffers to quickly and efficiently review new products. For example, about 70% of the FDA\u2019s drug program is financed by user-fee agreements, which must be reauthorized by Congress every five years.",
      "But the agreements stipulate that if FDA\u2019s federal funding falls below set levels, companies are no longer required to pay fees and, in some cases, can claw back their money. The threshold requirements are designed to ensure Congress continues funding FDA, rather than relying entirely on the private sector.",
      "FDA and industry groups are supposed to begin negotiations later this year to renew several user-fee agreements, including those for drugs and devices.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the agency nor regulated industry can afford for \u2018user fees\u2019 not to be reauthorized,\u201d said Michael Gaba, an attorney who advises FDA-regulated companies.",
      "Whatever the reasoning behind the telework shift, former government officials say it\u2019s a sign that recently confirmed FDA Commissioner Marty Makary is trying to retain and rebuild staffing and resources. Makary made his first appearance at FDA's headquarters last Wednesday, one day after the mass layoffs. According to the memo obtained by the AP, Makary signed off on the return to telework.",
      "\u201cDr. Makary needs to rebuild teams and restart the engine of productivity lost to weeks of job insecurity, uncertainty and shortages of team members,\u201d said Steven Grossman, a former HHS official. \u201cTurning commuting time back into work time is a great first step in achieving both.\u201d",

      "A day care facility in a Texas county that's part of the measles outbreak has multiple cases, including children too young to be fully vaccinated, public health officials say.",
      "West Texas is in the middle of a still-growing measles outbreak with 481 cases Friday. The state expanded the number of counties in the outbreak area this week to 10. The highly contagious virus began to spread in late January and health officials say it has spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas and Mexico.",
      "Three people who were unvaccinated have died from measles-related illnesses this year, including two elementary school-aged children in Texas. The second child died Thursday at a Lubbock hospital, and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended the funeral in Seminole, the epicenter of the outbreak.",
      "As of Friday, there were seven cases at a day care where one young child who was infectious gave it to two other children before it spread to other classrooms, Lubbock Public Health director Katherine Wells said.",
      "\u201cMeasles is so contagious I won\u2019t be surprised if it enters other facilities,\u201d Wells said.",
      "There are more than 200 children at the day care, Wells said, and most have had least one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, which is first recommended between 12 and 15 months old and a second shot between 4 and 6 years old.",
      "\u201cWe do have some children that have only received one dose that are now infected,\u201d she said.",
      "The public health department is recommending that any child with only one vaccine get their second dose early, and changed its recommendation for kids in Lubbock County to get the first vaccine dose at 6 months old instead of 1. A child who is unvaccinated and attends the day care must stay home for 21 days since their last exposure, Wells said.",
      "Case count and hospitalization numbers in Texas have climbed steadily since the outbreak began, and spiked by 81 cases from March 28 to April 4, with 16 more people hospitalized in that time.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention met with Texas officials Monday to determine how many people it would send to West Texas to assist with the outbreak response, spokesman Jason McDonald said Monday. He expected a small team to arrive later this week, followed by a bigger group on the ground next week.",
      "The CDC said its first team was in the region from early March to April 1, withdrawing on-the-ground support days before a second child died in the outbreak.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Monday said he plans to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention soon to stop recommending fluoridation in communities nationwide. Kennedy also said he\u2019s assembling a task force to focus on the issue.",
      "Also on Monday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced it is reviewing \u201cnew scientific information\" on potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water.",
      "Kennedy told The Associated Press of his plans after a news conference in Salt Lake City.",
      "Utah last month became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, pushing past opposition from dentists and national health organizations who warned the move would lead to medical problems that disproportionately affect low-income communities.",
      "Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed legislation barring cities and communities from deciding whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral to their water systems. Water systems across the state must shut down their fluoridation systems by May 7.",
      "Kennedy praised Utah for emerging as \u201cthe leader in making America healthy again.\u201d He was flanked by Utah legislative leaders and the sponsor of the state\u2019s fluoride law. \u201cI\u2019m very, very proud of this state for being the first state to ban it, and I hope many more will,\u201d he said.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who appeared with Kennedy at the news conference, said his agency was launching a renewed examination of scientific studies on the potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water to help inform any changes to the national standards.",
      "\u201cWhen this evaluation is completed, we will have an updated foundational scientific evaluation that will inform the agency\u2019s future steps,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cSecretary Kennedy has long been at the forefront of this issue. His advocacy was instrumental in our decision to review fluoride exposure risks and we are committed to working alongside him, utilizing sound science as we advance our mission of protecting human health and the environment.\u201d",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the CDC. In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and in 1962 set guidelines for how much should be added to water.",
      "Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has called fluoride a \u201cdangerous neurotoxin\u201d and said also it\u2019s been associated with arthritis, bone breaks, and thyroid disease. Some studies have suggested such links might exist, usually at higher-than-recommended fluoride levels, though some reviewers have questioned the quality of available evidence and said no definitive conclusions can be drawn.",
      "Fluoride can come from a number of sources, but drinking water is the main one for Americans, researchers say. Nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population gets fluoridated drinking water, according to CDC data. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water was long considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "About one-third of community water systems \u2014 17,000 out of 51,000 across the U.S. \u2014 serving more than 60% of the population fluoridated their water, according to a 2022 CDC analysis. The agency currently recommends 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water.",
      "But over time, studies have documented potential problems. Too much fluoride has been associated with streaking or spots on teeth. Studies also have traced a link between excess fluoride and brain development.",
      "A report last year by the federal government\u2019s National Toxicology Program, which summarized studies conducted in Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico, concluded that drinking water with more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter \u2014 more than twice the recommended level in the U.S. \u2014 was associated with lower IQs in kids.",

      "ATHENS, Greece -- A medical charity working in Greece says it has diagnosed six young children living in a migrant facility on the eastern Aegean island of Samos as suffering from malnutrition, the first time its doctors have made such a diagnosis since the facility opened in 2021.",
      "The Greek section of Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French acronym MSF, said Monday its staff had diagnosed the children, who are aged between 6 months and 6 years old, with moderate to severe acute malnutrition and in need of immediate medical intervention.",
      "\u201cChildren make up about 25% of the (camp\u2019s) population, yet pediatric care remains insufficient, not only within the center but on the entire island of Samos,\u201d MSF Greece\u2019s Director General Christina Psarra said in a news release.",
      "The six children, who hailed from Afghanistan and Syria, all arrived in the camp with their families within the last two to three months, and it was not possible to determine whether they had already been suffering from malnutrition before they arrived, Psarra told The Associated Press.",
      "However, \u201cdefinitely the conditions in the camp have made things more difficult and have had an aggravating effect,\u201d she said.",
      "Asked about the MSF claims, the Ministry of Migration and Asylum said it would have a response later Monday.",
      "Psarra said that while meals were provided for the camp\u2019s residents, the diet \u201cis not nutritious for children of this age.\u201d The situation was exacerbated by the severance nine months ago of a stipend provided to asylum seekers in Greece, which had allowed them to purchase fresh food and other basic necessities, she added.",
      "Officially designated as a \u201cclosed controlled access center,\u201d the European Union-funded migrant camp in Samos, built on a hillside about 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the island\u2019s main port of Vathy, was opened in 2021 to replace a massively overcrowded camp that had developed on the town\u2019s fringes.",
      "The camp, which is guarded by police and private security, has a capacity of 3,664 people and as of Monday, it was housing 3,176 people, according to the Ministry of Migration and Asylum.",
      "Psarra noted that the children had already endured grueling journeys to arrive in Samos, and conditions inside the camp exacerbated their medical situation.",
      "Rights groups have reported dire conditions in the camp in Samos, including poor sanitation and a shortage of running water.",
      "\u201cThey are children who have been through painful journeys. They have had many difficulties in arriving,\u201d Psarra said of the malnourished children on Samos. \u201cThe conditions in the camp makes it even worse.\u201d",
      "Greece lies on one of the most popular routes into the EU for people fleeing conflict and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Many make the short but treacherous boat journey from the Turkish coast to nearby Greek islands like Samos, often in small, unseaworthy inflatable dinghies.",
      "Last week, at least seven people, including three children, died near another Greek island, Lesbos, after the inflatable dinghy they were traveling in sank. Another 23 people survived and were taken to a migrant camp in Lesbos.",

      "Health care systems can reduce suicides through patient screening, safety planning and mental health counseling, a new study suggests, an important finding as the U.S. confronts it 11th leading cause of death.",
      "The \u201cZero Suicide Model\u201d was developed in 2001 at Detroit-based Henry Ford Health, where the focus on people considering suicide included collaborating with patients to reduce their access to lethal means such as firearms and then following up with treatment.",
      "The approach made a difference, and for all of 2009, the health system saw no suicides among patients. The researchers then studied what happened when a different health system, Kaiser Permanente, adopted the program in four locations from 2012 through 2019.",
      "Suicides and suicide attempts fell in three of the locations, while the fourth maintained a low rate of suicides and attempts. Suicide attempts were tracked in electronic health records and insurance claims data. Suicides were measured using government death records.",
      "Reductions varied and reached up to 25%, said lead author Brian Ahmedani, of Henry Ford Health.",
      "\u201cOver the course of the year, that\u2019s up to 165 to 170 suicide attempts that were prevented at these participating health care systems,\u201d Ahmedani said.",
      "The study, published Monday in JAMA Network Open, shows the model works, said Katherine Keyes, a Columbia University public health professor who studies suicide.",
      "Prior research has shown that nearly everyone who dies by suicide is seen by a health care provider in the year before their death, Keyes said. Many doctor's offices have started asking patients whether they've thought about harming themselves.",
      "\u201cWe are coming into contact with people who are at high risk for suicide. If we don\u2019t ask them, we don\u2019t know,\u201d said Keyes who was not involved in the new study.",

      "Kennedy said in a social media post that he was working to \u201ccontrol the outbreak\" and went to Gaines County to comfort the families who have buried two young children. He was seen late Sunday afternoon outside of a Mennonite church where the funeral services were held, but he did not attend a nearby news conference held by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the outbreak.",
      "Seminole is the epicenter of the outbreak, which started in late January and continues to swell \u2014 with nearly 500 cases in Texas alone, plus cases from the outbreak believed to have spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas and Mexico.",
      "The second young child died Thursday from \"what the child's doctor described as measles pulmonary failure,\u201d and did not have underlying health conditions, the Texas State Department of State Health Services said Sunday in a news release. Aaron Davis, a spokesperson for UMC Health System in Lubbock, said that the child was \u201creceiving treatment for complications of measles while hospitalized.\u201d",
      "This is the third known measles-related death tied to this outbreak. One was another elementary school-aged child in Texas and the other was an adult in New Mexico; neither were vaccinated.",
      "It's Kennedy's first visit to the area as health secretary, where he said he met with families of both the 6- and 8-year-old children who died. He said he \u201cdeveloped bonds\u201d with the Mennonite community in West Texas in which the virus is mostly spreading.",
      "Kennedy, an anti-vaccine advocate before ascending to the role of nation\u2019s top health secretary earlier this year, has resisted urging widespread vaccinations as the measles outbreak has worsened under his watch. On Sunday, however, he said in a lengthy statement posted on X that it was \u201cthe most effective way to prevent the spread of measles.\"",
      "The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine has been used safely for more than 60 years and is 97% effective against measles after two doses.",
      "Dr. Manisha Patel, CDC incident manager, said in a Sunday news conference that the MMR vaccine is the best way to protect against measles. She also told parents in Gaines County that it was important not to \u201cdelay care\u201d for a child who is sick with measles.",
      "\u201cCall your doctor and make sure you\u2019re talking to a health care professional who can guide you on those next steps,\" Patel said.",

      "Asked about the outbreak Sunday by reporters on Air Force One, Trump said, \u201cthey\u2019re doing reports on it,\u201d adding that if the outbreak \u201cprogresses, we\u2019ll will have to take action very strongly.\u201d",
      "Neither the CDC nor the state health department included the death in their measles reports issued Friday, but the CDC acknowledged it when asked Sunday.",
      "The number of cases in Texas shot up by 81 between March 28 and April 4, and 16 more people were hospitalized. Nationwide, the U.S. has more than double the number of measles cases it saw in all of 2024.",
      "Republican U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy from Louisiana, a liver doctor whose vote helped cinch Kennedy\u2019s confirmation, called Sunday for stronger messaging from health officials in a post on X.",
      "\u201cEveryone should be vaccinated! There is no treatment for measles. No benefit to getting measles,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTop health officials should say so unequivocally b/4 another child dies.\u201d",
      "Cassidy has requested Kennedy to appear before his health committee Thursday, although Kennedy has not publicly confirmed whether he will attend.",
      "A CDC spokesperson noted the efficacy of the measles vaccine Sunday but stopped short of calling on people to get it. Departing from long-standing public health messaging around vaccination, the spokesperson called the decision a \u201cpersonal one\u201d and encouraged people to talk with their doctor. People \u201cshould be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Misinformation about how to prevent and treat measles is hindering a robust public health response, including claims about vitamin A supplements that have been pushed by Kennedy and holistic medicine supporters despite doctors\u2019 warnings that it should be given under a physician's orders and that too much can be dangerous.",
      "Doctors at Covenant Children's Hospital in Lubbock, where the first measles death occurred, say they've treated fewer than 10 children for liver issues from vitamin A toxicity, which they found when running routine lab tests on children who are not fully vaccinated and have measles. Dr. Lara Johnson, chief medical officer, said the patients reported using vitamin A to treat and prevent the virus.",
      "Dr. Peter Marks, the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s former vaccine chief, said responsibility for the death rests with Kennedy and his staff. Marks was forced out of the FDA after disagreements with Kennedy over vaccine safety.",
      "\u201cThis is the epitome of an absolute needless death,\u201d Marks told The Associated Press in an interview Sunday. \u201cThese kids should get vaccinated \u2014 that\u2019s how you prevent people from dying of measles.\u201d",
      "Marks also said he recently warned U.S. senators that more deaths would occur if the administration didn\u2019t mount a more aggressive response to the outbreak.",
      "Experts and local health officials expect the outbreak to go on for several more months if not a year. In West Texas, the vast majority of cases are in unvaccinated people and children younger than 17.",
      "With several states facing outbreaks of the vaccine-preventable disease \u2014 and declining childhood vaccination rates nationwide \u2014 some worry that measles may cost the U.S. its status as having eliminated the disease.",

      "Italian authorities say 40 migrants with no permission to remain on Italian soil are being transferred from Italy to Albania",
      "ROME -- Italian authorities said Friday they were transferring 40 migrants with no permission to remain in the country to Italian-run migration detention centers in Albania. It appeared to be the first time a European Union country was sending rejected migrants to a nation outside the EU that is neither their own nor a country they had transited on their journey.",
      "Italian media reported the migrants had left the Italian port of Brindisi. The Italian government has not released their nationalities or further details.",
      "The migrants will be held in Italian-built and run migrant centers located in Shengjin port, 66 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of the capital, Tirana, and in Gjader. They were built to process asylum requests of migrants intercepted in the Mediterranean Sea by Italy. But since their inauguration in October, Italian courts have stopped authorities from using them and small groups of migrants were returned to Italy.",
      "It is not clear how long the rejected asylum-seekers may stay in Albania. In Italy they can be detained for up to 18 months pending deportation.",
      "Italy\u2019s far-right-led government of Premier Giorgia Meloni approved a decree last month that expanded the use of the Albanian fast-track asylum processing centers to include the detention of rejected asylum seekers with deportation orders.",
      "While the announcement was in line with a recent EU Commission proposal that would allow EU countries to set up so-called \u201creturn hubs,\" the proposal has yet to be fully approved. Migrant rights organizations and lawyers say it violates the right to seek asylum and sets a dangerous precedent.",
      "Migration experts consulted by The Associated Press say it's unclear how legal Italy's actions were and that they would likely be challenged in court.",
      "\u201cThey need to show they are doing something with this incredibly expensive structure,\u201d said Meghan Benton of the Migration Policy Institute. Speaking from Toulouse, France, Benton said other EU countries are interested in doing the same, including the Netherlands with Uganda.",
      "Francesco Ferri, a migration expert with Action Aid, who was among a group of nongovernmental organizations and Italian lawmakers visiting Albania to follow the migrant transfer, said there is no legislation in Italian law, nor in EU law, nor in the Albania-Italy agreement that would allow rejected asylum-seekers to be deported directly from Albania, making the purpose of the transfer unclear.",
      "\u201cFor us it is unacceptable,\u201d Ferri said.",
      "The Albanian centers opened in October but they remained substantially inactive due to legal hurdles and wide opposition from human rights associations, which believe they violate international laws and put migrants\u2019 rights at risk.",
      "The November 2023 agreement between Italy and Albania\u2014 worth nearly 800 million euros over five years \u2014 allows up to 3,000 migrants intercepted by the Italian coast guard in international waters each month to be sheltered in Albania and vetted for possible asylum in Italy or repatriation.",
      "Italy has agreed to welcome those migrants who are granted asylum, while those whose applications are rejected face deportation directly from Albania.",
      "The first three groups of 73 migrants transferred there in October, November and January spent only a few hours in Albania and were returned to Italy after Italian magistrates refused to validate their detention in the non-EU country.",
      "So far this year, 11,438 migrants landed on Italian shores, less than the 16,090 who arrived in the same period last year. Most arrived from Bangladesh, followed by Syria, Tunisia and Egypt, according to the Italian Interior Ministry. ____",
      "Semini reported from Tirana, Albania and Brito from Barcelona, Spain. Associated Press journalists Giada Zampano and Paolo Santalucia in Rome contributed to this report.",

      "Istanbul\u2019s jailed opposition mayor has appeared in court in one of multiple cases against him",
      "ISTANBUL -- Istanbul\u2019s jailed opposition mayor appeared in court Friday in one of multiple cases against him.",
      "Hundreds of supporters gathered outside Silivri prison, west of Istanbul, where the hearing was taking place.",
      "Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu has been held at Silivri since March 23. The case alleges that he threatened a public prosecutor and is one of six that predate his arrest last month, which led to nationwide protests.",
      "Addressing the judge, Imamoglu said he was in court because he had won three elections against the person \u201cwho thinks he owns Istanbul,\u201d a reference to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who launched his political career as the city\u2019s mayor in the 1990s. Erdogan was heavily involved in backing his party\u2019s candidates against Imamoglu.",
      "The hearing was attended by Imamoglu\u2019s wife and son, as well as lawmakers from the Republican People\u2019s Party, or CHP, Halk TV and other outlets reported. The case was adjourned to June 16.",
      "The mayor, who is also the main opposition challenger to Erdogan\u2019s 22-year rule at the next election, faces more than seven yearsin prison and a political ban for allegedly \u201ctargeting, threatening and insulting persons working in the fight against terrorism.\u201d",
      "The charge stems from comments he made on Jan. 20 in which he criticized Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor Akin Gurlek over criminal cases brought against other opposition figures.",
      "Imamoglu was arrested on March 19 in relation to two investigations, one focusing on corruption in the Istanbul municipality and another alleging terrorism links in his party\u2019s electoral pact with pro-Kurdish politicians.",
      "Demonstrations calling for his release and an end to Turkey\u2019s democratic backsliding under Erdogan led to some 2,000 people being detained for attending protests banned by the authorities.",
      "The mayor was officially nominated as the CHP presidential candidate while in custody. An election is due to be held in 2028 but may come sooner, and Imamoglu\u2019s imprisonment has been widely viewed as politically motivated although the government insists Turkey\u2019s judiciary is independent and free of political influence.",
      "Also Friday, two other courts in Istanbul were also holding hearings on cases against Imamoglu.",
      "One is a bid-rigging case that dates back 10 years, when he was mayor of Istanbul\u2019s Beylikduzu district. The other alleges illegal donation collection and stems from a video circulated in the runup to last year\u2019s local elections showing CHP staff counting bundles of cash.",

      "On the eve of the meeting of Ukraine's Western backers at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said a key issue was strengthening his country\u2019s air defenses. \u201cUkraine needs a sufficient number of modern systems like Patriot\u201d missile systems, he said in a post on social media.",
      "\u201cA political decision is needed to supply these systems to protect our cities, towns, and the lives of our people \u2014 especially from the threat of Russian ballistic weapons. Our partners have such available systems,\u201d Umerov said.",

      "\u201cUkraine needs at the very least 10 systems that are sufficiently effective specifically against Russian ballistic missiles, and this is where Patriots are second to none,\u201d he said on his Telegram channel ahead of the meeting. \"We are counting on decisions.\u201d",

      "The Russian delay in accepting Washington's proposal has frustrated U.S. President Donald Trump and fueled doubts about whether Russian President Vladimir Putin really wants to stop the fighting while his bigger army has momentum on the battlefield.",
      "\u201cRussia continues to use bilateral talks with the United States to delay negotiations about the war in Ukraine, suggesting that the Kremlin remains uninterested in serious peace negotiations to end the war,\u201d the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank, said in an assessment late Thursday.",

      "The Sao Paulo Museum of Art has opened a new building, bringing to completion its architectural vision 77 years after the facility's inauguration",
      "SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 S\u00e3o Paulo is marking the opening of its famed art museum's new building with a Renoir exhibit and art lovers are already flocking to the Brazilian city.",
      "The new, 14-story tower of Sao Paulo Museum of Art \u2014 better known as MASP after its initials and one of the country's most visited \u2014 opened its doors on March 28, bringing to completion its architectural vision 77 years after the museum was inaugurated.",
      "The tower is named after the museum's first artistic director, Pietro Maria Bardi, and includes five exhibition galleries, two multi-purpose galleries, a restoration lab, classrooms, a restaurant, and a museum shop.",
      "The 13 works by French impressionist Pierre-Auguste Renoir are a special draw and treat to visitors, while others come eager to see how the original red MASP building blends with the new addition on the Paulista Avenue, Brazil's most recognizable business road.",
      "Next month, the museum will host an exhibition of works of Claude Monet, another French impressionist and an art fan favorite in Brazil.",
      "The new building more than doubles the museum space to 7,821 square meters (84,184 square feet), increasing MASP's exhibition capacity by 66%. Its fa\u00e7ade is made of perforated and pleated metal sheets, which add to the brutalist style conception of the original building next to it.",
      "Construction started in 2019 and was entirely sponsored by donors who spent about 250 million Brazilian reais ($43 million) on the project, inspired by vertical museum typologies such as those in New York City, MASP said.",
      "\u201cMASP is the main museum in the Southern Hemisphere in terms of European art collection,\" said said Paulo Vicelli, MASP\u2019s director for experience and communication. \"We have more than 11,000 works; Amedeo Modigliani, Paul C\u00e9zanne, Vincent van Gogh, Rafael, the great masters. But also important artists from Brazil.\u201d",
      "\u201cArt can transform people, the city,\" he added. \"Everyone who comes leaves a different person.\u201d",
      "The original MASP building was in a different venue for 20 years but then in 1968 moved to the Paulista Avenue. The museum \u2014 a prime example of brutalism, a form characterized by exposed concrete structures, emphasis on raw materials and monumental scale \u2014 is the work of architect Lina Bo Bardi.",
      "Over the years, it has become one of Sao Paulo's most recognizable touristic attractions.",
      "\u201cMASP has grown and become bigger than its building. It was necessary to push the boundaries,\u201d said museum director Heitor Martins. \u201cThis is a historic moment. ... Two buildings form one museum.\u201d",
      "An underground walkway connecting the two buildings is expected to be completed in November. Until then, visitors will have to briefly step out on the busy Paulista Avenue to move from one building to the other.",
      "Naira Regis de Moura, a 60-year old tourist from the southern city of Porto Alegre, said she was moved when she saw MASP's new tower. She came to Sao Paulo for a concert, but found a way to squeeze a museum visit into her schedule.",
      "\u201cThis is a landmark for Brazilian art,\u201d she said.",

      "The conflict in Amhara has simmered largely out of sight, with access limited by authorities and insecurity. But a rare interview with Asres, deputy of an influential Fano faction, and others on the ground give a sense of its impact.",
      "Ethiopia's federal government has long been challenged to hold together a potent mix of ethnic groups and interests. Sometimes, as recently in the Tigray region, it explodes into war.",
      "The Amhara, Ethiopia\u2019s second-largest ethnic group, once dominated national politics. Many among the rebels want to see them in power again. But they also claim the Amhara are under attack, citing ethnic-based violence in parts of Ethiopia where they are a minority.",
      "The extent of the Amhara fighting has been difficult to measure since the Fano emerged during anti-government protests in 2016.",
      "Alliances in Ethiopia can be shifting. During the Tigray conflict, the Fano fought alongside Ethiopian forces. Afterward, angered by certain terms of the peace deal, the rebels turned against the federal government once again.",
      "Before taking up arms, Asres said he coordinated peaceful demonstrations to protest the killing of Amharas. He was arrested twice and fled in 2022 after a third warrant was issued.",
      "These days, he and fellow fighters live in fear of drone strikes by Ethiopian forces. He makes bullish, unverified claims.",
      "\u201cWe have fought thousands of battles,\u201d he told The Associated Press from Amhara\u2019s Gojjam area, which has seen some of the heaviest battles. He claimed that the Fano control over 80% of Amhara, a mountainous region of over 22 million people, and has captured \u201cmany enemy troops.\u201d",
      "In a statement last month, Amhara\u2019s deputy head of security said the government had \u201cfreed\u201d 2,225 of Amhara\u2019s 4,174 subdistricts. It was not clear how many more were under Fano control.",
      "Fighting has escalated since mid-March, with the Fano launching an offensive across Amhara. The military has claimed it \u201ccrushed\u201d the offensive and killed 300 Fano fighters, but reports of clashes persist.",
      "Amhara's large population has long created pressure to expand, and the ethnic group has claimed the western part of Tigray. The Fano and Amhara regional forces seized it during the Tigray conflict, but they were left out of peace negotiations. They were angered to learn that western Tigray's fate might be left up to a referendum, which has not been held.",
      "It is \"not a genuine peace,\u201d Asres said.",
      "After several months of small-scale skirmishes, Amhara saw open rebellion in July 2023, when Fano groups launched a coordinated offensive and briefly seized control of several towns.",
      "They retreated to the countryside and have waged a hit-and-run guerrilla campaign since then, setting up checkpoints on key roads and often entering major urban areas.",
      "\u201cOne week you\u2019re ruled by one, one week you\u2019re ruled by the other,\u201d said a mother of three in the southern town of Debre Markos, referring to the rebels and Ethiopia's military. She spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.",
      "The monitoring group ACLED recorded 270 battles between Fano and government forces between Oct. 27 of last year and Jan. 31, as well as over a dozen attacks targeting health facilities and doctors in Amhara since last April.",
      "Residents and observers say some local officials have fled their posts for fear of assassination, while police struggle to maintain control.",
      "The regional education office says over 3,600 schools across Amhara are closed, with many looted or damaged, depriving 4.5 million children of schooling. The government said 2.3 million people needed food aid in 2024, many in hard-to-reach areas.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t travel from one city to another safely. Work has stopped,\u201d said Tadesse Gete, a barber based in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, but from North Gondar, one of the fighting's hot spots. He said his family fled for safety.",
      "Rights groups have accused Ethiopia\u2019s military of abuses including extrajudicial killings, drone strikes against civilians and enforced disappearances of alleged Fano sympathizers. Human Rights Watch last year said it had documented attacks by Ethiopian soldiers and allied militias in at least 13 Amhara towns since August 2023.",
      "The bloodiest known episode was in February 2024 in Merawi, 30 kilometers (18 miles) south of Amhara's regional capital, when Ethiopian troops went door-to-door rounding up and executing civilians following a Fano attack, according to Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. The state-appointed human rights commission said at least 45 civilians were killed.",
      "\u201cThe Ethiopian authorities have taken no meaningful steps to hold perpetrators accountable,\u201d said Haimanot Bejiga, a researcher for Amnesty International.",

      "Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube said the government has approved the disbursement of $3.1 million, the first such payment under a deal signed between President Emmerson Mnangagwa and dispossessed white farmers in 2020.",
      "Ncube said in a statement this week that the amount is equivalent to 1% of the total compensation claim of $311 million. He said 740 farms have been approved for compensation, with 378 benefiting from the first batch of payments.",
      "About 4,000 white farmers lost their homes and swathes of land when the Black-majority country\u2019s then-president, Robert Mugabe, launched the often-chaotic redistribution program in 2000.",

      "The compensation payments are part of conditions of a debt resolution and international re-engagement strategy by Zimbabwe after years of sanctions and isolation by the United States and other Western countries.",
      "The U.S. and the European Union imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe and dozens of its officials, citing human rights abuses that included often violent attacks on white farmers and seizures of their land. Those measures have been gradually eased over the years, although Mnangagwa and some members of his inner circle remain under sanctions.",
      "Mnangagwa has shown signs of rapprochement with the U.S, supporting some of President Donald Trump\u2019s controversial decisions. In February, he backed Trump\u2019s moves to deport undocumented migrants. Last week, he offered support to Trump\u2019s harsh tariff regime and said Zimbabwe in response would slash tariffs on U.S imported goods to zero \u201cin the spirit of constructing a mutually beneficial and positive relationship.\u201d",

      "Immediately after the crash, gestures by Russian President Vladimir Putin created hopes for better ties between Russia and Poland. But Russia's ensuing refusal to hand over the wreckage to Poland has instead engendered greater distrust as fears grow of Russian aggression in the region.",
      "Among those who joined remembrance events in Warsaw was Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, the surviving twin of the late president and leader of the country's main opposition party, Law and Justice, who continues to have a prominent role in political life in the Central European nation of 38 million people.",
      "The plane crash occurred when the presidential delegation was flying to Smolensk, Russia, to pay tribute to some 22,000 Polish officers killed in the Katyn massacres by the Soviet secret police during World War II. Traveling with Kaczy\u0144ski and the first lady were military commanders, the president of the national bank, senior members of the clergy as well as lawmakers and other top officials. All 96 aboard were killed.",
      "A Polish investigation carried out soon after the crash concluded that it was an accident resulting pilot error and heavy fog. However, Kaczy\u0144ski has long suggested that Prime Minister Donald Tusk, his political rival, and Putin colluded to eliminate his brother from public life.",
      "Years of investigations while his party was in power did not produce evidence of that claim. Many Poles accuse Kaczy\u0144ski of fomenting a dangerous conspiracy theory. He repeated his unproven allegation of foul play in an interview Thursday in the \u201cSuper Express\u201d tabloid. He said his brother had a political plan, and he remains convinced that there was \"an assassination attempt organized by those for whom this plan was detrimental.\u201d",
      "Tusk said it was time for reconciliation.",
      "\u201cThe memory of the Smolensk disaster and its victims should no longer divide us,\u201d Tusk said on X. \u201cRebuilding community and mutual respect is possible and necessary, even if it is still very difficult.\u201d",

      "Since the fall of President Bashar Assad in Syria late last year, Israel and Turkey have been competing over their separate interests there. Syria\u2019s Foreign Ministry has said Israeli jets have struck a Syrian airbase. Turkey purportedly hopes to use the base to extend its influence.",
      "Israel also fears that Syria\u2019s new Islamist leadership will pose a new threat along its border and has set up a buffer zone inside Syrian territory. Turkey\u2019s emergence as a key player in Syria, meanwhile, has prompted Israeli concerns over a larger Turkish military presence. Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that Turkish bases in Syria would be a \u201cdanger to Israel.\u201d",
      "Ankara is supporting the new Syrian government, which is led by former rebels it backed during the 13-year civil war. The support includes counterterrorism operations against the Islamic State group.",
      "The Defense Ministry official said that assessments for the establishment of a base for joint Turkish-Syrian training are ongoing, adding that such activities followed international law \u201cwithout targeting third countries.\u201d",
      "Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Wednesday that Turkey had \u201cno intention of conflict in Syria, not only with Israel but with any country in the region.\" But he added that Ankara \"cannot watch Syria being subjected to an internal turmoil, an operation, a provocation that will threaten Turkey\u2019s national security.\u201d",
      "Once strong regional partners, ties between Israel and Turkey have long been frosty and deteriorated further over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been an outspoken critic of the war, prompting angry reactions from Israeli officials.",
      "Netanyahu this week sought to hear support from his ally President Donald Trump on a country Israel perceives as increasingly hostile. Instead, Trump lavished praise on Erdogan for \u201ctaking over Syria,\u201d positioned himself as a possible mediator between the countries and urged Netanyahu to be \u201creasonable\u201d in his dealings with Turkey.",

The court is most likely to say the same thing in this case, meaning that this case will not go forward,\u201d Melanie O\u2019Brien, an associate professor of international law at the University of Western Australia and an expert on the Genocide Convention, told The Associated Press.",

Those flights went through Mar\u00e9chal Idriss Deby international airport in Amdjarass, Chad. The UAE says the purpose of the flights was to support a local hospital.",
      "In January, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that RSF leader Mohammad Hamdan Daglo Mousa, also known as Hemedti, had been targeted for sanctions along with seven RSF-owned companies in the United Arab Emirates, including one handling gold likely smuggled out of Sudan. That came as the U.S. declared the RSF rebels are committing genocide.",
      "The war has killed more than 24,000 people and driven over 14 million people \u2014 about 30% of the population \u2014 from their homes, according to the United Nations. An estimated 3.2 million Sudanese have escaped to neighboring countries.",

      "BRUSSELS -- European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Thursday welcomed President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to temporarily halt most U.S. tariffs, but she did not say whether the European Union intends to press ahead with its own retaliatory measures.",
      "\u201cI have authorized a 90 day PAUSE,\u201d Trump said, after recognizing the more than 75 countries that he said have been negotiating on trade and had not retaliated against his latest increases in tariffs. Countries subject to the pause will now be tariffed at 10%. The EU's rate was 20%, but it was not entirely clear how the 27-nation bloc would be impacted.",

      "In a statement, BirGun said: \u201cNo matter what excuses the official authorities use, we know that the main reason for the detention of our friends is that they have revealed one by one the unlawful acts in all the judicial processes carried out since March 19 and have resolutely pursued the system of lies and plunder into which they are trying to drag the country.\u201d",
      "The newspaper added that its writer Soykan had been due to receive an award for his journalism Thursday evening, which demonstrated that \u201cthe government\u2019s main target is not crime and criminals, but journalism and the truth.\u201d",
      "As he was being transferred from the hospital to police headquarters, Soykan shouted: \u201cThe gangs will lose, the people will win. All of this will end.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe must be ready for when that peace comes. That\u2019s why the work of this coalition is so vital,\" Healey said at NATO headquarters in Brussels. He added that 200 military planners have been developing plans to deepen European involvement in Ukraine.",

      "Its make-up will depend on the nature of any peace agreement, but the contingent is unlikely to be stationed at Ukraine's border with Russia. It would be located farther from the ceasefire line, perhaps even outside Ukraine, and deploy to counter any Russian attack.",
      "Building a force big enough to act as a credible deterrent is proving a considerable effort for nations that shrank their militaries after the Cold War but are now rearming. U.K. officials have talked about possibly 10,000 to 30,000 troops.",
      "Healey said the \u201creassurance force for Ukraine would be a committed and credible security arrangement to ensure that any negotiated peace does bring what President Trump has pledged: a lasting peace for Ukraine.\u201d",

      "\u201cCan the U.S. produce what China, or Yiwu is producing now? Ordinary people are the ones who will get hurt the most by the tariffs,\" she said. \"I don\u2019t think he can continue his behavior for long.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Los Angeles-area residents whose homes survived the Eaton wildfire in January face a whole different set of struggles to their neighbors whose homes were burned to the ground",
      "All sense of survivors\u2019 guilt was fleeting for those residents whose homes remained standing after wildfires ripped through the Los Angeles area three months ago.",
      "Many worried that smoke from the Eaton wildfire that destroyed more than 9,000 structures and killed 18 people may have carried toxins, including lead, asbestos and heavy metals, into their homes. But they struggled to convince their insurers to test their properties to ensure it was safe to return.",
      "Nicole Maccalla, a data scientist, said embers burned more than half of her roof, several windows and eaves were damaged, and her house in Altadena was left filled with ash, debris, soot and damaged appliances. She said her insurance adjuster said USAA would pay for contamination testing, but after choosing a company and coming back with the results, her claim was rejected. The adjuster said the company only covered testing in homes with major damage.",
      "\u201cEvery single item is a battle,\u201d said Maccalla. \u201cIt\u2019s denials and appeals and denials and appeals, and you wait weeks and weeks and weeks for responses.\u201d",
      "Maccalla and others banded together as Eaton Fire Residents Unite, sharing environmental testing data and compiling the results in an online map. Of 81 homes tested so far for lead, all show elevated levels, according to the group.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve already had multiple people reach out and say: \u2018Thank you for publishing this map \u2026 because my insurance company has changed their mind and approved testing,\u2019\u201d said Maccalla, who helped design the data collection to verify results and maintain privacy.",
      "Many homeowners paid privately for the testing after their insurance companies refused, revealing gaps in coverage. The group hopes the data will help residents who can\u2019t afford it to convince their insurers to cover testing and remediation.",
      "\u201cIf I can prove my community is not fit for human habitation then maybe I can show my home won\u2019t be,\u201d said Jane Lawton Potelle, founder of Eaton Fire Residents Unite.",
      "It's not easy to understand how and when it is safe to return home, Lawton Potelle said. The fine print of insurance policies can be frustrating and confusing, and the government has not stepped in to help.",
      "The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it has no plans to conduct widespread environmental testing. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is tracking environmental testing largely by academic researchers and a handful from government agencies, but most studies assess outdoor contamination.",
      "Reports from other urban wildfires, in which building materials, appliances, cars and more burn at incredibly high temperatures, show increased levels of heavy metals including lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzene that are tied to negative health risks. But insurance companies haven't standardized testing for those contaminants.",
      "Home insurance broadly covers fire damage, but there is a growing dispute over what damage must be covered when flames don't torch the property.",
      "California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara released a bulletin in March that put the onus on companies to properly investigate reported smoke damage, saying they cannot deny such claims without investigating thoroughly, including paying for professional testing as warranted. But many residents have been left to fight for coverage anyway.",
      "Janet Ruiz, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute that represents many major insurance companies, said it's hard to compare neighbors because every claim is unique due to each home\u2019s physical structure, actual damage and defined insurance coverage limits.",
      "\u201cIt can vary and insurance companies are sensitive to what the claim is,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cYou have to work with your insurance companies and be reasonable about what may have happened.\u201d",
      "Dave Jones, director of the Climate Risk Initiative at University of California, Berkeley, and former state insurance commissioner, said testing should be covered even though some insurance companies disagree.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly reasonable for people to have some kind of environmental test done so that their home is safe and their property is safe,\" Jones said. \"We\u2019re talking about very catastrophically high temperature fires where all sorts of materials are melted and some of them become toxic.\"",
      "The state's insurer of last resort, known as the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, has been scrutinized for years over how it handles smoke damage claims. A 2017 change to the FAIR Plan limited coverage to \u201cpermanent physical changes,\u201d meaning smoke damage must be visible or detectable without lab testing for claims to be approved. State officials said that threshold was too high and illegal, and ordered a change.",
      "Dylan Schaffer, an attorney leading a class action lawsuit challenging FAIR Plan\u2019s threshold, said he was surprised private carriers are disputing similar fire damage claims.",
      "\u201cThe damage is not due to smoke, the damage is contamination from fire,\u201d Schaffer said. \u201cThey make it complicated because it saves them money.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Altadena residents on the FAIR Plan say their claims are still being denied. Jones believes the debate will only end when lawmakers take action.",
      "FAIR Plan spokeswoman Hilary McLean declined to comment on the ongoing litigation and individual cases, but said the FAIR Plan pays all covered claims based on the adjusters\u2019 recommendations.",
      "\u201cOur policy, like many others, requires direct physical loss for there to be coverage,\u201d McLean said.",
      "Lawton Potelle said the first inkling that her house might be toxic came after meeting with her AAA insurance adjuster in the days after the fire. Even though she had worn a mask, her chest still ached and her voice rasped, and she wondered whether her home was safe for her 11-year-old.",
      "Stephanie Wilcox said her toddler\u2019s pediatrician recommended testing their home. Her Farmers Insurance policy includes coverage for lead and asbestos in addition to her wildfire coverage, but after multiple denials, she paid out of pocket.",
      "\u201cAfter the initial inspection, (Farmers) had told us remediation would cost about $12,000 and that it would be habitable, like we could move back in tomorrow,\u201d she said. \"But now there\u2019s no way.\u201d",
      "She plans to ask for a new estimate including lead abatement and other costs, citing the results.",
      "Similarly, Zach Bailey asked in late January for contamination testing. The house he shares with his wife and toddler sits in an island of largely spared homes among blocks wiped out by the fire. After months of denials, State Farm agreed to pay for lead and asbestos testing because the remediation company cited federal worker safety regulations.",
      "It shouldn't have been that hard, he said.",
      "\u201cIt feels like the insurance companies should have a playbook at this point,\" he said. \u201cThey should have a process to keep people safe because this isn\u2019t the first disaster like this.\u201d",

      "The visit comes at a complex moment for Europe and China. The tariffs announced last week \u2014 and then paused \u2014 by U.S. President Donald Trump could mean that the European Union pursues more trade with China \u2014 the world\u2019s third-largest consumer market after the United States and the EU.",

And this is clear, the world needs both China and the United States to talk.\u201d",

      "American shrimpers have been hammered in recent years by cheap imports flooding the U.S. market and restaurants, driving down prices to the point that profits are razor thin or shrimpers are losing money and struggling to stay afloat.",
      "Tariffs, they hope, could level the playing field and help their businesses not just survive but thrive.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been tough the last several years that we\u2019ve tried to fight through this,\" said Reed Bowers, owner of Bowers Shrimp Farm in Palacios, Texas. Tough times meant difficult choices for many. \"Cutting people off, laying people off, or reduce hours or reduce wages ... whatever we can do to survive.\"",
      "Since 2021, the price of imported shrimp has dropped by more than $1.5 billion, according to the Southern Shrimpers Alliance trade association, causing the U.S. shrimp industry to lose nearly 50% of its market value.",
      "The shrimpers alliance complains that the overseas industry has benefitted from billions of dollars invested in shrimp aquaculture, cheap or even forced labor, use of antibiotics banned in the U.S., and few or no environment regulations.",
      "More than 90% of shrimp consumed in the U.S. is imported, according to the alliance.",

      "But Trump's tariffs will also force shrimpers to balance the higher costs of equipment, such as trawl cables, webbing, chains and shackles. Some of those items have recently been increasing in price, Wallis said.",
      "\"We got be careful that there\u2019s a good balance,\u201d he said.",
      "If the American shrimping industry collapses, Wallis sees a future where foreign trawlers are operating in the Gulf of Mexico, which Trump renamed the \u201c Gulf of America. \u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hanging on to have something when I retire,\u201d said Wallis, who is 72. \u201cIf it keeps going like it is, it\u2019s taken away from my retirement that I\u2019ve worked for all my life.\u201d",
      "Phan Tran's family used to be shrimpers but quit the boats around 25 years ago to open Tran's Family Restaurant, a place they literally built themselves.",
      "\u201cIt was just my dad, me and one welder,\u201d Tran said.",

      "\u201cThe taste, the size, you could tell the texture of the shrimp, everything. ... Domestic shrimp versus imported shrimp, you could tell the difference,\u201d Tran said, adding he'll be buying straight from the day's catch at the dock, \u201cas long as we have the restaurant business.\u201d",
      "Tariffs will help keep the market fair for local shrimpers, Tran said.",

      "The withdrawal of Kathleen Sgamma to lead the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management was announced Thursday morning at the start of her confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.",
      "David Bernhardt, who served as interior secretary in Trump\u2019s first term, suggested on X that Sgamma\u2019s withdrawal was \u201cself-inflicted\u201d and he included a link to a website that posted her 2021 comments. Bernhardt indicated that people whose views don\u2019t align with Trump\u2019s should not seek political appointments in his administration.",
      "\u201cI am disgusted by the violence witnessed yesterday and President Trump\u2019s role in spreading misinformation that incited it,\u201d Sgamma said in the comments earlier reported by Documented, which describes itself as a watchdog journalism project.",
      "Sgamma confirmed her withdrawal on LinkedIn and said it was an honor to have been nominated.",
      "\u201cI remain committed to President Trump and his unleashing American energy agenda and ensuring multiple-use access for all,\u201d said Sgamma. Since 2006 she's been with the Denver-based Western Energy Alliance, an oil industry trade group, and has been a vocal critic of the energy policies of Democratic administrations.",
      "White House spokesperson Liz Huston said the administration looked forward to naming another nominee but did not offer a timeline.",
      "The longtime oil and gas industry representative appeared well-poised to carry out Trump's plans to roll back restrictions on energy development, including in Western states where the land bureau has vast holdings. The agency also oversees mining, grazing and recreation.",
      "Sgamma's withdrawal underscored the Trump administration's creation of a \u201cloyalty test\u201d to weed out subordinates who are out of step with him, said Aaron Weiss, deputy director of the left-leaning Center for Western Priorities.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the world we're in \u2014 if that\u2019s what happened \u2014 where being sane and acknowledging reality with the White House is enough to sink a nomination,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump has been testing how far Republicans are willing to go in supporting his supercharged \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d agenda. Few Republicans have criticized Trump after his sweeping pardons of supporters, including violent rioters, charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.",
      "Most congressional Republicans have played down the potential negative impact of Trump\u2019s actions, including widespread tariffs on U.S. allies, and have stressed the importance of uniting behind him.",
      "The Bureau of Land Management plays a central role in a long-running debate over the best use of government-owned lands, and its policies have swung sharply as control of the White House has shifted between Republicans and Democrats. Under President Joe Biden, a Democrat, it curbed oil drilling and coal mining on federal lands while expanding renewable power. The agency under Biden also moved to put conservation on more equal footing with oil drilling and other extractive industries in a bid to address climate change.",
      "Trump is reversing the land bureau's course yet again.",
      "On Thursday, officials announced that they will not comprehensively analyze environmental impacts from oil and gas leases on a combined 5,500 square miles (14,100 square kilometers) of bureau land in Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming. The leases were sold to companies between 2015 and 2020 but have been tied up by legal challenges.",
      "Also this week, Trump signed an executive order aimed at boosting coal production. That will end the Biden administration's ban on new federal coal sales on bureau lands in Wyoming and Montana, the nation's largest coal fields.",
      "The land bureau had about 10,000 employees at the start of Trump\u2019s second term, but at least 800 employees have been laid off or resigned amid efforts by the Trump administration to downsize the federal workforce.",
      "It went four years without a confirmed director during Trump's first term. Trump moved the agency\u2019s headquarters to Colorado before it was returned to Washington, D.C., under Biden.",
      "Senate energy committee Chairman Mike Lee said he would work with the administration to find a new nominee for the bureau.",
      "\"Its work directly impacts millions of Americans \u2014 especially in the West \u2014 and its leadership matters,\" the Utah Republican said.",
      "Utah officials last year launched a legal effort to wrest control of Bureau of Land Management property from the federal government and put it under state control. They were turned down by the U.S. Supreme Court.",

      "In the aftermath of Wednesday\u2019s tariff whiplash, President Donald Trump is deciding exactly what he wants out of trade talks with as many as 75 nations in the coming weeks",
      "WASHINGTON -- In the aftermath of this week's tariff whiplash, President Donald Trump is deciding exactly what he wants out of trade talks with as many as 75 nations in the coming weeks.",
      "Trump is also figuring out next steps with China. He upped his tariffs on Chinese goods to 145% after China placed retaliatory taxes of 84% on imports from the U.S. While his 90-day pause on other tariffs caused the stock market to rally on Wednesday, countries still face a baseline 10% import tax instead of the higher rates announced on April 2.",
      "\u201cThere will be a transition cost and transition problems,\u201d Trump said at Thursday's Cabinet meeting. \u201cBut in the end it\u2019s going to be a beautiful thing.\u201d",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, told Fox News\u2019 \u201cFox and Friends\" on Thursday that the administration already has \u201coffers on the table from more than 15 countries.\u201d",
      "Hassett said the next step will be determining exactly what Trump wants out of the negotiations.",
      "\u201cWe have a meeting today with all the top principals where we\u2019re going to present to the president a list of what we think his priorities might look like,\" Hassett said. \"And I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going to, you know, have his own ideas about where to move things.\u201d",
      "Here's a look at where Trump's tariffs showdown stands:",
      "With $28.9 trillion in publicly held debt, the U.S. government can still be beholden to the investors who lend it money. Trump might be willing to run roughshod over political rivals, judges he dislikes and a host of political norms, but the bond market showed that it can temper his plans.",
      "Going into Wednesday, the interest rate on a 10-year U.S. Treasury note was increasing and approaching 4.5%. That meant the U.S. government was having a tough time finding possible buyers for its debt, as market participants were wondering if Trump's tariffs had caused foreign buyers to sour on the U.S. government. Higher interest rates for the government could trigger even higher mortgage rates and auto loans for consumers, among other problems.",
      "Trump on Wednesday said investors were getting \u201cyippy,\u201d but after his tariff pause he described the bond market as \u201cbeautiful.\u201d",
      "The S&P 500 stock index jumped 9.5% after the pause was announced. But reality crept back in Thursday and the S&P 500 slumped nearly 3.5% as interest rates on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose. Sure, Trump was no longer going to put a 20% tariff on goods from the European Union, a 24% tariff on Japan or 25% on South Korea. But those nations still have imports taxed at an elevated 10%, Trump's new baseline as trade talks begin. And tariffs went up against China, locking the world's two largest economies in a trade war.",
      "Plus, the trade war has expanded with China, and 25% tariffs still apply to imported autos, steel and aluminum. Imports from Canada and Mexico, the two largest U.S. trading partners, still face tariffs of as much as 25%. And Trump still plans tariffs on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips.",
      "\u201cWhile we appreciate the pause, the reciprocal tariff of 10% still represents more than double the tariff on imports of leather footwear from countries like Vietnam and Cambodia,\u201d said Tom Florsheim, CEO of the Weyco Group, a footwear company. \u201cEven at this level, it means a significant cost increase that will impact consumers.\u201d",
      "Because tariffs are taxes paid by importers, the costs generally get passed along to consumers and businesses in the form of higher prices. The Budget Lab at Yale University estimated Thursday that even with the pause, Trump's current tariff regime would pull down a household's average disposable income by $4,364.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said any trade agreements will be \u201cbespoke\u201d deals, rather than some overarching pact among a group of countries. Trump has laid out a series of grievances and goals regarding tariffs, but Canadian and European counterparts have said the actual asks from administration officials have been vague so far.",
      "Trump has said he wants to eliminate the $1.2 trillion trade deficit, which means he no longer wants the U.S. to import more goods than it exports to other nations. He also wants revenues from tariffs to offset his income tax cut plans. The president has also said he wants the tariffs to bring back factory jobs and raise workers\u2019 wages.",
      "Aides have said Trump wants other nations to scrap regulations and other policies, such as Europe's value-added taxes, that he deems to be a barrier to U.S. goods, an ask that would require other countries to change their laws. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said the goal is to get other nations to \u201crespect\u201d Trump.",
      "His goals might not necessarily be in line with what other nations want.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen posted on X that she's \u201cconsistently advocated for a zero-for-zero tariff agreement between the European Union and the United States.\u201d",
      "Lori Wallach, director of the Rethink Trade program at the American Economic Liberties Project, said Trump needs to be more publicly forthright about what he wants out of trade talks and tariffs.",
      "\u201cAbsent transparency about what is being demanded, we could end up with the worst of all outcomes \u2014 a bunch of bad special interest deals, all of the economic damage caused by tariff uncertainty and no trade rebalancing, U.S. manufacturing capacity or goods jobs,\u201d she said.",
      "The Trump administration views China as violating basic trade norms with how it subsidizes its manufacturers, takes intellectual property from its global competitors, suppresses wages for its workers and manipulates its currency.",
      "The White House clarified that the 125% tariffs that Trump announced Wednesday against China were actually 145%, once his previous 20% fentanyl tariffs were included.",
      "Census Bureau data show the U.S. ran a $295 billion trade deficit last year with China. Because U.S. consumers and businesses are such a major customer of Chinese manufacturers, Bessent has said that gives the U.S. an edge in terms of inflicting pain on that nation's economy through tariffs. Of course, China has also spent several years preparing for a trade war.",
      "Trump at his Cabinet meeting expressed hope that he could get an agreement with China, though he didn't offer any specifics on what he was seeking.",
      "\u201cWell, we\u2019ll see what happens with China,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI would love to be able to work a deal.\u201d",
      "Wendong Zhang, an economist at Cornell University, said the Chinese economy might suffer a steeper hit to its gross domestic product than the U.S., but it's \u201clikely to stick to its guns\u201d due to internal public support and the ability to increase consumption domestically on goods that might no longer be going to the U.S.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump will need to deal with voters who might be frustrated over the higher price of electronics and other goods resulting from the trade wars.",
      "\u201cMany products that the U.S. imports are predominantly from China: smartphones (73%), laptops (78%), video game consoles (87%), toys (77%), and also antibiotics for U.S. livestock production,\" Zhang said in an email. \u201cResourcing from other countries will take time and result in much higher costs.\u201d",

      "Even a hefty push from President Donald Trump couldn't heave the package to approval. Johnson was forced to abandon Wednesday's scheduled action as the Republican hardliners left him without enough support, and risked upending what the president calls the \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\" which is central to his agenda of tax cuts, mass deportations and a smaller federal government.",
      "\u201cThe president is very anxious for us to get this done,\u201d Johnson, R-La., said as he left a late-night meeting with the GOP lawmakers. He said he expects votes on Thursday.",
      "Pushing the budget framework forward would log another milestone for Johnson, who can only lose a few detractors from his slim majority. A failed vote, particularly as the economy was convulsing over Trump\u2019s trade wars, would be a major setback for the Republican agenda in Washington.",

Several of them, including members of the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus, made the unusual move of walking across the Capitol to meet privately with Senate GOP leaders to insist on deeper cuts.",
      "As night fell, Johnson pulled a group of Republicans into a private meeting room as House proceedings came to a standstill. They stayed into the night hashing out alternatives.",

      "But House GOP conservatives, including several of those who met personally with Trump at the White House this week, remained concerned that the Senate GOP's blueprint, approved last weekend, does not slash spending to the level they believe is necessary to help prevent soaring deficits.",
      "\u201cThe Math Does Not Add Up,\u201d Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, posted on social media. He said he would not support it.",
      "Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., the chair of the Freedom Caucus, led others to met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and other top Senate Republicans.",
      "\u201cAll we can do is make sure that they understand where we\u2019re coming from and how close we want to work with them to get to the final product,\u201d Thune said afterward.",
      "But the Senate GOP leader panned the idea of the House sending back an amended version, which would require another potential all-night voting session like the one senators endured last weekend. \u201cWe can\u2019t do that \u2014 another vote-a-rama, that drags it on indefinitely,\u201d Thune said.",
      "The House and Senate are still at the beginning phase of a process that will take weeks, if not months, as they turn their budget resolutions into legislative text \u2014 a final product with more votes ahead later this spring or summer.",
      "Democrats, in the minority, do not have enough votes to stop the package, but have warned against it.",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said the Republicans' budget plan is reckless and callous as it proposes slashing budgets to give tax breaks to the wealthy.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re here to make it clear,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cHands off everyday Americans struggling to make ends meet.\u201d",
      "Central to the budget framework is the Republican effort to preserve the tax breaks approved in 2017, during Trump's first term, while potentially adding the new ones he promised on the campaign trail. That includes no taxes on tipped wages, Social Security income and others, ballooning the price tag to some $7 trillion over the decade.",
      "The package also allows for budget increases with some $175 billion to pay for Trump's mass deportation operation and as much for the Defense Department to bolster military spending.",
      "It all would be partly paid for with steep cuts to domestic programs, including health care, as part of the $2 trillion in reductions outlined in the House GOP version of the package, though several GOP senators have signaled they are not willing to go that far.",
      "To clip costs, the Senate is using an unusual accounting method that does not count the costs of preserving the 2017 tax cuts, some $4.5 trillion, as new spending, another factor that is enraging the House conservatives.",
      "Two Republican senators voted against their package during an overnight weekend session \u2014 Maine Sen. Susan Collins objected to steep cuts to Medicaid in the House's framework, while Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul argued the whole package relied on \u201cfishy\u201d math that would add to the debt.",
      "The package would also boost the nation's debt limit to allow more borrowing to pay the bills. Trump had wanted lawmakers to take the politically difficult issue off the table. With debt now at $36 trillion, the Treasury Department has said it will run out of funds by August.",
      "But the House and Senate need to resolve their differences on the debt limit, as well. The House GOP raises the debt limit by $4 trillion, but the Senate GOP boosted it to $5 trillion so Congress would not have to revisit the issue again until after the fall 2026 midterm election.",
      "With Trump's trade wars hovering over the debate, House Republicans tucked a provision into a procedural vote that would prevent House action \u2014 as the Senate has taken \u2014 to disapprove of Trump\u2019s tariffs.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, widely seen as the front-runner in a presidential by-election triggered by the removal of Yoon Suk Yeol last week, announced his presidential bid Thursday, vowing to heal a starkly divided nation through economic growth.",
      "Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 election to Yoon, led the liberal Democratic Party\u2019s campaign to oust the former president over his December declaration of martial law.",
      "Lee recently stepped down as the party\u2019s chairman to focus on campaigning for the June 3 election. He is considered the clear front-runner in party's primary. Kim Dong-yeon, the Democratic governor of Gyeonggi province and a longtime financial policymaker, also told reporters Wednesday that he intends to run for president.",
      "Yoon\u2019s downfall has left the conservative People Power Party in disarray, with roughly 10 politicians expected to seek the nomination, reflecting a split between Yoon loyalists, who still control the party\u2019s leadership, and reformists calling for a fresh start.",
      "In a video message, Lee said that Yoon\u2019s martial law saga exposed the country\u2019s deep divisions and social conflicts, and argued that the root cause was a widening rich-poor gap. He promised aggressive government spending to jolt economic growth and ease income polarization.",
      "\u201cWe have more than we did in the past, but wealth is too concentrated in certain areas,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWith economic growth rates declining worldwide, it has become difficult to maintain and develop an economy solely on the strength of the private sector. However, with government-led talent development and extensive investments in technological research and development, we can revive the economy.\u201d",
      "Lee said it was crucial to maintain a robust alliance with the United States and to pursue three-way cooperation with Japan, but he stressed that South Korea\u2019s national interest should come first in \u201cevery decision.\u201d",
      "Lee, who has served as a lawmaker, provincial governor and city mayor, is adored by supporters for his outspoken style and has long positioned himself as an anti-elitist. His critics view him as a populist who stokes division and demonizes conservative opponents while failing to offer realistic funding plans to achieve his ambitious goals.",
      "Kweon Seong-dong, PPP floor leader and a staunch Yoon loyalist, said that if Lee becomes president, he will \u201cruthlessly wield the sword of dogmatism and retribution\u201d and further deepen the country\u2019s divisions.",
      "Lee also has his own set of legal troubles, facing five different trials for corruption and other criminal charges.",
      "Earlier this month, the Constitutional Court upheld Yoon\u2019s impeachment by the legislature and formally removed him from office over the martial law decree, triggering a presidential by-election within 60 days. The next president will serve a full 5-year term.",
      "Former PPP leader Han Dong-hoon, head of the party\u2019s anti-Yoon faction, announced his presidential bid Thursday, positioning himself as a conservative who opposed martial law and appealing to centrist voters to stop the inauguration of a populist \u201cmonster government\u201d led by Lee. Among the conservatives\u2019 presidential hopefuls, former Labor Minister Kim Moon Soo is considered to be the most pro-Yoon.",
      "Kim, Daegu Mayor Hong Joon-pyo and senior PPP lawmaker Ahn Cheol-soo \u2014 a former computer software entrepreneur who finished third in the 2017 presidential vote \u2014 have declared their intentions to run for president. Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon is expected to enter the race later.",

    "story": [
      "The 29 vehicles in a Rolls-Royce and Bentley museum outside Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, are getting the best of care in their golden years",
      "MECHANICSBURG, Pa. -- Mike Fowler had been faintly aware that a museum of Rolls-Royce and Bentley vehicles existed near his boyhood home in the suburbs of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, but the car enthusiast didn't expect the experience he got when he started volunteering there.",
      "Fowler had oil on his hands within a half-hour of his first volunteer session at the Rolls-Royce and Bentley Museum. More than a year later, he keeps a list on his phone with notes about cars in the collection to help him get them started properly or disconnect their batteries.",
      "Fowler is part of a group of about 50 volunteers who gather twice a month at the museum to help out, including cleaning, maintaining and driving the fleet of customized iconic vehicles, many designed to be driven by a chauffeur. For many volunteers, it\u2019s an opportunity to experience a life few people can afford.",
      "\u201cYou take it out on the road and you are transported to a different time, a different mentality,\u201d said Fowler, a 28-year-old Camp Hill resident.",
      "Newcomers are first paired with a more experienced volunteer for about a year and must pass the museum\u2019s driving school. They start with the most modern vehicles, which have automatic transmissions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re very protective of the collection. We\u2019re its caretakers, and we take it very seriously. So you can\u2019t just come in off the street and start driving,\u201d said Sarah Holibaugh, the museum\u2019s head librarian and archivist. \u201cBut it should be that way.\u201d",
      "The 29 antique and collectible Rolls-Royce and Bentley automobiles that date as far back as the late 1920s are the central attraction of the largely overlooked and seldom visited museum, which is easy to miss among the surrounding miles of farm fields and stretch of nondescript industrial buildings just outside Mechanicsburg. The museum, owned by the Rolls-Royce Foundation, includes a showroom, maintenance area and a third room being converted into a library and reading room.",
      "\u201cI often wonder if the homes around here know the foundation exists,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cOr if they always just wonder, \u2018Why do we see these vintage Rolls-Royce and Bentleys roaming around from time to time?\u2019\"",
      "The museum has its roots in nearby Harrisburg, where Rolls-Royce put an owners' club in the 1960s, located between large dealerships in New York and Washington. After Hurricane Agnes devasted that location in 1972, a businessman donated the Mechanicsburg property for a new facility. The 6,000-person owners' club, with members in 26 countries and a headquarters in the same complex, is a separate entity but works closely with the museum.",
      "Though admission is just $5, the museum launched in 2004 gets only about 1,000 visitors a year. It typically draws members of car clubs, groups of seniors and students on school field trips, with visits that have to be scheduled in advance.",
      "It also has rented out its cars for films and similar uses. The museum's 1961 Rolls-Royce Phantom V was in last year\u2019s Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet biopic about Bob Dylan, \u201cA Complete Unknown,\u201d and a 1959 Silver Cloud I from the collection appeared in Season 4 of the series \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\u201d",
      "Volunteers also help preserve and digitize the museum's archive of ownership and service records for North America, which span from 1907 until 2004, shortly after Rolls-Royce and Bentley were acquired by BMW and Volkswagen, respectively. Records for cars made for the European market are available through the Rolls-Royce Enthusiasts\u2019 Club in the United Kingdom.",
      "The North American records, which are available for a fee and produce the foundation's biggest revenue stream, have helped prove cars outside of their collection were once owned by famed director Alfred Hitchcock, actor Zsa Zsa Gabor and hockey great Wayne Gretzky.",
      "Foundation records have also debunked claims about purported prior ownership, including a Rolls-Royce vehicle thought to have been owned by country singer Hank Williams Jr.",
      "\u201cWe were able to absolutely prove that it was not owned by him,\u201d recalled volunteer Randy Churchill, a Boiling Springs man now retired from a marketing career. \u201cThey just thought they had a million-dollar gold mine on their hands.\u201d",
      "Vehicles in the museum\u2019s collection range in value from about $30,000 to about $120,000. A whiskey delivery truck appraised at $320,000 has been donated and will soon be on display.",
      "Many of the cars Rolls-Royce has built are still on the road and used models can be surprisingly cheap. But maintaining an older Rolls, with its customized features and expensive parts, can be pricey, noted volunteer Ron Deguffroy, a retired psychologist from Chambersburg.",
      "\u201cThe most expensive Rolls-Royce you will buy,\" he said, \u201cis a cheap one.\u201d",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- A new executive order from President Donald Trump that's part of his effort to invigorate energy production raises the possibility that his Department of Justice will go to court against state climate change laws aimed at slashing planet-warming greenhouse gas pollution from fossil fuels.",
      "Trump\u2019s order, signed Tuesday, comes as U.S. electricity demand ramps up to meet the growth of artificial intelligence and cloud computing applications, as well as federal efforts to expand high-tech manufacturing. It also coincides with \u201cclimate superfund\u201d legislation gaining traction in various states.",
      "Trump has declared a \u201c national energy emergency \" and ordered his attorney general to take action against states that may be illegally overreaching their authority in how they regulate energy development.",
      "\u201cAmerican energy dominance is threatened when State and local governments seek to regulate energy beyond their constitutional or statutory authorities,\u201d Trump said in the order.",
      "He said the attorney general should focus on state laws targeting climate change, a broad order that unmistakably puts liberal states in the crosshairs of Trump's Department of Justice.",
      "Michael Gerrard, director of the Columbia University\u2019s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said it would be an \u201cextraordinarily bold move\u201d for the federal government to go to court to try to overturn a state climate law.",
      "Gerrard said the quickest path for Trump's Department of Justice is to try to join ongoing lawsuits where courts are deciding whether states or cities are exceeding their authority by trying to force the fossil fuel industry to pay for the cost of damages from climate change.",
      "Democratic governors vowed to keep fighting climate change.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom accused Trump of \u201cturning back the clock\u201d on the climate and said his state's efforts to reduce pollution \u201cwon\u2019t be derailed by a glorified press release masquerading as an executive order.\u201d",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, cochairs of the U.S. Climate Alliance, which includes 22 governors, said they \u201cwill keep advancing solutions to the climate crisis.\"",
      "Vermont and New York are currently fighting challenges in federal courts to climate superfund laws passed last year. Trump suggested the laws \u201cextort\u201d payments from energy companies and \u201cthreaten American energy dominance and our economic and national security.\u201d",
      "Both are modeled on the 45-year-old federal superfund law, which taxed petroleum and chemical companies to pay to clean up of sites polluted by toxic waste. In similar fashion, the state climate laws are designed to force major fossil fuel companies to pay into state-based funds based on their past greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "Several other Democratic-controlled states, including New Jersey, Massachusetts, Oregon and California, are considering similar measures.",
      "The American Petroleum Institute, which represents the oil and natural gas industries, applauded Trump\u2019s order that it said would \u201cprotect American energy from so-called \u2018climate superfunds.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cDirecting the Department of Justice to address this state overreach will help restore the rule of law and ensure activist-driven campaigns do not stand in the way of ensuring the nation has access to an affordable and reliable energy supply,\" it said.",
      "The American Petroleum Institute, along with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, filed the lawsuit against Vermont. The lawsuit against New York was filed by West Virginia, along with several coal, gas and oil interests and 21 other mostly Republican-led states, including Texas, Ohio and Georgia.",
      "Make Polluters Pay, a coalition of consumer and anti-fossil fuel groups, vowed to fight Trump's order and accused fossil fuel billionaires of convincing Trump to launch an assault on states.",
      "The order, it said, demonstrates the \u201ccorporate capture of government\u201d and \u201cweaponizes the Justice Department against states that dare to make polluters pay for climate damage.\u201d",
      "Separately, the Department of Justice could join lawsuits in defense of fossil fuel industries being sued, Gerrard said.",
      "Those lawsuits include ones filed by Honolulu, Hawaii, and dozens of cities and states seeking billions of dollars in damages from things like wildfires, rising sea levels and severe storms.",
      "In the last three months, the U.S. Supreme Court has declined to get involved in a couple climate-themed lawsuits.",
      "One was brought by oil and gas companies asking it to block Honolulu's lawsuit. Another was brought by Alabama and Republican attorneys general in 18 other states aimed at blocking lawsuits against the oil and gas industry from Democratic-led states, including California, Connecticut, Minnesota, New Jersey and Rhode Island.",
      "Trump\u2019s order set off talk in state Capitols around the U.S.",
      "That includes Pennsylvania, where the governor is contesting a court challenge to a regulation that would make it the first major fossil fuel-producing state to force power plant owners pay for greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "John Quigley, a former Pennsylvania environmental protection secretary and a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Kleinman Center for Energy Policy, wondered if the Department of Justice would begin challenging all sorts of state water and air pollution laws.",
      "\u201cThis kind of an order knows no bounds,\" Quigley said. \"It's hard to say where this could end up.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Inflation likely declined last month as the cost of energy, used cars and hotel rooms may have fallen, though President Donald Trump's remaining tariffs could lift prices soon.",
      "Consumer prices probably rose 2.6% in March from a year ago, the Labor Department is expected to report Thursday, according to economists' projections compiled by FactSet. That would be down from February's yearly gain of 2.8%. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices are expected to have risen 3%, down from 3.1% in February.",
      "The projected figures, if accurate, would suggest inflation is starting to cool again after remaining elevated for most of the fall and winter. Core inflation was stuck at 3.3% for five months before declining in February.",
      "Still, inflation remains above the 2% target set by the inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve. And on a monthly basis, core prices are forecast to rise 0.3% in March. If sustained, price increases at that pace would easily top the Fed's target. Overall prices are expected to tick up just 0.1% in March, however. Economists pay closer attention to the core figures because they provide a better guide to where inflation is headed.",
      "Most economists had forecast higher inflation this year as a result of the sweeping tariffs on 60 nations that President Donald Trump announced last week. Yet on Wednesday, Trump paused those duties for 90 days. A universal tariff of 10% remains in place, as well as 25% duties on steel, aluminum, cars and many items from Canada and Mexico.",
      "And import taxes on China have been ramped up to 125%, after China retaliated against Trump's earlier decisions to place large duties on imports from China.",
      "Even with the pause, many companies are still uncertain where trade policy will go next. Trump has also said that duties on pharmaceutical imports will be imposed.",
      "Consumers will likely see some prices rise because of the existing duties, including the massive tariffs on China. The United States imports more than $60 billion of iPhones and other mobile phones every year from China, as well as massive amounts of clothes, shoes and toys.",
      "Many U.S. companies will likely shift production out of China, a process that had already started during Trump's first term when he slapped duties on some of its exports. Still, China remains the Unite States' third-largest trading partner.",
      "Shifting supply chains out of China, however, will likely take time and come with its own costs, which could raise prices for U.S. consumers in the coming months.",
      "Last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that the central bank was likely to keep its key interest rate unchanged at about 4.3% as it waited to see how Trump's policies impacted the economy. Trump called for the Fed to cut rates on Friday.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of waiting and seeing going on, including by us,\u201d Powell said. \u201cAnd that just seems like the right thing to do in this period of uncertainty.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump delivered another jarring reversal in American trade policy Wednesday, suspending for 90 days import taxes he\u2019d imposed barely 13 hours earlier on dozens of countries while escalating his trade war with China. The moves triggered a powerful stock market rally on Wall Street but left businesses, investors and America\u2019s trading partners bewildered about what the president is attempting to achieve.",
      "The U-turn came after the sweeping global tariffs Trump announced last week set off a four-day route in global financial markets, paralyzed businesses and raised fears the U.S. and world economies would tumble into recession.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt tried to characterize the sudden change in policy as part of a grand negotiating strategy. But to those outside the Trump administration, it looked like a cave-in to market pressure and to growing fears that the president\u2019s impetuous use of import taxes -- tariffs -- would cause massive collateral economic damage.",

      "Trump\u2019s turnaround Wednesday capped a wild week in U.S. trade policy. On Wednesday April 2 \u2014 which Trump labeled \u201cLiberation Day\u2019\u2019 \u2014 the president announced plans to impose tariffs on almost every country on earth, upending the world trading system. The first of his new tariffs -\u2013 a 10% \u201cbaseline\u2019\u2019 tax on imports from most countries \u2013 went into effect Saturday.",

Those are the tariffs he suspended for 90 days, saying the pause would give countries time to negotiate with him and his trade team.",

Meanwhile, the 10% baseline tariffs \u2013 a substantial act of protectionism in their own right \u2013 remain in place.",
      "Trump\u2019s ever-changing trade war tactics \u2014 which include earlier levies on cars, steel and aluminum, and Mexico and Canada \u2014 have already done damage, forcing dazed companies to delay or cancel plans as they tried to figure out what Trump was doing and how they should respond.",

      "And Delta Air Lines said earlier Wednesday that demand for domestic leisure trips and corporate travel has stalled because of the uncertainty around global trade. In a conference call with investors, the company said it was cutting capacity. It also declined to provide a full-year financial forecast.",
      "\u201cRight now, it\u2019s hard to know how this is going to play out, given that this is somewhat self-imposed,\u201d Delta CEO Ed Bastian said. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that sanity will prevail and we\u2019ll move through this period of time on the global trade front relatively quickly.\u201d",

Earlier, Jaisli called Trump's tariffs \"a grenade that was thrown into the room that\u2019s going to cause chaos.''",
      "Trump's tariffs have set off a tit-for-tat trade war with China, the world's second-biggest economy. Even before Trump upped his taxes on China to 125%, the Chinese had set their own tariffs on the United States at 84%.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is reversing course on its requirement for all staffers to report to the office",
      "WASHINGTON -- Weeks after ordering all Food and Drug Administration employees back into the office, the agency is reversing course, allowing some of its most prized staffers to work remotely amid worries that recent layoffs and resignations could jeopardize basic functions, like approving new medicines.",
      "An internal email obtained by The Associated Press states that FDA leadership are \u201callowing review staff and supervisors to resume telework\u201d at least two days a week. The policy shift was confirmed by three FDA staffers who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal agency matters.",
      "The message was sent Tuesday to some of the FDA\u2019s hundreds of drug reviewers. Staffers said a similar policy was communicated to reviewers who handle vaccines, biotech drugs, medical devices and tobacco products\u2014 although not always in writing.",
      "It\u2019s the latest example of the Trump administration\u2019s chaotic approach to overhauling the federal health workforce, which has included firings, a scramble to rehire some employees, and then additional layoffs last week of an estimated 3,400 staffers, or more than 15% of the agency\u2019s workforce. When FDA employees were called back to the agency's Maryland headquarters last month they confronted overflowing parking lots, crowded offices and broken or missing supplies.",
      "A spokeswoman for Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the administration is returning to \u201cpre-COVID telework arrangements for reviewers, whose read and write work output is tracked in 15-minute increments to ensure productivity and accountability.\u201d",
      "While many agencies switched to telework during the pandemic, the FDA began embracing the practice nearly two decades earlier. The flexibility was seen as a competitive perk for recruiting employees who can often earn more working in industry.",
      "Last week's cuts included entire offices focusing on FDA policy and regulations, most of the agency\u2019s communication staff and teams that support food inspectors and investigators. Senior officials overseeing tobacco, new drugs, vaccines and other products have also been dismissed or forced to resign. Staffers have described rank-and-file employees \u201cpouring\u201d out of the agency.",
      "Former FDA Commissioner Dr. David Kessler called the cuts \"devastating, haphazard, thoughtless and chaotic\" during a House hearing on Wednesday.",
      "When Kennedy announced plans to eliminate 10,000 staffers across the federal health workforce, he noted that FDA medical reviewers and safety inspectors wouldn't be impacted.",
      "In February, HHS was forced to recall some probationary employees who were fired, including hundreds of medical reviewers at FDA, whose salaries are largely funded by industry fees, not federal dollars.",
      "But last week\u2019s cuts combined with resignations and retirements have raised a new threat: that FDA funding could fall so low that it short circuits a long-standing system in which companies help fund much of the agency's operations.",
      "Nearly half the FDA's nearly $7 billion budget comes from fees collected from drug, device and tobacco companies. The agency uses the money to hire thousands of extra staffers to quickly and efficiently review new products. For example, about 70% of the FDA\u2019s drug program is financed by user-fee agreements, which must be reauthorized by Congress every five years.",
      "But the agreements stipulate that if FDA\u2019s federal funding falls below set levels, companies are no longer required to pay fees and, in some cases, can claw back their money. The threshold requirements are designed to ensure Congress continues funding FDA, rather than relying entirely on the private sector.",
      "FDA and industry groups are supposed to begin negotiations later this year to renew several user-fee agreements, including those for drugs and devices.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the agency nor regulated industry can afford for \u2018user fees\u2019 not to be reauthorized,\u201d said Michael Gaba, an attorney who advises FDA-regulated companies.",
      "Whatever the reasoning behind the telework shift, former government officials say it\u2019s a sign that recently confirmed FDA Commissioner Marty Makary is trying to retain and rebuild staffing and resources. Makary made his first appearance at FDA's headquarters last Wednesday, one day after the mass layoffs. According to the memo obtained by the AP, Makary signed off on the return to telework.",
      "\u201cDr. Makary needs to rebuild teams and restart the engine of productivity lost to weeks of job insecurity, uncertainty and shortages of team members,\u201d said Steven Grossman, a former HHS official. \u201cTurning commuting time back into work time is a great first step in achieving both.\u201d",

      "Bulls, bears and dead cats are lurking in the background of President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war",
      "NEW YORK -- Bulls, bears and dead cats are lurking in the background of President Donald Trump's trade war. As the effects of the administration's latest tariffs unfold, news consumers may confront unfamiliar terms related to investments or financial markets. Here is a guide to some of the most common words:",
      "A bear market is a term used by Wall Street when an index such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 20% or more from a recent high for a sustained period of time.",
      "Why use a bear to refer to a market slump? Bears hibernate, so they represent a stock market in retreat. In contrast, Wall Street\u2019s nickname for a surging market is a bull market, because bulls charge.",
      "When stocks rebound briefly in a moment of free fall or uncertainty, it's known as a \u201cdead cat bounce.\" That's from the notion that even a dead cat will bounce when it falls from a great enough height. The market recovery tends to be temporary and brief, and the downturn tends to resume.",
      "Capitulation refers to the point when investors give up on the idea of recouping their losses and sell, often out of fear and intolerance of falling prices. This tends to happen during times of low confidence and high uncertainty and volatility.",
      "Capitulation can sometimes indicate the bottom of a market, but it's easier to identify in retrospect.",
      "A recession is a time when the economy shrinks and unemployment rises.",
      "Recessions are officially declared by the obscure-sounding National Bureau of Economic Research, a group of economists who consider factors such as hiring trends, income levels, spending, retail sales and factory output. The bureau's Business Cycle Dating Committee defines a recession as \u201ca significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.\u201d",
      "The organization typically does not declare a recession until well after one has begun, sometimes as long as a year later.",
      "In the days before Trump\u2019s most recent tariffs took effect, economists at Goldman Sachs raised their assessment of the odds the U.S. will experience a recession from 35% to as high as 65%, but the analysts rescinded that forecast Wednesday after his administration announced a 90-day pause on most of the levees.",
      "\"Buying the dip\u201d refers to purchasing a stock or buying into the market right after it has lost value, at a discount. The phrase is commonly used by retail investors. Unfortunately, it's all but impossible to time the market, to know where the bottom will be or how long a recovery will take.",
      "The 10-year Treasury bond yield is the interest rate the U.S. government pays to borrow money for a decade. It's a key indicator of investor sentiment and economic conditions, and it helps set prices for all kinds of other loans and investments. The yield influences borrowing costs and signals expectations about inflation and economic growth.",
      "Historically, Treasury bonds are considered one of the world's safest assets. That means investors often buy them when there's uncertainty in the market, which tends to lower the yield. Prices for the 10-year bonds tend to fall when confidence is high (and people buy assets perceived as riskier), which causes yields to rise.",
      "In recent days, however, investors have sold Treasury bonds, which has sent the benchmark 10-year yield up. That could point to a lack of consumer confidence in Treasury bonds themselves, or any number of other factors.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Facing a global market meltdown, President Donald Trump on Wednesday abruptly backed off his tariffs on most nations for 90 days even as he further jacked up the tax rate on Chinese imports to 125%.",
      "It was seemingly an attempt to narrow what had been an unprecedented trade war between the U.S. and most of the world to a showdown between the U.S. and China. The S&P 500 stock index jumped 9.5% after the announcement, but the drama over Trump's tariffs is far from over as the administration prepares to engage in country-by-country negotiations. In the meantime, countries subject to the pause will now be tariffed at 10%.",
      "The president hit pause in the face of intense pressure created by volatile financial markets that had been pushing Trump to reconsider his tariffs, even as some administration officials insisted the his reversal had always been the plan.",
      "As stocks and bonds sold off, voters were watching their retirement savings dwindle and businesses warned of worse than expected sales and rising prices, all a possible gut punch to a country that sent Trump back to the White House last year on the promise of combatting inflation.",
      "The global economy appeared to be in open rebellion against Trump\u2019s tariffs as they took effect early Wednesday, a signal that the U.S. president was not immune from market pressures. By early afternoon, Trump posted on Truth Social that because more than 75 countries had reached out to the U.S. government for trade talks and had not retaliated in meaningful ways, \u201cI have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately.\u201d",
      "Trump later told reporters that he pulled back on many global tariffs \u2014 but not on China \u2014 because people were \u201cyippy\u201d and \u201cafraid\" due to the stock market declines. He added that while he expected to reach deals, \u201cnothing\u2019s over yet.\u201d",
      "The president said he had been monitoring the bond market and that people were \u201cgetting a little queasy\" as bond prices had fallen and interest rates had increased in a vote of no confidence by investors in Trump's previous tariff plans.",
      "\u201cThe bond market is very tricky,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI was watching it. But if you look at it now, it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d",
      "The president later said he'd been thinking about his tariff pause over the past few days, but he said it \u201ccame together early this morning, fairly early this morning.\u201d",
      "Asked why White House aides had been insisting for weeks that the tariffs were not part of a negotiation, Trump said: \u201cA lot of times, it\u2019s not a negotiation until it is.\u201d",
      "The 10% tariff was the baseline rate for most nations that went into effect on Saturday. It's meaningfully lower than the 20% tariff that Trump had set for goods from the European Union, 24% on imports from Japan and 25% on products from South Korea. Still, 10% represents an increase in the tariffs previously charged by the U.S. government. Canada and Mexico would continue to be tariffed by as much as 25% due to a separate directive by Trump to ostensibly stop fentanyl smuggling.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the negotiations with individual countries would be \u201cbespoke,\u201d meaning that the next 90 days would involve talks on a flurry of potential deals. Bessent, a former hedge fund manager, told reporters that the pause was because of other countries seeking talks rather than brutal selloffs in the financial markets, a statement later contradicted by the president.",
      "\u201cThe only certainty we can provide is that the U.S. is going to negotiate in good faith, and we assume that our allies will too,\u201d Bessent said.",
      "The treasury secretary said he and Trump \u201chad a long talk on Sunday, and this was his strategy all along\u201d and that the president had \u201cgoaded China into a bad position.\u201d",
      "Prior to the reversal, business executives were warning of a potential recession caused by his policies, some of the top U.S. trading partners were retaliating with their own import taxes and the stock market was quivering after days of decline.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the walk back was part of Trump\u2019s negotiating strategy.",
      "She said the news media \"clearly failed to see what President Trump is doing here. You tried to say that the rest of the world would be moved closer to China, when in fact, we\u2019ve seen the opposite effect. The entire world is calling the United States of America, not China, because they need our markets.\u201d",
      "The head of the World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, said the trade war between the U.S. and China could \u201ccould severely damage the global economic outlook\" and warned of \u201cpotential fragmentation of global trade along geopolitical lines.\u201d",
      "Market turmoil had been building for weeks ahead of Trump's move, with the president at times suggesting the import taxes would stay in place while also saying that they could be subject to negotiations.",
      "Particularly worrisome was that U.S. government debt had lost some of its luster with investors, who usually treat Treasury notes as a safe haven when there's economic turbulence. Government bond prices had been falling, pushing up the interest rate on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note to 4.45%. That rate eased after Trump's reversal.",
      "Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities, said before the announcement that markets wanted to see a truce in the trade disputes.",
      "\u201cMarkets more broadly, not just the Treasury market, are looking for signs that a trade de-escalation is coming,\" he said. \"Absent any de-escalation, it\u2019s going to be difficult for markets to stabilize.\u201d",
      "John Canavan, lead analyst at the consultancy Oxford Economics, noted that while Trump said he changed course due to possible negotiations, he had previously indicated that the tariffs would stay in place.",
      "\u201cThere have been very mixed messages on whether there would be negotiations,\" Canavan said. \"Given what's been going on with the markets, he realized the safest thing to do is negotiate and put things on pause.\u201d",
      "The whipsaw-like nature of Wednesday could be seen in the social media posts of Bill Ackman, a hedge fund billionaire and Trump supporter.",
      "\u201cOur stock market is down,\u201d Ackman posted on X. \u201cBond yields are up and the dollar is declining. These are not the markers of successful policy.\u201d",
      "Ackman repeated his call for a 90-day pause in the post. When Trump embraced that idea several hours later, an ebullient Ackman posted that Trump had \u201cbrilliantly executed\u201d his plan and it was \u201cTextbook, Art of the Deal,\u201d a reference to Trump's bestselling 1987 book.",
      "Presidents often receive undue credit or blame for the state of the U.S. economy as their time in the White House is subject to financial and geopolitical forces beyond their direct control.",
      "But by unilaterally imposing tariffs, Trump has exerted extraordinary influence over the flow of commerce, creating political risks and pulling the market in different directions based on his remarks and social media posts. There still appear to be 25% tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum, with more imports, including pharmaceutical drugs, set to be tariffed in the weeks ahead.",
      "The tariffs frenzy of recent weeks has taken its toll on businesses and individuals alike.",
      "On CNBC, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said the administration was being less strategic than it was during Trump's first term. His company had in January projected it would have its best financial year in history, only to scrap its expectations for 2025 due to the economic uncertainty.",
      "\u201cTrying to do it all at the same time has created chaos in terms of being able to make plans,\u201d he said, noting that demand for air travel has weakened.",
      "Before Trump's reversal, economic forecasters said his second term has had a series of negative and cascading impacts that could put the country into a downturn.",
      "\u201cSimultaneous shocks to consumer sentiment, corporate confidence, trade, financial markets as well as to prices, new orders and the labor market will tip the economy into recession in the current quarter,\u201d said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at the consultancy RSM.",
      "Bessent has previously said it could take months to strike deals with countries on tariff rates.

      "BRUSSELS -- European Union member states have voted to approve retaliatory tariffs on $23 billion in goods in response to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s 25% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.",
      "The tariffs will go into effect in stages, with some on April 15 and others on May 15 and Dec. 1. The EU executive commission didn\u2019t immediately provide a list of the goods Wednesday.",
      "Members of the 27-country bloc repeated their preference for a negotiated deal to settle trade issues.",
      "\u201cThe EU considers U.S. tariffs unjustified and damaging, causing economic harm to both sides, as well as the global economy,\" the EU's executive commission said in a statement. \"The EU has stated its clear preference to find negotiated outcomes with the U.S., which would be balanced and mutually beneficial.\u201d",
      "The targeted goods are a tiny fraction of the 1.6 trillion euros ($1.8 trillion) in U.S.-EU annual trade, which sees some 4.4 billion euros in goods and services cross the Atlantic each day in what the European Commission calls \u201cthe most important commercial relationship in the world.\u201d",
      "The head of the EU\u2019s executive commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has offered Trump a zero-for-zero tariffs deal on industrial goods including cars. But Trump has said that\u2019s not enough to satisfy U.S. concerns.",
      "The EU has targeted smaller lists of goods in hopes of exerting political pressure and avoiding economic damage from a wider escalation of tit-for-tat tariffs.",
      "The EU is also working on a response to Trump's blanket 20% tariff on all European goods, imposed as part of his sweeping \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs imposed on global trading partners. That could include measures aimed at U.S. tech companies and the services sector as well as trade in goods.",
      "France's Economic Minister Eric Lombard said the second package \u201cwill take account not only of European imports, but also of other ways in which we can respond.\u201d",
      "Lombard added: \u201cThe idea is that, with these extremely strong, extremely powerful measures, we can get to the negotiating table on an equal footing, so that both sides of these duties can be lowered and all our economic sectors protected.\"",

      "NEW YORK -- Walmart, the nation's largest retailer, is standing behind its full-year sales and operating income outlook even as President Donald Trump has launched tariff wars with China and nearly every trading partner that have brought a wave of economic uncertainty.",
      "The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company said Wednesday that it continues to expect first-quarter sales growth of 3% to 4%. But it walked away from its guidance for first-quarter operating profit growth of between 0.5% to 2%, citing the risk of tariffs. It didn't provide a new range.",
      "Walmart said in a release the range of outcomes has \u201cwidened due to less favorable category mix\" and \"the desire to maintain flexibility to invest in price as tariffs are implemented.\u201d",
      "The announcement comes the same day that Walmart is holding an investor conference featuring key leaders in Dallas.",
      "It also comes the same day that Trump's trade wars have escalated, raising the risk of a recession and causing panic in the financial markets. Trump\u2019s latest round of tariffs went into full effect at midnight Wednesday, with higher import tax rates on dozens of countries and territories taking hold.",
      "On Wednesday, China raised tariffs on American goods to 84% to match Trump\u2019s addition of a 50% tariff, while adding an array of additional countermeasures Wednesday.",
      "The 84% tariff will be effective Thursday, and comes as a 104% tax on the country\u2019s exports to the U.S. came into effect.",
      "Walmart has built in hedges against some tariff threats. Two-thirds of Walmart\u2019s merchandise is sourced in the U.S., with groceries driving much of that. Groceries account for roughly 60% of Walmart\u2019s U.S. business.",
      "But Walmart faces challenges with the new tariffs because they carry more economic risks than during Trump's first term. A wave of new price increases would deal a blow to its lower- and middle-income shoppers who have already been pulling back in the last year or so because of still-high inflation on necessities.",

    "story": [
      "Defending champion Scottie Scheffler opened with a bogey-free 68 on Thursday to put himself in the mix at the Masters",
      "AUGUSTA, Ga. -- Just a couple of weeks ago, Scottie Scheffler thought his game was not quite as sharp as he would have wanted it.",
      "\u201cSharp\u201d might be a poor word choice given what happened in December.",
      "In any case, Scheffler's game looked \u2014 How should we say it? \u2014 nicely honed in the opening round of the Masters on Thursday, when the defending champion shot a bogey-free 68 to put himself squarely in the mix. Sheffler made two long birdie putts and a couple of nice saves from bunkers on an Augusta National course that was ripe for some red numbers.",
      "\u201cI don't really care what happened in the last few tournaments,\u201d said Scheffler, who arrived this week winless for the first time since 2021. \u201cAny time you get close to the lead, it\u2019s going to be easier for you to win the golf tournament. That\u2019s a simple fact of the matter. You get off to a good start, statistically you\u2019re going to have a better chance to win.\u201d",
      "His good start began at the par-5 second, when Scheffler got up-and-down for birdie from 40 yards out. But it really brightened at the par-3 fourth, when he rolled in a putt from 62 feet across a green that slopes dramatically from back to front.",
      "Scheffler added another birdie at the par-5 eighth, then rolled in a 42-footer for birdie at No. 16. Throw in a pretty sand save at the next hole, when Scheffler managed to carry his bunker shot all the way to the top-shelf hole location at the back of the green, and the world's top-ranked player was happy to sign for a 4-under round to start his tournament.",
      "He is only the fourth defending Masters champion to open with a bogey-free round in the last three decades.",
      "\u201cAny time you can keep a card clean out here,\" Scheffler said, \u201cit's a really good thing.\u201d",
      "Even though he has yet to win this season, Scheffler believes things have been trending in the right direction. He shot a final-round 63 to finish second to Min Woo Lee at the Houston Open, and he was able to get some solid work in this past week, when he skipped the Texas Open in favor of a little extra preparation for the Masters.",
      "He hasn't had any problem with his hand, either. Scheffler cut it badly in December, when he was trying to make ravioli using a wine glass during the holidays and it broke. The injury forced Scheffler to delay the start of his season, and it may be one of the reasons why he merely has three top-10 finishes and no wins by the time he drove up Magnolia Lane.",
      "History has proven that a good start is important at Augusta National.",
      "This is the fourth consecutive year that Scheffler has opened with a round in the 60s. In 2022, he backed it up with a second-round 67 en route to his first green jacket, and he used his opening 66 last year to catapult him to his second one.",
      "Perhaps this one will help the 28-year-old become the youngest with three green jackets since Jack Nicklaus in 1966.",
      "\u201cI struggled for what felt like two pars today. I had to make two really good up-and-downs,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cBut other than that, the golf course was in front of me most of the day, kept the ball in play, did a lot of really good things out there.\u201d",

      "Lionel Messi and Inter Miami are headed to the CONCACAF Champions Cup semifinals and it took a dramatic three-goal comeback to get there",
      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- Down 1-0 on the scoreboard, down 2-0 in total goals in the series and needing three goals to advance, Inter Miami needed a most unlikely rally.",
      "Lionel Messi made it happen.",
      "Inter Miami is headed to the CONCACAF Champions Cup semifinals for the first time, after Messi \u2014 the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner \u2014 led a dramatic three-goal comeback. He had two goals and an assist, including the clinching penalty kick in the 84th minute, to lift Inter Miami past LAFC 3-1 on Wednesday night and a 3-2 aggregate win in the two-leg series.",
      "\u201cWe gave it our all,\u201d Inter Miami coach Javier Mascherano said. \u201cWe wanted it, we wanted to be in the semis, and I think it showed. ... Many times luck has to be on your side, and we had it.\u201d",
      "Maybe it was luck. Maybe it was Messi. Maybe it was both.",
      "For Messi, the series clincher was a bit reminiscent of how he led Argentina past France in the World Cup final in 2022. He scored two goals in that match, one on a penalty kick \u2014 then also converted in the penalty-shot shootout that decided the final after it ended in a 3-3 tie. Those goals came against France's Hugo Lloris, who was also in net for LAFC on Wednesday night.",
      "Lloris couldn't solve Messi in the World Cup final \u2014 and couldn't in this one, either. Messi simply waited for Lloris to move a bit on the penalty that put Inter Miami up 3-1, essentially freezing the keeper before gently sending the ball into the right side of the net.",
      "And when the final whistle sounded, Mascherano punched the air in celebration.",
      "\u201cThey believed,\u201d Mascherano said.",
      "Oscar Ustari made two huge stops in the final minutes for Inter Miami, who will face either the Mexican club Pumas or the Vancouver Whitecaps in the tournament\u2019s semifinals. The first leg of that two-leg matchup is set to start on either April 22, 23 or 24.",
      "Aaron Long scored in the ninth minute to give LAFC a 1-0 lead, but it put Inter Miami in a much deeper hole than that. Inter Miami lost the series opener at LAFC 1-0, so Long\u2019s goal not only gave LAFC a 2-0 aggregate lead \u2014 but it also gave his club control of the away-goals tiebreaker.",
      "That meant Inter Miami needed at least three goals from there to advance. It might have seemed unlikely.",
      "With Messi, all things are possible.",
      "Messi started the rally in the 35th, getting loose near the top of the 18-yard box and scoring with the left foot to tie the match at 1 \u2014 giving Inter Miami some hope.",
      "Noah Allen gave Inter Miami a 2-1 lead in the 61st \u2014 Messi getting the assist \u2014 on a bit of a fluke; he chipped a ball into the box, playing it toward Federico Redondo. Lloris came off his line, anticipating Redondo to play the ball \u2014 but it bounced off the grass, skipped past both of them and ended up in the side of the net.",
      "That knotted the aggregate at 2-2, but LAFC still held the away-goal tiebreaker. And in the 67th, Inter Miami thought it grabbed the lead in the series when Messi played a ball into the box that Luis Suarez appeared to flick into the net on a header \u2014 but the flag came up for offside, taking the goal off the board.",
      "Inter Miami kept the pressure on throughout, then argued successfully for a handball call that Messi turned into a 3-1 lead and a spot in the semifinals. It was his 42nd goal in 48 appearances across all competitions since joining Inter Miami.",
      "\u201cThis is the way,\u201d Mascherano said. \u201cThis is the way to play football. ... They gave everything. I'm very happy.\u201d",

      "Sunny Isles Beach officers responded to the home Monday following a call from Hill's mother-in-law, who began living with the couple in November, shortly after her granddaughter was born, according to the report.",

      "Hill\u2019s agent didn\u2019t immediately respond to a telephone message seeking comment.",

    "summary": "Jordan Spieth's 3-year-old son, Sammy, was among the kids who stole the show at the Masters Par 3 Contest on Wednesday",
    "story": [
      "Jordan Spieth's 3-year-old son, Sammy, was among the kids who stole the show at the Masters Par 3 Contest on Wednesday",
      "AUGUSTA, Ga. -- Sammy Spieth, age 3, hit a better tee shot by his standards than playing partners Justin Thomas and Max Homa did by theirs on the second hole of the Par 3 Contest at the Masters. He teed up a driver, gripped it cross-handed and sent his ball about 30 yards down the middle, while Thomas and Homa hit their wedges short and right into a bunker.",
      "Sammy's dad, 2015 Masters champion Jordan Spieth, didn't bother to tee off. He had enough to manage with a team of caddies \u2014 all wearing white Augusta National coveralls \u2014 that included Sammy, 1-year-old daughter Sophie and wife Annie, who is expecting a third child in July.",
      "The record book will show that Masters rookie Nico Echavarria won the Par 3 on Wednesday, beating J.J. Spaun with a birdie on the second playoff hole after each shot 5-under 22. While the Masters is arguably the easiest major to win because of its small field that includes aging past champions, the Par 3 is much easier, because most players don't even try.",
      "Gary Player certainly does. The oldest living Masters champion at age 89, he made three straight birdies \u2014 flirting with aces on Nos. 6 and 7 \u2014 to get his name onto the leaderboard, although he ultimately didn't post an official score.",
      "The same was true of 70 players in the field of 90. That trend likely will continue as long as the winner on Augusta National's tranquil, 1,090-yard par-3 course fails to win the green jacket. The contest began in 1960 and no one has won it and the Masters in the same year.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never really been, like, buy into the jinx too much, but I also don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever turned in a card,\u201d Thomas said.",
      "Rory McIlroy was joined by wife Erica and 4-year-old daughter Poppy, who holed a birdie putt on the ninth hole when she nudged the ball with her dad's putter and it nearly stopped before it caught a slope and ran into the hole.",
      "McIlroy, who would complete the career Grand Slam with a victory on Sunday, appreciated the chance to focus on his daughter, who interrupted his on-course interview with ESPN.",
      "\u201cThe buildup to this event is a lot, and the sort of anticipation and we\u2019re waiting eight or nine months for the next major to roll around from the Open Championship,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cTo end your preparation with an afternoon like this ... it's such a fun afternoon.\u201d",
      "Keegan Bradley made the first ace of the day when his approach on the 140-yard sixth hole caught a ridge and trickled into the cup. He hoisted each of his sons in the air, and when the family got to the green, Bradley's younger boy, 4-year-old Cooper, ran to the hole, looked down and clapped his hands together at the sight of the ball. He lifted it out and raised his arm in triumph.",
      "Earlier, when the Bradley family made its way down the first hole, 7-year-old Logan showed an impressive grasp of Masters patron etiquette when he yelled at his younger brother, \u201cYou can't run!\u201d",
      "Byeong Hun An's 5-year-old son, Sun-woo, got a cheer worthy of an ace when he bombed a drive about halfway to the green on the 130-yard first hole. Sun-woo then took out an iron and after a couple of whiffs \u2014 er, practice swings \u2014 he hit a worm-burner that scooted into a greenside bunker.",
      "Scottie Scheffler holed a 3-footer for birdie on the first hole, a feat more impressive because he did it one-handed while holding his 11-month-old son, Bennett.",
      "Tom Hoge gave been-there, done-that high-fives to the players and caddies in his group when he aced the 90-yard fourth with a shot that spun back and slammed into the flagstick. Brooks Koepka used the slope behind the hole on the sixth for the last hole-in-one of the day and 115th in the contest's history.",
      "Participation in the Par 3 is optional, and a handful of players \u2014 including Xander Schauffele, Patrick Cantlay and Phil Mickelson \u2014 opted out, choosing to grind on the range or play practice rounds well into the afternoon ahead of Thursday's opening round.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re not ready by now, then you don\u2019t really have a chance. This week takes a lot of energy,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough walk, it\u2019s hilly, and the mental energy you\u2019re expending as well. Get this done, and then just go home, have dinner, relax and get ready for tomorrow.\u201d",

      "Two months after that seismic trade out of nowhere that sent the five-time All-Star to the Lakers, the 26-year-old Doncic is back in Dallas for a game Wednesday night.",
      "\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know about closure. It\u2019s obviously a lot,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cI know the fans are going to appreciate me being back here. Honestly, I don't know how I\u2019m going to feel, but I\u2019m just excited to be back.\u201d",
      "Several hours before the sold-out game, tickets on the secondary market for upper-level seats were running at $230 and more, excluding fees. For the next Mavericks home game Friday night against Toronto, similar tickets were available for less than $20 before fees.",
      "Doncic had been the face of the Mavericks, and he was the NBA scoring champion last season when they made it to the NBA Finals. The 2019 rookie of the year from Slovenia had two seasons left on his contract when general manager Nico Harrison traded him the first weekend of February in a package that brought Anthony Davis to Dallas.",
      "Mavericks fans conducted a mock funeral outside the American Airlines Center on Feb. 2, right after news of the trade late the previous night. There have been protests and plenty of ire directed at Harrison, including \u201cFire Nico!\u201d showing up on plenty of signs and T-shirts. As for the GM, he hasn't spoken to the media since comments he made right after the deal was done when he said he felt the team was \u201cbuilt to win now as well as in the future.\u201d",
      "During a Mavericks TV broadcast last month, new team CEO Rick Welts said the reactions showed the emotional connection between the fans and the team.",
      "\u201cThe wonderful thing about our business is these things have a scorecard, right? Time, wins and losses will tell whether the deal was a good deal or a bad deal,\u201d Welts said. \u201cI just am going to promise our fans right now, whatever trust we have lost, or whatever concerns they have, we\u2019re going to earn it back, as we\u2019re going to do this the right way and we\u2019re going to win a championship.\u201d",
      "The Mavericks went into the reunion with Doncic sitting in 10th place in the Western Conference, the final spot to get into next week's play-in tournament.",
      "Dallas was 12-18 since the trade. Davis had played in only seven of those games (five wins). The 10-time All-Star missed six weeks after his dominant debut with the Mavs on Feb. 8, when he had 26 points, 16 rebounds, seven assists and three blocks against Houston before coming up lame in the third quarter because of a groin injury.",
      "Los Angeles, which was third in the West with four teams only a game behind them, was 20-12 since Doncic joined LeBron James' team. The Lakers were 16-9 in the games Doncic played, including Tuesday night when he got ejected at Oklahoma City.",
      "This isn't the first time Doncic played the Mavericks. He had a triple double (19 points, 15 rebounds and 12 assists) in the Lakers' 107-99 home win on Feb. 25, only 23 days after the trade.",
      "After that game, Doncic struggled for the words to express how strange it was to play against the Mavs.",
      "\u201cIt was so weird,\" Doncic said then. \"There were moments I felt like I don\u2019t know what I was doing.\u201d",

      "The International Olympic Committee made it official Wednesday when it released the official program for the 2028 Games, in which female athletes are expected to have a slight majority for the first time.",
      "Golf only returned to the Olympic program at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games after a 112-year absence, and it has awarded medals to only one competition \u2014 72 holes of stroke play \u2014 for men and for women.",
      "The International Golf Federation had been lobbying for a mixed-team competition for the last several years without taking away too much time from golfers' schedules on various tours.",
      "Still to be determined are how many teams will compete and the qualification process.",
      "\u201cThe International Golf Federation is thrilled with the IOC Executive Board\u2019s decision to approve the addition of a mixed-team event to the Olympic Golf program,\" the IGF said in a statement. It said more details would be released next week.",
      "The IOC had an online board meeting Wednesday that was co-chaired in Lausanne, Switzerland, for the first time by Kirsty Coventry since she was elected IOC president last month. She takes over in June for Thomas Bach and will be the first female IOC president in its 131-year history.",
      "The men's competition would start on Wednesday \u2014 one day earlier than before \u2014 and end on Saturday. The mixed teams would be held on Sunday and Monday, with foursomes (alternate shot) used for one round and fourballs (better ball) the other.",
      "Tuesday would be a practice day for the women, and their competition would start Wednesday through Saturday, one day before the Summer Games come to a close.",
      "The golf competition is scheduled for Riviera Country Club, a revered PGA Tour stop that has hosted major championships. Riviera is to host the U.S. Women\u2019s Open for the first time in 2026, and the U.S. Open returns in 2031.",
      "A mixed team event would require only two more days for the players who qualify for the Olympics. It\u2019s unlikely any of the top players would be competing the following week at a regular PGA Tour or LPGA Tour event.",
      "Scottie Scheffler won the men's gold medal at the 2024 Paris Games by closing with a 62 at Le Golf National. Lydia Ko won the women's gold in Paris \u2014 she won the silver in Rio and the bronze in Tokyo in 2021 \u2014 which also gave her points required for the LPGA Hall of Fame.",

      "AHMEDABAD, India -- Batter Sai Sudharsan and bowler Prasidh Krishna led Gujarat Titans to a 58-run victory over Rajasthan Royals as the 2022 champions notched their fourth straight win in the Indian Premier League on Wednesday to go top of the 10-team standings.",
      "Left-handed opener Sudharsan smashed 82 off 53 balls -- his third half century of the season -- and spearheaded Gujarat to 217-6 after Rajasthan won the toss and bowled.",
      "Right-arm fast bowler Krishna then picked up 3-24 in four overs with his sharp, short deliveries and spinner Rashid Khan took 2-37 as Rajasthan was bowled out for 159 in 19.2 overs.",

      "Gujarat has eight points with four wins in five games. It fell short by 11 runs in the only loss against Punjab Kings in the opening game run-fest at home. Gujarat has a two-point lead over second-placed Delhi Capitals, which has played two fewer games. Delhi has won all three of its games and is the only unbeaten team in the tournament.",

      "Jaiswal timed the ball confidently, only to see Rashid not moving an inch at third man for the catch, and Rana\u2019s ramp shot flew to Kulwant Khejroliya, also at third man, as Rajasthan slipped to 12-2.",
      "Samson and Riyan Parag (26) revived the chase briefly with Parag smashing three sixes. Parag was convinced he didn\u2019t edge impact player, left-arm fast bowler Khejroliya, after Gujarat went for a successful television review.",
      "Rashid, who picked up just one wicket in the last four matches, struck when Dhruv Jorel misread the googly and Sudharsan gobbled a low catch at deep mid-wicket.",
      "Samson was undone by Krishna\u2019s extra pace and got caught at short third man before Hetmyer made a brisk half century. He was eventually caught at deep backward square in the 16th over off another Krishna short ball to end Rajasthan\u2019s slim hopes.",
      "Sudharsan continued his sublime form. He and Jos Buttler laid the foundation for a big Gujarat score with an 80-run, second-wicket stand.",
      "That came after captain Shubman Gill (2) had his off stump clattered by Jofra Archer\u2019s 147 kph (91 mph) delivery before Sudharsan and Buttler took the total to 94.",

      "Shahrukh Khan hit a quick-fire 36 off 20 before Theekshana had him stumped off a full delivery.",
      "Sudharsan kept Gujarat going at more than 10 an over by smashing three sixes and eight fours but missed out on a century. He was caught behind off a thin inside edge against Tushar Deshpande (2-53) in the penultimate over as Rahul Tewatia (24 not out in 12 balls) carried Gujarat over the 200-run mark.",

      "Paige Bueckers is clearly the best-known player in Monday\u2019s WNBA draft, but Dominique Malonga of France is among the most interesting",
      "NEW YORK -- Paige Bueckers is clearly the best-known player in Monday's WNBA draft, but Dominique Malonga of France is among the most interesting.",
      "Curiosity around the 6-foot-6 forward seems to be growing.",
      "\u201cShe is a unbelievably intriguing player because she has size, athleticism and range,\u201d former Washington Mystics general manager Mike Thibault said. \u201cShe\u2019s got a wide range of skills, which makes her pretty intriguing.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s not much doubt Bueckers is going to have an immediate impact in Dallas on and off the court as the team's first pick, giving the Wings one of the most efficient players coming out of college in quite some time.",
      "Whether other players in the draft can offer quick help to teams will be seen over the next few months. A lot of that depends on which teams draft which players and how that fit evolves.",
      "It certainly applies to Malonga, who played for France's national team at last year's Paris Olympics.",
      "Still only 19, she averaged 15.0 points and 10.3 rebounds this season while playing professional basketball for Lyon.",
      "\u201cIf she were in the U.S.,\u201d Thibault said, \u201cshe would be a college sophomore basically with all that potential in front of her.\u201d",
      "ESPN analyst Debbie Antonelli believes players in this draft have a chance to be successful, though they don't bring the name recognition or resumes the players in last year's draft had.",
      "\u201cI think the timing for this class with expansion and the increased value in franchises and in the growth of the game will bring another level of incredible play from these players that have already been on a stage similar,\u201d Antonelli said.",
      "Five teams in the league don't even have first round picks: New York, Indiana, Phoenix and Atlanta all traded away their picks. Las Vegas forfeited its pick following an investigation by the league in 2023 that found the franchise violated league rules regarding impermissible player benefits and workplace policies.",
      "Washington has three picks in the first round and Connecticut has two. Both teams are rebuilding and players could find a lot of available minutes there. There's also the expansion Golden State franchise that should have a lot of open spots, too.",
      "Here are some players to keep an eye on that could dictate how the draft unfolds once Dallas makes Bueckers the expected No. 1 player selected:",
      "Malonga isn't the only player in the draft who has honed her skills in France. Juste Jocyte, Malonga's Lyon teammate in the French basketball league, is also expected to be taken in the first round.",
      "If Seattle takes her second, she'll be paired with an already strong frontcourt alongside Ezi Magbegor and Nneka Ogwumike, which could give the Storm a formidable front line.",
      "Jocyte is a versatile player who can play any of the guard positions and is really effective in the pick and roll. The Lithuanian, who is also 19 years old, scored 22 points against Belgium in EuroBasket qualifying a few months ago. She has a toughness about her and is fundamentally sound.",
      "\u201cShe's left-handed and knows how to play with or without the ball in her hands,\u201d Thibault said. \u201cNot a true point guard, but can handle the ball. She's a smart player who knows how to use screens.\u201d",
      "Aneesah Morrow has a nose for the ball with a desire to go get it.",
      "She is just 6-1, but led the nation in double-doubles, averaging 18.7 points and 13.5 rebounds a game with LSU to finish second all-time behind Courtney Paris in that category. She is able to grab boards over much taller opponents and just has a knack for rebounding. She shot 49% from the field, but most of her shots came from close to the basket. She'll need to increase her range.",
      "Georgia Amoore and Hailey Van Lith are combo guards who can score and also distribute to teammates.",
      "Amoore averaged 19.6 points and 6.9 assists at Kentucky this season after transferring from Virginia Tech. At 5-6, she might have a more difficult time getting her shot off then she did in college.",
      "Van Lith benefitted from playing in the Olympics and winning a bronze medal with the USA Basketball 3-on-3 team last year. She averaged 17.7 points and 5.4 assists this past season to help TCU reach the Elite Eight for the first time in school history.",

      "Jason Day thinks his fellow Aussie can climb even higher.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all up to him if he wants to get to No. 1,\u201d said Day, who spent 51 weeks there starting in September 2015. \"It\u2019s a lifestyle change he has to understand. I know that he has the tools and the mental side to do it because he loves the moment, and that\u2019s something you cannot teach golfers in general, to love being in that moment and under the most stress.",
      "\u201cIf he can really enjoy that and just improve over time, he\u2019ll be probably be our next No. 1,\u201d Day added. \"I\u2019m going to take myself out of the conversation because that\u2019s my goal as well. But he\u2019s got the best chance to become No. 1 from Australia.\"",

      "She had also passed along some advice to the 26-year-old Lee, who heads into this week's Masters having made the cut in two of his previous three appearances at Augusta National, including a tie for 22nd last year.",
      "\u201cI wanted him to hear, \u2018Hey, this is what she did. This is what I did. A lot of these other guys did,\u2019\u201d Day explained. \u201cWhen you want to be No. 1, everything has to be in order. Certain sacrifices need to happen. ... There is only a certain amount of people that can sit on that perch. It\u2019s nice to look back and say, 'I accomplished that.'\u201d",
      "Viktor Hovland is a naturally inquisitive fella, which comes in handy when it comes to golf. The 27-year-old from Norway likes to tinker with things, which is how he came to have a new driver in the bag for the Masters this week.",
      "It's also how he wound up last week on the \u201cUAP Files Podcast\u201d \u2014 as in, unidentified anomalous phenomena.",
      "UFOs, in common parlance. Extraterrestrials. Space aliens.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s just interesting when you have an open mind,\u201d Hovland said. \u201cEven in the golf swing, you can get very dogmatic and you look at things as, \u2018Oh, this has to be a truth. This has to be correct.\u2019 And sometimes the beliefs that you hold the most deeply can obfuscate yourself. When you question things and look at things from different angles, you might get to a deeper truth.\"",
      "Sure, Hovland says, there are moments when he thinks, \"OK, I know this is getting into territory that's very speculative.\"",
      "\u201cBut I think as long as you have an objective kind of mindset while looking into this information, I think it\u2019s just fun,\u201d Hovland said. \u201cYou don't have to live and die by every word you read or thing you hear.\u201d",
      "Augusta National doesn't see a need to update its criteria to create a special category for LIV Golf players. Chairman Fred Ridley said that can be handled through special invitations, which is what Joaquin Niemann received each of the last two years.",

      "PGA Tour winners (that offer full FedEx Cup points) get automatic invitations. The LIV Golf players who won 54-hole tournaments since last year's Masters who are not at Augusta National this week are Brendan Steele, Carlos Ortiz, Adrian Meronk and Marc Leishman, who won last week at Doral.",
      "All eight of the PGA Tour winners in the fall, where most fields were weak because they were primarily players trying to keep their tour cards, received invitations. That list includes Kevin Yu, Rafael Campos and Matt McCarty.",
      "Key to the Masters is keeping the field under 100 players. The field is at 95 this year.",
      "\u201cWe will have a thorough examination of our qualifications after the tournament this year, and we may make some changes,\u201d Ridley said. \u201cNot necessarily that, but some years we do make changes, some years we don\u2019t.\u201d",

      "DETROIT -- The Detroit Tigers are wrapping up their first homestand with a subtle change on the field at Comerica Park, putting grass over a strip of dirt that used to be between the pitcher's mound and batter's box.",
      "AL Cy Young and Triple Crown winner Tarik Skubal said he\u2019s glad the team got rid of the keyhole, making the lefty\u2019s sightline the same as it is in every other ballpark in Major League Baseball.",
      "\u201cI might get some heat for this, but they asked what we thought of it, and I said I didn\u2019t really like it,\u201d Skubal said Wednesday morning before a series-ending game against the New York Yankees. \"I wasn\u2019t a fan of it.",
      "\u201cObviously, I understand from a fan perspective. It\u2019s unique and stuff, but just from a visual perspective, it\u2019s so much different.\u201d",
      "Detroit was the last team in the majors to have the throwback feature \u2014 which was common in the 1800s and early 1900s \u2014 in their ballpark that opened in 2000 after leaving Tiger Stadium. The Arizona Diamondbacks also had a keyhole at Chase Field before removing it in 2019 when they changed their playing surface from grass to synthetic turf.",
      "The Tigers also made major renovations in the seating area behind home plate, removing a tunnel that was mostly used by umpires and installing state-of-the-art chairs that allow fans to heat or cool their seats.",
      "\u201cI'm a fan of having no tunnel,\u201d Skubal said. \u201cI'm glad it's gone. It makes it feel pretty clean back there.\u201d",
      "While Skubal said the front office asked for his input following the 2024 season and he gave his strong opinion, two other pitchers on the staff simply shrugged their shoulders when asked about the new-look view and an All-Star outfielder insisted he didn't even realize the keyhole was gone.",
      "\u201cThey asked a couple guys, but it didn't bother me,\u201d right-handed reliever Will Vest said. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t really move the needle too much for me.\u201d",
      "When lefty Tyler Holton is on the mound, he said he's locked in on the catcher's target with or without a path of dirt in front of him.",
      "\u201cI think if you\u2019re noticing things like that, you\u2019re probably not focused on what you need to be focused on,\u201d Holton said.",
      "Riley Greene, meanwhile, insisted he didn't know the keyhole was gone until a reporter asked him about it on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI'm going to be honest, I didn't even notice it,\u201d Greene said. \u201cSomebody told me that it was being taken out and I was like, `Oh, cool. I\u2019m probably not even going to notice it.' And, I haven\u2019t even noticed it.\u201d",

      "AUGUSTA, Ga. -- Rasmus Hojgaard and his identical twin brother Nicolai grew up playing golf in Denmark, occasionally pretending they were on the other side of the world at Augusta National.",
      "\u201cWe would tell each other \u2018this is the putt to win the Masters,\u2019\u201d Rasmus said, \u201cand then try to compete with each other.\u201d",
      "This week they\u2019ll both have a chance to fulfill that childhood dream \u2014 all while making Masters history.",
      "The Danish duo will become the first set of twins ever to play in the Masters together. There have been 18 sets of brothers who\u2019ve played here together, most recently Italy\u2019s Eduardo and Francesco Molinari from 2010-2012, but none have been twins.",
      "\u201cI think we really started watching the Masters when we were about 10, 11 years old,\u201d Rasmus said. \u201cSo 2012 when Bubba (Watson) won was probably the first real memory we have of the place. Yeah, it\u2019s nice to be here now.\u201d",
      "This is Nicolai's second Masters.",
      "He actually led last year's tournament for 10 holes in the third round, only to fall out of contention after shooting 74 and 76 on the weekend. He finished tied for 16th. It was Nicolai's best finish in nine majors, but not enough to earn an automatic bid to this year's tournament since only the top 12 are guaranteed a spot. He received a special invitation to play the Masters this year.",
      "Rasmus is making his first Masters appearance, earning his way in after finishing in the top 50 in the world rankings last year. This will be his seventh major.",
      "On Sunday, the 24-year-old twins toured the historic course together and Nicolai pointed out some tips to his slightly younger brother on how to navigate one of golf's toughest challenges this week since Rasmus has never played here. That preceded a joint news conference on Tuesday, where they inadvertently wound up \u201ctwinning\u201d after showing up in similar outfits.",
      "\u201cCompletely random,\u201d Nicolai joked.",
      "The twins would be nearly indecipherable if not for Rasmus' slightly longer hair.",
      "There have been other twins in golf, but none quite as accomplished as the Hojgaards. Rasmus ranks 55th in the world and has won five times on the European Tour, two more than his brother. Nicolai ranks 82nd and was a member of the winning European Ryder Cup team in 2023.",
      "They won\u2019t be playing in the same group at the Masters on Thursday, however.",
      "Nicolai will be in the second threesome on the course, while Rasmus tees off in the afternoon.",
      "There was a time that might have been a good thing. Growing up, the twins were extremely competitive on the course and didn't always get along. When one brother beat the other they would often go days without speaking to one another.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we supported each other very much back then,\u201d Rasmus said. \u201cWe would fight a lot more than saying congratulations.\u201d",
      "There are no regrets, though.",
      "Nicolai said that fierce sibling rivalry helped shape and drive them to get to where they are today.",
      "\"That helped a certain amount, really wanting to beat each other and that competitive edge we both have,\u201d Nicolai said.",
      "Times have since changed somewhat, though.",
      "The twins have matured and are now big supporters of each other's game and the successes that have come along with it. They can often be seen practicing together and helping each other as much as possible when their games veer off course.",
      "\u201cWe got older and we can shake each other\u2019s hand now and say congrats when someone is playing well \u2014 and be brothers as well and friends at the same time,\u201d Nicolai said.",
      "But the competitiveness will always be there.",
      "So what happens if the other brother knocks off defending champion Scottie Scheffler and gets to wear the green jacket on Sunday?",
      "\u201cProbably be very frustrating,\u201d Rasmus said with a long laugh. \u201cNo, I think it would be very cool. It would be very cool. If something like that happens, I think we\u2019ll deal with it at the time, but I think it\u2019s hard to sit here and try and explain what that would feel like.\"",
      "\u201cAgree,\u201d added Nicolai.",

    "story": [
      "Augusta National looks as pristine as ever on the eve of the Masters",
      "AUGUSTA, Ga. -- The patrons walking up the first fairway at Augusta National during a sun-splashed practice round for the Masters managed to find a nice viewpoint between a couple of pines, where they watched as Justin Rose hit an approach shot to the green.",
      "There are quite a few more places for them to perch after Hurricane Helen tore through Georgia last summer.",
      "By the time the deadly Category 4 storm churned north and finally dissipated, it left in its wake an estimated 1 million downed trees, thousands without power, and some 7 million cubic yards of debris to pick up. The city of Augusta was devastated, and the pristine property that annually hosts golf's most revered tournament was left with its own massive clean-up effort.",
      "Nearly six months later, it's hard to tell anything was ever amiss. The fairways and greens are perfectly manicured, the azaleas once again in bloom. All that are missing are the hundreds of trees that failed to survive the storm.",
      "\u201cIt almost felt like I was playing the back nine for the first time,\u201d two-time major winner Xander Schauffele said. \u201cThere's trees you aim at off the tee, and over the 11th green you can \u2014 when you're walking down 10, you can see half the course.\u201d",
      "That sweeping vista left Schauffele with mixed feelings. In some respects, it was neat to see what was happening elsewhere on the property, thanks to panoramic views that are probably a lot like what Alister MacKenzie and Bobby Jones would have had as they plotted the layout on a former nursery and antebellum plantation in the early 1930s.",
      "In other respects, Schauffele said, \u201cit's sad to see, too, how many trees have fallen.\u201d",
      "The missing trees should not demonstrably affect the way the course plays when the Masters begins Thursday. Some of those towering pines served as convenient aiming points \u2014 over the 11th green, for example \u2014 but markers that are just as helpful. And the most wayward shots will still be penalized by trunks and limbs among the pine straw.",
      "\u201cWhen you're hitting into the trees,\u201d Scottie Scheffler said, \u201cyou're still going to be in a good amount of trouble.\u201d",
      "The more interesting discussion seems to center on whether the loss of so many trees was an unintended positive.",
      "John Fought played in the Masters three times in the 1970s and \u201880s before his second career as a lauded golf course architect behind such well-known layouts as Pumpkin Ridge in Oregon. He's among many who have embraced the removal of unnecessary trees at such classic courses as Oakmont, and restoring them to the what their original designers intended.",
      "\u201cIn my opinion the course has undergone a lot of change. Not just in length \u2014 which is obvious \u2014 but also in its tree planting,\u201d Fought said, pointing specifically to trees down the right of No. 11 and behind Nos. 15 and 17. \u201cSome of this tree planting has been good, but overall it has changed the course markedly from the course Bobby Jones and Alister Mackenzie envisioned.\u201d",
      "Indeed, Jones and MacKenzie often said that St. Andrews served as an inspiration for Augusta National. It is evident in the large, undulating greens, the absence of penal rough, and the risk-reward opportunities that exist across the course.",
      "There are no towering pines on the windswept Scottish coast, though.",
      "\u201cSt. Andrews is wide open with many angles to play from. I would like to see more of that,\" Fought said. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I love the Masters and how it is run, but I have observed that trees have become a dominating force in the design.\u201d",
      "Much of that has been by necessity.",
      "One way to combat advancements in technology, and force players to hit similar shots to those of decades ago, has been to lengthen the course. But another has been to tighten it. When the club transplanted 36 pines in 2003, then-Masters chairman Hootie Johnson said the impetus was to continue \u201cour long-standing emphasis on accuracy off the tee.\u201d",
      "In the late 1990s, longtime New Yorker and Golf Digest writer David Owen was asked to write a history of the club, and granted unfettered access to its vast archives. His book, \u201cThe Making of the Masters,\u201d is considered its definitive account.",
      "Owen points out that Jones \u201cdescribed the course as \u2018of national design,\u2019\u201d and he embraced changes suggested by many people. And while Mackenzie did call St. Andrews the model, \u201cyou kind of have to suspend disbelief to see real similarities.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would say the changes have been necessary,\u201d Owen concluded. \u201cPros today would annihilate the course as it was in 1934.\u201d",
      "How they will fare in 2025 remains to be seen.",
      "Thanks to Hurricane Helene, those walking the property this week at least will have different places to watch it.",
      "\u201cI just think it looks better. I don\u2019t know why I say that,\u201d admitted Fred Couples, the 1992 Masters champion. \"The other day we played No. 1 and we were standing on the green and you just look right down and you see a lot more room on the ninth tee. I think that\u2019s kind of cool. You can watch people hit. There\u2019s a few areas where it blew right through there, but for me personally, I know a lot of trees went down. I know this town was devastated. But the golf course is unbelievable.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of trees,\u201d Couples said. \u201cMy God.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has been predicting its barrage of tariffs targeting China will push Apple into manufacturing the iPhone in the U",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- President Donald Trump's administration has been predicting its barrage of tariffs targeting China will push Apple into manufacturing the iPhone in the United States for the first time.",
      "But that's an unlikely scenario even with U.S tariffs now standing at 145% on products made in China \u2014 the country where Apple has manufactured most of its iPhones since the first model hit the market 18 years ago.",
      "The disincentives for Apple shifting its production domestically include a complex supply chain that it began building in China during the 1990s. It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product.",
      "\u201cThe concept of making iPhones in the U.S. is a non-starter,\u201d asserted Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, reflecting a widely held view in the investment community that tracks Apple's every move. He estimated that the current $1,000 price tag for an iPhone made in China, or India, would soar to more than $3,000 if production shifted to the U.S. And he believes that moving production domestically likely couldn't be done until, at the earliest, 2028. \u201cPrice points would move so dramatically, it's hard to comprehend.\u201d",
      "Apple didn't respond to a request for comment Wednesday. The Cupertino, California, company has yet to publicly discuss its response to Trump\u2019s tariffs on China, but the topic may come up on May 1 when Apple CEO Tim Cook is scheduled to field questions from analysts during a quarterly conference call to discuss the company\u2019s financial results and strategy.",
      "And there is no doubt the China tariffs will be a hot-button issue given Apple\u2019s stock price has dropped by nearly 20% and lowered the company\u2019s market value by $600 billion since Trump began increasing them on April 2.",
      "If the tariffs hold, Apple is widely expected to eventually raise the prices on iPhones and other popular products because the Silicon Valley\u2019s supply chain is so heavily concentrated in China, India and other overseas markets caught in the crossfire of the escalating trade war.",
      "The big question is how long Apple might be willing to hold the line on its current prices before the tariffs\u2019 toll on the company\u2019s profit margins become too much to bear and consumers are asked to shoulder some of the burden.",
      "One of the main reasons that Apple has wiggle room to hold the line on its current iPhone pricing while the China tariffs remain in place is because the company continues to reap huge profit margins from the revenue generated by the subscriptions and other services tied to its product, said Forrester Research analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee. That division, which collected $96 billion in revenue during Apple\u2019s last fiscal year, remains untouched by Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "\u201cApple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,\u201d Chatterjee said.",
      "Apple tried to appease Trump in February by announcing plans to spend $500 billion and hire 20,000 people in the U.S. through 2028, but none of it was tied to making an iPhone domestically. Instead, Apple pledged to fund a Houston data center for computer servers powering artificial intelligence \u2014 a technology the company is expanding into as part of an industrywide craze.",
      "When asked this week about whether Trump believes Apple intends to build iPhones in the U.S., White House Press Secretary Karoline Levitt pointed to Apple's investment promise as evidence that the company thinks it could be done. \u201cIf Apple didn\u2019t think the United States could do it, they probably wouldn\u2019t have put up that big chunk of change,\u201d Leavitt said.",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also predicted tariffs would force a manufacturing shift during an April 6 appearance on a CBS news program. \u201cThe army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America,\u201d Lutnick said.",
      "But during a 2017 appearance at a conference in China, Cook expressed doubt about whether the U.S. labor pool had enough workers with the vocational skills required to do the painstaking and tedious work that Lutnick was discussing.",
      "\u201cIn the U.S. you could have a meeting of tooling engineers and I\u2019m not sure we could fill the room,\u201d Cook said. \u201cIn China, you could fill multiple football fields.\u201d",
      "Trump also tried to pressure Apple, to no avail, into shifting iPhone production to the U.S. during his first term as president. But the administration ultimately exempted the iPhone from the tariffs he imposed on China back then \u2014 a period when Apple had announced a commitment to invest $350 billion in the U.S. Trump's first-term tariffs on China also prompted Apple to begin a process that led to some of its current iPhones being made in India and some of its other products being manufactured in Vietnam.",
      "Cook also took the president on a 2019 tour of a Texas plant where Apple had been assembling some of its Mac computers since 2013. Shortly after finishing that our, Trump took credit for the plant that Apple had opened while Barack Obama was president. \"Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America,\u201d Trump posted on Nov. 19, 2019.",

      "OAKLAND, Calif. -- OpenAI is suing Elon Musk for unfair competition and interfering with its business relationships with investors and customers, escalating a legal battle between the ChatGPT maker and the billionaire who helped bankroll the artificial intelligence startup a decade ago.",
      "The allegations against Musk were filed Wednesday in a federal court in California as a counterclaim to Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI, which is heading to a jury trial next year.",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor who now runs his own AI firm, xAI, began a legal offensive against OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman more than a year ago, suing for breach of contract over what he said was the betrayal of its founding aims as a nonprofit research laboratory.",
      "A federal judge in March denied Musk\u2019s request for a court order blocking OpenAI from converting itself to a for-profit company but said she could expedite a trial to consider Musk\u2019s claims. She offered to hold a trial later this year, but it has been pushed back to March 2026.",

      "Less than four hours later, Trump announced a 90-day pause on nearly all his tariffs. Stocks soared on the news, closing up 9.5% by the end of trading. The market, measured by the S&P 500, gained back about $4 trillion, or 70%, of the value it had lost over the previous four trading days.",
      "It was a prescient call by the president. Maybe too prescient.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s loving this, this control over markets, but he better be careful,\u201d said Trump critic and former White House ethics lawyer, Richard Painter, noting that securities law prohibits trading on insider information or helping others do so. \u201cThe people who bought when they saw that post made a lot of money.\u201d",

      "The ambiguity about what Trump meant didn't stop people from pouring money into that stock.",
      "Trump Media closed up 22.67%, soaring twice as much as the broader market, a stunning performance by a company that lost $400 million last year and is seemingly unaffected by whether tariffs would be imposed or paused.",

      "Microsoft says it's \u201cslowing or pausing\u201d some of data center construction, including a $1 billion project in Ohio",
      "Microsoft said it is \u201cslowing or pausing\u201d some of its data center construction, including a $1 billion project in Ohio, the latest sign that the demand for artificial intelligence technology that drove a massive infrastructure expansion might not need quite as many powerful computers as expected.",
      "The tech giant confirmed this week that it is halting early-stage projects on rural land it owns in central Ohio's Licking County, outside of Columbus, and will reserve two of the three sites for farmland.",
      "\u201cIn recent years, demand for our cloud and AI services grew more than we could have ever anticipated and to meet this opportunity, we began executing the largest and most ambitious infrastructure scaling project in our history,\u201d said Noelle Walsh, the president of Microsoft's cloud operations, in a post on LinkedIn.",
      "Walsh said \u201cany significant new endeavor at this size and scale requires agility and refinement as we learn and grow with our customers. What this means is that we are slowing or pausing some early-stage projects.\u201d",
      "Microsoft didn't say Wednesday what other projects it has slowed outside of Ohio, but in late December it revealed it was pausing the later phases of a large data center project in Wisconsin.",

      "\u201cOpenAI was moving in one direction\u201d by prioritizing the development of ever-more advanced AI systems, which require vast computing resources to train on troves of data, while \u201cMicrosoft may not have been moving that same direction,\u201d said Craig Ellis, director of research at B. Riley Securities.",
      "The two companies announced on Jan. 21 that they were altering the agreement that had made Microsoft the exclusive provider of OpenAI's computing power, enabling the smaller company to build its own capacity, \u201cprimarily for research and training of models.\u201d It was the same day that newly inaugurated President Donald Trump touted OpenAI's partnership with Oracle and SoftBank to pledge $500 billion in new AI infrastructure in the U.S., starting with a data center in Texas.",
      "Microsoft has long built data centers around the world to run its cloud computing services. The generative AI boom accelerated the demand for such facilities, both to train new AI systems and to keep them running as millions of people start using chatbots and other AI tools at work and home.",
      "The computing it takes to run AI tools is expensive and requires a large amount of electricity \u2014 so much so that Trump this week cited AI needs as part of the justification for using his emergency authorities to boost the U.S. coal industry, a reliable but polluting energy source. Tech companies have also sought to tap into nuclear power, including a proposed Microsoft-backed revival of the shuttered Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania, which would feed an electricity grid supplying data centers in Ohio as well as Virginia, the nation's biggest data center hub.",
      "Microsoft said it still plans to spend more than $80 billion globally to expand its AI infrastructure this fiscal year, which ends in June, and has already doubled its data center capacity over the past three years.",
      "\u201cWhile we may strategically pace our plans, we will continue to grow strongly and allocate investments that stay aligned with business priorities and customer demand,\u201d Walsh said.",
      "The Ohio pause nevertheless came as a disappointment to local officials.",
      "Licking County has also attracted data center investments from Microsoft rivals Google and Meta Platforms and a highly anticipated semiconductor factory from Intel, though the struggling chipmaker in February pushed back the expected completion date for the project's first stage to 2030.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Thanks to a mouse watching clips from \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d scientists have created the largest functional map of a brain to date \u2013 a diagram of the wiring connecting 84,000 neurons as they fire off messages.",
      "Using a piece of that mouse\u2019s brain about the size of a poppy seed, the researchers identified those neurons and traced how they communicated via branch-like fibers through a surprising 500 million junctions called synapses.",
      "The massive dataset, published Wednesday by the journal Nature, marks a step toward unraveling the mystery of how our brains work. The data, assembled in a 3D reconstruction colored to delineate different brain circuitry, is open to scientists worldwide for additional research \u2013 and for the simply curious to take a peek.",
      "\u201cIt definitely inspires a sense of awe, just like looking at pictures of the galaxies,\u201d said Forrest Collman of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, one of the project\u2019s leading researchers. \u201cYou get a sense of how complicated you are. We\u2019re looking at one tiny part ... of a mouse\u2019s brain and the beauty and complexity that you can see in these actual neurons and the hundreds of millions of connections between them.\u201d",
      "How we think, feel, see, talk and move are due to neurons, or nerve cells, in the brain \u2013 how they\u2019re activated and send messages to each other. Scientists have long known those signals move from one neuron along fibers called axons and dendrites, using synapses to jump to the next neuron. But there\u2019s less known about the networks of neurons that perform certain tasks and how disruptions of that wiring could play a role in Alzheimer's, autism or other disorders.",
      "\u201cYou can make a thousand hypotheses about how brain cells might do their job but you can\u2019t test those hypotheses unless you know perhaps the most fundamental thing \u2013 how are those cells wired together,\u201d said Allen Institute scientist Clay Reid, who helped pioneer electron microscopy to study neural connections.",
      "With the new project, a global team of more than 150 researchers mapped neural connections that Collman compares to tangled pieces of spaghetti winding through part of the mouse brain responsible for vision.",
      "The first step: Show a mouse video snippets of sci-fi movies, sports, animation and nature.",
      "A team at Baylor College of Medicine did just that, using a mouse engineered with a gene that makes its neurons glow when they\u2019re active. The researchers used a laser-powered microscope to record how individual cells in the animal\u2019s visual cortex lit up as they processed the images flashing by.",
      "Next, scientists at the Allen Institute analyzed that small piece of brain tissue, using a special tool to shave it into more than 25,000 layers, each far thinner than a human hair. With electron microscopes, they took nearly 100 million high-resolution images of those sections, illuminating those spaghetti-like fibers and painstakingly reassembling the data in 3D.",
      "Finally, Princeton University scientists used artificial intelligence to trace all that wiring and \u201cpaint each of the individual wires a different color so that we can identify them individually,\u201d Collman explained.",
      "They estimated that microscopic wiring, if laid out, would measure more than 3 miles (5 kilometers). Importantly, matching up all that anatomy with the activity in the mouse's brain as it watched movies allowed researchers to trace how the circuitry worked.",
      "The Princeton researchers also created digital 3D copies of the data that other scientists can use in developing new studies.",
      "Could this kind of mapping help scientists eventually find treatments for brain diseases? The researchers call it a foundational step, like how the Human Genome Project that provided the first gene mapping eventually led to gene-based treatments. Mapping a full mouse brain is one next goal.",
      "\u201cThe technologies developed by this project will give us our first chance to really identify some kind of abnormal pattern of connectivity that gives rise to a disorder,\u201d another of the project's leading researchers, Princeton neuroscientist and computer scientist Sebastian Seung, said in a statement.",

It eventually provided them in Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, French and Samoan. The contract lapse comes as President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to slash spending in federal agencies, including cuts within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that have led to high employee vacancy rates at NWS offices.",

      "The chopper -- identified by the Federal Aviation Administration as a Bell 206 helicopter -- was on its sixth flight of the day. It was found upside-down in the 50-degree water when rescuers arrived at the scene, which was closer to the New Jersey side of the Hudson River, according to sources.",
      "Video from the crash showed the chopper plunging into the water without a tail rotor or a main rotor blade. Officials said it hit the water inverted.",
      "New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch told reporters that four victims were pronounced dead at the scene. Two others later succumbed to their injuries, she said.",
      "Jersey City Medical Center, where the passengers were transported after the crash, tried as hard as they could to save the injured, Fulop told ABC News.",
      "Fulop said the city has had concerns about the air traffic over the Hudson before and is hoping this brings more attention to their safety concerns.",

      "\"I was walking by and the helicopter went down at a 45-degree angle,\" Eric Campoverde told ABC News. \"Big splash -- it was very scary.\"",
      "\"It sounded like a sonic boom,\" a witness told New York ABC station WABC. He said he saw the \"helicopter splitting in two with the rotor flying off.\"",

      "The deadline has arrived for Maine officials to reach a resolution with the U.S. Education Department over a finding that the state violated antidiscrimination laws by allowing transgender athletes to participate in girls\u2019 sports",
      "PORTLAND, Maine -- The deadline has arrived for Maine officials to reach a resolution with the U.S. Education Department over a finding that the state violated antidiscrimination laws by allowing transgender athletes to participate in girls\u2019 sports.",
      "The Education Department said in March that an investigation concluded the Maine Department of Education violated the federal Title IX law by allowing transgender girls to participate on girls\u2019 teams. The investigation followed a public disagreement between Democratic Maine Gov. Janet Mills and President Donald Trump at a February meeting of governors.",
      "The U.S. Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights issued a final warning on March 31 telling the state it needed to comply with the law in 10 business days or face enforcement from the U.S. Justice Department. That deadline arrived Friday.",
      "Maine education officials have declined to comment on the investigation. Trump has said the state risks losing federal funding if it does not come into compliance.",
      "\u201cThe Maine Department of Education\u2019s indifference to its past, current, and future female athletes is astonishing. By refusing to comply with Title IX, MDOE allows \u2014 indeed, encourages \u2014 male competitors to threaten the safety of female athletes, wrongfully obtain girls\u2019 hard-earned accolades, and deny females equal opportunity in educational activities to which they are guaranteed under Title IX,\u201d said Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for the Education Department\u2019s Office for Civil Rights.",
      "Federal funding is critical to Maine schools. Maine got $358 million in federal funding for K-12 schools in 2021-22, or 10% of its budget, according to data from the Census. About 13% of that money went to Title I, 14% to special education and 20% to child nutrition programs such as school lunches.",
      "Almost half of federal funds were simply marked as \u201cother,\u201d which likely points to the substantial COVID relief funds schools got that year. Prior to the pandemic, Maine got 6% of its funding from federal sources, almost $185 million in 2018-19.",
      "The issue of school funding and transgender participation in sports in Maine began to bubble up when Mills and Trump sparred over the subject during the February meeting at the White House. During the meeting, Trump threatened to pull federal funding from Maine if the state did not comply with his executive order barring transgender athletes from sports.",
      "Mills responded: \u201cWe\u2019ll see you in court.\u201d",
      "Soon after, the Education Department and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services launched investigations into the state.",
      "Health and Human Services officials said in March that the Maine Department of Education, Maine Principals\u2019 Association and a high school are each in violation of Title IX because of the participation of transgender athletes. The Health Department has already referred the issue to the Justice Department for enforcement in court.",
      "The principals\u2019 association and school district both said they would not comply with a proposed agreement to ban the athletes. The Maine education department declined to comment.",
      "Maine Republicans, who are in the minority in both houses of the Legislature, have put pressure on state Democrats to resolve the investigations. House Republican Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham, speaking during a news conference, said Mills has created a \u201chostage situation\u201d that jeopardizes federal funding.",
      "\u201cThe governor, and her administration, is holding Maine schools and Maine education under hostage,\u201d Faulkingham said. \u201cThis standoff is not going to end well for the state of Maine and its education funding.\u201d",
      "LGBTQ+ rights groups in Maine have defended the state\u2019s approach. \u201cWe\u2019re not giving in, and we\u2019re not giving up on our trans community,\u201d EqualityMaine said in a social media post.",
      "Federal authorities have also said they are investigating Maine due to claims school districts in the state violate federal law by withholding information about students\u2019 gender transitioning from parents.",

      "China is prepared to withstand the economic pain, according to experts.",
      "Xi Jinping is playing hardball.",
      "The Chinese president wants to show his people that the country can withstand the economic pain from President Donald Trump's tariffs and stand up to what Beijing is calling America's \"bullying,\" according to experts.",
      "Trump's trade war also feeds into the strategy that Xi has been working on for years: become less reliant on the United States.",
      "This breakdown in trade is \"exactly what Beijing has been preparing for,\" said Jude Blanchette, director of the RAND China Research Center. \"Beijing is not looking for negotiation.\"",
      "The world's superpowers are engaged in a risky game of chicken, experts told ABC News. The question is who blinks first.",
      "\"At the moment, Xi seems to be calculating that China can withstand the damage and that ultimately it's the United States who will blink first,\" said Neil Thomas, a fellow for Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis",
      "Xi's view is that countries will want to do business less with the U.S. because of the uncertainty created by tariffs, which will drive them toward China, said Thomas, who added that China has been preparing for this possibility for years by growing trade relations with the rest of the world.",
      "\"Both Washington and Beijing think they hold the stronger hand for different reasons. The Trump administration sees China as export-dependent, so they believe it's significant leverage to get the Chinese to bend,\" Blanchette said. \"On the other hand, Beijing sees the U.S. as increasingly economically weak under Trump and distanced from its allies.\"",
      "While Trump in his Cabinet meeting on Thursday called Xi a \"friend\" and said he'd love to strike a deal with China, the calculus isn't so simple for Xi. If Xi walks away from the phone call without a deal, he risks losing face.",
      "\"For Xi, there's a huge amount of risk of looking weak in his dealings with the U.S. He risks being humiliated or not having anything to show for his engagement with Trump,\" Thomas said. \"The tariffs will be economically painful, but Xi also sees this as an opportunity to get China into a healthier situation by reducing reliance on the U.S.\"",
      "There are also other levers China can pull to retaliate. Experts say Beijing could ban more companies from doing business in China and further limit exports of critical materials, such as rare earth minerals.",
      "China \"hasn't gone anywhere close to the maximum that it could do with its rare earth exports, considering it's such a dominant player in the industry,\" Thomas said.",
      "China could \"shut down huge segments of high-tech supply chains\" by banning rare earth minerals, Thomas said, calling it \"a nuclear option that would severely damage not just the American economy but European and Asian economies.\"",
      "Beijing has also said it will restrict Hollywood films in China. While it's not a \"significant\" retaliation, Thomas said that \"it feeds right into Xi Jinping's broader political agenda to reduce foreign influence on Chinese society.\"",
      "But Scott Kenney, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, argued that Beijing believes Trump has already blinked by pausing the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days.",
      "\"I think the Chinese will read this as weakness from President Trump and they will wait,\" he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate confirmed retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan \u201cRazin\u201d Caine to become the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on Friday, filling the position almost two months after President Donald Trump fired his predecessor.",
      "Trump nominated Caine to become the top U.S. military officer in February after abruptly firing Gen. CQ Brown Jr., the second Black general to serve as chairman, as part of his administration\u2019s campaign to rid the military of leaders who support diversity and equity in the ranks. The Senate confirmed Caine 60-25 in an overnight vote before heading home for a two-week recess.",
      "Caine is a decorated F-16 combat pilot who served in leadership in multiple special operations commands, in some of the Pentagon\u2019s most classified programs and in the CIA. He does not meet prerequisites for the job set out in a 1986 law, such as being a combatant commander or service chief. But those requirements can be waived by the president if there is a determination that \u201csuch action is necessary in the national interest.\u201d",
      "Caine\u2019s confirmation in the middle of the night, just before the Senate left town, comes as Republicans have been quickly advancing Trump\u2019s nominees and as Democrats have been trying to delay the process and show that they are fighting Trump\u2019s policies. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., set up the early morning vote after Democrats objected to speeding up procedural votes on the nomination.",
      "Still, Caine was confirmed with some bipartisan support. At his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Caine said he would be candid in his advice to Trump and vowed to be apolitical. He disputed Trump\u2019s story that Caine wore a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat when the two first met.",
      "\u201cI have never worn any political merchandise,\u201d he said.",
      "Caine was asked how he would react if ordered to direct the military to do something potentially illegal, such as being used against civilians in domestic law enforcement.",
      "\u201cWill you stand up and push back?\u201d Michigan Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin asked.",
      "\u201cSenator, I think that\u2019s the duty and the job that I have, yes,\u201d Caine said.",
      "Trump\u2019s relationship with Caine dates to his first administration. They met during a trip to Iraq, as Trump recounted in a 2019 speech. He has said Caine is \u201ca real general, not a television general.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump\u2019s relationship with then-Chairman Gen. Mark Milley soured as Milley pushed back and took steps to try to prevent what he saw as an attempt to politicize the office. He would remind military service members that they took an oath to the Constitution, not to a president.",
      "Within hours of Trump\u2019s inauguration in January, Milley\u2019s portrait as chairman of the Joint Chiefs was removed from the Pentagon. Milley\u2019s security clearance and security detail also were revoked.",

      "But they tumbled again Thursday as uncertainty remains over what happens next, especially when it comes to China -- which the White House clarified now faces a whopping 145% tariff.",
      "Trump on Wednesday said he was upping the tariff against China to 125% after Beijing retaliated with a significant levy on U.S. goods. That new tariff is in addition to a 20% fentanyl-related levy imposed by Trump back in February, the White House confirmed on Thursday.",
      "\"We'll see what happens,\" Trump said when asked directly to comment on next steps with China, the world's second largest economy behind the United States.",

      "The administration's now up against the clock of Trump's 90-day pause.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Republicans narrowly got their budget plan over the finish line. Now comes the hard part.",
      "The resolution adopted this week was only a first step that allows Republicans to draft legislation that they can push through Congress without Democratic support. Next, they begin crafting a final bill with enough spending cuts to satisfy those on the right while not jeopardizing the reelection prospects of more vulnerable lawmakers whose constituents rely on key safety net programs.",
      "With thin majorities in the House and Senate, Republicans can afford to lose hardly any votes from their side of the aisle as they draft legislation, giving every individual lawmaker leverage over the process.",
      "\u201cIt's going to take all of us to get it done,\u201d said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La.",
      "The road ahead is daunting.",
      "Republicans are determined to extend the individual tax cuts that were approved during President Donald Trump's first term before they expire at year's end. But they intend for the legislation to do far more than that, potentially enacting a host of tax reductions that Trump promised during the campaign, such as no income tax on tips and overtime.",
      "And the tax cuts are only half the equation. Conservatives in the House gave the budget plan the final votes needed for passage Thursday after they said they received assurances from leadership in both chambers that they would work to have a final product with at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts \u2014 forcing changes to federal programs including Medicaid that could prove hard for some in the party to support.",
      "\u201cThe struggles Republicans have faced so far are only a glimmer of what\u2019s to come,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer.",
      "Rep. Max Miller, R-Ohio, senses a difficult fight for Republicans. He said Trump has made clear he doesn't want any benefit cuts for those who get health insurance coverage through Medicaid, which could conflict with the desire some conservatives have for steep spending cuts.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s this rocky now, it\u2019s only going to get worse from here on out if the speaker is not able to get the entire conference in line,\u201d Miller said.",
      "Democrats have framed the debate as Republicans looking to slash key government programs so they can pass tax cuts that predominately help wealthier households. It's a message Democrats will hammer home leading up to the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "\u201cAt this point, they\u2019re all worried about primaries and they are worried about Elon\u2019s money, but they ought to be worried about a general election as well,\" said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., referring to Trump's billionaire ally, Elon Musk. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very difficult for a moderate Republican, if there\u2019s still any left, to be able to vote for this and go home and defend it.\"",
      "Some Republicans also made clear to GOP leadership before Thursday's budget vote that they will be closely monitoring the changes to Medicaid in the final bill.",
      "\u201cThis was just making sure that there is a clear understanding here that there are a group of members that will not cut benefits from seniors and our most vulnerable New Yorkers who rely on Medicaid,\" said Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who is up for reelection next year, said she's also made her position known to leadership.",
      "\u201cI could not make my position on Medicaid cuts clearer,\" she said. \"I am not going to support cuts that affect low-income families, disabled individuals, low-income seniors, rural hospitals.\u201d",
      "Republicans say their focus is on instilling work requirements for able-bodied beneficiaries and more rigorous eligibility assessments. But Democrats say Republicans can't generate the savings being discussed without also cutting benefits.",
      "Meanwhile, Republicans see extending the individual and estate tax cuts passed in Trump's first term as key to their electoral success next year. The House Ways and Means Committee says a family of four making $80,610, the median income in the United States, would see a $1,695 tax increase if the tax cuts are not extended.",
      "Republicans spent the last few years blaming the Biden administration for increasing the debt, and a key test will be how many keep that focus as they seek to extend and expand tax cuts.",
      "A recent estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation projects that extending the 2017 tax breaks will add $5.5 trillion over the next decade when including interest, and $4.6 trillion not including interest. On top of that, adding Trump\u2019s campaign promises would swell the price tag to $7 trillion.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he'll advocate for splitting the measure into two reconciliation bills if Republicans take too long to get to a final product.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to say break it apart, because they need money for the border yesterday and they also need money for DoD,\u201d Graham said, referring to the Department of Defense.",

      "If history is any indication, his latest physical is likely to produce a flattering report that's scarce on details. It will be conducted at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and will be the first public information on Trump's health since an assassination attempt against him in Butler, Pennsylvania, last July.",

Ronny Jackson \u2014 a staunch supporter who served as his White House physician and once joked in the White House briefing room that Trump could live to be 200 if he had a healthier diet \u2014 wrote a memo describing a gunshot wound to Trump\u2019s right ear.",
      "In a subsequent interview with CBS last August, Trump said he\u2019d \u201cvery gladly\u201d release his medical records but never did.",

      "Before Jackson's memo, Americans hadn't seen key details about Trump's health since November 2023, when Dr. Bruce A. Aronwald released a letter to coincide with Biden\u2019s 81st birthday, saying Trump was in \u201cexcellent\u201d physical and mental health.",
      "The letter, posted on Trump\u2019s social media platform, contained no details \u2014 including Trump's weight, blood pressure and cholesterol levels, or the results of any test. Instead, Aronwlad wrote that he'd examined Trump that fall and found his \u201cphysical exams were well within the normal range and his cognitive exams were exceptional,\u201d while also noting that Trump had \u201creduced his weight.\u201d",
      "Trump was treated at Walter Reed for his serious bout with the coronavirus in 2020. During that, Trump\u2019s physician offered a rosy prognosis on his condition, though his White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said some of Trump\u2019s vital signs were \u201cvery concerning.\"",
      "After he recovered, more details emerged that Trump had been sicker than he'd let on.",
      "But Trump largely refused to say more about his health at the time, instead submitting to a pretaped, remote medical \u201cevaluation\u201d and interview on Fox News Channel. That was conducted by Dr. Marc Siegel, a Fox News contributor who had questioned Hillary Clinton's physical ability to serve as president in 2016 and later urged the Biden White House to test the then-president's cognitive acuity.",
      "In November 2019, meanwhile, Trump's trip to Walter Reed for a physical was omitted from his public schedule, breaking the White House protocol of giving advance public notice of them.",

      "Arguably, Trump's most famous past comments about his own health came during a television interview in July 2020, when he listed off \u201cPerson. Woman. Man. Camera. TV\" while attempting to demonstrate his cognitive abilities.",
      "Trump said that a collection of those five nouns, or ones like them, stated in order, demonstrated mental fitness \u2014 and were part of a cognitive test he had aced.",

    "summary": "Two Democrats are seeking answers from the White House about whether Trump administration officials engaged in insider trading amid the tariff rollbacks.",
    "story": [
      "The president told social media followers, \"THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY.\"",
      "Two Democratic senators are demanding answers from the White House over serious concerns that President Donald Trump's rollbacks on his tariffs and his social media posts earlier Wednesday may have been part of insider trading among White House allies.",
      "Sens. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., sent a letter to Trump's chief of staff, Susie Wiles, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Thursday asking for an investigation into potential conflicts of interest over the actions that took place Wednesday.",
      "Hours before Trump announced he was rolling back tariffs to 10% to all countries except China, which sent the stock market soaring, he posted on Truth Social: \"BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!\" and \"THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT.\"",
      "\"This sequence of events raises grave legal and ethics concerns. The President, his family, and his advisors are uniquely positioned to be privy to and take advantage of non-public information to inform their investment decisions,\" the senators said in their letter.",
      "Stocks were down Wednesday morning before Trump's Truth Social post immediately caused markets to spike. Nasdaq soared 12.1% at close, the index's largest single-day gain since 2021, while the Dow jumped 7.8%, its biggest one-day increase in five years.",
      "The White House has not immediately commented.",
      "The senators asked the Office of Government Ethics to probe whether any White House or executive branch officials, to include special government employees, were informed of the announcement in advance and what financial transactions were made by officials with knowledge of nonpublic information.",
      "The senators also said they wanted answers to several questions about Wednesday's chain of events, including whether any Trump's family members were informed of the deliberations prior to Trump's Truth Social post announcing the tariff changes and if there were any records of communications with executive branch officials, family members or special government employees.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday that the president's decision was part of his plan and that 75 countries had called to negotiate with the president. They did not provide further details.",
      "Hours later, however, Trump told reporters he made his decision Wednesday morning.",
      "\"I think it probably came together early this morning, fairly early this morning. Just wrote it up. I didn't -- we didn't have the use of, we didn't have access to lawyers, or it was just brought up. We wrote it up from our hearts,\" he said.",
      "Michael Guttentag, a Loyola Law School professor who has written several research papers on insider trading, told ABC News there is no universal national insider trading law. Rather, cases have been prosecuted, generally, through court decisions that have set precedents.",
      "\"Generally, the other issue is the standard test for insider trading is, 'Did you have material nonpublic information?,'\" he told ABC News.",
      "However, in 2012, Congress passed the Stock Act of 2012, which made it illegal for Congress members and anyone part of the executive branch to take part in insider trading.",
      "Guttentag said it would not be hard to determine if insider trading took place within the White House as one would just need to start by pulling up the trading records, match them with individuals linked to the executive office and the time Trump's announcement was made.",
      "He noted former U.S. Rep. Chris Collins was prosecuted on insider trading in 2018 after the Office of Congressional Ethics determined he used his congressional connections to inform his son to sell stocks of a pharmaceutical company that was about to get information on a drug trial. Investigators were able to determine Collins made the call to his son while at a picnic at the White House almost immediately after he received the e-mail about the failed drug trial.",
      "He ultimately resigned from his seat and pleaded guilty to insider trading in 2019 but was pardoned by Trump in December 2020.",
      "Guttentag said the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission would be in charge of investigating the civil and criminal allegations of potential violations of the 2012 Stock Act.",
      "While Trump and other officials declined to talk more about Schiff and Gallego's request, some other Democratic senators at the Capitol on Thursday also questioned the timing of the announcement and the rise in stocks.",
      "\"Look, it shouldn't be an investigation by Democrats or Republicans, it should be an independent investigation. And if the president and his cabinet and his family have nothing to hide, they should want an investigation like that. Let's just clear up the smoke here,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., told reporters.",
      "\"Over and over again we see evidence of self-dealing and efforts to improve your bottom-line net worth with the policies of this administration,\" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said. \"I think it deserves closer scrutiny.\"",
      "But some Republicans dismissed the concern.",
      "Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, called the assertion of insider trading \"ridiculous\" and said Democrats were just looking to \"take a dig\" at Trump.",
      "\"It's pretty obvious that when the stock market is in a dip that maybe if you have some money, you might consider investing and make some money when it picks back up again. I think any idea of insider trading is ridiculous,\" Cornyn told reporters.",
      "Guttentag noted investigating possible insider trading within the executive branch and prosecuting them if there any solid evidence is a long hill to climb. However, he said it is imperative that ethics rules are followed.",
      "\"People tend to find insider trading reprehensible. If [investigators] could share evidence that people were trading in this window, it would be important in establishing transparency and keeping the rule of law,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Despite widespread HHS cuts, RFK Jr. continues to say critical programs are protected.",
    "story": [
      "\"Our purpose is not to reduce any level of scientific research,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Far as he was from Washington, D.C., as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hiked to the top of a towering sandstone arch in rural Arizona with a group of Navajo Nation leaders, the impact of his agency\u2019s cuts reached farther.",
      "Wearing a shirt with a clear request written on the front, \u201cSave IHS Jobs and Diabetes Program,\u201d a Navajo council delegate, Eugenia Charles-Newton, approached Kennedy to tell him she was concerned HHS cuts were impacting the diabetes program that she relied on for care.",
      "Charles-Newton said she'd heard funding wasn't being renewed for aspects of the Special Diabetes Program for Indians, a program within Indian Health Services (IHS) at HHS. The rapid restructuring at HHS had made it difficult to track the actual impact, she said.",
      "Kennedy, who listened and then walked arm-in-arm with Charles-Newton for the last leg of the hike, promised to look into the program and whether any funding was being impacted by the HHS-wide restructuring. The improvements to Navajo health care that she was asking for seemed like \u201ccommon sense,\u201d he said.",
      "The president of Navajo Nation, Buu Nygren, also mentioned an impacted program \u2014 the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, which provides federally funded assistance to reduce utility bills and help with weatherizing homes. Navajo people \u2014 living with the extreme temperatures of the desert \u2014 relied heavily on its assistance, he said.",
      "But the program was gutted by HHS cuts. Nygren told ABC News he held out hope that Kennedy, made aware of its importance to Navajo Nation, might consider reinstating it.",
      "From the start of the layoffs, Kennedy has insisted that no \u201cessential services\u201d would be cut. \u201cThe cuts in all of our agency are not affecting science,\u201d Kennedy told ABC News last week.",
      "But the scope of the cuts \u2014 and the work impacted, from utility bill assistance on Navajo Nation, to research into black lung disease for coal miners, to a division that monitors lead exposure among children \u2014 has continued to dog Kennedy, raising questions about his oversight and involvement in the major restructuring.",
      "In all, the tribal leaders were resoundingly appreciative of Kennedy's visit, which was part of his first major trip as HHS secretary. The trip focused on combatting chronic disease, with a heavy emphasis on the importance of healthy, unprocessed foods.",
      "Dubbed the Make America Healthy Again tour, Kennedy also visited Utah, the first state in the nation to pass a law to remove fluoride from drinking water systems, and met with local officials. While there, he toured the Osher Center for Integrative Health at the University of Utah, which is aiming to center healthy diet and exercise in the health care conversation, and got aboard their \u201cfood pharmacy,\u201d which delivers prescribed healthy foods to patients.",
      "In Arizona, which passed a law to ban SNAP recipients from using the assistance for soda, Kennedy held a press conference with the legislators who championed the bill and toured a Phoenix health center that offers healthy cooking programs for local native communities. He also stopped in for a panel discussion at the 2025 Tribal Self-Governance Conference, sitting with tribal leaders including the chairwoman of the Wampanoag Tribe, which he fondly described spending time around during his childhood in Massachussetts.",
      "On Navajo Nation, the crowd that gathered at the foot of Window Rock, a memorial, commended him for his devoted attention to issues of outdated medical centers, lack of water infrastructure and inadequate access to healthy foods.",
      "\u201cProcessed food hurts all of us. It disproportionately injures Native people,\u201d Kennedy told the group of Navajo leaders, who nodded in agreement.",
      "But they also used the opportunity to tell Kennedy that they needed more support, not less \u2014 warning against the impact of his agency\u2019s cuts. It was a conversation that Kennedy was receptive to.",
      "\u201cWe are all going back with a long laundry list of tasks that we need to perform. And I'm going to give you my commitment today that I am available and listening to you,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "In an interview with CBS News that aired on Wednesday, Kennedy struck a similar tone to what he told the tribal leaders on Navajo Nation \u2014 that he would look into cuts that he wasn\u2019t aware of, and reinstate those that had disrupted \u201cscientific research.\u201d",
      "\"There's a number of studies that were cut that came to our attention and that did not deserve to be cut, and we reinstated them. Our purpose is not to reduce any level of scientific research, that's important,\" Kennedy said in an interview with CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s comments come after he also told ABC News last week that studies and personnel were being reinstated, adding that the plan was always to make large cuts and then \u201cremedy\u201d mistakes.",
      "But government officials later walked back those comments \u2014 and have largely stood by the cuts, which hit nearly one-fifth of the workforce at both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "On Wednesday, HHS did not respond to a request from ABC News for clarity on which research studies Kennedy was referring to in his interview with CBS News, and whether they had been reinstated.",
      "Asked about various cuts in the CBS interview, from a grant for diabetes research at the University of Michigan to over $11 billion in cuts to COVID recovery efforts at the state level, Kennedy said he wasn't \"familiar,\" but would look into it.",
      "Across the CDC, FDA and the National Institute of Health, three of the main public health arms of HHS, there have not been significant changes to the cuts that hit around 10,000 employees last week.",

    "story": [
      "A judge is set to decide whether to proceed with the resentencing hearings for Erik and Lyle Menendez in light of the Los Angeles County district attorney opposing their release",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A judge is set to decide Friday whether to proceed with resentencing hearings for Erik and Lyle Menendez, who were convicted of murdering their parents, in light of Los Angeles' new district attorney opposing their release after 30 years behind bars.",
      "The brothers were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole at ages 18 and 21 after being convicted of murdering their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, in their Beverly Hills home in 1989. While the defense argued they acted out of self-defense after years of sexual abuse by their father, prosecutors said the brothers killed their parents for a multimillion-dollar inheritance.",
      "Los Angeles County's previous progressive district attorney, George Gasc\u00f3n, sought resentencing for the brothers before he lost reelection to tough-on-crime candidate Nathan Hochman in November. Gasc\u00f3n had asked a judge to change the brothers' sentence to 50 years to life, which would make them immediately eligible for release under California law because they committed the crime when they were younger than 26.",
      "But last month, Hochman submitted a motion to withdraw that request, saying he did not support the brothers' resentencing because they had not admitted to lies they told as the case unfolded about why they killed their parents and did not \u201cfully recognize, acknowledge, and accept complete responsibility\u201d for their crime.",
      "On Friday, the court will decide whether to allow prosecutors to withdraw their resentencing motion. If that request is granted, the judge also will decide whether to proceed independently with the brothers' resentencing hearings, which are tentatively scheduled for April 17 and 18.",
      "The district attorney's opposition poses a major hurdle for the brothers, whose path to resentencing was all but certain with Gasc\u00f3n's support.",
      "The family's relationship with Hochman also has soured. Most of the brothers' extended family supports their resentencing. Milton Andersen, Kitty Menendez's brother and the sole relative who opposed their release, died last month.",
      "Tamara Goodall, a cousin of the brothers, submitted a complaint with the state asking that Hochman be removed from the case, citing his bias against the brothers and alleging he violated a law meant to protect victims' rights.",
      "Hochman had a \u201chostile, dismissive and patronizing tone\u201d in meetings with the family and created an \u201cintimidating and bullying atmosphere,\" Goodall wrote.",
      "In their response to the district attorney's motion to withdraw the resentencing request, attorneys for the Menendez brothers questioned whether Hochman had legitimate reasons for doing so or was influenced by \u201ca change of political winds.\u201d",
      "The attorneys pointed out that Hochman demoted Nancy Theberge and Brock Lunsford, the two deputy district attorneys who filed the original resentencing motion. Theberge and Lunsford have since filed lawsuits against Hochman alleging harassment, discrimination and retaliation for their work on the Menendez brothers case.",
      "\u201cThe law requires fairness, not personal vendettas,\" Anamaria Baralt, a cousin of the brothers, said in a statement. \"Erik and Lyle have not only taken responsibility, they\u2019ve become the kind of men this system is supposed to help create. If rehabilitation doesn\u2019t matter here, when does it?\"",
      "Hochman's office denied any political influence on their decision-making in their reply and doubled down on the position that Erik and Lyle Menendez \u201cfabricated their self-defense claim\u201d in the murders of their parents and had not achieved full rehabilitation.",
      "Without resentencing, the brothers would still have two other pathways to freedom. They have submitted a clemency plea to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has ordered the state parole board to investigate whether the brothers would pose a risk to the public if they are released. The parole board is scheduled to hold its final hearings June 13.",
      "The brothers also submitted a petition for habeas corpus in May 2023 asking the court to grant them a new trial in light of new evidence presented. Hochman's office also filed a motion opposing the petition.",

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Long a method of execution associated with political terror or military justice, a firing squad is set to kill a South Carolina inmate on Friday, the second time the state will have carried out that method in the past five weeks.",
      "Mikal Mahdi was sentenced to die 20 years ago for the ambush killing of an off-duty police officer. He will be the fifth inmate executed by South Carolina in less than eight months as the state makes its way through prisoners who ran out of appeals during an unintended 13-year pause on the death penalty.",
      "Mahdi, 42, chose to die by three bullets to the heart instead of lethal injection or the electric chair. On March 7, Brad Sigmon was executed in the first U.S. firing squad death in 15 years and only the fourth since 1976. The others all occurred in Utah.",
      "The firing squad is an execution method with a long and violent history around the world. Death in a hail of bullets has been used to punish mutinies and desertion in armies, as frontier justice in America\u2019s Old West and as a tool of terror and political repression in the former Soviet Union and Nazi Germany.",
      "But South Carolina lawmakers saw it as the quickest and most humane way to kill an inmate, especially with the uncertainty in obtaining lethal injection drugs.",
      "Mahdi will be the 12th execution in the U.S. this year. Twenty-five prisoners in nine states were killed in all of 2024. Alabama and Louisiana have killed inmates by nitrogen gas. Florida, Oklahoma, Arizona and Texas have executed men by lethal injection, while South Carolina has used both the firing squad and lethal injection.",
      "At 6 p.m. Friday, the curtain will open in the death chamber at a Columbia prison with fewer than a dozen witnesses sitting behind bulletproof glass.",
      "Mahdi will be strapped into a chair. A white square with a red bull\u2019s-eye will be over his heart, placed by a doctor with a stethoscope. His lawyer can read Mahdi's final statement if he has one. A prison employee will then place a hood over Mahdi's head, walk across the small room and pull open a black shade where the prison employees who volunteered for the firing squad will be stationed.",
      "Without an audible or visual warning to witnesses, the shooters will fire high-powered rifles at Mahdi from 15 feet (4.6 meters) away, about the distance from a basketball backboard to the free-throw line. They all will have live bullets that shatter and splinter when they hit something firm, like a rib cage.",
      "A doctor will then come out within a minute or two, examine Mahdi and declare him dead.",
      "Mahdi admitted he killed Orangeburg Public Safety officer James Myers in 2004, shooting him at least eight times before burning his body. Myers\u2019 wife found him in the couple's Calhoun County shed, which had been the backdrop to their wedding 15 months earlier.",
      "Myers\u2019 shed was a short distance through the woods from a gas station where Mahdi tried but failed to buy gas with a stolen credit card and left behind a vehicle he had carjacked in Columbia. Mahdi was arrested in Florida while driving Myers\u2019 unmarked police pickup truck.",
      "Mahdi also admitted to the killing three days earlier of Christopher Boggs, a Winston-Salem, North Carolina, convenience store clerk who was shot twice in the head as he checked Mahdi\u2019s ID. Mahdi was sentenced to life in prison for that killing.",
      "Mahdi's final appeal was rejected this week by the South Carolina Supreme Court. His lawyers said Mahdi's original attorneys put on a shallow case trying to spare his life that didn\u2019t call on relatives, teachers or others who knew him and ignored the impact of months spent in solitary confinement in prison as a teen.",
      "The defense\u2019s case to spare Mahdi\u2019s life before a judge lasted only about 30 minutes. It \u201cdidn\u2019t even span the length of a Law & Order episode, and was just as superficial,\u201d Mahdi\u2019s lawyers wrote.",
      "Mahdi's earliest memory was his father slamming his mother through a glass table and later lying to his son and saying his mother was dead. Mahdi's father pulled him out of school in fifth grade when officials suggested he needed behavioral help, defense lawyers said.",
      "Prosecutors said Mahdi constantly uses brutality to solve his problems. As a death row prisoner, he stabbed a guard and hit another worker with a concrete block. Mahdi was caught three times with tools he could have used to escape, including a piece of sharpened metal that could be used as a knife, according to prison records.",
      "\u201cThe nature of the man is violence,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Mahdi then sent his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, which has not ruled.",
      "Mahdi's death is the end of a busy time in South Carolina's death chamber. He will be the fifth inmate killed since September after the state had not had any executions since 2011. No other inmates are out of appeals but several are close.",
      "The state was able to restart executions after lawmakers allowed the firing squad and passed a bill allowing suppliers of the pentobarbital to remain secret, along with the exact procedures used to kill inmates and the names of prison employees on execution teams, including the firing squad shooters.",
      "Along with Sigmon's firing squad death last month, three other South Carolina prisoners have been executed via lethal injection since September.",
      "South Carolina now has 28 inmates on its death row. Just one man has been sentenced to death in the past decade.",

      "NEW YORK -- Dominicans in New York City are mourning the deaths of over 200 people in Tuesday's roof collapse at a Santo Domingo nightclub.",
      "The city is home to the largest Dominican diaspora community, with over 700,000 residents claiming roots in the island nation as of 2020.",
      "On Thursday, Teresa Tapia was among those visiting a growing memorial set up in the center of the Washington Heights neighborhood, featuring a dozen veladoras \u2014 prayer candles placed in glass.",
      "\u201cDominicans are really grieving, I tell you,\u201d said Tapia, 47, who has lived in the U.S. for eight years. \u201cI'm so sad. I had to go out and walk. I had to get out.\u201d",
      "Among the 221 confirmed dead in the tragedy at the Jet Set club were prominent baseball players Octavio Dotel and Tony Enrique Blanco Cabrera, as well as merengue singer Ruddy P\u00e9rez.",
      "Tapia had seen P\u00e9rez perform in his final New York concert on April 4, where she said he encouraged people to join him at Jet Set, at the next show. After shedding a few tears, she turned to a poster of the singer.",
      "\u201cThank you Ruddy,\u201d she said in Spanish, \u201cFor all the joy you gave to your country.\u201d",
      "Others at the memorial in the heavily Dominican neighborhood met up and greeted each other, conferring briefly over the latest headline or image from the disaster in their phones.",
      "Above the memorial, scrawled in black pen, was a message of unity that brushed off regional and political divisions.",
      "\u201cToday we are not from Licey or Las Aguilas, from the PRM or the PLD,\" it read in Spanish, using acronyms for political parties in the Dominican Republic. \u201cToday we are simply a people united by grief.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, mourners clutching Dominican flags filled the pews at St. Elizabeth Church for a mass in memory of the victims. Among those speaking from the pulpit was Ydanis Rodriguez, the city's transportation commissioner who was born in Dominican Republic. He pushed back at a narrative heard online and in the streets of Washington Heights that less sympathy was due to the victims because it was an expensive nightclub.",
      "\u201cThe people who say \u2018it was millionaires there.' No. It was Dominicans there. It was workers at Jet Set,\" other workers and students, said Rodriguez in Spanish.",

      "A senior U.N. official says a nearly two-year-old war has engulfed Sudan in the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis and led the African country to become the only nation experiencing famine",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- A nearly two-year-old war has engulfed Sudan in the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis and led the African country to become the only nation experiencing famine, a senior U.N. official said Thursday.",
      "Nearly 25 million people \u2014 half of Sudan\u2019s population \u2014 face extreme hunger, while people are dying in famine-hit areas in western Darfur, said Shaun Hughes, the World Food Program\u2019s emergency coordinator for Sudan and the region.",
      "Sudan plunged into conflict on April 15, 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions, including the vast western Darfur region.",
      "Since then, at least 20,000 people have been tallied as being killed, though the number is likely far higher.",
      "\u201cBy any metric, this is the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis,\u201d Hughes told U.N. reporters, pointing to over 8 million people displaced within Sudan and 4 million who have fled across borders to seven countries that also face hunger and need humanitarian aid.",
      "Famine was initially confirmed last August in Zamzam camp in North Darfur, where about 500,000 people sought refuge, but Hughes said it has since spread to 10 other areas in Darfur and Kordofan. He said 17 other areas are at risk of famine in coming months.",
      "\u201cThe scale of what is unfolding in Sudan threatens to dwarf anything we have seen in decades,\u201d Hughes said.",
      "He warned in a video press conference from Nairobi that \u201ctens of thousands more people will die in Sudan during a third year of war unless WFP and other humanitarian agencies have the access and the resources to reach those in need.\u201d",
      "Late last month, the Sudanese military regained control over Khartoum, a major symbolic victory in the war. But the rival Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group still controls most of Darfur and some other areas.",
      "Hughes said what\u2019s happening in Zamzam camp, which is caught in the conflict, is \u201chorrific\u201d \u2014 as is the situation in North Darfur\u2019s capital, El Fasher, which has been besieged by the RSF since May 2024. It is the only capital in Darfur that the RSF does not hold.",
      "Hughes said WFP receives daily reports from its humanitarian partners and contacts on the ground in North Darfur \u201cthat excess mortality is occurring as a result of the famine.\u201d",
      "While WFP has not been able to reach Zamzam with a convoy since October, he said the agency has been able to help some 400,000 people there, in El Fasher and other camps, by transferring cash digitally into people\u2019s bank accounts so they can buy food and other items. However, this is only possible where markets exist.",
      "Hughes said WFP\u2019s assistance to Sudanese people in need has tripled since mid-2024 and that the agency is now reaching over 3 million per month, mainly through a surge in the use of digital cash transfers.",
      "WFP said it wants to help 7 million people in Sudan in the next six months but needs $650 million.",
      "Hughes was asked whether Trump administration funding cuts were responsible for any of that needed amount. He replied: \u201cAll allocations that the U.S. government has made to Sudan remain effective, for which we are grateful.\u201d",
      "WFP said it needs an additional $150 million to help people who have fled to Chad, South Sudan, Central African Republic and elsewhere.",
      "\u201cWithout funding we either cut the number of people receiving assistance, or cut the amount of assistance we provide people,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cThat\u2019s already happening.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court says the Trump administration must work to bring back a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, rejecting the administration\u2019s emergency appeal",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Thursday said the Trump administration must work to bring back a Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to prison in El Salvador, rejecting the administration\u2019s emergency appeal.",
      "The court acted in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen who had an immigration court order preventing his deportation to his native country over fears he would face persecution from local gangs.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis had ordered Abrego Garcia, now being held in a notorious Salvadoran prison, returned to the United States by midnight Monday.",
      "\u201cThe order properly requires the Government to \u2018facilitate\u2019 Abrego Garcia\u2019s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador,\u201d the court said in an unsigned order with no noted dissents.",
      "It comes after a string of rulings on the court's emergency docket where the conservative majority has at least partially sided with Trump amid a wave of lower court orders slowing the president's sweeping agenda.",
      "In Thursday's case, Chief Justice John Roberts had already pushed back Xinis' deadline. The justices also said that her order must now be clarified to make sure it doesn\u2019t intrude into executive branch power over foreign affairs, since Abrego Garcia is being held abroad. The court said the Trump administration should also be prepared to share what steps it has taken to try to get him back \u2014 and what more it could potentially do.",
      "The administration claims Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, though he has never been charged with or convicted of a crime. His attorneys said there is no evidence he was in MS-13.",
      "The administration has conceded that it made a mistake in sending him to El Salvador, but argued that it no longer could do anything about it.",
      "The court\u2019s liberal justices said the administration should have hastened to correct \u201cits egregious error\u201d and was \u201cplainly wrong\u201d to suggest it could not bring him home.",
      "\u201cThe Government\u2019s argument, moreover, implies that it could deport and incarcerate any person, including U. S. citizens, without legal consequence, so long as it does so before a court can intervene,\u201d Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, joined by her two colleagues.",
      "Abrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, said the ordeal has been an \u201cemotional rollercoaster\u201d for their family and the entire community.",
      "\u201cI am anxiously waiting for Kilmar to be here in my arms, and in our home putting our children to bed, knowing this nightmare is almost at its end. I will continue fighting until my husband is home,\u201d she said.",
      "One of his lawyers, Simon Sandoval-Moshenburg, said \u201ctonight, the rule of law prevailed,\" and he encouraged the government to \"stop wasting time and get moving.\u201d",
      "In the district court, Xinis wrote that the decision to arrest Abrego Garcia and send him to El Salvador appears to be \u201cwholly lawless.\u201d There is little to no evidence to support a \u201cvague, uncorroborated\u201d allegation that Abrego Garcia was once in the MS-13 street gang, Xinis wrote.",
      "The 29-year-old was detained by immigration agents and deported last month.",
      "He had a permit from the Homeland Security Department to legally work in the U.S. and was a sheet metal apprentice pursuing a journeyman license, his attorney said. His wife is a U.S. citizen.",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, assistant DHS secretary for public affairs, said Thursday that the justices' order for clarification from the lower court was a win for the administration. \u201cWe look forward to continuing to advance our position in this case,\u201d she said.",
      "A Justice Department spokesman said the court had \u201cdirectly noted the deference owed to the Executive Branch\u201d in foreign affairs.",
      "An immigration judge had previously barred the U.S. from deporting Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in 2019, finding that he faced likely persecution by local gangs.",
      "A Justice Department lawyer conceded in a court hearing that Abrego Garcia should not have been deported. Attorney General Pam Bondi later removed the lawyer, Erez Reuveni, from the case and placed him on leave.",

      "An ex-military officer in Gambia and others have testified this week against a man on trial in the United States accused of conspiring to torture people accused of opposing the West African nation's longtime dictator",
      "DENVER -- Suspected of backing a coup plot against the longtime dictator of Gambia nearly 20 years ago, Pharing Sanyang described Thursday how he was beaten with pipes and palm tree branches, pistol-whipped and hit in the face with a hammer.",
      "Particles from the sandy ground of a courtyard in the West Africa nation where the military officer fell during one of the 2006 beatings lodged in his eyes, causing damage requiring several surgeries, he testified.",
      "Sanyang, a former military officer in Gambia, took the stand in federal court in Denver against one of the former soldiers he said beat him \u2014 Michael Sang Correa.",
      "Correa is on trial after being indicted in 2020 under a rarely used law that allows people to be prosecuted in the U.S. judicial system for torture allegedly committed abroad.",
      "He is charged with torturing Sanyang and four others and being part of a conspiracy to torture alleged coup plotters while serving with the Junglers, a military unit that reported directly to former Gambian president Yahya Jammeh.",
      "Sanyang told jurors he eventually agreed to sign a false confession but wiped blood from his head onto the paper to show he had been tortured. Then, after refusing to confess on television, he was shocked with wires plugged into a wall socket and beaten again, he said.",
      "Bleeding, he read his confession for the television camera, but only the audio was recorded to conceal the torture, he told the court.",
      "\u201cI had to save my body,\u201d Sanyang said of why he agreed to confess, adding he did not join the failed insurrection against Jammeh, who ousted the previous president of Gambia in a coup of his own in 1994.",
      "Sanyang spent nearly a decade in prison after being convicted of treason and fled to nearby Senegal after his release.",
      "Correa came to the U.S. to serve as a bodyguard for Jammeh in December 2016 and overstayed his visa after Jammeh was ousted in 2017, according to prosecutors. Since sometime after arriving, Correa had been living in Denver and working as a day laborer, they said.",
      "Sanyang and other alleged victims traveled from Gambia, Europe and elsewhere in the U.S. to testify this week about their torture. Prosecutors showed the jury photos of victims with scars left by things including a bayonet, a burning cigarette and ropes. The men were asked to circle scars on photos and explain how they received them.",
      "Correa's lawyers have not disputed that the defendant was involved in Sanyang's torture even though Sanyang said Correa, like the other Junglers, was wearing a face mask. Sanyang said he knew Correa from working with him at the president's official home and recognized his \u201cwalking gait.\u201d",
      "But his lawyers argue Correa was a low-ranking private who risked being tortured himself or even killed if he refused Jammeh's orders.",
      "Demba Dem testified Wednesday that his torturers put a black plastic shopping bag over his head and beat him as he was handcuffed.",
      "Another time, they put a heavy bag of sand on his back and then held a piece of hot metal close to his nose. Then they hung him upside down, his wrists and ankles tied, beating him again.",
      "The former teacher who became a member of the Gambian parliament as part of Jammeh's political party said Correa used a stick to beat him.",
      "Dem, who said he was not part of the planned coup, later moved to the Netherlands with his family after seeking asylum and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. He was reluctant to talk on the witness stand about the impact the torture had on his life other than saying it was \u201cvery bad\u201d and asking a prosecutor to move on.",
      "Still, Dem said he was \u201chappy\u201d to be in court to try to hold one of his abusers accountable.",
      "\u201cI have to do it but I feel satisfied,\u201d he said.",
      "The trial is scheduled to continue into next week.",
      "In 2021, a truth commission in Gambia urged that the perpetrators of crimes committed under Jammeh's regime be prosecuted by the government. Other countries have also tried people connected with his rule.",
      "Last year, Jammeh\u2019s former interior minister was sentenced to 20 years behind bars by a Swiss court for crimes against humanity. In 2023, a German court convicted a Gambian man who was also a member of the Junglers of murder and crimes against humanity for involvement in the killing of government critics in Gambia.",

      "BOSTON -- A federal judge on Thursday said she will halt the Trump administration from ending a program that allowed hundreds of thousands of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans to temporarily live in the United States.",
      "U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani that she will issue a stay on the program, which was set to end later this month. The push to help more than half-a-million Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans is part of a broader legal effort to protect nationals from Ukraine, Afghanistan and other countries who are here legally.",
      "Last month, the administration revoked legal protections for hundreds of thousands of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, setting them up for potential deportation in 30 days. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said they will lose their legal status on April 24.",
      "They arrived with financial sponsors and were given two-year permits to live and work in the U.S. During that time, the beneficiaries needed to find other legal pathways if they wanted to stay in the U.S. Parole has been a temporary status.",
      "President Donald Trump has been ending legal pathways for immigrants to come to the U.S., implementing campaign promises to deport millions of people who are in the U.S. illegally.",
      "In motion ahead of the hearing, plaintiffs called the administration\u2019s action \u201cunprecedented\u201d and said it would result in people losing their legal status and ability to work. The also called the move \u201ccontrary to law within the meaning of the Administrative Procedure Act,\u201d which sets out the procedures that agencies have to follow when making rules.",
      "Lawyers for the Trump administration argued that the plaintiffs lacked standing and that the move by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security impacting immigrants in the program, known as CHNV, did not violate the Administrative Procedure Act. They also said plaintiffs would not be able to show the termination of the program was unlawful.",
      "\u201cDHS\u2019s decision to terminate the CHNV program and existing grants of parole under that program is within this statutory authority and comports with the notice requirements of the statute and regulations,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAdditionally, given the temporary nature of CHNV parole and CHNV parolees\u2019 pre-existing inability to seek re-parole under the program, their harms are outweighed by the harms to the public if the Secretary is not permitted to discontinue a program she has determined does not serve the public interest.\u201d",
      "The end of temporary protections for these immigrants has generated little political blowback among Republicans other than three Cuban-American representatives from Florida who called for preventing the deportation of the Venezuelans affected. One of them, Rep. Maria Salazar of Miami, also joined about 200 congressional Democrats this week in cosponsoring a bill that would enable them to become lawful permanent residents.",

      "A federal judge is allowing the Trump administration to move forward with a requirement that everyone in the U.S. illegally must register with the federal government",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Thursday allowed the Trump administration to move forward with a requirement that everyone in the U.S. illegally must register with the federal government and carry documentation, in a move that could have far-reaching repercussions for immigrants across the country.",
      "Judge Trevor Neil McFadden \u2014 a Trump appointee \u2014 sided with the administration, which had argued that officials were simply enforcing a requirement that already existed for everyone who is in the country but isn\u2019t an American citizen. McFadden's ruling didn't go into the substance of those arguments but rested largely on the technical issue of whether the groups pushing to stop the requirement had standing to pursue their claims. He ruled they didn't.",
      "The requirement goes into effect Friday.",
      "Immediately after the ruling, Department of Homeland Security officials emphasized in a news release that the deadline to register for those who've already been in the country for 30 days or more is Friday and that going forward, the registration requirement would be enforced to the fullest.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump and I have a clear message for those in our country illegally: leave now. If you leave now, you may have the opportunity to return and enjoy our freedom and live the American dream,\u201d Secretary Kristi Noem said in the statement. \u201cThe Trump administration will enforce all our immigration laws \u2014 we will not pick and choose which laws we will enforce. We must know who is in our country for the safety and security of our homeland and all Americans.\u201d",
      "While questions remain about how the registration requirement will function, its impact is potentially far-reaching. The Trump administration \u2014 which has worked to make good on campaign promises of mass deportations \u2014 has said between 2.2 million and 3.2 million people could be affected.",
      "One of the groups that sued, the National Immigration Law Center, called the Thursday ruling \u201cdisappointing\u201d in a statement.",
      "\u201cThis disappointing ruling unfortunately means that, for now, Trump\u2019s scheme to force people into an impossible choice moves forward. As we weigh next steps in our case, we urge affected community members to consult with an immigration attorney to better understand the consequences of registering or not,\" said Nicholas Esp\u00edritu, deputy legal director at National Immigration Law Center.",
      "Homeland Security officials announced Feb. 25 that it was mandating that all people in the United States illegally register with the federal government, and said those who didn\u2019t self-report could face fines or prosecution. Failure to register is considered a crime, and people will be required to carry registration documents with them or risk prison time and fines.",
      "Registration will be mandatory for everyone 14 and older without legal status. People registering have to provide their fingerprints and address, and parents and guardians of anyone under age 14 must ensure they registered.",
      "The registration process also applies to Canadians who are in the U.S. for more than 30 days, including so-called snowbirds who spend winter months in places like Florida.",
      "Federal immigration law has long required that people who aren\u2019t American citizens and live in the U.S., including those here illegally, register with the government. Those laws can be traced back to the Alien Registration Act of 1940, which came amid growing fears of immigrants and political subversives in the early days of World War II. The current requirements stem from the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.",
      "But the requirement that people illegally in the U.S. register has been enforced only in rare circumstances. In fact, advocates opposing the government say it hasn\u2019t been universally used since it was first introduced in the mid-1940s.",
      "It was used in a limited way after Sept. 11, 2001, when the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System required that noncitizen males 16 and older from 25 countries \u2014 all but one of them majority Arab or Muslim \u2014 register with the U.S. government. The program led to no terrorism convictions but pulled more than 13,000 people into deportation proceedings. It was suspended in 2011 and dissolved in 2016.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that the registration requirement has always existed and that officials are simply enforcing it for everyone.",
      "The groups that sued say the government should have gone through the more lengthy public notification process before bringing about the change, and that it's enforcing this simply to facilitate President Donald Trump\u2019s aim of carrying out mass deportations.",
      "They argue that the registry puts people who work, contribute to the economy and have deep family ties in America into a deep bind: Do they come forward, register and essentially give up their location to a government intent on carrying out mass deportations, or do they stay in the shadows and risk being charged with the crime of not registering?",
      "The government has already asked people subject to the registration requirement to create an account on the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website.",

      "NEW YORK -- A New York City sightseeing helicopter broke apart in midair Thursday and crashed upside-down into the Hudson River, killing the pilot and a family of five Spanish tourists in the latest U.S. aviation disaster, officials said.",
      "Mayor Eric Adams said the flight began at a downtown heliport around 3 p.m. and the dead \u2014 including three children \u2014 had been recovered and removed from the water. The flight north along the Manhattan skyline and then back south toward the Statue of Liberty lasted less than 18 minutes.",
      "Video of the crash showed parts of the aircraft tumbling through the air into the water near the shoreline of Jersey City, New Jersey. A witness there, Bruce Wall, said he saw it \u201cfalling apart\u201d in midair, with the tail and propeller coming off. The propeller was still spinning without the helicopter as it fell.",
      "Dani Horbiak was at her Jersey City home when she heard what sounded like \u201cseveral gunshots in a row, almost, in the air.\u201d She looked out her window and saw the chopper \"splash in several pieces into the river.\u201d",
      "The helicopter was spinning uncontrollably with \u201ca bunch of smoke coming out\u201d before it slammed into the water, said Lesly Camacho, a hostess at a restaurant along the river in Hoboken, New Jersey.",
      "Rescue boats circled the submerged aircraft within minutes of impact near the end of a long maintenance pier for a ventilation tower serving the Holland Tunnel. Recovery crews hoisted the mangled helicopter out of the water just after 8 p.m. using a floating crane.",
      "The flight was operated by New York Helicopters, officials said. No one answered the phones at the company\u2019s offices in New York and New Jersey.",
      "A person who answered the phone at the home of the company\u2019s owner, Michael Roth, declined to comment. Roth told the New York Post he was devastated and had \u201cno clue\u201d why the crash happened.",
      "\u201cThe only thing I know by watching a video of the helicopter falling down, that the main rotor blades weren\u2019t on the helicopter,\u201d the Post quoted him as saying. He added that he had not seen such a thing happen during his 30 years in the helicopter business, but noted: \u201cThese are machines, and they break.\u201d",
      "Emails seeking comment were sent to attorneys who have represented Roth in the past.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration identified the helicopter as a Bell 206, a model widely used in commercial and government aviation, including by sightseeing companies, TV news stations and police. It was initially developed for the U.S. Army before being adapted for other uses. Thousands have been manufactured over the years.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board said it would investigate.",
      "Video of the crash suggested that a \u201ccatastrophic mechanical failure\u201d left the pilot with no chance to save the helicopter, said Justin Green, an aviation lawyer who was a helicopter pilot in the Marine Corps.",
      "It is possible the helicopter\u2019s main rotors struck the tail boom, breaking it apart and causing the cabin to free fall, Green said.",
      "\u201cThey were dead as soon as whatever happened happened,\u201d Green said. \u201cThere\u2019s no indication they had any control over the craft. No pilot could have prevented that accident once they lost the lifts. It\u2019s like a rock falling to the ground. It\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d",
      "The skies over Manhattan are routinely filled with planes and helicopters, both private recreational aircraft and commercial and tourist flights. Manhattan has several helipads from which business executives and others are whisked to destinations throughout the metropolitan area.",
      "At least 38 people have died in helicopter accidents in New York City since 1977. A collision between a plane and a tourist helicopter over the Hudson in 2009 killed nine people, and five died in 2018 when a charter helicopter offering \u201copen door\u201d flights went down into the East River.",
      "New York Helicopters also owned a Bell 206 that lost power and made an emergency landing on the Hudson during a sightseeing tour in June 2013. The pilot managed to land safely, and he and the passengers \u2014 a family of four Swedes \u2014 were uninjured. The National Transportation Safety Board found that a maintenance flub and an engine lubrication anomaly led to the power cutoff.",
      "Thursday\u2019s crash was the first for a helicopter in the city since one hit the roof of a skyscraper in 2019, killing the pilot.",
      "The accidents \u2014 and the noise caused by helicopters \u2014 have repeatedly led some community activists and officials to propose banning or restricting traffic at Manhattan heliports.",
      "Other recent crashes and close calls have already left some people worried about the safety of flying in the U.S.",
      "Seven people were killed when a medical transport plane plummeted into a Philadelphia neighborhood in January. That happened two days after an American Airlines jet and an Army helicopter collided in midair in Washington in the deadliest U.S. air disaster in a generation.",

      "In an announcement this week, PCH said it was using the bankruptcy process to \u201cfinalize a shift away\u201d from its legacy business of direct-mail, retail merchandise and magazine subscriptions. The company is hoping to instead transition to a \u201cpure digital advertising\" model, where it will continue to offer free-to-play entertainment and prizes.",
      "The Chapter 11 proceedings, filed in New York on Wednesday, arrive amid growing financial strain for PCH \u2014 which has struggled with rising operational costs and changing consumer habits in recent years.",
      "Pivoting from its old way of doing business will help the company break free from past constraints and \u201cestablish a strong foundation for our future,\" CEO Andy Goldberg said in a statement.",
      "But that doesn't mean the famous sweepstakes are going away. PCH says it plans to operate in a \"business-as-usual manner\" throughout the bankruptcy process \u2014 noting that the \u201cPrize Patrol\u201d team will continuing to deliver awards across the U.S. The company says it's lined up debtor-in-possession financing from Prestige Capital to fund operations through its restructuring.",
      "PCH's roots date back to 1953 \u2014 when Harold and LuEsther Mertz and their daughter, Joyce Mertz-Gilmore, formed a business out of their Long Island, New York home to send direct-to-consumer mailings that solicited subscribers for a number of magazines through one single offering.",
      "The company later grew with chances for consumers to win money \u2014 first launching a direct mail sweepstakes in 1967 \u2014 and expanded its offerings to a wide variety of merchandise, from collectible figurines to houseware and \u201cAs Seen on TV\u201d accessories, in the years that followed. Its in-person \u201cPrize Patrol\u201d team was formed in 1989.",
      "PCH became known for surprising prize winners with oversized checks, which was often filmed and featured in TV commercials. In Wednesday court documents, the company said it has awarded over half a billion dollars in prizes and continues to attract millions of contestants today.",
      "But its operations haven't been without financial strain \u2014 particularly in recent years.",
      "\u201cWhile PCH\u2019s direct mail and e-commerce programs were profitable for decades, changing patterns of consumer behavior, costs and competition, along with a declining pool of new prospecting names, negatively impacted the business, resulted in losses beginning in 2022,\u201d William H. Henrich, co-chief restructuring officer for PCH, wrote in a court declaration Wednesday.",
      "Henrich pointed to a handful of cost pressures \u2014 including rising shipping and postal rates, inventory and supply chain challenges that have continued since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and rising competition from major retailers today, like Walmart and Amazon, that have dominated the e-commerce space.",
      "PCH also faced some scrutiny from regulators who previously raised concerns about consumers mistakenly believing that making purchases from the company would improve their chances at winning its sweepstakes. As a result, PCH has racked up several costly legal settlements over the years \u2014 most recently, Wednesday's court documents note, paying $18.5 million to resolve allegations from the Federal Trade Commission in 2018.",
      "As of the end of March, PCH had total assets of nearly $11.7 million and total liabilities of about $65.7 million, court documents show. The company currently has 105 employees and an annual gross revenue of about $38 million.",

The Ogeechee Riverkeeper group said the agency failed to consider potential impacts to the region's main drinking water supply from the factory using up to 6.6 million gallons (25 million liters) daily.",
      "No revisions to the site's federal permit are needed, the Army Corps said in a March 25 memo to the Georgia Department of Economic Development and local economic developers that applied for the Hyundai project\u2019s 2022 permit.",

      "The Michigan Supreme Court has made sweeping changes to the state\u2019s sentencing law",
      "DETROIT -- The Michigan Supreme Court made an extraordinary change to the state's sentencing law Thursday, striking down automatic, no-parole prison terms for 19-year-olds and 20-year-olds convicted of murder.",
      "As a result, hundreds of people will be eligible to return to local courts for new sentences and an opportunity for freedom.",
      "The Supreme Court, in a 5-2 opinion, said mandatory life sentences for people who were 19 and 20 at the time of the crime violate a ban against \u201ccruel or unusual punishment\u201d in the Michigan Constitution. The court made a similar decision for 18-year-olds in 2022.",
      "A mandatory life sentence \u201cthat does not allow for consideration of the mitigating factors of youth or the potential for rehabilitation is a grossly disproportionate punishment,\u201d Justice Elizabeth Welch wrote.",
      "A life sentence still could be possible though rare. The burden will be on prosecutors to show that someone convicted of murder should never get a chance at parole. Judges will hear evidence about family life, mental health, education and other factors, the same process followed for people 18 or under.",
      "Welch said the court's decision was rooted in scientific research about brain development and a young person's ability to fully grasp the consequences of their actions.",
      "\u201cAs late adolescents mature into fully developed adults, they become less prone to reckless decision-making, more likely to consider and appreciate consequences, and less susceptible to peer pressure,\u201d Welch said.",

      "\u201cCourts should not reshape the law with every shift in scientific consensus, especially when it is the Michigan Constitution that is the subject of reshaping,\u201d said Clement, who was joined by Justice Brian Zahra.",

      "Bernice King warns decades of work to reduce inequities in housing is at risk, as the Trump administration cuts funding for projects and tries to reduce funding for nonprofits that handle housing discrimination complaints.",
      "\u201cI shudder to think what\u2019s going to happen \u2014 there\u2019s still a lot of residential segregation,\" King, CEO of The King Center and the youngest daughter of civil rights leaders The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, told The Associated Press. \"It\u2019s better than it was during my father\u2019s lifetime. But going forward, we may end up right back where we were in the \u201850s and in the \u201960s. People will feel very emboldened to discriminate because they know there\u2019s nothing there to to stop it.\"",
      "In February, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development canceled millions of dollars in grants to nonprofits that handle housing discrimination complaints. A judge temporarily froze the terminations, which HUD said targeted funding awards that included diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, language.",
      "The department will uphold the Fair Housing Act and combat discrimination in housing, a HUD official said, adding that no staffing changes specific to the department have been announced.",
      "King said the attacks on what the administration calls DEI look familiar.",
      "\u201cTo me, these are those same old historic, divide-and-conquer tactics to try to keep people fighting with each other and keep people separated and keep a certain hierarchy existing in a society,\u201d she said.",
      "Whenever she can, King said she highlights her father's legacy pressing for economic equality, including speaking Thursday at the Northwest African American Museum in Seattle, near where Habitat for Humanity of Seattle-King & Kittitas Counties is building a new condominium named after him.",
      "The 58-unit apartment block is located on Martin Luther King Jr. Way in King County, which is also named for him. Construction on the site has started and units will eventually be sold to buyers at affordable prices.",
      "Seattle Habitat CEO Brett D\u2019Antonio, said naming the building after King offered a chance to talk about racial equity in housing, part of Habitat for Humanity's efforts to raise awareness about fair housing, including its fundraising campaign Home is the Key, in April in remembrance of the Fair Housing Act's passage.",
      "\u201cThere was just no better opportunity to name the building in honor of Dr. King as we look to the work ahead of us in tackling affordable housing needs across the country, but also here in Seattle,\u201d he said.",
      "Bernice King remembers when her father moved their family in 1966 to a third-floor walk-up without heat in Chicago. Martin Luther King Jr. came to Chicago to try to break through discrimination housing, which left Black residents paying more in rent for worse conditions than white tenants.",
      "Martin Luther King Jr. campaigned in Chicago, speaking to crowds of tens of thousands around the area and leading a march to City Hall to tape their demands on the front door. A week after he was assassinated in 1968, the Fair Housing Act was signed into law, which prohibited discrimination in housing based on race and other characteristics and created mechanisms to resolve complaints.",
      "She said the dream of fair and equitable housing that the law's passage signaled has still not be realized.",
      "\u201cTo allow its provisions to be weakened is to betray the commitment and the sacrifices made to realize it,\u201d she said, speaking in Seattle.",
      "Large discrepancies in homeownership between Black, Hispanic and white Americans persist today, though that is just one measure of inequity in housing access. The National Fair Housing Alliance found housing discrimination complaints reached a record 34,000 in 2023, with most involving rentals and over half having to do with discrimination based on disability.",
      "Diane Levy, who researches housing at the Urban Institute, said she was concerned about who will take future fair housing complaints if funding to nonprofits that handle those complaints is significantly diminished.",
      "\u201cIf you experience discrimination, if it\u2019s blatant, that takes a toll,\" she said, adding even unseen discrimination limits where you can live and whether to rent or buy home, which, in turn, limits where you can work or go to school.",
      "Levy also noted the administration ended federal protections against housing discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.",
      "Bernice King said this moment calls for creativity and perseverance.",
      "\u201cPeople feel like it\u2019s okay to discriminate \u2014 okay to suppress, oppress and deny,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just means those of us who are on the side of standing up for what is right and fighting for freedom, justice and equality, having even more work to do.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The top U.S. commander in the Pacific warned senators Thursday that the military support China and North Korea are giving Russia in its war on Ukraine is creating a security risk in his region as Moscow provides critical military assistance to both in return.",
      "Adm. Samuel Paparo, head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that China has provided 70% of the machine tools and 90% of the legacy chips to Russia to help Moscow \u201crebuild its war machine.\u201d",
      "In exchange, he said, China is potentially getting help in technologies to make its submarines move more quietly, along with other assistance.",
      "Senators pressed Paparo and Gen. Xavier Brunson, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, on China's advances in the region, including threats to Taiwan. And they also questioned both on the U.S. military presence in South Korea, and whether it should be shielded from personnel cuts..",
      "Both said the current U.S. force there and across the Indo-Pacific is critical for both diplomacy in the region and America's national security, as ties between Russia and China grow. The U.S. has 28,500 forces in South Korea.",
      "Paparo said North Korea is sending \u201cthousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of artillery shells\u201d and hundreds of short-range missiles to Russia. The expectation, he said, is that Pyongyang will get air defense and surface-to-air missile support.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a transactional symbiosis where each state fulfills the other state's weakness to mutual benefit of each state,\u201d Paparo said.",
      "In his opening comments, Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the Republican committee chairman, said the greater alignment of Russia, China and North Korea \u201cshould be of great concern to all in the West. This concern should then lead to action. If we are to maintain global peace and stability, we must continue taking steps now to rebuild our military and reestablish deterrence.\u201d",
      "Brunson said North Korea has shown the ability to send munitions and troops to Russia while advancing development of its own military capabilities, including hypersonics. Pyongrang, he said, \u201cboasts a Russian-equipped, augmented, modernized military force of over 1.3 million personnel.\u201d",
      "North Korea\u2019s efforts to develop advanced nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles \u201dpose a direct threat to our homeland and our allies,\u201d Paparo added.",
      "North Korea also has sent thousands of soldiers to fight with the Russians against Ukraine. And Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday that Russia is actively recruiting Chinese citizens to fight alongside its forces in the Ukraine war. He said more than 150 such mercenaries are already active in the battle with Beijing\u2019s knowledge.",
      "China has called the accusation \u201cirresponsible.\u201d",
      "In other comments, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking Democrat on the panel, said observers fear that President Donald Trump will \u201cshrink the U.S. troop presence in Korea and Japan, reduce our military exercises with both nations, and scale back plans for our Joint Force Headquarters in Japan.\u201d Any such actions, he said, will sow \u201cseeds of doubt\u201d about America\u2019s stability and trustworthiness.",
      "He also questioned whether recent moves by the Pentagon to shift an aircraft carrier and Patriot missile battalion from the Pacific region to the Middle East have hurt military readiness in the Indo-Pacific command.",
      "Paparo said he owes the defense chief and the president \u201cconstant vigilance\u201d on that matter, including a persistent awareness on whether those forces could get back to the Pacific if there is suddenly a \"higher priority threat\" in his region.",

      "At issue in the Rapid City Area School District were questions of harsh discipline and access to advanced coursework for Native students, who have been less likely than their white peers to be in high-level classes. A federal investigation found Native students were roughly four times as likely to be suspended and five times as likely to be arrested compared with their white peers.",

      "The Education Department backed away from the Rapid City case because the resolution focused on racial balancing and tasked its lawyers with \u201cmicromanaging\u201d how the schools disciplined students, a department official said.",
      "Under Trump, the Education Department has threatened to cut funding from schools that refuse to disavow DEI, which his administration has described as discriminatory and illegal.

      "In a statement, the district's acting superintendent, Cory Strasser, said neither the board or district leadership were involved in the decision to terminate the resolution agreement.

      "Members of a 104-year-old Pasadena synagogue that was burned down in the Los Angeles fires in January are getting ready to celebrate Passover",
      "PASADENA, California -- Aty Rotter lost her family home and her spiritual home in the ravenous fire that scorched a large swath of Los Angeles County earlier this year.",
      "The house her late father built in Pasadena more than 60 years ago is gone to the fire that charred more than 21 square miles (54 square kilometers). So is the 104-year-old Pasadena Jewish Temple and Center where she has worshipped since she was a child.",
      "The January fire destroyed the menorahs she lit for Hanukkah and the growing collection of dreidels she planned to pass down to her granddaughters. Also lost forever are the candlesticks and brassware her family carried while fleeing Nazi Europe, and the Seder plates she would have used for the upcoming ritual Passover meal this weekend.",
      "\u201cOnly their spirit and memory of those things remain with me now,\u201d Rotter said. \u201cThe memories of when I used them and who was with me.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s not alone. Thirty of the synagogue\u2019s 435 families lost their homes and even more were displaced. As the major Jewish festival approaches, it\u2019s hard not to see the Passover story reflected in this post-fire reality, said Melissa Levy, the temple\u2019s executive director.",
      "Passover, which begins at sundown Saturday, commemorates the Israelites\u2019 liberation from slavery in ancient Egypt, including their 40-year journey through the desert. It is celebrated with a special meal called a Seder, the eating of matzo or unleavened bread, and the retelling of the Exodus story.",
      "\u201cThe synagogue itself and our people are doing a lot of wandering right now, and having to focus on togetherness and resiliency is a theme that hits home harder than usual this year,\u201d Levy said.",
      "The congregation has received overwhelming support from the community. First United Methodist Church opened its doors so they could continue to hold weekly Shabbat services, their Passover Seders will be held at Pasadena City College, and a synagogue member is sponsoring the second night\u2019s dinner.",
      "\u201cThe outpouring of support we\u2019ve received reminds us that we\u2019re not alone and we\u2019re not wandering alone,\u201d Levy said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good reminder that we all are part of one human family and that the purpose of religion is to make ourselves the best we can be so we can repair the world and take care of each other.\u201d",
      "While the sanctuary adorned with stained glass panels completely burned down, all 13 Torah scrolls were saved, including a Persian scroll retrieved by a congregant from Iran.",
      "Cantor Ruth Berman Harris, who leads the congregation in lieu of a full-time rabbi, said she channeled her Polish grandmother who survived the Holocaust as she and others fought to save the sacred scrolls from the approaching flames.",
      "\u201cWhen I heard the fire was getting closer to the synagogue, that was no time to feel. It was time to step up and take action,\u201d she said.",
      "Time and again, Jewish people \u201chave been forced to pack up and move, go somewhere else and experience something new,\u201d often not of their own volition, Harris said. The Haggadah, a book that leads participants through a Seder, serves as a reminder of Jewish resilience. But the trauma of the fire is recent and raw.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to talk about this sense of loss when it just happened,\u201d she said. \u201cBut also, it\u2019s Passover, and so I need to talk about it.\u201d",
      "Harris is preparing for this task even as she processes her own trauma. She changed the background of her Apple watch from fire \u2013 a reminder \u201cof the internal fire we carry that is connected to God\u201d \u2014 to water.",
      "Levy said the community currently uses three locations \u2013 one where they pray, another that serves as office quarters and a third that houses their school. They are looking for rental space where they can consolidate all of their programs and settle down while planning a major fundraising effort to rebuild.",
      "As Passover approaches, this theme of replenishing and rebuilding continues with various efforts in the area\u2019s Jewish communities to replace sacred items, also known as Judaica, that were lost in the fire. Last month, Leo Baeck Temple in Los Angeles hosted an event featuring thousands of new and used Judaica items where Rotter and others affected by the Eaton and Palisades fires were able to obtain them for free.",
      "Rotter said she found Seder plates, covers for matzo and challah breads and kiddush cups, which hold wine or grape juice that is used in sanctifying prayers recited to mark the beginning of the Jewish holiday.",
      "Rachel Neumann, a congregant since 2017, said much of her Judaica was ruined in the fire, though her Altadena home survived.",
      "\u201cI lost my Shabbat items and various heirlooms, including things from my late father,\u201d she said, her voice thick with emotion. \u201cTo see this room full of Jewish ritual items donated by individuals or Judaica companies was so beautiful to me. It felt very special to be cared for in this way.\u201d",
      "Emily Kane Miller, a board member at the Kehillat Israel synagogue in Pacific Palisades, founded an organization called Heart and Hamsa with actress and activist Noa Tishby. It\u2019s a free registry and marketplace for Judaica for Jewish families affected by the wildfires. While her synagogue survived the fire, Miller\u2019s home did not. She lost heirlooms handed down from her great-grandmother, a Holocaust survivor.",
      "The site has received numerous donations, including many items from precious Judaica collections.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve received hundreds of Judaica items, which represent hundreds of stories,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThere are hundreds of miracles that brought those pieces to affected families that then become opportunities to reverberate that miracle every time a family uses an item.\u201d",
      "While giving away items that have been handed down over generations can be difficult, even painful, it\u2019s also a \u201cloving act of kindness in a time of struggle,\u201d Miller said. Launching this site along with Tishby has helped her cope with a low moment in her life, she said.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t just lose my house,\u201d Miller said. \u201cMy entire community burned down. To still be able to appreciate and feel the sacred in our world is such a gift. It\u2019s my medicine in this moment.\u201d",
      "Alisa Bromberg, who lost her Pacific Palisades home, said she has felt a sense of tranquility after bringing the Judaica to her rental. She deliberately picked items that appeared old or used.",
      "\u201cThe new things are lovely, but they did not speak to me in the same way that the older ones did,\u201d she said. \u201cSo much of Jewish history is storytelling. I feel so empowered by the people who came before me.\u201d",
      "In her home, Bromberg had a wall display dedicated to her ancestors. Since that burned down, Bromberg has created a new one decorated with Seder plates she recently received.",
      "\u201cThe wall talks to me and I feel like it protects and envelops me,\u201d she said. \u201cWith this Judaica now in my home, I have felt relief for the first time in three months.\u201d",
      "Now the fire is part of her Jewish story and her history. That's why nestled in the display are two charred kiddush cups \u2014 the only items she managed to retrieve from her burned-out home.",

      "The futuristic system was ordered by Trump during his first week in office, and if successful, would mark the first time the U.S. would place weapons in space that are meant to destroy ground-based missiles within seconds of launch.",
      "In his January executive order, Trump gave the military 60 days to provide him recommendations on what an overall system would look like.",
      "Recent developments in hypersonics \u2014 and in particular China's 2021 groundbreaking launch of a warhead system that went into orbit before reentering Earth's atmosphere \u2014 have prompted calls for several years by the U.S. military to develop additional ways to defend against missile strikes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time that we can clearly say that we need space fires and we need weapons systems. We need orbital interceptors,\u201d Gen. Stephen Whiting, head of U.S. Space Command, said in a speech kicking off the annual Space Symposium, an industry event held this week in Colorado. \u201cWe call these weapons, and we need them to deter a space conflict and to be successful if we end up in such a fight.\u201d",
      "Multiple options were developed, vetted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and provided to Hegseth, said Col. Matthew Wroten, Space Command's head of global warfare requirements. He didn't give details on what those options look like.",
      "The Defense Department said it would deliver options to Trump in line with his executive order.",
      "Space Command has not said how much it anticipates a space-based defense will cost, but Wroten said the options sent to Hegseth incorporated estimated costs. This week, Trump said his 2026 defense budget proposal will near $1 trillion.",
      "The program was previously known as Iron Dome but was renamed by the Pentagon in February to Golden Dome.",
      "Wroten said Space Command is now moving forward on developing specific requirements for Golden Dome. Those requirements will be used to weigh what capabilities and \u2014 importantly for defense firms attending the space conference \u2014 what commercially available technologies the military will pursue to get an initial system fielded within a few years.",
      "The administration has said Golden Dome will incorporate existing missile defense systems and new space-based capabilities to form a multilayered defense.",
      "In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan proposed a similar space-based defense, but the Strategic Defense Initiative, also known as \u201cStar Wars,\u201d ultimately did not come to fruition because of technology and cost challenges.",

      "Economists had predicted UK growth of just 0.1% in February, but the ONS said several factors contributed to the surprise rise which was driven by a boost in manufacturing and production.",
      "The government has made growing the UK economy its top priority in its effort to improve living standards.",
      "Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said February's surprise growth was due to computer programming, telecoms and car dealerships in the services sector all having \"strong months\".",
      "She added that manufacturing, electronics and pharmaceutical businesses performed well, and the car making industry also picked up after \"its recent poor performance\".",

      "Alongside the better-than-expected growth, the ONS revised up its figure for January from a contraction of 0.1% to no growth.",
      "Monthly figures alone can be volatile so should be taken in context. The more stable three-month average to February shows growth is up 0.6%.",
      "This would have been considered normal growth a decade ago, but has been elusive in recent years.",
      "However, it suggests that recent talk of a recession has been way off the mark.",

    "story": [
      "There were some heroic efforts from Donald Trump and those around him on Wednesday night to suggest the past seven days were something other than absolute chaos.",
      "By this reading, Trump's 4D game of chess has left China in check. Certainly the Chinese economy faces a massive hit from punitive tariffs in its biggest market. But even accounting for the President's roll back, the US has still erected a massive protectionist tariff wall, not seen since the 1930s.",
      "The world is left with a universal 10% tariff, irrespective of whether that country (for example the UK or Australia) actually sells less to the US than the US sells to it.",
      "There is now no difference between the EU, which clearly does have a massive trade deficit in goods and was preparing to retaliate, and the UK.",
      "There is also an anxious wait to find out what comes next. One of the questions is whether President Trump pushes ahead with tariffs on medicines, the UK's second biggest goods export.",
      "Plus there is potential logistical chaos on the cards from a little-noticed multi-million dollar port tax for every cargo vessel docking in the US that was \"made in China\". That is more than half of the global merchant fleet - and it is due next week.",
      "Even with Trump's stated 90 day pause on implementing higher tariffs, there remains too much uncertainty for companies to go through the rigmarole of rerouting global trade.",
      "The China fallout",
      "The central issue now, however, is that the world's two great economic superpowers are facing off against each other like rutting stags.",
      "Tariffs at these sky-high rates are massively hitting business between two nations which together account for around 3% of the entire world's trade. The main motorway of the global economy is effectively shut.",
      "The visible tangible consequences of all this will become very real very quickly: Chinese factories will close, workers will stroll from plant to plant looking for work.",
      "Beijing will need to organise a stimulus package to account for the loss of whole percentage points of GDP, the kind of thing that happens when a natural disaster flattens a major city. Painful, but manageable at a cost, though not forever.",
      "Meanwhile the US will see consumer prices surge. President Trump might try to order these US companies not to raise prices, but the effect will come through soon enough.",
      "In theory this will be in sharp contrast to what is happening in other countries in the world. Across the border in Canada, or in Europe, not only will there not be such China-sourced price rises, there could be price cuts.",
      "From trade wars to currency wars",
      "Trade wars on this scale do not stay confined to the flow of goods. They tend to become currency wars.",
      "What we saw this week was the trade turmoil spread to credit markets, especially the US bond market, having already hit share prices.",
      "Indeed there was an invaluable reveal for the game theory of this conflict. The Trump administration revealed a key pressure point with its concern about the \"yippy\" - as Trump called it - bond market.",
      "As trading in US government debt continued overnight in Asia, the effective interest rate on these bonds rose to 5%.",
      "This sort of borrowing should not move in such an erratic fashion.",
      "The last time this happened was in the \"Dash for Cash\", the key moment of financial fragility at the very beginning of the pandemic. The world was focussed on life or death in March 2020, but this potential further crisis was alleviated only by emergency action.",
      "Effectively, the President's row back was a form of emergency policy change.",
      "Was the Chinese government behind this rash of US government bond sales in Asia? Probably not. However, what happened on Wednesday highlighted a vulnerability for Trump.",
      "China is the second biggest holder of US government debt in the world and if it chose to, dumping all that debt would be catastrophic for America. But doing so would be a form of mutually assured economic destruction - the losses for China would be huge.",
      "More importantly, what the bond markets were telling Trump is that they are deeply sceptical about his tariff policy.",
      "The US does have the Federal Reserve, which does have some power to tranquillise bond markets. But right now it does not look like its chairman Jerome Powell will ride to the rescue.",
      "The bond market scepticism echoes the sentiment of the ascendant Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. He is now pushing for Trump to reach trade deals with their allies because the US needs them to take on China.",
      "Given the US was previously calling these same close allies cheaters, looters and pillagers, there is no way this was the strategy all along.",
      "This does matter. The US needs the EU, UK, the rest of the G7 on side in terms of China. China probably needs those countries just to stay neutral, and carry on soaking up its exports.",
      "The rest of the world has seen Trump's team struggle to explain tariffing penguin islands or poor African economies and the President himself recirculating the suggestion he was crashing stock markets on purpose. And they've witnessed the fact that the tariff rates were changed after they came into effect and also the absurd nature of the equation used to calculate them.",
      "It's in this context that Trump's handling of the situation has handed leverage back to the rest of the world, because neither friend nor foe will know quite what they are negotiating  with this America.",
      "There is a calm, welcomed by all, but it could be rather brief.",
      "Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceqj3z4g0e1o",
    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 23:07:36 GMT",
    "summary": "Cocoa prices are soaring so new chocolate firms are looking at an alternative ingredient.",
    "story": [
      "The first thing I notice is the lack of a strong aroma. There's no familiar, powerful waft of cocoa when opening this bag of sweets, the packet of biscuits, or the caramel-filled truffles.",
      "And as I taste each one as part of my solemn commitment to inform the public, I don't get quite the same burst of chocolate flavour that you might expect from treats with that familiar, waxy, light brown chocolate-like coating. The thing is, this isn't chocolate. It's made with sunflower seeds. Or fava (also called broad) beans.",
      "The selection before me is just a smattering of the non-cocoa containing alternatives to chocolate that are creeping into the European retail market right now. Their makers have spied an opportunity, partly because real chocolate prices are soaring.",
      "\"The average increase in price for chocolate was 9% over 2024,\" says Richard Caines, principal analyst in UK food and drink research at market research firm Mintel. \"In January just gone, it's shot up by 14%.\"",
      "That's the retail price of chocolate. The wholesale price of the key ingredient, cocoa \u2013 which is made from fermented, roasted and ground cacao beans \u2013 has increased by an astonishing 300% in 2024.",
      "\"I have been looking at this chocolate market for quite a few years now \u2013 I don't remember a big story like this on costs going up,\" adds Mr Caines.",
      "A key reason for this increase is climate change-related weather impacts on cacao farms, particularly in West Africa.",
      "Plus, some farmers in Ghana are turning away from cacao production in favour of illegal gold-mining, according to reports.",
      "It means that there was a deficit of roughly 500,000 tonnes of cocoa in the global market last year.",
      "Real chocolate could become a \"luxury\" item in the future says Massimo Sabatini, co-founder and chief executive of Italian firm Foreverland, which makes a cocoa powder alternative called Choruba.",
      "The company opened its production facility in March, where staff process not cacao beans but carob husks.",
      "Carob trees produce small, brown, banana-shaped pods containing seeds. It's possible to process the pods to create a cocoa-like powder. This chocolate alternative has a long history, however \u2013 and not a very happy one.",
      "A New Yorker article claims a generation was \"traumatized\" by carob-based confectionary during the 1970s. It didn't taste as good as real chocolate, and it didn't melt in your mouth in the same way, apparently.",
      "But Mr Sabatini insists that he and his colleagues have come up with a worthy product. He acknowledges that carob \"really doesn't taste like chocolate\" but adds that Foreverland's fermentation and roasting process removes some of the carob flavour to get it closer to cocoa.",
      "Their carob-based dark chocolate alternative is sweeter and more caramel-like than real dark chocolate, he explains.",
      "There could be health benefits to this. \"We can reduce drastically the sugar content,\" says Mr Sabatini. Carob is also higher in fibre and lower in fat than cocoa.",
      "German food manufacturer Planet A Foods has developed a different chocolate alternative. Sara Marquart, co-founder and chief technology officer, says her goal is not to replace chocolate but to help fill the gap in the market caused by volatility in cocoa availability and prices.",
      "Unlike Foreverland, Planet A Foods have chosen sunflower seeds as the key ingredient in their cocoa powder alternative, ChoViva.",
      "\"We process sunflower seeds like cocoa beans,\" explains Dr Marquart. \"It's a highly abundant ingredient, there's millions and millions of tonnes on the market.\"",
      "ChoViva is now present in roughly 35 different retail products, mostly on the market in Germany and France \u2013 though it also appears in mini egg-shaped sweets sold by Aldi in the UK. The sweets are made with peanuts and have a chocolate-like coating containing ChoViva.",
      "When I try them, the flavour is overwhelmingly dominated by the salty peanut at the egg's core. But the chocolatey texture of the coating is impressive. The same applies to ChoViva-covered biscuits made by the firm.",
      "I note that the chocolate-like coating is rather thin and not overly flavourful. But again, the texture is pretty much what you'd expect from real chocolate, though not quite as melty.",
      "The company's ChoViva-covered popcorn is probably the most chocolatey item I try \u2013 the popcorn doesn't usurp its coating.",
      "Overall, there's nothing here that would perturb a consumer. Especially one unaware that these products don't actually contain chocolate.",
      "A UK start-up also keen to compete in this space is Nukoko. Two of its founders previously ran a real chocolate business and teamed up with a food scientist to form their new venture.",
      "\"We saw first-hand the issues with the chocolate supply chain,\" says Ross Newton, co-founder. Like Foreverland and Planet A Foods, Nukoko has opted for a key ingredient that the firm can source and process locally \u2013 to reduce food miles and insulate against supply chain risks. But in Nukoko's case the raw material of choice is not carob or sunflower seeds but fava beans.",
      "\"There's around a million tonnes harvested in the UK every year,\" says Mr Newton.",
      "It's early days for the company but he adds that he hopes to begin selling their cocoa powder alternative to food firms later this year.",
      "Mr Newton says imitating the flavour of real chocolate is very hard but that, out of 25 crucial flavour compounds in real chocolate, his company's product manages to include 24 of them \u2013 though in some cases at slightly different concentrations.",
      "The company sends me four caramel-filled truffles to try. The caramel totally dominates and the truffles are very sweet. But the chocolate alternative is as smooth and glossy as you'd expect, and very satisfying to chew.",
      "\"Anything new that comes out has got to meet equal taste expectations,\" says Mr Caines, noting how discerning consumers are when it comes to their favourite chocolate-containing products. Getting them to embrace alternatives devoid of cocoa will be no mean feat.",
      "He adds that alternatives might fare best when used in bakery products \u2013 such as the chips in chocolate chip cookies: \"The chocolate is not so much the star of the show there so it might actually be more acceptable.\"",
      "Should chocolate alternatives meet with success, there is some risk that this could negatively impact cacao farmers, says Tonya Lander, a lecturer in biology at Oxford University.",
      "\"It's something that should be worked through with farmers or farmer collectives,\" she says. Cacao farmers are among the poorest agricultural workers in the world.",
      "Nukoko, Planet A Foods and Foreverland all say they don't aim to replace chocolate, rather, the goal is to fill the gap left by cocoa production shortfalls.",
      "Dr Lander and colleagues have studied environmental factors that influence yield from cacao trees.",
      "Poor pollination and high temperatures negatively affect how much cacao the trees produce, the researchers report in a study published in February.",
      "By shading cacao trees on plantations, for example, it might be possible to improve harvests and potentially reduce the volatility of cocoa supplies. Such interventions, besides switching to cocoa alternatives, could help satisfy confectionary-obsessed consumers in the coming years.",

      "\"Trump has induced a gigantic amount of uncertainty into the global economy and consumers and investors and business managers are reeling and unable to make long-term decisions,\" Mr Ellerboek said.",
      "\"We are really on hold, because we only trade when we have high conviction levels,\" he said.",
      "\"What do we do with Apple? I don't know. I'm not going to change when I have no clue what the tariff rate is going to be next week,\" he said.",
      "Faced with so many uncertainties, some investors are simply quitting the market, said John Canavan, lead analyst at Oxford Economics.",
      "\"What you're looking at, broadly speaking, is a market that is frustrated, uncertain and confused about where we're going to be one day to the next,\" he said.  \"In that environment you have a tendency to see some investors choosing the safety of cash.\"",
      "While Trump's tariff rollback was a \"relief\", he said it did not change the bigger picture: firms in the US that are bringing in parts or products are facing significantly higher import taxes than they were at the start of the year.",
      "\"The tariffs that remain are still high enough that they are likely to push up inflation and weigh significantly on the economy as we go forward,\" he said.",

      "After the US implemented a 104% tariff on products from China at midnight on Wednesday, Beijing hit back with 84% levy on American products. Trump later raised the tariff on China to 125%.",
      "Stock markets have been falling sharply over the past few days in reaction to the escalating global trade war and fears of tariffs leading to higher prices, although US stocks soared when Trump announced the 90-day pause and a lowered 10% reciprocal tariff for other countries.",
      "However, the sale of bonds in the US poses a major problem for the world's biggest economy.",
      "The interest rate - or yield - for US government borrowing over 10 years has spiked sharply in the past couple of days from 3.9% to 4.5%, the highest level since February.",

      "\"Bonds should do well in times of turmoil as investors flee to safety, but Trump's trade war is now undermining the US debt market,\" he added.",
      "While interest rates on US government debt rose, the price of the bonds themselves fell as demand weakened due to investors offloading them.",
      "Mohammed El Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz and former boss of the biggest bond manager Pimco, said one reason US borrowing costs had shot up was because there had been an \"erosion\" of bonds being seen as a safe haven.",
      "He added concerns over the impact of tariffs on inflation and US government budgets were also reasons.",
      "Will the Federal Reserve step in?",
      "Some analysts suggested that America's central bank - the US Federal Reserve -  might be forced to step in if turbulence continues, in a move reminiscent of the Bank of England's emergency action in 2022 following Liz Truss's mini-Budget.",
      "\"We see no other option for the Fed but to step in with emergency purchases of US Treasuries to stabilise the bond market,\" said George Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank.",

      "Economists have predicted US tariffs, which will be paid for by American companies importing goods from abroad, will raise consumer prices domestically.",
      "Trump's plan is aimed at protecting American businesses from foreign competition and also to boost domestic manufacturing.",
      "However, tumbling stock markets resulting from fears extra taxes will hit the profits of companies, could lead ultimately to firms cutting jobs and an economic downturn.",
      "'US recession a coin toss'",
      "JP Morgan, the investment banking giant, has raised the likelihood of a US recession from 40% to 60% and warned that American policy was \"tilting away from growth\".",
      "Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Liberum, told the BBC that the Fed could decide to cut interest rates in a bid to protect US jobs by making it easier for businesses to borrow cash as they face higher costs from tariffs.",
      "He said it was a \"coin toss\" over whether the US would enter a recession.",
      "This is defined as a prolonged and widespread decline in economic activity typically characterised by a jump in unemployment and fall in incomes.",

      "Mr El Erian said the UK was likely to be impacted by the US bonds sell-off.",

      "However, despite this optimism from firms aiming to develop the technology, Dr Domenico Vicinanza, associate professor of intelligent systems and data science at Anglia Ruskin University in the UK, says there are numerous big hurdles before space-based data centres can be a viable proposition.",
      "\"Even with the contribution and advancements of companies like SpaceX, launching hardware into orbit remains extremely expensive,\" he says. \"Each kilogram sent into space costs thousands of dollars.",
      "\"Space-based data centres would require not only the data equipment but also the infrastructure to protect, power, and cool them. All of which add up in weight and complexity.\"",
      "Cooling the equipment will be a particular problem,  because even though space is cold, conventional cooling systems don't work well without gravity.",
      "Meanwhile, space weather can damage electronics, while the ever-increasing quantity of space debris puts the physical hardware at risk.",
      "Dr Vicinanza adds: \"And fixing problems in orbit is far from straightforward. Even with robotics and automation, there are limits to what can be repaired remotely.",
      "\"A big hardware failure might necessitate a costly human mission, potentially making downtime stretch for weeks or months.\"",
      "Yet firms like Lonestar are supremely confident, and say that they are responding to demand. \"We wouldn't be doing this if the customers weren't asking us to,\" says Mr Scott.",
      "Its next target is to put a small data centre in orbit around the moon in 2027. Meanwhile, other companies are hoping to get there a bit faster, such as Washington state-based Starcloud, which is due to launch a satellite-based data centre next month, and start commercial operations in mid-2026.",
      "Lonestar's Mr Eidele says that space-based facilities offer more security for governments and businesses because their data does not need to be routed through terrestrial networks. Instead the information can be beamed directly from space to a dedicated ground station.",
      "\"It's like having the vaults at the back of the bank,\" he says. \"You don't have to open it every day, but it's there to provide an extra measure of security, and the distance from the Earth to the moon offers that - it's that much harder to hack, that much harder to access.\"",
      "The distance to the Moon means that data takes about a second and a half to reach the ground - this doesn't matter for some applications, like longer-term data storage and backups.",
      "And meanwhile, says Lonestar founder and chief executive Chris Stott, space-based data centres can help organisations meet regulations about data sovereignty - the need to hold peoples' data in the country of origin.",
      "\"Under space law, that box of electronics is literally under the law of the licensing or launching state - it is an actual embassy in space,\" he says.",

      "Douglas Irwin, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US, who specializes in the history of US trade policy, believes the economic impact of the boycott may be limited. \"It is hard to judge how economically significant the consumer boycotts will be in terms of reducing trade with the United States,\" he says.",
      "\"In the past, boycotts have not lasted long and have not achieved much. It starts as a hostile reaction to some US action but tends to fade with time,\" he says.",
      "For now though, the rising Buy Canadian sentiment in Canada is boosting sales for many local brands. The CEO of Canadian grocer Loblaw posted on LinkedIn that weekly sales of Canadian products were up by double digits.",

Ryan Christiansen, Caledonia's president and head distiller, says his business had an order on track for shipment to Quebec cancelled directly after tariffs were announced.",

    "story": [
      "It's likely that you have not heard of Taiwan's Hong Fu Industrial Group, but look down on a busy street and you may well see its products.",
      "Hong Fu is the world's second-biggest maker of trainers (sneakers) supplying shoes to Nike, Converse, Adidas, Puma and many others. It makes around 200 million pairs of sports shoes a year.",
      "So when it made a big investment in India's market, the footwear industry took note.",
      "Hong Fu is currently building a giant plant in Panapakkam, in the state of Tamil Nadu in south eastern India. When fully operational, some time in the next three to five years, it will make 25 million pairs of shoes a year, employing as many as 25,000 workers.",
      "The project has Indian partners, including Aqeel Panaruna, the chairman of Florence Shoe Company: \"The international market is saturated and they [Hong Fu] were looking for a new market,\" he explains.",
      "\"There is a drastic increase in non-leather footwear in India. It has huge potential,\" Mr Panaruna added.",
      "The Indian government is keen to attract such investment, hoping it will raise standards in the footwear industry and boost exports.",
      "To spur the industry, last August the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) introduced new quality rules for all shoes sold in India.",
      "Under those standards, for example, materials will have to pass tests of strength and flexibility.",
      "\"These BIS standards are really about cleaning up the market. We've had too many low-quality products flooding in, and consumers deserve better,\" says Sandeep Sharma a journalist and footwear industry expert.",
      "But many in India can't afford shoes from well-known brands.",
      "Serving them is a huge and intricate network of small shoe makers, known as the unorganised sector.",
      "Their affordable products are estimated to account for two-thirds of the total footwear market.",
      "Ashok (he withheld his full name) counts himself as part of that sector, with shoe making units all across the district of Agra in northern India. He estimates that 200,0000 pairs of shoes are made everyday by operations like his across Agra.",
      "\"Many consumers, especially in rural and lower-income urban areas, opt for cheaper local footwear instead of branded options,\" he says.",
      "\"Many organised brands struggle to expand their retail footprint in semi-urban and rural areas because we cater to them.\"",
      "So how will the new government standards affect makers like Ashok?",
      "\"It's complicated,\" says Mr Sharma.",
      "\"I think the government is trying to walk a tightrope here. They can't just shut down thousands of small businesses that employ millions of people - that would be economic suicide.",
      "\"What I'm seeing is more of a carrot-and-stick approach. They're pushing for standards, but also rolling out programs to help small manufacturers upgrade their processes. It's not about wiping out the unorganised sector but gradually bringing them into the fold.\"",

      "Mr Agrawal says his company, Zen Barefoot, is unusual as much of the Indian footwear industry is not very innovative.",
      "\"There are very few people who are ready to take time and invest in new technologies here. Indian manufacturing is a very profit- first market, ROI [return on investment] driven.",

      "\"Many high value brands need to move their manufacturing to India. In 3-5 years, we should have a robust ecosystem to compete in the international sneaker market,\" he adds.",
      "Back in Agra, Ashok hopes that the unorganised sector is not neglected amid the growth of India's footwear industry.",
      "\"The government should give us accreditation and certificates so our factories don't close down. Once we too are included in the organised sector no one can beat India in the shoe manufacturing industry.\"",

      "The Nike Air Jordan 1 is, in some ways, the iconic US trainer. It's a popular line by a large American brand, created four decades ago for homegrown basketball legend Michael Jordan.",
      "But although Nike sells most of its products in the US, almost all of its trainers are made in Asia \u2013 a region targeted by President Donald Trump's tariffs salvo against foreign countries he accuses of \"ripping off\" Americans.",
      "Nike's shares fell 14% the day after the tariffs announcement, on fears over the impact they could have on the company's supply chain.",
      "Follow live updates",
      "So what will all this mean for the price of Nike's trainer?",
      "It depends on how much of the cost increase Nike decides to pass on to customers, if any, and how long they think the tariffs will actually be in place for.",
      "'Competitive industry'",
      "Goods from Vietnam, Indonesia and China face some of the heaviest US import taxes - between 32% to 54%.",
      "Hopes remain that Trump might be willing to negotiate those rates lower. On Friday, he said he had had a \"very productive\" call with the leader of Vietnam, helping Nike shares to recover some ground after their steep Thursday falls.",
      "But most analysts think the firm's prices will have to go up.",
      "Swiss bank UBS estimates that there will be a 10% to 12% increase in the prices of goods that come from Vietnam - where Nike produces half of its shoes.",
      "Meanwhile, Indonesia and China account for almost all of the balance of its trainer production.",
      "\"Our view is that, given how extensive the list of tariffs is, the industry will realise there are few ways to mitigate the impact in the medium term other than by raising prices,\" UBS analyst Jay Sole said in a note.",
      "David Swartz, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, agrees that price rises are likely but says any large price increase would reduce demand.",
      "\"This is a very competitive industry. My guess is that it would be difficult for Nike to raise prices by much more than 10-15%. I don't think it could offset most of the tariff,\" he says.",
      "Many other western brands such as H&M, Adidas, Gap and Lululemon will be facing the same predicament.",
      "Nike is already facing a tight bottom line.",
      "It had around $51bn (\u00a339.6bn) in sales in its most recent fiscal year. The cost of making products, including shipping, third-party profits and warehouse fees, consumed only about 55% of revenue, giving it a healthy gross profit margin of more than 40%.",
      "But that profit gets whittled away once you add in the cost of other business operations. A third of its revenue, for example, is consumed by selling and administrative expense.",
      "By the time you factor in interest and taxes, Nike's profit margin has shrunk to about 11%.",
      "That is across all its products, as they don't break down costs separately for its different items.",
      "Rahul Cee, who set up the trainer review website Sole Review, says there are other ways Nike could keep retail prices low.",
      "Mr Cee, who trained as a footwear designer and worked for Nike and Vans in India, says one way could be to downgrade the level of tech in the trainer.",
      "\"So instead of using high-performance midsole foams and construction, stick to injection moulded EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate),\" he says.",
      "Another option would be instead of bringing out a new design every one to two years, to refresh the design cycle every three to four years.",
      "Things could change fast",
      "Simeon Siegel, managing director at BMO Capital Markets, says most companies were looking at Wednesday's announcement as \"still far from the final conclusion\".",
      "\"I don't think that many people believe that those numbers are etched in stone just yet,\" he says.",
      "Theoretically, Nike is such a big brand that it should be able to put up prices without it hitting their sales, he says, but adds: \"Do they have it right now is the question and do they have it across their product offering is another?\"",
      "Even before the announcement, Nike was facing a slump in sales that had curbed its ability to command full price for its shoes.",
      "Finance chief Matthew Friend has also cited tariffs as an example of developments that were affecting consumer confidence.",
      "And Nike relies heavily on US sales, with the market contributing to roughly $21.5bn of its sales - almost everything it sells in its largest market of North America.",

      "China has already hit back with a 34% tariff of its own.",

      "What has happened to UK interest rates and will they go down further?",

      "When the Bank cut rates in February, it also cut its growth forecast for the UK economy in 2025.",
      "It said it expected the UK to only narrowly avoid falling into recession - where the economy shrinks for two three-month periods in a row - and predicted that inflation would rise towards 4% later in 2025.",
      "Announcing the decision to hold rates in March, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned about global economic uncertainty but said that he still believed interest rates were on a \"gradually declining path\".",

      "There are growing fears that the US tariffs could spark a full-blown international trade war, push up prices and fuel inflation around the world - including in the UK.",

    "summary": "What made the US step back from the system that it profited handsomely from for decades?",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has built another wall, and he thinks everyone else is going to pay for it. But his decision to impose sweeping tariffs of at least 10% on almost every product that enters the US is essentially a wall designed to keep work and jobs within it, rather than immigrants out.",
      "The height of this wall needs to be put in historical context. It takes the US back a century in terms of protectionism. It catapults the US way above the G7 and G20 nations into levels of customs revenue, associated with Senegal, Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan.",
      "What occurred this week was not just the US starting a global trade war, or sparking a rout in stock markets. It was the world's hyper power firmly turning its back on the globalisation process it had championed, and from which it handsomely profited in recent decades.",
      "And in so doing, using the equation that underpinned his grand tariff reveal on the Rose Garden's lawns, the White House also turned its back on some fundamentals of both conventional economics and diplomacy.",
      "The great free trade debate",
      "Trump talked a lot about 1913 in his announcement. This was a turning point when the US both created federal income tax and significantly lowered its tariffs.",
      "Before this point, from its inception, the US government was funded mainly by tariffs, and was unapologetically protectionist, based on the strategy of its first Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton.",
      "The basic lesson the White House has taken from this is that high tariffs made America, made it \"great\" the first time, and also meant that there was no need for a federal income tax.",
      "On this side of the Atlantic, underpinning globalisation and free trade are the theories of 19th-Century British economist David Ricardo. In particular, the 1817 Theory of Comparative Advantage.",
      "There are equations, but the basics are pretty easy to understand: Individual countries are good at making different things, based on their own natural resources and the ingenuity of their populations.",
      "Broadly speaking, the whole world, and the countries within it, are better off, if everyone specialises in what they are best at, and then trades freely.",
      "Here in Britain this remains a cornerstone of the junction between politics and economics. Most of the world still believes in comparative advantage. It is the intellectual core of globalisation.",
      "But the US was never a full convert at the time. The underlying reluctance of the US never disappeared. And this week's manifestation of that was the imaginative equation created by the US Trade Representative to generate the numbers on Trump's big board.",
      "The rationale behind 'reciprocal' tariffs",
      "It is worth unpacking the rationale for these so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs. The numbers bear little resemblance to the published tariff rates in those countries.",
      "The White House said adjustments had been made to account for red tape and currency manipulation. A closer look at the, at-first, complicated looking equation revealed it was simply a measure of the size of that country's goods trade surplus with the US. They took the size of the trade deficit and divided it by the imports.",
      "In the hour before the press conference a senior White House official explained it quite openly. \"These tariffs are customised to each country, calculated by the Council of Economic Advisers\u2026 The model they use is based on the concept the trade deficit that we have is the sum of all the unfair trade practices, the sum of all cheating.\"",
      "This is really important. According to the White House, the act of selling more goods to the US than the US sells to you, is by definition \"cheating\" and is deserving of a tariff that is calculated to correct that imbalance.",
      "This is why the surreal stories about the US tariffing rarely visited islands only inhabited by penguins matter. It reveals the actual method.",
      "The long-term aim, and the target of the policy, is to get the US $1.2 trillion trade deficit and the largest country deficits within that down to zero. The equation was simplistically designed to target those countries with surpluses, not those with recognisable quantifiable trade barriers. It targeted poor countries, emerging economies and tiny irrelevant islets based on that data.",
      "While these two different factors overlap, they are not the same thing.",
      "There are many reasons why some countries have surpluses, and some have deficits. There is no inherent reason why these numbers should be zero. Different countries are better at making different products, and have different natural and human resources. This is the very basis of trade.",
      "The US appears no longer to believe in this. Indeed if the same argument was applied solely to trade in services, the US has a $280bn (\u00a3216bn) surplus in areas such as financial services and social media tech.",
      "Yet services trade was excluded from all the White House calculations.",
      "'China shock' and the ripple effect",
      "There is something bigger here. As the US Vice President JD Vance said in a speech last month, globalisation has failed in the eyes of this administration because the idea was that \"rich countries would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the simpler things\".",
      "That has not panned out, especially in the case of China, so the US is moving decisively away from this world.",
      "For the US, it is not David Ricardo who matters, it is David Autor, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economist and the coiner of the term \"China shock\".",
      "In 2001, as the world was distracted by the aftermath of 9/11, China joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO), having relatively free access to US markets, and so transforming the global economy.",
      "Living standards, growth, profits and stock markets boomed in the US as China's workforce migrated from the rural fields to the coastal factories to produce exports more cheaply for US consumers. It was a classic example of the functioning of \"comparative advantage\". China generated trillions of dollars, much of which was reinvested in the US, in the form of its government bonds, helping keep interest rates down.",
      "Everyone was a winner. Well, not quite. Essentially US consumers en masse got richer with cheaper goods, but the quid pro quo was a profound loss of manufacturing to East Asia.",
      "Autor's calculation was that by 2011, this \"China shock\" saw the loss of one million US manufacturing jobs, and 2.4 million jobs overall. These hits were geographically concentrated in the Rust Belt and the south.",
      "The trade shock impact on lost jobs and wages was remarkably persistent.",
      "Autor further updated his analysis last year and found that while the Trump administration's first term dabble with tariff protection had little net economic impact, it did loosen Democrat support in affected areas, and boosted support for Trump in the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Marine Le Pen's ban outraged France's far right - and they may well take revenge",
      "The influencers who want the world to have more babies - and say the White House is on their side",
      "Trump has blown up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabbling",
      "Fast forward to this week, and the array of union car workers and oil and gas workers celebrating the tariffs in the White House.",
      "So the promise is that these jobs will return, not just to the Rust Belt, but across the US. This is indeed likely to some degree. The president's clear message to foreign companies is to avoid the tariffs by moving your factories. The carrots offered by Biden followed by the stick from Trump could well lead to material progress on this.",
      "But the president's characterisation of the past half century of freer trade as having \"raped and pillaged\" the US obviously doesn't reflect the overall picture, even if it has not worked for specific regions, sectors or demographics.",
      "The US service sector thrived, dominating the world from Wall Street and Silicon Valley. US consumer brands used hyper-efficient supply chains stretching into China and East Asia to make incredible profits selling their aspirational American products everywhere.",
      "The US economy did very well indeed. The problem, simply, was that it was not evenly distributed among sectors. And what the US lacked was levels of redistribution and adaptation to spread that wealth across the country. This reflects America's political choices.",
      "The first social media trade war",
      "Now, as the US chooses to reshore its manufacturing with a sudden jolt of protectionism, other countries also have choices as to whether to support the flows of capital and trade that have made the US rich.",
      "The world's consumers have choices.",
      "It is little wonder major blue chip American companies, which have built cash machines on hyper-efficient East Asian supply chains producing cheaply and then selling to the whole world based on their attractive aspirational brands, have a big problem.",
      "Their share prices are particularly badly affected because the president has both decimated their supply chain strategies, and also risks greatly impairing their brand image amongst global consumers.",
      "Ultimately, this is the first social media trade war. The experience of Tesla's sale slump and Canada's backlash against US goods may prove contagious. That would be as powerful as any counter-tariff.",
      "These countries that bet on being the workshops for US consumers have choices over trade too. New alliances will form and intensify that seek to cut out an erratic US.",
      "The president's sensitivity to this was apparent when he threatened to increase tariffs if the EU and Canada joined forces over retaliation. This would be the nightmare scenario.",
      "In the game theory of trade wars, credibility does matter. The US has unrivalled military and technological might, which helps. But to transform the global trading system using an arbitrary formula, that throws up transparent absurdities, even without the penguins, is likely to encourage the other side to resist.",
      "This is especially the case when the rest of the world thinks that the loaded gun that the president is holding is being aimed at his own foot. The stock market fell most in the US. Inflation will go up most in the US. It is Wall Street now calculating a more-than-evens chance of a recession in the US.",
      "Perhaps there is some substance to the theory that the real objective here is to weaken the dollar and lower US borrowing costs.",
      "For now, the US is checking out of the global trade system it created. It can continue without it. But the transition is going to be very messy indeed.",

Trump has slapped a 10% tariff on all nations \u2013 including the UK \u2013 for imports into the US, and much higher rates on some countries, including China, which has responded with fresh tariffs of its own.",
      "So what's happening in Whitehall right now to try to limit the harm to the UK, perhaps by making a deal with the US, and make the most of any opportunities?",
      "Tariffs have shaken the markets - how worried should we be?",
      "China and US are at each other's throats on tariffs, and neither is backing down",
      "The PM is spending another dramatic weekend working the phones from the peace of his country pad, Chequers. So far, the other calls that could really matter, from US negotiators, have not yet resumed.",
      "Trump dangled a possible trade deal that might exempt the UK from some of the costs from tariffs during the pair's chummy White House press conference in February. There have been significant negotiations since then by a team of around 20, led out of No 10 by Michael Ellam, the Treasury and banking veteran, and the PM's business adviser Varun Chandra alongside the business secretary.",
      "Those talks included ideas about the UK watering down rules on electric vehicles, possible changes to a tax on tech companies (\"space to talk about it\", one minister says) and changes to online safety rules (\"not happening\", says a government source).",
      "But as the US government prepared for its announcements on Wednesday, talks about a deal ground to a halt. Now, after the announcement, the \"ball is in their court\", said one government source involved, waiting to hear if, in the chaos of Trump's new tariff world, the White House can find time and energy to push a deal with the UK.",
      "\"We're expecting to hear from them any moment,\" one of those involved hopes. The risk, in the visible turmoil, is that any economic agreement could become a case of: don't call us, we'll call you. We'll be asking Darren Jones, the Treasury Minister, about it when he join us in the studio tomorrow.",
      "If a deal is done, however, do not expect an all-singing all-dancing arrangement. Instead, \"it would be a basic agreement on principles \u2013 rather than a super detailed trade agreement\", says a government source, contrasting these \"quick and dirty\" moves to long-running negotiations with India (\"we're on our 15th chapter with them!\").",
      "Uncertainty around the talks, and the limited nature of what a deal could achieve in any case, means No 10 is \"not sitting here waiting for it \u2013 it's not the basket where all our eggs are\".",
      "For weeks the government told us they were preparing for all kinds of scenarios. A secret cabinet committee was considering how the UK might react if Trump's tariffs materialised.",
      "But now they are here, the actual response is\u2026 not to respond, and to spend four weeks asking businesses if they would like the government to respond later on. That is not just Whitehall dither: at this stage, there seems to be almost zero appetite among ministers to join in with the rounds of tariffs between the US, China, and perhaps the EU in coming days.",
      "One Whitehall figure working with business says \"there has not been a single voice in business, big or small, saying this is the wrong strategy\".",
      "Ministers' approach to get businesses on board, like when Sir Keir invited dozens of big wigs to No 10 the morning after Trump's tariff announcement, is in part because of the anger when the government increased National Insurance contributions. \"The really calm reaction,\" one source says, \"is because we got people into the headspace where tariffs were going to happen \u2013 one of the businesses said they were being borderline stalked, we've been trying to persuade business to trust the process.\"",
      "The government is in no rush, and has no enthusiasm to introduce its own new tariffs, and for now at least, demands on them to do so are muted. According to a minister: \"Most people have considerable numbers of jobs in their constituencies on the line \u2013 even in cabinet there might have been some question marks but there weren't this week.\"",
      "And they joke that the Lib Dems, who are calling for tariffs in retaliation, \"keep demanding a trade war but I don't think they'll lead the nation\". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who also does not want extra tariffs, will be on tomorrow's show too.",
      "But just as the government is going slow on hitting back, they are cracking heads to crack on with their existing plans faster.",
      "This isn't all about Trump. I understand the chancellor is looking at whether any of the money announced in the government's vital Spending Review can be brought forward from June. If government departments are able to finalise their deals, can that be sorted and made public as soon as possible?",
      "There are discussions too about whether it's possible to speed up the long waited-for Industrial Strategy \u2013 a plan to get investment into the UK pencilled in for June, but could it be brought forward? A decision hasn't been made but the prime minister is again, his team indicate, trying to use the jeopardy around the world as an impetus to push the government machine harder. \"We have to run quickly towards this,\" a government source says \u2013 and the chancellor is looking at it this weekend.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "You might feel, haven't I heard this before? You'd be right. Since the start of the year, the prime minister and the chancellor have both repeatedly said the government has to go faster, work harder. So why after years in opposition weren't Starmer's team ready to go with all of these changes when they got into office? For a government that promised to be radical, its plans have not always been forthcoming.",
      "You may not fancy the kind of radicalism we're seeing out of the White House, but radical it certainly is. To compete, the UK may need to be that too.",
      "It is ludicrous to imagine the PM is \"very happy\" that the UK has been hit with tariffs as Trump suggested \u2013 \"artistic licence\", a government source remarked. No British action can completely insulate our economy from disruption abroad. But the government's own actions do matter, and this could be a defining moment.",
      "While there's been no lack of trying to soften the blows for the UK, the government's hopes have been dashed already. First, ministers believed the UK could escape tariffs, then they said they were prepared in case, then disappointed when they arrived.",
      "As Sir Keir spends another weekend on the phone, and his officials wait for their phone to ring, the government doesn't know what it will be able to say next.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 23:13:02 GMT",
    "summary": "A unique study is tracking the development of hundreds of babies whose parents have also been studied since birth.",
    "story": [
      "Two-year-old Henry is completely transfixed by the iPad in front of him. Every time a smiley face appears he taps the screen - and his tap transforms the face into a cartoon of a dancing animal.",
      "It looks like a simple, repetitive game, but is actually a test of a fundamental skill that is developing in the toddler's growing brain. Henry is wearing a sensor-laden cap with wires emerging from it that are attached to a large piece of analytical machinery. While Henry plays the game, the cap is scanning his brain activity and building up a picture of how well he can control his decision making.",
      "It is a test of inhibitory control, one of the skills scientists at the University of Bristol are measuring in babies and toddlers, as part of a mission to understand how and when very young children develop abilities that enable them to focus and learn.",
      "Scientists already know these skills are critical - but they don't yet know at what point they are established in an infant brain.",
      "The development of hundreds of children - from the age of six months to five years - is being tracked as they form the key skills that will shape their academic and social abilities.",
      "But what is really special about this pioneering project is that it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment. The mothers of 300 of the children being studied are themselves part of a project that has monitored their health since they too were babies, in the 1990s.",
      "A lifetime of data is being gathered that could reveal links between the brain development of the children being studied now and the health, experiences and genetics of their parents.",
      "For a study of child development, already having all this rich information about the parents is \"completely unique in the world\", lead researcher Dr Karla Holmboe says.",
      "\"We need to know when different skills develop and we need to understand how individual children develop over time.\"",
      "Children who are struggling when they start school tend to continue to struggle, Dr Holmboe explains.",
      "\"That can even continue into adulthood. So, there's this whole period of development that we need to understand so we can support children at a much younger age.\"",
      "During the study, young participants and their parents are invited to the university psychology lab to play scientific games and have their brain activity measured. Many have MRI scans at the ages of six months, three years and five years, generating a true picture of their young, developing brains.",
      "Key to the smiley face game Henry is playing is where that face appears on the iPad screen. Just as the toddler gets used to the face repeatedly popping up on the right side of his screen, it randomly starts appearing on the other side too.",
      "\"We're seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,\" explains research assistant Carmel Brough, \"and instead look for where the smiley face is.\"",
      "This skill, explains Dr Holmboe, is critical when children start school.",
      "\"In a classroom, a child needs to be able to focus and not let their attention drift,\" she says. \"To learn new things, we need to be able to stop old habits.\"",
      "In another room, Jackson, who is also aged two, is playing a game designed to test his working memory.",
      "A research assistant encourages him to watch as she puts stickers in different pots. The toddler is then asked to recall which pots contain stickers, and which do not. The motivating factor? Jackson can keep all the stickers he finds.",
      "\"Working memory is when we need to keep a little bit of information in our head to solve a problem or do a task - like a puzzle, or even just remembering where we put something two minutes ago,\" explains Dr Holmboe. \"For children, you can imagine we need these skills when we learn maths or learn to read.",
      "\"These are what I call 'building blocks' of really important skills.\"",
      "The study will also assess language development and processing speed - a measure of how quickly children pick up new information.",
      "The Children of the 90s project is now 35 years old. Focused primarily on health, by tracking 14,500 children born between 1991 and 1992, it has revealed insights into obesity, autism and, more recently, the effect of the pandemic on mental health.",
      "The project's data has been made available to scientists around the world and has been cited in thousands of scientific papers.",
      "One study of the diets of children of the 90s provided evidence that, while a child's fussy eating is often worrying, it is unlikely to have any lasting impact on their health and development.",
      "Thanks to repeated health-screenings that have been key to the project, it also revealed that one in five young people shows signs of fatty liver disease, and one in 40 young people may have liver scarring - caused largely by obesity and alcohol consumption. This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet.",
      "And the scientific revelations keep on coming. Last month, the study revealed that children who lacked oily fish in their diets were less sociable and kind.",
      "In this latest study \u2013 of the children of the children of the 90s \u2013 scientists are looking specifically at formative abilities and brain development. They will follow each child until they start school.",
      "Emily, who was studied as a child of the 90s, is Henry's mum. Today, her young son sits on her lap as he works on one of the research team's carefully designed puzzles.",
      "\"We've both been a part of this since birth,\" Emily says. \"It wasn't a choice for me at the start - my mum signed me up. But it is now, and I just think it's fascinating.\"",
      "Helping children to thrive in the future is the aim, Dr Holmboe says. Because when children start school, she explains \"a lot of things are already set.",
      "\"This is the groundwork that will help us support children at the right time.\"",
      "Henry and Jackson finish their puzzles and games and take off their brain-scanning hats.",
      "\"My boys just love coming here,\" says Emily. \"They love all the toys - they get free snacks. So I'll continue coming just as long as they want to.",

      "Banning phones in schools should be a decision for head teachers and not \"imposed nationally by the government\", England's children's commissioner has said.",
      "Nine in ten secondary schools restrict the use of smartphones, according to a survey of 19,000 schools and colleges commissioned by Dame Rachel de Souza.",
      "Dame Rachel said children were racking up hours of screen time at home instead, and that \"the people with the real power here are the parents\".",
      "Her comments come as the general secretary of the UK's largest teaching union said a government ban on phones would \"take the pressure off schools\".",
      "Dame Rachel told BBC Radio 5Live that the vast majority schools were already restricting and banning phones, adding: \"Blanket ban if you want, but they're doing it.\"",
      "The former head teacher cast doubt on how effective a ban would be on those schools without strict policies, noting that the government can impose rules but \"unless a headteacher really believes it, they won't do it properly\".",
      "A minority of schools want a ban because they are \"worried about parents\" not supporting the decision, she said.",
      "\"That's why I'm saying parents, 'get behind your school'.\"",
      "Dame Rachel told BBC Breakfast that \"parents have to remember they are not the friends of their children\" but are \"there to protect their children [and] put the boundaries around them.\"",

      "23% of children spend more than four hours a day",
      "\"These children are not spending these hours on their phones while sat in school,\" Dame Rachel said in a new report.",
      "She said schools should educate young people about online risks - but parents and carers needed more help to manage their children's online habits and technology companies must \"take responsibility for making the online world safe\".",
      "She added that she would back any head teacher's decision to ban phones, but added: \"It should always be their choice, based on their knowledge of what's best for the children in their own classrooms, not a direction imposed nationally by the government.\"",
      "However, her report also recommended the government should \"conduct more research into the potential benefits of wider restrictions on children's use of phones, particularly social media\".",
      "The Netflix drama Adolescence has raised awareness of the type of content children can be exposed to online, such as misogyny and violence, and the risks involved.",

      "And the government has said there is already guidance on how schools can restrict the use of phones, which head teachers can decide how to put into practice.",
      "But Daniel Kebede, the general secretary of the National Education Union, said he believed a government ban on smartphones in schools would \"assist parents, but also take the pressure off schools\".",
      "\"Most schools do have rules in place, but [a ban] would create a uniformity across the school system, which would be very important and ensure that a new culture was developed in which smartphones were not in possession during school time,\" he said.",
      "He said the UK should consider following in Australia's steps with a social media ban for under-16s, adding: \"We have to view the online world, social media and mobile phones in the same prism as we view the tobacco companies.

      "In an exclusive interview, Katie Wheeler and John Meehan told the BBC that life without Genevieve was \"unbearable\".",
      "When she sent her daughter to nursery, she \"never in a million years thought that anything like this would happen\", says Ms Wheeler.",
      "The couple have described as \"horrifying\", figures obtained by the BBC that show there were almost 20,000 reports of serious childcare incidents in England's nurseries in the past five years.",
      "That is an average of about 75 \"significant events\" reported to Ofsted each week - including incidents of serious injury or significant harm. There have even been rare cases involving deaths.",
      "The latest figures for serious incidents in the year 2023-24 are 40% higher than five years previously.",
      "Ofsted - which inspects England's education providers - says the rise may, in part, be due to its increased efforts to ensure nurseries report such events.",
      "Industry body, the Early Years Alliance, says most providers prioritise safety and that safeguarding breaches are extremely rare.",
      "Ms Wheeler and Mr Meehan are now calling for more frequent Ofsted inspections and for CCTV footage to be checked by inspectors.",
      "Genevieve had been at the now-closed Tiny Toes nursery in Stockport, Greater Manchester, for a week when she died.",
      "CCTV footage showed her struggling and coughing, but nursery worker Kate Roughley did not check on her properly until she was \"unresponsive and blue\", her trial heard. Roughley received a 14-year prison sentence for manslaughter in May last year.",
      "\"I couldn't understand how a baby of this age could go to sleep for a nap in the afternoon and then not wake up,\" Ms Wheeler told us.",
      "\"I completely lost who I was, that night in hospital, holding her.\"",
      "Nurseries made more than 4,200 reports of serious childcare incidents in 2023-24, the BBC has found, compared with 3,021 in 2019-20 - according to Ofsted figures, obtained through a Freedom of Information request.",
      "Ofsted - which regulates more than 27,000 non-domestic childcare settings in England - says these were reports it had assessed as urgent.",
      "Incidents could range from injuries or illnesses, to serious accidents and deaths. They also include events affecting nursery premises, such as fires or floods.",
      "Ofsted's broad criteria for reporting can mean nursery workers \"err on the side of caution\", the Early Years Alliance says - meaning investigations often find no safeguarding breach has, in fact, occurred.",
      "But a childcare expert says the rise in the number of reports highlights a \"dire situation\".",
      "\"Standards [of care] are so low that the government surely has an obligation to improve them,\" says Helen Penn, professor of early childhood from the University of East London.",
      "Parents often rely on Ofsted's inspections and subsequent ratings to help them choose the best childcare setting.",
      "Full inspections usually happen every six years, but the regulator can inspect more often if a nursery is graded as inadequate or requiring improvement - or if concerns are raised.",
      "Schools rated good or outstanding are usually inspected every four years - and more frequently if graded lower.",
      "More than 1,500 nursery inspections had been brought forward after receiving reports of serious childcare incidents - Ofsted told us.",
      "But a former Ofsted inspector told us the regulator is not conducting enough inspections to identify poor practice and protect children.",
      "The ex-inspector, who did not want to be named, says inspections are a \"tick box exercise\" which are \"very easy to manipulate\".",
      "\"As long as they can say: 'We've asked all these questions, what more can we do?' But you do that once every so many years - how is that safeguarding the children?\" she says.",

      "Details of organisations offering support with child bereavement are available at BBC Action Line",
      "The BBC has spoken to more than 20 former and current nursery workers, all from different premises across England, who said they had witnessed poor care.",
      "Many said frequent short-staffing was a factor in children being put at risk - and that Ofsted inspectors were not always able to spot this.",
      "Until 2015, inspectors would arrive at nurseries unannounced - but only a third of inspections are now carried out this way. Most nurseries are informed the day before.",
      "The notice period is used by some nurseries to deliberately mislead inspectors, some nursery workers told us. Managers ask friends or family to attend, they say, to make a nursery appear fully staffed.",
      "One former worker said 15 babies had been left sleeping in a room with only a baby monitor and no staff members to look after them. But when Ofsted announced an inspection, managers called in staff from other locations.",
      "The ex-Ofsted inspector says she witnessed workers man-handling children during inspections. \"If you can do that in front of someone, what are you planning on doing if nobody is watching?\" she adds.",
      "Misleading inspections is an \"appalling practice\", says Yvette Stanley, Ofsted's Head of Early Years and Social Care - adding that inspectors have to rely on the \"integrity of providers\".",
      "As police reviewed nursery CCTV as part of their investigation into Genevieve's death, it revealed a second staff member had also been causing harm to children.",
      "Rebecca Gregory was jailed for three years last September after being convicted of the wilful neglect and ill-treatment of children, including threatening and pushing babies younger than one.",
      "Ofsted inspectors do not routinely check CCTV footage - and the regulator says it cannot mandate CCTV use in nurseries.",
      "There is no government guidance on checking footage during inspections and it does not have the resources to do this, it adds.",
      "The former owners of Tiny Toes in Stockport say they cannot comment because of an ongoing investigation by Stockport Council.",
      "Local authorities are responsible for investigating any safeguarding concerns at nurseries.",
      "In light of our findings from Ofsted about a broad range of incidents, we asked councils across England about the specific number of times harm had been caused to children by nursery workers.",
      "Seventy-two out of more than 150 councils responded to Freedom of Information requests with figures indicating there had been 5,795 reports or allegations of children being harmed by nursery workers, over a five-year period between 2019 and 2024.",
      "There were like-for-like figures from 36 councils for both that period and the five years up to 2015, when Ofsted stopped routine no-notice inspections.",
      "Reports of harm to young children almost tripled over that time - from 1,303 between 2010-15, to 3,342 between 2019-24. These figures may include cases where the incident was either accidental or unproven.",
      "Standards of care are low and if something does not change there will be \"more accidents, more harm to babies, more unhappy parents and children,\" says early childhood professor Helen Penn.",
      "Ofsted says it is giving \"conspicuous care and monitoring\" to reports of harm to children.",
      "More frequent inspections may be a solution, says Ofsted's Yvette Stanley, but she says the regulator does not currently have the resources available to do this.",
      "\"We think we do enough no-notice inspections to reassure ourselves in the cases where the data is worrying,\" she adds.",
      "The Early Years Alliance added that children's safety should \"never be compromised\" and it welcomed any action which strengthens this.",
      "The Department for Education (DfE) has said it will introduce stronger safeguarding measures in early years settings in September, including \"enhanced recruitment practices\" intended to prevent unsuitable people from working with children.",
      "A spokesperson said the department will \"continue to closely monitor whether any further changes to safeguarding requirements are needed in early years to keep children as safe as possible\"."

      "Familiarity was crucial, so before filming began, the cast were sent on a three-week military bootcamp.",
      "They lived together, learning military jargon and gun safety and were pushed beyond their limits - all of which brought them closer together.",
      "First off though, they agreed to shave each other's heads to look the part, boosting trust and familiarity.",
      "\"We shaved our heads on day one, and got tattoos at the end of the process, so it bookended the experience,\" Poulter tells the BBC.",
      "The actor, who recently appeared in The Bear and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, plays Captain Eric, who was part of a group of US soldiers and Iraqi scouts on a surveillance mission.",
      "We see how it goes wrong, with devastating consequences.",
      "Heartstopper star Connor plays newcomer Tommy, hitting home how young the soldiers were - he's just turned 21, the same age Tommy was at the time.",
      "The actor says the decision to get a shared tattoo with his castmates after filming wrapped was a \"no-brainer\". The casts of The Avengers and The Lord of the Rings did the same thing after their final films.",
      "Warfare's actors decided their tattoo would say \"Call On Me\", to reflect their brotherhood, while referencing Erik Prydz's 2004 dance hit, which kicks the film off.",
      "The cast features some other big names, including Reservation Dogs' D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Sh\u014dgun's Cosmo Jarvis, Stranger Things and the forthcoming Beatles biopic's Joseph Quinn, and Riverdale's Charles Melton.",
      "\"It was really formative for me,\" Connor says about his time  on the film. \"I've made friends I really do believe I will know for a long time.",
      "\"We all wanted to commemorate it - we are so proud of the work we've done together.\"",
      "The movie is based entirely on a real-life mission that took place during the Iraq war, and is built on the memories of the US soldiers who were there.",
      "The group was embedded in the home of an ordinary Iraqi family, who we briefly see in the film, in Ramadi - an area controlled by Al-Qaeda forces.",
      "The military's goal had been to slip into and observe the area under the cover of darkness, to ensure the safe passage of ground forces there the next day.",
      "What they didn't know what that they were next door to an insurgent house, making them the target of an attack.",
      "Shot in real-time, Warfare has no music or flashbacks, so there's no let-up for the audience. You're dropped into the thick of the action for the whole film.",
      "The soldiers in command have to make split-second decisions amid the pain and chaos, with the Iraqi family caught in the crossfire.",
      "Oscar nominee Garland, whose back catalogue includes the 28 Days film franchise and Ex Machina, got the idea for Warfare when he was making last year's film Civil War.",
      "He was working on the battle scenes with Hollywood stunt man and gunfight co-ordinator Ray Mendoza.",
      "\"During the edit process of Civil War, I was able to really focus on some of the work Ray had done, and how sophisticated and how nuanced it was,\" Garland recalls.",
      "They got chatting about Mendoza's previous life as a US Navy Seal, and about the Ramadi operation, where he was its communications officer.",
      "Mendoza said he'd always wanted to make a film about that mission.",
      "The veteran had a very big reason for wanting to recreate what happened that day - to help replace the lost memories of his colleague Elliott Miller.",
      "Miller, a former Navy Seal, was so badly injured in Ramadi that he suffered traumatic brain injury and memory loss, and had to have a leg amputated.",
      "During the mission, Mendoza carried the unconscious soldier to the rescue tank that ultimately saved his life.",
      "\"Elliott doesn't remember it, and when he woke up, he had a lot of questions,\" Mendoza says.",
      "\"No matter how many maps we drew, or how many times we wrote it out - without that core memory, I think he's had a hard time.",
      "\"It just raised more questions than answers. So I wanted to recreate this one.\"",
      "So Garland and Mendoza decided to make Warfare together, sharing writing and directing credits, and dedicating the film to Miller.",
      "The crucial question is whether seeing the film helped Miller piece things together.",
      "\"It did, yeah - he was a sponge,\" Mendoza says.",
      "\"We walked him through it - he had a lot of questions, he's got kids that have questions.",
      "\"It's now a film memory, but it's as close as he's gonna have \u2013 he's super grateful.\"",
      "Miller was played by Jarvis, who calls him \"a funny guy... he's great - a living embodiment of perseverance\".",
      "It was a \"unique situation to be in when you're entrusted with portraying somebody that's sitting right across from you\", Jarvis said, about having the person he was playing actually on set.",
      "\"But because he didn't remember [what happened], a lot of my references had to come from his colleagues.\"",
      "The soldiers' casting has caused some excitement online, with some publications breathily calling the actors \"all of the internet's boyfriends\" and \"red hot rising stars\".",
      "Garland arches an eyebrow at this, and Mendoza jumps in to talk about why those actors were chosen.",
      "\"I've said this to them, so I'm not trying to offend them, but we weren't looking for the best actors. They're all great actors. We were looking for the right actors,\" he says.",
      "\"So what that means is their willingness to push their bodies past a comfort level that they're maybe not used to. 'You're gonna be exhausted. You're gonna be required to rely on other people. It's not about you, it's about the team'.",
      "\"And the ones that jump at that opportunity, you're like, 'Yep, that's the attitude that we need'.\"",
      "Collating and cross-checking the soldiers' memories was a big job, largely undertaken by Garland.",
      "\"I think there's an inherent value in attempting to be honest and truthful about something as serious and significant as war,\" he says.",
      "He shot the film in a studio in a suburb north of London, on a former World War Two airfield, making it in real-time to recreate \"a real incident of combat... as honestly, forensically and accurately as possible\".",
      "Not surprisingly, while sharing credits with Garland, former US Navy Seal Mendoza ran the actors' bootcamp.",
      "He was played by Woon-A-Tai, who calls him \"a brilliant instructor who instilled a lot of confidence in us\", while also making gun safety a top priority.",
      "The actor was also fascinated by the narrative not being \"dramatised or Hollywoodised\".",
      "\"To see these guys not obey orders - and do what they needed to save their platoon was interesting to me,\" he says, talking about the soldiers' evacuation process.",
      "Mendoza thinks the film may also help veterans who are struggling to express what warfare can be like.",
      "\"Some of these things are harder to explain in words,\" he says. \"So art imagery is how I'm able to communicate that.\"",
      "Connor echoes this, saying: \"A lot of these men are very much less inclined to talk about themselves in these situations, whether it be to be due to humility, or a difficulty in really articulating it.",
      "\"A lot of them just don't really enjoy talking about their involvement.\"",
      "The film has been called \"the most harrowing \u2013 and honest \u2013 depiction of modern combat ever made\" by the Telegraph, while the New Yorker said it offers a \"hyperrealist rebuke of the American war movie\".",
      "The Guardian said the \"film-makers' message gets lost in the deafening blizzard of battle\", while Empire added: \"It may well be cinema's most effective, purest anti-war film: there is no sentimentality, no hand-wringing, but most significantly not a second of it makes war look cool, or attractive.\"",

      "The unnamed woman sued the star, whose real name is DeAndre Cortez Way, in 2021, saying he regularly raped her and beat her and sometimes kept her as a prisoner after she was hired as his assistant.",
      "Way had denied abusing her and said their relationship was consensual - but a jury in a civil trial found him liable for sexual battery, assault and gender violence.",
      "The 34-year-old smiled calmly as the verdict was read on Thursday, according to the Courthouse News Service.",
      "Speaking outside the court, he maintained his innocence and said he was \"committed to filing an appeal and fighting for the truth to be revealed\".",

      "His commercial peak came in 2010, when Forbes magazine said he earned $7m (\u00a35.3m), since when he has diversified into record production and video game development.",
      "According to court documents, the woman was hired as an assistant in 2018 and started a romantic relationship shortly afterwards.",
      "The abuse soon followed, she said. The lawsuit accused him of punching and raping her several times.",
      "During her testimony, she said she had lost almost half of her body weight during their time together, dropping to almost 6 stone (39kg), before \"I managed to get away from him\".",
      "\"I didn't even feel human any more,\" she told the court. \"I felt like an animal.\"",
      "She said she had stayed in the relationship because Way threatened to hurt her or her family, and told her he would post a sexually explicit video to the internet if she left.",
      "Text messages shown in court painted a complicated picture of their relationship.",
      "Way would ask her to perform tasks typical of an assistant, including making travel arrangements or setting up computer equipment.",
      "But at other times, he would text her messages like \"I hope u die slow\", \"I hope you catch corona\" and \"I should have killed your ass\", the jury heard.",
      "In other messages highlighted during the trial, the woman texted Way: \"You body slammed me on my head and choked me\", and \"I should have just let you hit me.\"",

      "However, he would apologise, sending messages such as: \"Babe come back let's talk seriously\" and \"Are u ok? I'm sorry I love u please call.\"",
      "During the trial, Way denied that his accuser had been an employee. Instead, he claimed, he had offered her a place to stay in exchange for which she would roll marijuana for him.",
      "During closing arguments, Way's attorney Rickey Ivie maintained that the woman had invented her story and was \"motivated by jealousy, revenge and financial gain\".",
      "Although Way was found liable for sexual assault, he was cleared on claims of false imprisonment and constructive dismissal.",
      "It is not the first time that the rapper has faced such allegations.",
      "In 2023, he was ordered to pay ex-girlfriend Kayla Myers $471,900 (\u00a3360,000) stemming from an assault and kidnapping lawsuit she filed in 2020."

      "Speaking on BBC 6 Music, frontman Jarvis Cocker said the band had been tempted back into the studio by the overwhelming response to their 2023 reunion tour.",
      "\"We did play one new song towards the end of the tour, and nobody threw things at us, or left to go to the bar,\" he said. \"So we just thought we'd carry on and see what we could conjure up.\"",
      "The Sheffield band were one of the biggest acts of the 1990s Britpop era - although their music never quite fit into the backward-looking musical revisionism of that movement - with songs like Babies, Disco 2000 and Common People.",
      "Formed in Sheffield in 1978, they sold more than 10 million records after taking a (very) long road to success.",
      "After 2001's We Love Life, the band went on a decade-long hiatus. They reformed in 2011 for a number of festival dates, including a surprise performance Glastonbury, and reunited again in 2023.",
      "The new single was inspired by the infamous Stone Roses concert at Spike Island, Widnes, in 1990 - a show that has been variously described as a milestone for British indie music, and a disappointing shambles with dodgy sound.",
      "Pulp guitarist Mark Webber told 6 Music's Lauren Laverne the show had been \"a slight anticlimax, to be honest\".",
      "\"I think everyone felt that way,\" he said. \"There was a lot of anticipation but it didn't sound very good, it was very windy and the vibe wasn't there.\"",
      "Cocker said he hadn't been at the show, but had written the lyrics after speaking to various attendees, including musician Jason Buckle, from the band All Seeing I, who co-wrote Pulp's single.",
      "\"All he could remember was a DJ who between every song said, 'Spike Island come alive, Spike Island come alive',\" he said.",

      "The inspiration for that track was \"a girl that I was speaking to at The Leadmill in Sheffield one night,\" he recalled.",
      "\"She said all that she could remember were people going round saying, 'Is everyone sorted for E's and whizz?'. So that phrase stuck in my mind.\"",
      "More will be released on 6 June, and is dedicated to Pulp's former bassist Steve Mackey, who died in 2023, at the age of 56.",
      "Cocker said that recording without the musician was \"weird at first\" but that there were \"two songs on the record which date from when Steve was around\", which made him feel part of the project.",
      "\"It was not the nicest thing,\" the singer continued, \"but people who you're close to, you never forget them, and you can do things to remember them by\".",
      "The album was recorded over three weeks in 2024, and Cocker said there were \"no over-riding themes, except feelings, maybe, which sounds very wafty and not very precise\".",
      "He said the absence of an overarching idea had given the band a sense of freedom, compared to more conceptual Pulp albums such as This Is Hardcore.",
      "\"We [recorded] it quite quickly, and we were trying to not think about it too much, because that's what kind of made the last couple of Pulp albums a bit of a pain,\" he said.",
      "\"It was mainly my fault,\" he added, \"because I'd never got the lyrics together, so I was always changing them and messing around.",
      "\"This time, they were all written before we went into the studio, and I realised it was a lot less stressful.",
      "\"You know, I would always be a bit stressed in the studio, because I knew once the music was done, then I had to write the words. I don't know why I put myself through that,\" he said.",

      "\"No AI was involved during the process.\"",
      "However, he did employ artificial intelligence to create the video for Spike Island, which animates the infamous \"cardboard cut-out\" figures who appear on the cover of Pulp's biggest album, Different Class.",
      "\"All the moving images featured in the video are the result of me feeding in a still image and then typing in a 'prompt' such as: 'The black & white figure remains still whilst the bus in the background drives off', which led to [a] sequence where the coach weirdly slides towards the cut-out of me,\" said Cocker.",
      "\"The weekend I began work on the video was a strange time: I went out of the house and kept expecting weird transformations of the surrounding environment due to the images the computer had been generating.",

    "summary": "A CMS committee report warns of the need to safeguard \"culturally distinct British productions\".",
    "story": [
      "A share of the revenue streaming services make from subscription fees should be paid into a fund to support British high-end TV production, an influential group of MPs has said.",
      "In a new report, the Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) committee urged the government to improve support measures for producers while safeguarding the creation of distinctly British content.",
      "It follows an inquiry into the UK TV and film industry which examined the effects of the rise of streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon and Apple TV.",
      "The report noted how \"vital\" dramas such as Adolescence are to the country's \"identity, national conversations and talent pipeline\", which they say is now \"under threat\".",
      "It is \"time for streamers to put their money where their mouth is\", the report read, suggesting that streaming companies should pay \"5% of their UK subscriber revenue into a cultural fund to help finance drama with a specific interest to British audiences\".",
      "Chair of the CMS committee, MP Dame Caroline Dinenage, noted how recent \"big box-office blockbusters made in Britain have showcased the UK's world-class film and high-end television industry like never before\".",
      "\"But the boom in inward investment of recent years now risks crowding out our many talented independent British producers,\" she said.",
      "She added: \"While streamers like Netflix and Amazon have proved a valuable addition for the industry and economy, unless the government urgently intervenes to rebalance the playing field, for every Adolescence adding to the national conversation, there will be countless distinctly British stories that never make it to our screens.\"",
      "Adolescence, created by Jack Thorne and Stephen Graham, tells the story of a 13-year-old boy who is charged with killing a female classmate.",
      "This week, it became fourth most popular English-language series in Netflix's history with 114 million views.",
      "A Netflix spokeswoman said: \"The UK is Netflix's biggest production hub outside of North America - and we want it to stay that way.",
      "\"But in an increasingly competitive global market, it's key to create a business environment that incentivises rather than penalises investment, risk taking and success. Levies diminish competitiveness and penalise audiences who ultimately bear the increased costs.\"",
      "The Association for Commercial Broadcasters and On-Demand Services (COBA) said a levy risks damaging streamers' investment in the UK.",
      "Coba executive director Adam Minns said: \"Especially in this economic climate, a levy risks impacting existing content budgets for UK shows, jobs, and growth, along with raising costs for businesses.",
      "\"Ironically, it could actually damage public service broadcaster dramas by reducing co-production budgets at streamers.\"",
      "He added pressure on domestic production stemmed from the real terms decline in the TV licence fee.",
      "A BBC spokesman said the corporation \"continues to invest\" in British content but faced \"significant financial challenges due to pressure on the licence fee and rising industry costs\".",
      "\"It is therefore integral that the BBC and the wider UK creative industries have the support in place to drive growth in the creative economy and support homegrown content and storytelling.\"",
      "The report released on Thursday noted how last year there was a 27% decrease in the number of domestic high-end TV productions made in the UK and a 25% fall in spend.",
      "The calls for greater help come after Wolf Hall director Peter Kosminsky told BBC News last month that the industry was in crisis, and that public service broadcasters including the BBC and ITV could no longer afford to make high-end British drama.",
      "Fair levy or unfair tariff?",
      "The arrival of the streamers into the UK market \"drove up the price of everything\", Kosminsky told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday, to the point where the public service broadcasters \"couldn't afford to make their programs anymore, so we need a new pot of money.\"",
      "He underlined how 17 other countries in Europe have imposed a similar levy \"so that public service broadcasters can stay in the game.\"",
      "Speaking on the same programme, former BBC One controller Peter Fincham replied saying he did not agree.",
      "\"I think this sounds to me a little bit like a tariff - to use a more fashionable word - and indeed a form of protectionism.\"",
      "A spokeswoman for the Department of Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) said: \"We acknowledge the challenges facing our brilliant film and TV industry and are working with it through our industrial strategy to consider what more needs to be done to unlock growth and develop the skills pipeline.",
      "\"We thank the committee for its report which we will respond to in due course.\"",
      "'Support freelancers'",
      "The report also noted while the introduction of tax breaks for independent British films, and for film and TV studios in England may have helped, it was not a \"silver bullet\" for solving many of the issues facing British producers.",
      "As well as providing greater support and resources for UK TV production workforces, it also suggested that lawmakers should consider cutting VAT on cinema tickets as well as doing more to meet the challenges posed by AI.",
      "Commenting on the report, Paul W Fleming, general secretary of Equity, which represents British performers, said the government should \"heed the call\" for the licensing of creative works in all cases where they are used to train artificial intelligence models.",
      "\"AI is being built illegally by stealing Equity members' life's works,\" he said.",
      "Big tech firms \"must be held to account\", he added, \"brought to the table and made to pay creators what they owe.\"",
      "The cross-party committee recommended the government and British Film Institute (BFI) should launch a national awareness campaign, highlighting the employment opportunities offered by film and high-end TV, and \"the range of skills the industry requires\".",
      "It stressed how the industry \"benefits hugely from the flexibility afforded by a predominantly freelance workforce\" and therefore more should be done to \"support freelancers when they are out of work\"; such as the introduction of a minimum hourly wage or guaranteed basic income.",
      "Head of industry union Bectu, Philippa Childs, said: \"We welcome this timely and incisive report from the committee which identifies many of the urgent challenges currently facing the industry and its workforce.\"",
      "She added: \"It's essential that the industry does not become too skewed towards large streamers, which risks the homogenisation of content and the loss of much of the UK's unique and distinctive output.\"",

    "summary": "The unsettling tech-driven anthology is back for a seventh series and there's no shortage of material.",
    "story": [
      "It's only been a couple of years since the last series of Charlie Brooker's dystopian Netflix show Black Mirror landed. But we're now living in an unpredictable world and a lot can happen in a short space of time.",
      "Renowned for its often savvy and disturbing takes on humanity and our relationship with technology, Black Mirror is back for a seventh series at a time when the pace of change in both politics and tech has left many of us - including lawmakers - struggling to keep up.",
      "In 2011, when the first episode aired, Siri was the new kid on the block and the iPhone 4S had just been launched. Now we have Meta AI embedded in WhatsApp and we're on series 10 of the Apple watch.",
      "Since then, Black Mirror has taken us from creepy memory devices, phone implants and robotic bees to actors-turned-werewolves. And everything in between.",
      "Brooker is in buoyant mood as, he tells the BBC there appears to be little danger of him running out of ideas anytime soon, when asked if Black Mirror could go on forever.",
      "\"Hopefully [it will run and run]. Selfishly, it's a fun job,\" he says. \"Technology is developing in the real world very quickly.",
      "\"That means there are more sources of inspiration, and... the viewer is experiencing more [technological] things in their everyday life.",
      "\"We can do stories that I wouldn't have thought of 10 years ago, and also, you don't need to explain some of the concepts to people because they've got it in their phone.\"",
      "The Crown and Deadpool & Wolverine actor Emma Corrin, who stars in one of this season's episodes, adds: \"It's much closer to home. People have access to stuff like AI which is terrifying so then it's more confronting and serves as a better warning.\"",
      "Brooker jokes: \"So you're saying it should go on forever?\"",
      "\"Yes, it should go on forever,\" Corrin concurs.",
      "Brooker adds: \"I'll find out when it stops if I drop dead or people stop watching.\"",
      "Corrin appears in an episode titled Hotel Reverie, alongside Issa Rae. The pair both play A-listers appearing in a remake of a vintage Hollywood classic. With a twist, of course.",
      "Corrin plays screen siren Dorothy Chambers, and reflects: \"I really enjoyed playing a 1940s movie star.",
      "\"I just like the voice and the mannerisms and the way they hold themselves, and the style of acting is so ridiculous, larger than life and tongue in cheek, and yet packed with emotion at the same time.\"",
      "Without giving too much away, AI - the subject of much debate in the creative industries - rears its head in the storyline.",
      "Corrin says they don't \"feel great\" about its potential impact on their profession.",
      "\"Obviously, I think it's scary, but it's also a massive conversation, right? There are aspects of it that are terrifying to me as an artist. I love the creative process. I love that this art is born out of being in a room with people and things coming from the depths of someone's human experience or imagination. And I really don't think we'll lose that, or I hope not.",
      "New Black Mirror series features Kent hot spots",
      "New Black Mirror series features Kent hot spots",
      "\"And I think there are also aspects of AI I probably don't understand, and that could be used as tools for good. It's about everyone being able to understand them and to use them correctly, and them being in the right hands.\"",
      "Brooker agrees: \"Quite rightly, when Andy Serkis played Gollum [in the Lord of the Rings trilogy], everyone's amazed by that, but what you're amazed by is the human, you're seeing a human performance shining through.",
      "\"I can totally see the value of AI as a tool for creative people. The point at which it worries me is if you remove the people bit from that equation, or you're just hoovering up their work and regurgitating it, and they're not being paid.\"",
      "Brooker also returns to another favourite tech theme, which he's used as a jumping off point for several Black Mirror episodes over the previous six series. The world of gaming.",
      "Remember the interactive standalone Black Mirror film Bandersnatch, where Asim Chaudhry and Will Poulter played a games company boss and a genius developer? The pair are now reprising their roles from the 2018 movie in a new series seven episode called Plaything.",
      "Scottish actor Lewis Gribben, who is soon to star in the highly anticipated TV series Blade Runner 2099, plays 1990s games journalist and loner Cameron, who becomes obsessed with one particular game featuring little pixel creatures. (Brooker himself was a games journalist back in the day.)",
      "Former Doctor Who Peter Capaldi also turns in a brilliantly disturbing performance as an older Cameron.",
      "Although a big Black Mirror fan, Gribben hadn't seen Bandersnatch but says that coming to Plaything fresh actually aided his performance.",
      "\"I think it made it easier for me... but I was just intimidated. I was like 'Oh my god, it's Will Poulter who I've watched since I was seven years old acting in Son of Rambow. And Asim Chowdhury from People Just Do Nothing!\"",
      "Gribben tells the BBC he's a bit of a gamer himself but has more of a handle on it than his Black Mirror character.",
      "\"I'm playing the new Assassin's Creed Shadows at the minute,\" he says. \"When you have a day off... I can spend a solid 10 hours [on it]. But I like to think most people game in moderation or just have bingeing game sessions. It's more like a relaxation thing.\"",
      "Josh Finan, who has starred in Baby Reindeer, The Responder and recently played Gerry Adams in Say Nothing, plays an acquaintance of Cameron who becomes unwittingly embroiled in his companion's distorted sense of reality.",
      "The pair will both star in the highly anticipated Amazon mini-series, Blade Runner 2099. Expected to drop later this year, the action takes place 50 years after 2017's Blade Runner 2049, a movie that also analyses the relationship between humans and AI.",
      "Finan isn't too worried about being replaced by robots though.",
      "\"I'm very optimistic. I don't think actors are going anywhere. Maybe I'm being naive [but] I don't think there's any danger of being replaced. What we do is too special.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 08 Apr 2025 12:01:43 GMT",
    "summary": "The artist opens a major exhibition in Paris, but the 87-year-old feared he wouldn\u2019t make it.",
    "story": [
      "It doesn't take long to make David Hockney laugh.",
      "At nearly 88 years old, he is frail but still very dapper in his beige, red and black houndstooth suit with a white silk handkerchief poking out of the pocket, and trademark round yellow glasses perched on his nose.",
      "Britain's most popular artist chuckles a lot, his throaty laugh betraying his many years of smoking.",
      "But, he tells me, as a young student from Bradford at the Royal College of Art in London in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the other students laughed at him.",
      "\"People would mock my accent,\" he says. But it didn't faze him. Hockney knew his worth even then. \"I'd look at their artworks and I'd think, well, if I drew like that, I'd keep my mouth shut.\"",
      "What would the young boy growing up in Bradford think about the life he'd go on to have and the work he'd create?",
      "\"He'd have thought it was pretty daft.\"",
      "For decades, Hockney has been among the world's greatest living artists, and he is now opening his biggest ever show.",
      "As we sit together in a vast gallery at the Louis Vuitton Foundation, a stunning museum designed in reflective glass on the edge of the Bois de Boulogne in Paris, I ask him what he thinks of the exhibition.",
      "He says it's his best ever, and bursts into laughter again.",
      "It's an expression of pure delight at the 11 rooms filled across four floors with his art - and at being alive to see it. \"I'm just laughing, I mean we made it!\"",
      "Two years ago, when they started planning the exhibition, \"I just thought I probably wouldn't be here\", he says. \"I'm still a smoker, a happy smoker fed up of bossy people telling you what to do... but I didn't know.\"",
      "Hockney is sporting a badge that says \"End Bossiness Soon\" in a gallery dedicated to his love of spring. During the pandemic in 2020, Hockney, who was living in Normandy, used his iPad to paint the trees and flowers blooming as spring arrived.",
      "Those 220 iPad works adorn this gallery, floor to ceiling, the walls bursting with blossom and pure joy, made at a time when the world wasn't feeling very hopeful.",
      "Visitors to the show are greeted at the entrance by Hockney's message from that time: \"Do remember they can't cancel the spring.\"",
      "Hockney has been in poor health. He now has two full-time carers, who have accompanied him to Paris from London, where he now lives. Portraits of both, sitting in their dark blue nurses' uniforms, are the most recent works in the exhibition, made earlier this year.",
      "A self-portrait of Hockney, painting and smoking a cigarette (his two great loves) is also very new.",
      "He still paints for four to six hours every day, he tells me.",
      "He believes you can't judge a painter until their last work is done - but looking at his own work gathered together in Paris, \"I can see what I was always trying to do, really\".",
      "And he promises that \"anybody who has just a little visual sensibility will really enjoy this show\".",
      "His great-nephew Richard Hockney, who has regularly sat for him for 28 years, since he was four years old, including for this exhibition, tells me everyone was determined the artist would make it to Paris.",
      "The night before, Hockney got into a car with his dachshund Tess to be driven across the Channel. And on the morning before they left, they were playing him variations of the jazz classic April in Paris.",
      "Having arrived, \"he is glowing\", Richard says. \"I think this will keep him going for a long, long time, to be honest.\"",
      "And with spring unfolding in the French capital, it's entirely appropriate that the artist known for chronicling spring would open his exhibition, David Hockney 25, now.",
      "This is a man who would fly back from his home in Los Angeles when he heard the hawthorn had begun to blossom in his native Yorkshire, just so he could paint the dazzling spectacle.",
      "Some of his earliest works, including probably his most famous, A Bigger Splash, are also on show in Paris.",
      "That painting, capturing the moment of a swimmer diving into a Santa Monica pool, is on the wall next to Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), the south of France pool painting that broke records when it sold at auction in 2018 for \u00a370m.",
      "Next to those are Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy, another of Hockney's most recognisable works, which depicts his good friend Celia Birtwell and her husband Ossie Clark, with their white cat on his knee.  Seeing them brought together in one room is spectacular.",
      "But the show's main focus is the last 25 years because \"it's 2025\", he says. \"People think it's miserable, but in 1925 they'd had the First World War.\"",
      "It's a visual feast, full of the bright colours and optimism for which Hockney has become known.",
      "\"I've always had it. I've always thought it was an absurd world.\"",
      "A world to laugh at, to look at closely, as Hockney does, and to paint vibrantly.",
      "Some of the iPad paintings are huge. He's \"amazed they could be blown up so big\" when they were created on something so small.",
      "One room is almost pitch dark to show off paintings he did of the Moon, made possible by advances in iPad technology.",
      "There's also a floor devoted to his portraits (about 60), including a 2022 painting of singer Harry Styles in a striped cardigan with a set of pearls around his neck.",
      "But the rest are the friends and family Hockney knows well - Birtwell, her children and grandchildren, the show's curator Sir Norman Rosenthal wearing full regalia, Hockney's partner JP, sometimes with Tess the dog - and two of Richard.",
      "Even though they're related, when he's having a portrait done \"it's very surreal looking at him and then realising you're being painted by David Hockney\", he tells me. \"You know he's always going to create a masterpiece.\"",
      "His great uncle chooses to paint people he loves because \"he sees the truer representation of yourself than you do\". In one of the portraits, Richard is grinning, in a green and white striped T-shirt.",
      "Because Hockney likes Richard's cheeky grin, \"he will sit there and grin at me because he knows it's going to make me grin... after six hours, it aches a bit\".",
      "King Charles went to visit Hockney at home in London before he travelled. \"He's a very nice man, thoughtful, I thought,\" the artist says. \"He does watercolours himself.\"",
      "But he doesn't fancy painting the King. \"The problem there is the majesty, isn't it really? I would find that a bit difficult, I think.\"",
      "He does, though, have a work on the go, a new painting of his great-nephew.",
      "Richard tells me Hockney \"says he's still got a lot of work to do, which is good\", adding: \"As long as that's in his head, then he'll keep going.\"",
      "The artist says he'll finish his painting of his great nephew and then \"I will paint somebody else. And I just carry on.\"",
      "Watch Katie Razzall's full interview - David Hockney: A Life in Art - on BBC iPlayer.",
      "David Hockney 25 is at the Fondation Louis Vuitton, Paris, from 9 April until 31 August."

      "It looks like a simple, repetitive game, but is actually a test of a fundamental skill that is developing in the toddler's growing brain. Henry is wearing a sensor-laden cap with wires emerging from it that are attached to a large piece of analytical machinery. While Henry plays the game, the cap is scanning his brain activity and building up a picture of how well he can control his decision making.",
      "It is a test of inhibitory control, one of the skills scientists at the University of Bristol are measuring in babies and toddlers, as part of a mission to understand how and when very young children develop abilities that enable them to focus and learn.",
      "Scientists already know these skills are critical - but they don't yet know at what point they are established in an infant brain.",
      "The development of hundreds of children - from the age of six months to five years - is being tracked as they form the key skills that will shape their academic and social abilities.",
      "But what is really special about this pioneering project is that it is a human experiment within another decades-long human experiment. The mothers of 300 of the children being studied are themselves part of a project that has monitored their health since they too were babies, in the 1990s.",
      "A lifetime of data is being gathered that could reveal links between the brain development of the children being studied now and the health, experiences and genetics of their parents.",
      "For a study of child development, already having all this rich information about the parents is \"completely unique in the world\", lead researcher Dr Karla Holmboe says.",
      "\"We need to know when different skills develop and we need to understand how individual children develop over time.\"",
      "Children who are struggling when they start school tend to continue to struggle, Dr Holmboe explains.",
      "\"That can even continue into adulthood. So, there's this whole period of development that we need to understand so we can support children at a much younger age.\"",
      "During the study, young participants and their parents are invited to the university psychology lab to play scientific games and have their brain activity measured. Many have MRI scans at the ages of six months, three years and five years, generating a true picture of their young, developing brains.",
      "Key to the smiley face game Henry is playing is where that face appears on the iPad screen. Just as the toddler gets used to the face repeatedly popping up on the right side of his screen, it randomly starts appearing on the other side too.",
      "\"We're seeing if Henry can resist the urge to just keep tapping on the right,\" explains research assistant Carmel Brough, \"and instead look for where the smiley face is.\"",
      "This skill, explains Dr Holmboe, is critical when children start school.",
      "\"In a classroom, a child needs to be able to focus and not let their attention drift,\" she says. \"To learn new things, we need to be able to stop old habits.\"",
      "In another room, Jackson, who is also aged two, is playing a game designed to test his working memory.",
      "A research assistant encourages him to watch as she puts stickers in different pots. The toddler is then asked to recall which pots contain stickers, and which do not. The motivating factor? Jackson can keep all the stickers he finds.",
      "\"Working memory is when we need to keep a little bit of information in our head to solve a problem or do a task - like a puzzle, or even just remembering where we put something two minutes ago,\" explains Dr Holmboe. \"For children, you can imagine we need these skills when we learn maths or learn to read.",

      "The project's data has been made available to scientists around the world and has been cited in thousands of scientific papers.",
      "One study of the diets of children of the 90s provided evidence that, while a child's fussy eating is often worrying, it is unlikely to have any lasting impact on their health and development.",
      "Thanks to repeated health-screenings that have been key to the project, it also revealed that one in five young people shows signs of fatty liver disease, and one in 40 young people may have liver scarring - caused largely by obesity and alcohol consumption. This has shown just how common the condition is and provided insights into ways it can be prevented through diet.",
      "And the scientific revelations keep on coming. Last month, the study revealed that children who lacked oily fish in their diets were less sociable and kind.",
      "In this latest study \u2013 of the children of the children of the 90s \u2013 scientists are looking specifically at formative abilities and brain development. They will follow each child until they start school.",

    "story": [
      "A \"miracle\" baby girl has become the first child in the UK to be born to a mother using a donated womb.",
      "The baby's mum, Grace Davidson, 36, was born without a functioning uterus, and received her sister's womb in 2023 \u2013 in what was then the UK's only successful womb transplant.",
      "Two years after that pioneering operation, Grace gave birth to her first child in February. She and her husband, Angus, 37, have named their daughter Amy after Grace's sister, who donated her womb.",
      "Holding baby Amy - who weighed just over two kilos (four and a half pounds) - for the first time was \"incredible\" and \"surreal\", new mum Grace says.",
      "\"It was quite overwhelming because we'd never really let ourselves imagine what it would be like for her to be here,\" she says. \"It was really wonderful.\"",
      "Grace and Angus, who live in north London but are originally from Scotland, hope to have a second child using the transplanted womb.",
      "The couple initially wished to remain anonymous, but following the safe arrival of baby Amy are now speaking to the BBC about their \"little miracle\".",
      "The surgical team told the BBC they have carried out three further womb transplants using deceased donors since Grace's transplant. They aim to carry out a total of 15 as part of a clinical trial.",
      "Grace was born with a rare condition, Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, where the womb is missing or underdeveloped, but with functioning ovaries. When the BBC first spoke to her in 2018, she was hoping her mother could donate her uterus to allow her to have children - but it proved to be unsuitable.",
      "The BBC met Grace and husband Angus again in 2019 when one of Grace's two sisters, Amy Purdie, was being assessed to find out if she could donate her womb to Grace. Amy and her husband already had two children and did not want any more.",
      "Prior to surgery both sisters had counselling. Grace and Angus also had fertility treatment and still have several embryos in storage. Grace says she was given the option of surrogacy or adoption, but carrying her own baby felt \"really important\".",
      "\"I have always had a mothering instinct,\" she says, \"but for years I had been suppressing it because it was too painful to go there.\"",
      "Womb transplants: how do they work?",
      "The first baby born as a result of a womb transplant was in Sweden in 2014. Since then around 135 such transplants have been carried out in more than a dozen countries, including the US, China, France, Germany, India and Turkey. Around 65 babies have been born.",
      "Originally scheduled to take place in late 2019, the sisters' transplant operation fell through and then looked in doubt for several years during the Covid pandemic.",
      "When it eventually took place, in February 2023, it took a team of more than 30 medics around 17 hours to remove Amy's womb and transplant it to Grace.",
      "Isabel Quiroga, the surgeon who led the transplant team at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford, says although the procedure carried risks for both sisters, it was \"life-enhancing and life-creating - and you can't have better than that.\"",
      "Amy says she did not feel the sense of loss some women experience after a hysterectomy, because of the \"dramatic\" and immediate benefits to her sister. Grace had her first ever period within two weeks of the transplant and became pregnant on the first attempt at IVF.",
      "It was \"incredible\" to feel her baby's first kick, she says, adding the entire pregnancy had been \"really special\".",
      "Baby Amy was born by Caesarean section at Queen Charlotte's hospital in west London on 27 February.",
      "\"It was an incredible moment, full of joy,\" says surgeon Isabel Quiroga.",
      "Grace and Angus say they hope to have a second child - as soon as the medical team say the time is right.",
      "The donated womb will be removed after the birth of a second child. This will allow Grace to stop taking the daily immunosuppressants she is currently on to ensure her body does not reject her sister's womb. Taking these drugs can increase the risks of developing some cancers, especially if taken over many years - but surgeon Isabel Quiroga says these risks should return to baseline once the womb is removed.",
      "Prof Richard Smith, a gynaecological surgeon at Imperial College Healthcare, who led the organ retrieval team, has been researching womb transplantation for more than two decades.",
      "He says his team is thrilled about the birth of baby Amy.",
      "\"I'm not often short of words but when the baby came out I was speechless - there were a lot of tears in the theatre that day.",
      "\"The whole thing is astonishing and incredibly moving,\" Prof Smith adds.",
      "He says Amy's birth will give hope to many of the 15,000 women in the UK of childbearing age who do not have a functioning uterus, of whom around 5,000 were born without a womb.",
      "Mr Smith heads a charity called Womb Transplant UK, which paid the NHS costs for Grace's transplant operation. All the medical staff gave their time for free.",
      "He told the BBC around 10 women have embryos in storage or are undergoing fertility treatment, a requirement for being considered for womb transplantation. Each transplant costs around \u00a330,000, he says, and the charity has sufficient funds to do two more.",
      "The surgical team has permission to perform 15 womb transplants as part of a clinical trial, five with living and 10 with deceased donors. No details have been made public about the three women who have so far received wombs from deceased donor organs. NHS Blood and Transplant told the BBC extra consent is sought from families for such rare donations.",
      "Baby Amy's father, Angus, says he and Grace will never be able to thank his wife's sister enough for enabling them to become parents. It was an \"absolute no brainer\" that they would name Amy after her aunt, Angus says.",
      "The baby's middle name is Isabel, after the surgeon who led the womb transplantation team.",
      "For Grace, having baby Amy has brought her even closer to her sister.",
      "\"It was incredibly difficult to let her do that for me,\" she says, \"it's a huge act of sisterly love.\"",

    "summary": "Men are more likely to die prematurely than women - and worse at seeking care when they need it.",
    "story": [
      "This month the government in England will launch a consultation for its men's health strategy. The move is long overdue, experts say, with men much more likely to die prematurely than women. But why are they in such poor health \u2013 and what can be done about it?",
      "Andrew Harrison was running a men's health clinic from a youth centre in Bradford when he heard a knock. He turned to the door, but no-one was there. Then he heard his name being called. He looked around to see a young man at the window asking for condoms.",
      "\"I was on the first floor,\" he says, recounting the story from a few years ago. \"The lad had shimmied up a drainpipe on the outside of the building because he didn't want to go through the reception and ask.\"",
      "The anecdote, in many ways, encapsulates the challenges over men's health \u2013 a combination of risk-taking behaviour and a lack of confidence and skills to engage with health services.",
      "Early deaths",
      "In the UK men are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol, use drugs and have high cholesterol and blood pressure.",
      "These are major contributors to the fact men have a lower life expectancy than women - by four years - and are nearly 60% more likely to die prematurely before the age of 75 with heart disease, lung cancer, liver disease and in accidents.",
      "Prof Alan White, who co-founded the Men's Health Forum charity and set up a dedicated men's health centre at Leeds Beckett University, says the issue needs to be taken more seriously.",
      "He cites the pandemic as an example, pointing out that 19,000 more men than women died from Covid. \"Where was the outrage? Where was the attention?\"",
      "He says it is too easy to blame men's poor health on their lifestyles, arguing \"it's much more complex than that.\"",
      "He says there are biological reasons \u2013 the male immune system is less able to fight off infection. But, as the story of the young man seeking condoms above demonstrates, they can also lack the skills to access health services.",
      "Prof White says: \"Men are less health-literate, that is to say they don't develop the skills to talk about their health and recognise and act on the signs. Men's health is very static from their teenage years right through into their 40s generally \u2013 many go years without seeing a health professional.",
      "\"It is different for women. Getting contraception, having cervical screening and then childbirth means many women have regular contact with health services in a way men do not.\"",
      "Stark differences",
      "Machismo is also a factor, says Mark Brooks, the policy adviser for the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Men's and Boy's Issues, which has played a key role in influencing the government to draw up a men's health strategy.",
      "\"In society we have different expectations in regards to men. They are expected to man up and get on with things, to be strong and resilient.\"",
      "But he says when it comes to men's health it is important to pay particular attention to the impact of deprivation. Life expectancy in the poorest 10% of areas is 10 years less than in the wealthiest \u2013 a larger gap than is seen for women \u2013 and in the most deprived areas a man is 3.5 times more likely to die before the age of 75.",
      "\"You cannot ignore the stark differences when it comes to left-behind communities and those working in blue-collar jobs like construction and manufacturing,\" he says. \"The way health services are designed isn't working for men.\"",
      "NHS health checks, which are offered every five years to those aged 40 to 74, are considered a crucial intervention when it comes to many of the diseases which are claiming the lives of men early. But fewer than four in 10 men take up the offer.",
      "\"Someone working in construction or on an industrial estate will find it very difficult to take time off whether that's for a health check or to go and see their GP.\"",
      "Mr Brooks says he would like to see employees given a right to two hours' paid time off to go for health checks as well as seeing them delivered in places where blue-collar workers are employed, such as industrial estates.",
      "But he says this is also an issue about employment - with some men in these roles scared to face up to health problems that develop in their 40s and 50s - ignoring early warning signs or hiding illnesses from bosses altogether because of what it may mean for their work.",
      "He adds that job worries and financial concerns, along with relationship problems,  are a big driver in the high suicide rates seen among men. Three-quarters of people who take their own lives are men.",
      "Despite this, just a third of people sent for talking therapies are men, which may suggest that services are not doing enough to consider men's needs.",
      "\"How services are set up to recognise signs of depression and anxiety is not how men express them \u2013 they are more likely to display signs of anger, abuse alcohol or become withdrawn and push people away,\" says Prof White.",
      "Ethnic differences are also important to recognise, he says. For example, black men in England are twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, while men from Indian or Bangladeshi backgrounds are at particularly high risk of diabetes.",
      "Wake-up call",
      "But none of this means men are not interested in their own health, says Prof Paul Galdas, a men's health expert at York University. \"Men will open up and want to be engaged, but to do that you have to base it around actions and activities.\"",
      "He has helped develop a six-week mental fitness programme in partnership with the Movember men's health movement that has been trialled on NHS front-line workers following Covid. Now it is being used by Leeds United football club for its youth players.",
      "Men are provided with support to understand how behaviour affects moods, they are encouraged to track their habits and set goals for healthy activities.",
      "\"It can be about going for a walk, seeing friends, playing golf and developing problem-solving skills to protect mental health. Good mental health leads to good physical health.\"",
      "Similar activity-based initiatives can be found in a number of local areas where charities, councils and local men's groups have worked together to set up schemes.",
      "The Men's Sheds movement is perhaps the most well-known where men are encouraged to come together and bond and support each other while doing practical projects.",
      "Prof White says now is the time to build on these foundations \u2013 something a national men's health strategy is vital for. He says it will help \"shine a spotlight\" on the issue in a similar way to the women's health strategy did back in 2022 \u2013 that led to the creation of a network of women's health hubs and women's health champions at the heart of government.",
      "But he also wants it to act as a \"wake-up call\" for men themselves. He says there are some simple steps every man should consider.",
      "\"Look at your waist size \u2013 if you are carrying weight, if your tummy is too big try to do something. Get moving, get out and about and talk to people.",
      "\"Take every opportunity to get a health check or screened. And, if you notice changes to body or the way you are managing problems, seek help.\"",

    "summary": "The economy grew by 0.5% in February, thanks to a strong month for the services sector.",
    "story": [
      "The UK economy grew by more than predicted in February and exports to the US increased by \u00a3500m as businesses rushed to beat US tariffs.",
      "The economy expanded by 0.5%, with the services sector having a strong month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.",
      "The better-than-expected figures come as the UK economy braces itself for the impact of tariffs imposed on goods imported to the US, with analysts warning that growth could prove short-lived.",
      "Tariffs on steel and aluminium came into effect on 12 March, while a 10% tariff on other goods came into effect this week.",
      "Goods exports from the UK to the US increased for the third consecutive month and are now at the highest level since November 2022, the ONS said.",
      "\"There are clear signs that UK firms increased goods exports to the US ahead of the introduction of tariffs,\" said William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC).",
      "\"Data for the past three months shows a 23% increase in the value of goods flowing from the UK across the Atlantic,\" Mr Bain said.",
      "Economists had predicted UK growth of just 0.1% in February, but the ONS said several factors contributed to the surprise rise which was driven by a boost in manufacturing and production.",
      "The government has made growing the UK economy its top priority in its effort to improve living standards.",
      "Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said February's surprise growth was due to computer programming, telecoms and car dealerships in the services sector all having \"strong months\".",
      "She added that manufacturing, electronics and pharmaceutical businesses performed well, and the car making industry also picked up after \"its recent poor performance\".",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves called the latest growth figures an \"encouraging sign\", but added the government was \"not complacent\".",
      "\"We must go further and faster to kickstart economic growth, provide security for working people and put more money in their pockets,\" she added.",
      "The UK is subject to the blanket 10% tariff on nearly all of its goods being brought into the US, which is expected to hit British exporters and also affect economic growth.",
      "Mr Bain from the BCC said securing a deal with the US and removing trade barriers with the EU would be \"key to cushioning the negative impacts of the sweeping new US tariffs\".",
      "Speaking to reporters, Reeves said: \"We continue to engage with our counterparts in the United States and of course we want to secure the best deal possible for British jobs and British industry and we are absolutely committed and resolved to do everything we can,\" she told reporters.",
      "How fast is the UK's economy growing?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Alongside the better-than-expected growth, the ONS revised up its figure for January from a contraction of 0.1% to no growth.",
      "Monthly figures alone can be volatile so should be taken in context. The more stable three-month average to February shows growth is up 0.6%.",
      "This would have been considered normal growth a decade ago, but has been elusive in recent years.",
      "However, it suggests that recent talk of a recession has been way off the mark.",
      "But February's figure comes ahead of the impact of tax rises on businesses and household energy and water bill increases on the economy, along with US tariffs.",
      "Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist, said the UK's \"surprisingly strong growth will prove short lived, as rises in tariffs and taxes bite\".",
      "\"The big picture is that the economy has grown in only four of the last nine months and it's hard to see the economy strengthening much from here,\" she said.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said: \"Since coming to office, Labour's choices have killed growth stone dead and there is still a long way to go to recover.\"",
      "While there is an acknowledgement that the uncertainty from US tariffs poses threats to the economy, some experts believe it may also create opportunities for a the UK as a stable, growing trade-friendly economy.",
      "Mitchell Barnes runs a 3D printing company in Warwickshire, designing and manufacturing parts for the automotive industry.",
      "Half of the parts made here are exported to the US.",
      "But rather than Trump tariffs, he says it is domestic factors that are hitting his business.",
      "Mr Barnes says this month's changes to National Insurance contributions and the minimum wage mean he may need to rethink his plan to create new jobs at the site.",
      "He had hoped to increase his number of staff from 27 to 100 over the next 18 months, but has now lowered that to between 30 to 40.",
      "The business is now looking to accelerate plans to expand in the United States instead. \"Ultimately, for us, it's all about innovating in order to control our own destiny.\"",

      "She said she wanted to see \"a fair resolution to this\" and added: \"I would urge Unite to suspend the action and accept the improved deal.",
      "\"This dispute is causing misery and disruption to residents and the backlog must be dealt with quickly to address public health risks.\"",

      "She said the new deal \"still leaves these workers worrying about how they are going to pay their mortgages and rent payments in a few months' time\".",

    "story": [
      "A share of the revenue streaming services make from subscription fees should be paid into a fund to support British high-end TV production, an influential group of MPs has said.",
      "In a new report, the Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) committee urged the government to improve support measures for producers while safeguarding the creation of distinctly British content.",
      "It follows an inquiry into the UK TV and film industry which examined the effects of the rise of streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon and Apple TV.",
      "The report noted how \"vital\" dramas such as Adolescence are to the country's \"identity, national conversations and talent pipeline\", which they say is now \"under threat\".",
      "It is \"time for streamers to put their money where their mouth is\", the report read, suggesting that streaming companies should pay \"5% of their UK subscriber revenue into a cultural fund to help finance drama with a specific interest to British audiences\".",
      "Chair of the CMS committee, MP Dame Caroline Dinenage, noted how recent \"big box-office blockbusters made in Britain have showcased the UK's world-class film and high-end television industry like never before\".",
      "\"But the boom in inward investment of recent years now risks crowding out our many talented independent British producers,\" she said.",
      "She added: \"While streamers like Netflix and Amazon have proved a valuable addition for the industry and economy, unless the government urgently intervenes to rebalance the playing field, for every Adolescence adding to the national conversation, there will be countless distinctly British stories that never make it to our screens.\"",

      "A Netflix spokeswoman said: \"The UK is Netflix's biggest production hub outside of North America - and we want it to stay that way.",
      "\"But in an increasingly competitive global market, it's key to create a business environment that incentivises rather than penalises investment, risk taking and success. Levies diminish competitiveness and penalise audiences who ultimately bear the increased costs.\"",
      "The Association for Commercial Broadcasters and On-Demand Services (COBA) said a levy risks damaging streamers' investment in the UK.",
      "Coba executive director Adam Minns said: \"Especially in this economic climate, a levy risks impacting existing content budgets for UK shows, jobs, and growth, along with raising costs for businesses.",
      "\"Ironically, it could actually damage public service broadcaster dramas by reducing co-production budgets at streamers.\"",
      "He added pressure on domestic production stemmed from the real terms decline in the TV licence fee.",
      "A BBC spokesman said the corporation \"continues to invest\" in British content but faced \"significant financial challenges due to pressure on the licence fee and rising industry costs\".",
      "\"It is therefore integral that the BBC and the wider UK creative industries have the support in place to drive growth in the creative economy and support homegrown content and storytelling.\"",
      "The report released on Thursday noted how last year there was a 27% decrease in the number of domestic high-end TV productions made in the UK and a 25% fall in spend.",
      "The calls for greater help come after Wolf Hall director Peter Kosminsky told BBC News last month that the industry was in crisis, and that public service broadcasters including the BBC and ITV could no longer afford to make high-end British drama.",
      "Fair levy or unfair tariff?",
      "The arrival of the streamers into the UK market \"drove up the price of everything\", Kosminsky told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday, to the point where the public service broadcasters \"couldn't afford to make their programs anymore, so we need a new pot of money.\"",
      "He underlined how 17 other countries in Europe have imposed a similar levy \"so that public service broadcasters can stay in the game.\"",
      "Speaking on the same programme, former BBC One controller Peter Fincham replied saying he did not agree.",
      "\"I think this sounds to me a little bit like a tariff - to use a more fashionable word - and indeed a form of protectionism.\"",

      "\"We thank the committee for its report which we will respond to in due course.\"",
      "'Support freelancers'",
      "The report also noted while the introduction of tax breaks for independent British films, and for film and TV studios in England may have helped, it was not a \"silver bullet\" for solving many of the issues facing British producers.",
      "As well as providing greater support and resources for UK TV production workforces, it also suggested that lawmakers should consider cutting VAT on cinema tickets as well as doing more to meet the challenges posed by AI.",
      "Commenting on the report, Paul W Fleming, general secretary of Equity, which represents British performers, said the government should \"heed the call\" for the licensing of creative works in all cases where they are used to train artificial intelligence models.",

      "Big tech firms \"must be held to account\", he added, \"brought to the table and made to pay creators what they owe.\"",
      "The cross-party committee recommended the government and British Film Institute (BFI) should launch a national awareness campaign, highlighting the employment opportunities offered by film and high-end TV, and \"the range of skills the industry requires\".",
      "It stressed how the industry \"benefits hugely from the flexibility afforded by a predominantly freelance workforce\" and therefore more should be done to \"support freelancers when they are out of work\"; such as the introduction of a minimum hourly wage or guaranteed basic income.",
      "Head of industry union Bectu, Philippa Childs, said: \"We welcome this timely and incisive report from the committee which identifies many of the urgent challenges currently facing the industry and its workforce.\"",

    "story": [
      "Politicians in Cardiff Bay are to get a vote over whether controversial Westminster legislation to legalise assisted dying should apply to Wales.",
      "Senedd members will have to decide whether to give consent for Labour MP Kim Leadbeater's legislation to apply in Wales, should it be agreed by the UK Parliament.",
      "Last October Senedd members - including First Minister Eluned Morgan and Health Secretary Jeremy Miles - voted against the broader principle of assisted dying.",
      "If agreed by MPs, Leadbeater's legislation would make it legal for over-18s who are terminally ill to be given assistance to end their own life.",
      "Separately, amendments passed in March by MPs could also give Senedd politicians and ministers power over the date for when most of the law comes into force.",
      "The UK and Welsh governments have remained neutral on the backbench legislation. Miles and Leadbeater met to discuss the bill earlier this week.",
      "Assisted dying move defeated in Senedd vote",
      "Assisted dying law could take four years to implement",
      "On Wednesday the Welsh government published documentation confirming Labour ministers in Cardiff believe Leadbeater's bill requires the consent of the Senedd.",
      "Although it amends the law regarding suicide - something which the UK Parliament is responsible for in Wales - the Welsh government says parts of the law tread into matters that the Senedd is usually responsible for.",
      "That includes the chief medical officer drawing up guidance on how the act operates, and powers for Welsh ministers to provide assisted dying services.",
      "It means that the Senedd needs to pass what is known as a \"legislative consent motion\" (LCM).",
      "When they were first envisaged parliament was not meant to legislate in devolved areas without the Senedd's permission via an LCM, but it is not legally binding.",
      "If the LCM was rejected it could be ignored by the UK Parliament, although that would be politically difficult.",
      "Westminster Labour has promised to \"strengthen\" the convention behind LCMs at the last general election.",
      "'Respect democracy'",
      "A committee of MPs has been amending the bill. In March it agreed by a small margin that Welsh ministers should have powers over when to start most of the legislation's provisions.",
      "Under the amendment, which was backed by 12 votes to 11 and proposed by Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Olney, the Senedd will have to vote on regulations to bring the law into force.",
      "Such a decision would only take place if the law gets through the UK Parliament - itself not certain - while the LCM would likely be held earlier.",
      "The proposal was opposed by UK Labour ministers Stephen Kinnock and Sarah Sackman, as well as Leadbeater herself.",
      "At the committee in March, Olney said: \"Regardless of where we stand on assisted dying, we should respect democracy.",
      "Referring to the October vote, she said: \"The people of Wales, through their elected representatives - acting as they should, as representatives - have voted against assisted dying.",
      "\"We should respect that choice and not impose it on them, in whole or in part, without their consent.\"",
      "But Aberavon MP Kinnock said the amendment could potentially \"create a disparity, particularly in relation to the introduction of the criminal offences, and a lack of certainty\".",
      "Ministers and Senedd 'could block bill'",
      "The amendment followed evidence to the committee by Aberyswyth University emeritus professor Emyr Lewis, who asked the MPs to consider whether ministers should be given powers over when the legislation begins to apply when the Senedd had rejected the broader principle.",
      "He told BBC Wales he had questioned whether it would be \"constitutionally appropriate\" for Parliament to have ignored the earlier Senedd vote.",
      "\"We know the Senedd has rejected this. Is it right that... the parliament in London should impose, if you want to put it that way, on Wales this change in the law, which is going to have far reaching effects?\"",
      "He said that if the Senedd supported the bill it could be brought in in Wales, should it be passed by MPs, as it would be in England.",
      "\"If, however, the feeling in Wales remains as it was when the matter was voted on before then this very morally and legally far reaching bill won't be brought into force in Wales if the people of Wales don't want it.\"",
      "He told BBC Wales that the Olney amendment could give ministers in Cardiff powers to block the legislation.",
      "The law professor said: \"Welsh ministers could block it and so could the Senedd in Wales.\"",
      "The Senedd vote last October saw 26 Members of the Senedd opposing Labour MS Julie Morgan's motion with 19 MSs in support versus nine abstentions.",
      "Leadbeater's bill is narrower than Morgan's motion, specifying it would apply to over-18s who are expected to die within six months, with a number of measures intended to act as safeguards.",
      "Morgan's vote proposed that suffering \"intolerably\" from an incurable physical condition should have the option of an assisted death. Former counsel general Mick Antoniw has said he expects a different debate.",
      "The difference between the law and the earlier Senedd vote was acknowledged in the committee's debate on Olney's amendment.",
      "Leadbeater said the Morgan motion was \"very different from the legislation before this Parliament\".",
      "She said changes made to the bill allowing ministers powers to make regulations about voluntary assisted dying services would \"hopefully also provide some reassurance on issues around devolution\".",
      "No date has been set for the LCM.",
      "A spokesperson for Kim Leadbeater said discussions with the Welsh government \"have been very constructive and Kim is determined to respect the devolution agreement and work with Welsh ministers in the interests of terminally ill people in both England and Wales\".",
      "The Welsh government said: \"This is a complex issue with many moral, operational, constitutional and legal considerations, and like the UK government we have adopted a neutral position.\""

      "More than 40 Labour MPs are urging ministers to introduce a new form of digital ID to help control the migration system and improve public services.",
      "In an open letter, Labour MPs from three groups said a \"gear shift\" was needed to reap the benefits of digital identification.",
      "The idea of digital ID for all has long been backed by former Labour Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair and former Conservative leader William Hague.",
      "But the BBC understands the government has no plans to introduce mandatory digital ID.",
      "The letter said while the government had made \"great strides\" on digitising identification, \"the time has come for a more comprehensive programme\".",
      "\"The truth is we are moving to an era of digital ID,\" Jake Richards, one of the Labour MPs who signed the letter, told the BBC.",
      "\"The government knows this - and is bringing forward new developments with digital driving licences and passports, but we want them to move faster, to ensure the project is comprehensive and joined-up and, critically, bring the public with them.\"",
      "The group argues digital ID could help tackle \"illegal off-the-books employment\".",
      "The proposal falls short of the compulsory identity cards Sir Tony brought in when he was prime minister.",
      "The last Labour government started issuing the first ID cards to UK citizens and 15,000 were in circulation when the scheme was scrapped by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition in 2011 and the database destroyed.",

      "In the open letter, the Labour MPs said \"this government will only succeed if it is able to get a grip on illegal migration\".",
      "A key part of this, the letter said, \"must be tackling illegal off-the-books employment, which is a major draw for migrants entering our country unlawfully\".",

      "It sounds like something from a science fiction movie, but Stephen Eisele is confident that one day his company will open a data centre on the Moon.",
      "\"The way we see it is that by putting the data centre in space, you're really offering unparalleled security,\" says the president of Lonestar Data Holdings.",
      "Last month, the Florida-based firm claimed to have successfully tested a tiny data centre the size of a hardback book that hitched a ride to the Moon on the Athena Lunar Lander from US space exploration firm Intuitive Machines. This, in turn, had been launched by a rocket from Elon Musk's SpaceX.",
      "Data centres are the vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments.",
      "Lonestar says that putting them on the Moon will offer customers secure, reliable data processing, while taking advantage of unlimited solar energy to power them.",
      "The environmental campaigners fighting against data centres",
      "Data centre power use 'to surge six-fold in 10 years'",
      "Concern UK's AI ambitions could lead to water shortages",
      "And while space-based data centres may sound far-fetched, it's an idea that's really starting to take off.",
      "Part of the reason is rocketing demand and the difficulty of finding suitable sites on Earth.",
      "The ever-expanding use of artificial intelligence (AI) computing has seen a massive increase in the amount of data that needs to be stored and processed around the world.",
      "As a result, the need for data centres has shot up too, with annual demand set to rise between 19% and 22% by 2030, according to global management consultants McKinsey.",
      "New facilities are springing up all the time - but it's getting hard to find places to put them. Data centres are large and sprawling, and use enormous amounts of power and water for cooling.",
      "And increasingly local people don't want them built nearby.",
      "Putting data centres in space \u2013 either in orbit around Earth, or on the Moon - the theory goes, means they can't do quite so much harm. There's more-or-less unlimited energy available from the sun, for example, and no neighbours to complain about the environmental impacts.",
      "Not only that, space-based data centres could specialise in services for spacecraft and other space facilities, with space-to-space data transfers quicker than from the ground.",
      "Last summer, a European Commission-funded feasibility study into orbiting data centres published its results.",
      "The Ascend report by carried out by Thales Alenia Space - a joint venture between French and Italian aerospace groups Thales and Leonardo - published its results.",
      "It determined that deploying data centres in space \"could transform the European digital landscape\", and be \"more eco-friendly\".",
      "Thales Alenia Space envisages building a constellation of 13 satellites measuring  a combined 200m-by-80m, and with a total data processing power of around 10 megawatts (MW). That's equivalent to a current medium-sized, ground-based data centre, with some 5,000 servers.",
      "Based on technologies that already exist or are under development, the satellites would be assembled in orbit.",
      "Damien Dumestier, Ascend project architect at Thales Alenia Space, says that for space-based data centres to be more environmentally friendly than existing ground-based ones it will be necessary to make the rocket launchers 10 times less emissive over their lifecycles. He says this looks possible.",
      "\"But in order to cover the new technology's developments and the production capacity ramp-up to benefit from scale, we have to consider larger system capacity, around 200MW, meaning 200 of our envisaged large space infrastructures and 200 launches,\" he says.",
      "\"The main question is when an adapted launcher will be ready. Depending on the investment and decisions to be taken, this could be done for 2030 or 2035, meaning commercial viability before 2037.\"",
      "However, despite this optimism from firms aiming to develop the technology, Dr Domenico Vicinanza, associate professor of intelligent systems and data science at Anglia Ruskin University in the UK, says there are numerous big hurdles before space-based data centres can be a viable proposition.",
      "\"Even with the contribution and advancements of companies like SpaceX, launching hardware into orbit remains extremely expensive,\" he says. \"Each kilogram sent into space costs thousands of dollars.",
      "\"Space-based data centres would require not only the data equipment but also the infrastructure to protect, power, and cool them. All of which add up in weight and complexity.\"",
      "Cooling the equipment will be a particular problem,  because even though space is cold, conventional cooling systems don't work well without gravity.",
      "Meanwhile, space weather can damage electronics, while the ever-increasing quantity of space debris puts the physical hardware at risk.",
      "Dr Vicinanza adds: \"And fixing problems in orbit is far from straightforward. Even with robotics and automation, there are limits to what can be repaired remotely.",
      "\"A big hardware failure might necessitate a costly human mission, potentially making downtime stretch for weeks or months.\"",
      "Yet firms like Lonestar are supremely confident, and say that they are responding to demand. \"We wouldn't be doing this if the customers weren't asking us to,\" says Mr Scott.",
      "Its next target is to put a small data centre in orbit around the moon in 2027. Meanwhile, other companies are hoping to get there a bit faster, such as Washington state-based Starcloud, which is due to launch a satellite-based data centre next month, and start commercial operations in mid-2026.",
      "Lonestar's Mr Eidele says that space-based facilities offer more security for governments and businesses because their data does not need to be routed through terrestrial networks. Instead the information can be beamed directly from space to a dedicated ground station.",
      "\"It's like having the vaults at the back of the bank,\" he says. \"You don't have to open it every day, but it's there to provide an extra measure of security, and the distance from the Earth to the moon offers that - it's that much harder to hack, that much harder to access.\"",
      "The distance to the Moon means that data takes about a second and a half to reach the ground - this doesn't matter for some applications, like longer-term data storage and backups.",
      "And meanwhile, says Lonestar founder and chief executive Chris Stott, space-based data centres can help organisations meet regulations about data sovereignty - the need to hold peoples' data in the country of origin.",
      "\"Under space law, that box of electronics is literally under the law of the licensing or launching state - it is an actual embassy in space,\" he says.",

    "summary": "The BBC finds evidence of fraud in the production of a \"green\" diesel meant to cut emissions.",
    "story": [
      "The UK government is investigating a fast-growing \"green fuel\" called HVO diesel amid claims of significant fraud, the BBC has learned.",
      "HVO is increasingly popular as a transport fuel and for powering music festivals and its backers say it can curb carbon emissions by up to 90% as it can be made from waste materials like used cooking oil.",
      "But industry whistleblowers told the BBC they believe large amounts of these materials are not waste but instead are virgin palm oil, which is being fraudulently relabelled.",
      "And data analysed by the BBC and shared with the UK's Department for Transport casts further doubt on one of the key ingredients in HVO, a material called palm sludge waste.",
      "Europe used more of this waste in HVO and other biofuels in 2023 than it is thought possible for the world to produce.",
      "In response to the BBC's findings, the Department for Transport said they \"take the concerns raised seriously and are working with stakeholders and international partners to gather further information\".",
      "HVO, or hydrotreated vegetable oil, has been called something of a wonder-fuel in recent years as it can be used as 100% substitute for diesel reducing planet warming emissions.",
      "UK consumption rocketed from 8 million litres in 2019 to about 699 million litres in 2024, according to provisional government figures.",
      "Its green credentials rely heavily on the assumption that it is made from waste sources, particularly used cooking oil or the waste sludge from palm oil production.",
      "But industry whistle-blowers have told the BBC that they believe virgin palm oil and other non-waste materials are often being used instead.",
      "That would be bad news for the planet, as virgin palm oil is linked to increased tropical deforestation, which adds to climate change and threatening endangered species like orang-utans.",
      "This palm oil \"floods the market like cancer,\" one large European biofuel manufacturer told the BBC.",
      "They said that to stay in business they have to go along with the pretence that they are using waste materials.",
      "Another whistle-blower, a former trader of these biofuels, also speaking anonymously, gave the BBC his account of one recent case dealing with supposedly waste products.",
      "\"I believe that what I bought was multiple cargos of virgin palm oil that has been wrongly classified as palm oil sludge,\" they said.",
      "\"I called one of the board members and told them about the situation, and then I was told that they didn't want to do anything about it, because the evidence would be burned.\"",
      "As well as this testimony, data compiled by campaign group Transport & Environment and analysed by the BBC suggests that more palm sludge waste is being used for transport biofuels than the world is probably able to produce.",
      "The figures show that the UK and EU used about two million tonnes of palm sludge waste for HVO and other biofuels in 2023, based on Eurostat and UK Department for Transport figures.",
      "EU imports of this sludge appear to have risen further in 2024, according to preliminary UN trade data, although the UK appears to have bucked this trend.",
      "But the data analysed by the BBC, which is based on well-established UN and industry statistics, suggests the world can only produce just over one million tonnes of palm sludge waste a year.",
      "This mismatch further suggests non-waste fuels such as  virgin palm oil are being used to meet Europe's rapid growth in biofuels, according to researchers and industry figures.",
      "\"It's a very easy game,\" said Dr Christian Bickert, a German farmer and editor with experience in biofuels, who believes that much of the HVO made with these waste products is \"fake\".",
      "\"Chemically, the sludge and the pure palm oil are absolutely the same because they come from the same plant, and also from the same production facilities in Indonesia,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"There's no paper which proves [the fraud], no paper at all, but the figures tell a clear story.\"",
      "Underpinning the sustainability claims of biofuels is an independent system of certification where producers have to show exactly where they get their raw materials from.",
      "It is mainly administered by a company called ISCC, and in Europe it has a long-standing reputation for ensuring that waste materials turned into fuel really do come from waste, by working with national authorities.",
      "But in Indonesia, Malaysia and China, three of the main sources of the raw ingredients claimed to be waste for HVO, supervision is much more difficult.",
      "\"ISCC is simply not allowed to send anybody to China,\" said Dr Christian Bickert.",
      "\"They have to rely on certification companies in China to check that everything is OK, but China doesn't allow any inspectors in from outside.\"",
      "This concern is echoed by several other groups contacted by the BBC.",
      "Construction giant Balfour Beatty, for example, has a policy of not using the fuel, citing sustainability concerns.",
      "\"We just are not able to get any level of visibility over the supply chain of HVO that would give us that level of assurance that this is truly a sustainable product,\" Balfour Beatty's Jo Gilroy told BBC News.",
      "The European Waste-based and Advanced Biofuels Association represents the major biofuel manufacturers in the EU and UK.",
      "In a statement they said \"there is a major certification verification issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of priority\", adding that the \"ISCC should do much more to ensure that non-EU Biodiesel is really what it claims to be\".",
      "In the light of growing fraud allegations, the Irish authorities have recently restricted incentives for fuels made from palm waste.",
      "The BBC also understands that the EU is about to propose a ban on ISCC certification of waste biofuels for two-and-a-half years, although it is expected to say it is not aware of direct breaches of renewable goals.",
      "It would then be up to individual member countries to decide whether to accept certifications.",
      "In response, the ISCC said it was \"more than surprised\" by the EU's move, adding that it had been \"a frontrunner in implementing the most strict and effective measures to ensure integrity and fraud prevention in the market for years\".",

    "story": [
      "For 20 years, Rj LaMendola found peace while paddling in the water on his surfboard.",
      "But last month off the coast of Southern California, the ocean turned hostile after a sea lion lunged at him, bit him and dragged him off his board.",
      "\"It looked possessed,\" Mr LaMendola wrote in a Facebook post, saying the animal involved in the encounter just north of Los Angeles was \"feral, almost demonic\".",
      "The surfer later learned the animal was suffering from domoic acid toxicosis- a neurological condition caused by a harmful algal bloom. It's one of dozens of sickened animals that have been spotted across California beaches recently - many suffering from symptoms like seizures or intense lethargy. The toxin often leads to death.",
      "This particular algae bloom has appeared four years in a row across California, raising concerns it might be turning into an annual event. The bloom of algae started earlier than normal this year and has spread roughly 370 miles of the iconic Southern California coastline.",
      "When Mr LaMenolda made it to shore, his wetsuit ripped open, he was bleeding and went to the hospital. \"It felt like I was being hunted,\" he said.",
      "South of where he was attacked, 15-year-old Phoebe Beltran was doing a swim test in Long Beach to become a lifeguard when a sea lion repeatedly bit her.",
      "\"I was just so scared, so shocked, but I still felt the immense pain on my arms, like, over and over again,\" the teen told local US media.",
      "The two back-to-back attacks have garnered global headlines and caused some anxiety among those who call California and its iconic beaches home. While attacks are rare, experts say the number of animals sickened by the toxic algae bloom appears to be increasing.",
      "John Warner, CEO of the Marine Mammal Care Center in Los Angeles - which is treating sea life sickened by the bloom - told the BBC these animals aren't \"naturally aggressive or actually attack people\" but the toxins impact their behaviour.",
      "\"These animals are reacting to the fact that they are sick,\" he explained. \"They're disoriented, and most likely, most of them are having seizures, and so their senses are not all fully functional as they normally would and they're acting out of fear.\"",
      "Domoic acid builds up in smaller fish like sardines and anchovies, which are eaten by marine predators such as dolphins, seals and sea lions in large quantities, causing them to get sick.",
      "Exposure to the acid causes serious neurological issues in sea lions, including seizures, disorientation and a telltale head-tilting behaviour known as \"stargazing.\"",
      "Some animals fall into a lethargic and comatose state, while others can turn aggressive.",
      "\"Their behaviour changes from what we're used to, to something more unpredictable,\" Mr Warner said. \"But in this particular bloom, we're seeing them really comatose and rather taken out by this toxin.\"",
      "The Marine Mammal Care Center is currently overwhelmed with the influx and severity of sick animals.",
      "According to Mr Warner, the nonprofit has admitted at least 195 sea lions from Feb 20 to the end of March. During the same time frame last year, the centre saw only 50 of the animals.",
      "If treated promptly, sea lions have a 50% to 65% chance of recovery, but Mr Warner says the centre is running out of space and money to treat the animals. Treatment includes anti-seizure medication and sedation, followed by twice-daily tube feeding and hydration.",
      "On top of that, the recovery pace this year has been slower, he said.",
      "While sick sea lions in 2023 typically began eating within a week, many this year are still lethargic five weeks into care.",
      "Recovery comes in stages: from a comatose state to disorientation, then aggressive reawakening\u2014when the animals are most dangerous due to lingering neurological effects.",
      "Adult sea lions can weigh hundreds of pounds, and aggressive behaviors make housing them complicated. If their behaviour doesn't normalize, it could signal permanent brain damage, and humane euthanasia becomes necessary.",
      "\"If they're still aggressive or not foraging properly, it tells us their brains aren't functioning the way they should,\" Mr Warner said.",
      "For now, beachgoers are urged to stay well away from stranded animals - at least 50 feet - and resist the temptation to intervene.",
      "\"These are still the same charismatic, really fun-to-watch expert cuddle puddlers that we see along the coast all the time,\" Mr Warner said. \"We need to remember they are wild animals. They can be unpredictable even in normal circumstances.\""

      "Paleogeneticist Dr Nic Rawlence, also from Otago University, explained how ancient dire wolf DNA - extracted from fossilised remains - is too degraded and damaged to biologically copy or clone.",
      "\"Ancient DNA is like if you put fresh DNA in a 500 degree oven overnight,\" Dr Rawlence told BBC News. \"It comes out fragmented - like shards and dust.",
      "\"You can reconstruct [it], but it's not good enough to do anything else with.\"",
      "Instead, he added, the de-extinction team used new synthetic biology technology - using the ancient DNA to identify key segments of code that they could edit into the biological blueprint of a living animal, in this case a grey wolf.",
      "\"So what Colossal has produced is a grey wolf, but it has some dire wolf-like characteristics, like a larger skull and white fur,\" said Dr Rawlence. \"It's a hybrid.\"",

      "\"A grey wolf is the closest living relative of a dire wolf - they're genetically really similar - so we targeted DNA sequences that lead to dire wolf traits and then edited grey wolf cells... then we cloned those cells and created our dire wolves.\"",
      "According to Dr Rawlence though, dire wolves diverged from grey wolves anywhere between 2.5 to six million years ago.",
      "\"It's in a completely different genus to grey wolves,\" he said. \"Colossal compared the genomes of the dire wolf and the grey wolf, and from about 19,000 genes, they determined that 20 changes in 14 genes gave them a dire wolf.\"",

      "The pups certainly look like many people's vision of a dire wolf and the story has gathered global attention. So why is this scientific distinction important?",

    "summary": "The BBC finds evidence of fraud in the production of a \"green\" diesel meant to cut emissions.",
    "story": [
      "The UK government is investigating a fast-growing \"green fuel\" called HVO diesel amid claims of significant fraud, the BBC has learned.",
      "HVO is increasingly popular as a transport fuel and for powering music festivals and its backers say it can curb carbon emissions by up to 90% as it can be made from waste materials like used cooking oil.",
      "But industry whistleblowers told the BBC they believe large amounts of these materials are not waste but instead are virgin palm oil, which is being fraudulently relabelled.",
      "And data analysed by the BBC and shared with the UK's Department for Transport casts further doubt on one of the key ingredients in HVO, a material called palm sludge waste.",
      "Europe used more of this waste in HVO and other biofuels in 2023 than it is thought possible for the world to produce.",
      "In response to the BBC's findings, the Department for Transport said they \"take the concerns raised seriously and are working with stakeholders and international partners to gather further information\".",
      "HVO, or hydrotreated vegetable oil, has been called something of a wonder-fuel in recent years as it can be used as 100% substitute for diesel reducing planet warming emissions.",
      "UK consumption rocketed from 8 million litres in 2019 to about 699 million litres in 2024, according to provisional government figures.",
      "Its green credentials rely heavily on the assumption that it is made from waste sources, particularly used cooking oil or the waste sludge from palm oil production.",
      "But industry whistle-blowers have told the BBC that they believe virgin palm oil and other non-waste materials are often being used instead.",
      "That would be bad news for the planet, as virgin palm oil is linked to increased tropical deforestation, which adds to climate change and threatening endangered species like orang-utans.",
      "This palm oil \"floods the market like cancer,\" one large European biofuel manufacturer told the BBC.",
      "They said that to stay in business they have to go along with the pretence that they are using waste materials.",
      "Another whistle-blower, a former trader of these biofuels, also speaking anonymously, gave the BBC his account of one recent case dealing with supposedly waste products.",
      "\"I believe that what I bought was multiple cargos of virgin palm oil that has been wrongly classified as palm oil sludge,\" they said.",
      "\"I called one of the board members and told them about the situation, and then I was told that they didn't want to do anything about it, because the evidence would be burned.\"",
      "As well as this testimony, data compiled by campaign group Transport & Environment and analysed by the BBC suggests that more palm sludge waste is being used for transport biofuels than the world is probably able to produce.",
      "The figures show that the UK and EU used about two million tonnes of palm sludge waste for HVO and other biofuels in 2023, based on Eurostat and UK Department for Transport figures.",
      "EU imports of this sludge appear to have risen further in 2024, according to preliminary UN trade data, although the UK appears to have bucked this trend.",
      "But the data analysed by the BBC, which is based on well-established UN and industry statistics, suggests the world can only produce just over one million tonnes of palm sludge waste a year.",
      "This mismatch further suggests non-waste fuels such as  virgin palm oil are being used to meet Europe's rapid growth in biofuels, according to researchers and industry figures.",
      "\"It's a very easy game,\" said Dr Christian Bickert, a German farmer and editor with experience in biofuels, who believes that much of the HVO made with these waste products is \"fake\".",
      "\"Chemically, the sludge and the pure palm oil are absolutely the same because they come from the same plant, and also from the same production facilities in Indonesia,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"There's no paper which proves [the fraud], no paper at all, but the figures tell a clear story.\"",
      "Underpinning the sustainability claims of biofuels is an independent system of certification where producers have to show exactly where they get their raw materials from.",
      "It is mainly administered by a company called ISCC, and in Europe it has a long-standing reputation for ensuring that waste materials turned into fuel really do come from waste, by working with national authorities.",
      "But in Indonesia, Malaysia and China, three of the main sources of the raw ingredients claimed to be waste for HVO, supervision is much more difficult.",
      "\"ISCC is simply not allowed to send anybody to China,\" said Dr Christian Bickert.",
      "\"They have to rely on certification companies in China to check that everything is OK, but China doesn't allow any inspectors in from outside.\"",
      "This concern is echoed by several other groups contacted by the BBC.",
      "Construction giant Balfour Beatty, for example, has a policy of not using the fuel, citing sustainability concerns.",
      "\"We just are not able to get any level of visibility over the supply chain of HVO that would give us that level of assurance that this is truly a sustainable product,\" Balfour Beatty's Jo Gilroy told BBC News.",
      "The European Waste-based and Advanced Biofuels Association represents the major biofuel manufacturers in the EU and UK.",
      "In a statement they said \"there is a major certification verification issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of priority\", adding that the \"ISCC should do much more to ensure that non-EU Biodiesel is really what it claims to be\".",
      "In the light of growing fraud allegations, the Irish authorities have recently restricted incentives for fuels made from palm waste.",
      "The BBC also understands that the EU is about to propose a ban on ISCC certification of waste biofuels for two-and-a-half years, although it is expected to say it is not aware of direct breaches of renewable goals.",
      "It would then be up to individual member countries to decide whether to accept certifications.",
      "In response, the ISCC said it was \"more than surprised\" by the EU's move, adding that it had been \"a frontrunner in implementing the most strict and effective measures to ensure integrity and fraud prevention in the market for years\".",

      "That meant an increase in the use of fossil fuel burning power stations.",
      "Solar power continues to be the fastest-growing energy source, with the amount of electricity it generates doubling in the last three years.",
      "\"Solar power has become the engine of the global energy transition,\" said Phil Macdonald, the managing director of Ember.",
      "\"Amid the noise, it's essential to focus on the real signal. Hotter weather drove the fossil generation increase in 2024, but we're very unlikely to see a similar jump in 2025.\"",
      "In a separate report, the European Copernicus climate service said March 2025 was the second hottest on record, extending a spell of record or near record breaking temperatures.",
      "Ember is a global energy think tank which has been predicting for several years that emissions of the climate warming gas carbon dioxide were about to start falling.",

      "The report says that clean energy sources contributed more than 40% of global electricity generation for the first time since the 1940s. Back then demand was much lower, and hydroelectric power stations contributed a significant share.",
      "The big picture is that the rise in the global demand for electricity continues to outpace the growth in renewable energy.",
      "That means that though the percentage generated by clean power has risen to 40.9% the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted has yet to start falling.",
      "According to the Ember report global demand for electricity rose by 4% in 2024.",
      "This was partly due to an increased use of air conditioning in what was a particularly hot year. That meant that fossil fuel generation, mostly coal (34%) and gas (22%), increased by 1.4% and global emissions of the climate warming gas CO2 rose to an all time high of 14.6bn tonnes.",

    "summary": "Some analysts say that if costs incurred by tariffs pass to consumers, US iPhone prices could rise by hundreds of dollars.",
    "story": [
      "The world's most popular gadgets - phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches - could be about to get a lot more expensive in the US.",
      "Many of them are made in China, which now faces a 145% tariff on its goods imported to the US, under President Donald Trump's controversial trade policy.",
      "The effect this may have on the iPhone and its maker Apple is under the spotlight - with some analysts saying if costs are passed onto consumers, iPhone prices in the US could rise by hundreds of dollars.",
      "And if the tariffs impact the value of the dollar, it could become more expensive to import iPhones and other devices around the world - potentially leading to higher prices in UK shops.",
      "Ben Wood of CCS Insight told the BBC that if tariffs remain in place, Apple may raise iPhone prices globally when the next iteration is launched.",
      "\"It is unlikely the company would want to have differentiated pricing globally,\" he said - as the tech giant would want to avoid people buying the device cheaply in the UK and selling it on for profit in the US.",
      "Though others say they believe it could result in cheaper prices if firms which normally send their goods to the US instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK.",
      "And there may be a significant change if the cost of tariffs is passed onto consumers globally - longer contracts to spread out the cost of the device.",
      "While a phone contract may typically last two years, Mr Wood said some firms already offer four year deals, and he believed \"we might see five-year contracts\" in 2025.",
      "\"One could argue it is almost like having a mortgage for your smartphone,\" he said.",
      "Where are iPhones made?",
      "The US is a major market for iPhones and Apple accounted for more than half of its smartphones sales last year, according to Counterpoint Research.",
      "It says as much as 80% of Apple's iPhones intended for US sale are made in China, with the remaining 20% made in India.",
      "Along with fellow smartphone giants such as Samsung, Apple has been trying to diversify its supply chains to avoid over-reliance on China in recent years.",
      "India and Vietnam emerged as frontrunners for additional manufacturing hubs.",
      "As tariffs took effect, Apple reportedly looked to speed up and increase its production of India-produced devices in recent days.",
      "Reuters reported on Thursday that Apple chartered cargo flights to ship more than 600 tons of iPhones from India to the US.",
      "Amid Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs, including those levied on India, the country may be set to benefit from an iPhone manufacturing boost.",
      "The BBC has approached Apple for comment on the impact of tariffs on their operations and prices, but has not had any response yet.",
      "How exposed is Apple to tariffs?",
      "Trump and his advisors have said the aim of its tariffs are to encourage more US manufacturing.",
      "However, the tech industry relies on a global network of suppliers for product components and assembly.",
      "This, and finding skilled workers to match the fast pace and low cost of production in Asia, means relocating supply chains is no simple feat.",
      "Apple committed a $500bn (\u00a3385bn) investment in the US in February - which the Trump administration believes will result in more homegrown manufacturing.",
      "But Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said shifting parts of its supply chain from cheaper manufacturing hubs in Asia to the US will take a lot of time, and money.",
      "\"The reality is it would take 3 years and $30 billion dollars in our estimation to move even 10% of its supply chain from Asia to the US with major disruption in the process,\" he wrote on X on 3 April.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Will iPhone prices go up?",
      "Apple have not revealed yet whether they plan to pass on the costs of the tariffs onto consumers in the US and increase prices.",
      "Some analysts believe Apple is in a more fortunate position than others, having reaped more money from its products than it has spent on making them.",
      "\"As a company with lucrative margins on its devices, Apple can absorb some of the tariff-induced cost increases without significant financial impact, at least in the short term,\" says Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee.",
      "But he notes the company's strong branding and popularity may allow it to pass some costs to consumers without too much backlash.",
      "\"The brand commands better loyalty than its competitors, and it is unlikely that a manageable price increase will send these customers fleeing into the arms of Android-based competitors.\"",
      "Some estimates suggest iPhone prices in the US could as much as triple if costs were passed to consumers.",
      "Following Trump's tariff increase on China to 125%, the cost for a China-made iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB storage would have surged from $1,199 to $1,999, according to estimates by investment banking firm UBS.",
      "They estimate a less significant increase on the iPhone 16 Pro 128GB storage - which is made in India - by five percent from $999 to $1046.",
      "While some analysts such as Dan Ives have suggested that the cost of a \"Made in USA\" iPhone could soar to as much as $3500.",
      "What can consumers do about it?",
      "There's still plenty of uncertainty about what happens next, and how companies like Apple will respond to tariffs remains to be seen.",
      "This hasn't stopped some US customers reportedly rushing to Apple stores to buy its smartphones.",
      "The BBC spoke to shoppers outside an Apple Store in New York who had bought products in fear of a potential price hike.",
      "Anthony Cacioppo, a 53-year-old DJ and security technician, purchased the new iPhone.",
      "\"I really didn't need a phone... but I'm not ready to pay double the price,\" he said.",
      "Bruce Conroy, a hair stylist, told the BBC that even if prices had risen considerably he \"would have stuck with Apple products\" - though potentially delayed his purchase of a new iPad.",
      "\"I bought it because the tariffs are coming, I want to buy before the prices go up and I expect they will,\" said Julia Baumann, a personal finance editor, of her new MacBook.",
      "We will likely have to wait until the autumn to see how much the next iPhone will cost.",

      "CCS Insight estimates that 5.5m second-hand smartphones will be sold in the UK in 2025, representing 29.7% of the total market.",
      "The iPhone remains one of the most expensive smartphones on the market - and brands such as Google and Samsung offer phones with similar features at a lower cost.",
      "The other option, and perhaps the most cost-effective, could be for people to skip upgrades to newer iPhone models and look to slightly older, cheaper versions.",
      "\"The path of least resistance would be to keep the smartphone they already have for longer,\" said Mr Wood.",

      "Dame Rachel said children were racking up hours of screen time at home instead, and that \"the people with the real power here are the parents\".",
      "Her comments come as the general secretary of the UK's largest teaching union said a government ban on phones would \"take the pressure off schools\".",
      "Dame Rachel told BBC Radio 5Live that the vast majority schools were already restricting and banning phones, adding: \"Blanket ban if you want, but they're doing it.\"",
      "The former head teacher cast doubt on how effective a ban would be on those schools without strict policies, noting that the government can impose rules but \"unless a headteacher really believes it, they won't do it properly\".",

      "\"These children are not spending these hours on their phones while sat in school,\" Dame Rachel said in a new report.",
      "She said schools should educate young people about online risks - but parents and carers needed more help to manage their children's online habits and technology companies must \"take responsibility for making the online world safe\".",
      "She added that she would back any head teacher's decision to ban phones, but added: \"It should always be their choice, based on their knowledge of what's best for the children in their own classrooms, not a direction imposed nationally by the government.\"",
      "However, her report also recommended the government should \"conduct more research into the potential benefits of wider restrictions on children's use of phones, particularly social media\".",

      "A government spokesperson said social media platforms already have to take down illegal material under the Online Safety Act, and the same law would soon protect children from other harmful online content.",
      "And the government has said there is already guidance on how schools can restrict the use of phones, which head teachers can decide how to put into practice.",
      "But Daniel Kebede, the general secretary of the National Education Union, said he believed a government ban on smartphones in schools would \"assist parents, but also take the pressure off schools\".",
      "\"Most schools do have rules in place, but [a ban] would create a uniformity across the school system, which would be very important and ensure that a new culture was developed in which smartphones were not in possession during school time,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The UK government sought to keep details of its row with Apple over requested access to its encrypted cloud storage tool private.",
    "story": [
      "A judge has sided with a coalition of civil liberties groups and news organisations - including the BBC - and ruled a legal row between the UK government and Apple over data privacy cannot be held in secret.",
      "The Home Office wants the right to be able access information secured by Apple's Advanced Data Protection (ADP) system, citing powers given to it under the Investigatory Powers Act.",
      "At the moment Apple has no such capability - such data can only be accessed by the user - and says it does not want to create what it calls a \"backdoor\" into ADP because of concerns it would eventually be exploited by hackers and criminals.",
      "The government's request prompted fierce criticism from privacy campaigners and some US politicians.",
      "In February, Apple pulled ADP from the UK and in March it launched legal proceedings against the government, in a case which is being heard by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal.",
      "The government argued it would damage national security if the nature of the legal action and the parties to it were made public - what are known as the \"bare details of the case\".",
      "In a ruling published on Monday morning, the tribunal rejected that request - pointing to the extensive media reporting of the row and highlighting the legal principle of open justice.",
      "\"It would have been a truly extraordinary step to conduct a hearing entirely in secret without any public revelation of the fact that a hearing was taking place,\" it states.",
      "\"For the reasons that are set out in our private judgement, we do not accept that the revelation of the bare details of the case would be damaging to the public interest or prejudicial to national security,\" it later adds.",
      "In a statement the Home Office said it would not comment on legal proceedings or individual notices but said its \"first priority is to keep people safe.\"",
      "\"There are longstanding and targeted investigatory powers that allow the authorities to investigate terrorists, paedophiles and the most serious criminals and they are subject to robust safeguards including judicial authorisations and oversight to protect people's privacy,\" it added.",
      "It stressed it was not seeking blanket data access - and any requests to view individual accounts protected by ADP would need a court approved warrant.",
      "Wider implications",
      "Civil and digital rights organisations in the UK, which criticised the Home Office request, have welcomed Monday's ruling.",
      "They, along with news organisations  - including the BBC - made legal representations for the case to be heard in public.",
      "\"This is bigger than the UK and Apple,\" said Jim Killock, executive director of Open Rights Group.",
      "\"The Court's judgment will have implications for the privacy and security of millions of people around the world.\"",
      "The Open Rights Group campaigned alongside Big Brother Watch and Index on Censorship against the proposal to hold the hearing in secret.",
      "Big Brother Watch interim director Rebecca Vincent says the judgement is \"effectively chipping away at the pervasive climate of secrecy surrounding the Investigatory Powers Tribunal's consideration of the Apple case\".",
      "\"The Home Office's order to break encryption represents a massive attack on the privacy rights of millions of British Apple users, which is a matter of significant public interest and must not be considered behind closed doors,\" she adds.",

      "\"As we have said many times before we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.\"",
      "How does ADP work?",
      "ADP is an opt-in data security tool designed to provide users of devices such as iPhones with a more secure way to protect data such as photos and notes stored in their iCloud accounts.",
      "It uses what is known as end-to-end encryption (E2EE), meaning only the user has the \"key\" necessary to unscramble and access the data.",
      "E2EE is also used to protect data on messaging services including WhatsApp and Signal.",
      "It makes the data very secure - but poses a problem for law enforcement agencies.",

      "\"I think the government is trying to walk a tightrope here. They can't just shut down thousands of small businesses that employ millions of people - that would be economic suicide.",
      "\"What I'm seeing is more of a carrot-and-stick approach. They're pushing for standards, but also rolling out programs to help small manufacturers upgrade their processes. It's not about wiping out the unorganised sector but gradually bringing them into the fold.\"",

      "Mr Agrawal says his company, Zen Barefoot, is unusual as much of the Indian footwear industry is not very innovative.",
      "\"There are very few people who are ready to take time and invest in new technologies here. Indian manufacturing is a very profit- first market, ROI [return on investment] driven.",

    "title": "Trump had five tariff goals - has he achieved any of them?",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c209x48ndjpo",
    "published": "Fri, 11 Apr 2025 04:01:05 GMT",
    "summary": "The president made a partial reversal this week - here's a look at where it leaves five of his key ambitions.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump announced a massive tariff plan last week that would have upended the global economic order as well as long-established trading relationships with America's allies.",
      "But that plan - or at least a significant part of it - is on ice after the president suspended higher tariffs on most countries for 90 days while leaning into a trade war with China.",
      "So with this partial reversal, is Trump any closer to realising his goals on trade? Here's a quick look at five of his key ambitions and where they now stand.",
      "1) Better trade deals",
      "WHAT TRUMP SAID: For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike",
      "Trump's original trade plan packed a big punch that landed around the world, with a flat 10% baseline tariff on everyone (including some uninhabited islands) and additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on the 60 countries that he said were the worst offenders.",
      "It sent allies and adversaries scrambling, as they stared down the prospect of a debilitating blow to their economies.",
      "The White House has been quick to boast about all the world leaders who have reached out to the president to make deals and offer trade concessions \u2013 \"more than 75\", according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",
      "Although the administration hasn't released a list of all the countries that Trump said on Tuesday were \"kissing my ass\" and promising to do anything, the US has announced it is in negotiations with South Korea and Japan, among others.",
      "THE TAKEAWAY: America's trading partners have 90 days to strike some sort of agreement with Trump, and the clock is ticking. But the fact that talks are happening indicates that the president has a good chance of getting something for his efforts.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?What does the tariff pause mean for global trade?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "What does the tariff pause mean for global trade?",
      "2) Boosting American industry",
      "WHAT TRUMP SAID: Jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country\u2026We will supercharge our domestic industrial base.",
      "Trump has said for decades that tariffs are an effective way of rebuilding America's manufacturing base by shielding it from unfair foreign competition. While some factories may be able to increase production in current facilities, more substantive efforts take time. And for business leaders to pull the trigger on \"reshoring\" their production lines and investing in new US factories, they will want to know that the rules of the game are relatively stable.",
      "The president's on-again, off-again tariff moves over the past week are inherently unstable, however. For the moment, it's difficult to predict where the final tariff levels will land and which industries will receive the greatest protections. It could be car manufacturers and steel producers today, and high-tech electronics companies tomorrow.",
      "THE TAKEAWAY: When tariffs are applied and removed seemingly at the president's whim, it's much more likely that companies \u2013 both in the US and abroad \u2013 will hunker down and wait for the dust to settle before making any big commitments.",
      "3) Facing off with China",
      "WHAT TRUMP SAID: I have great respect for President Xi of China, great respect for China, but they were taking tremendous advantage of us.",
      "After Trump's tariff about-face on Wednesday, several White House officials \u2013 including Treasury Secretary Bessent - were quick to say that Trump's goal was to drop the hammer on the real villain, China.",
      "\"They are the biggest source of the US trade problems,\" Bessent told reporters, \"and indeed they are the problem for the rest of the world.",
      "If Trump wanted a battle of wills with China, testing each side's tolerance for economic and political pain, he got one \u2013 even if the president and his aides have hinted that they are looking for an exit ramp.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump said that he blamed past US leaders, not China, for the current trade dispute. The prior day, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president would be \"incredibly gracious\" if China reaches out to make a deal.",
      "THE TAKEAWAY: Even if this showdown is one Trump wants, picking a fight with the second-largest economy in the world, with military power to match, comes at enormous risk. And along the way America may have alienated the allies it needs most in such a confrontation.",
      "Why Trump is hitting China - and what might happen next",
      "Why Trump is hitting China - and what might happen next",
      "4) Raising revenue",
      "WHAT TRUMP SAID: Now it's our turn to prosper, and in so doing, use trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt, and it'll all happen very quickly.",
      "During last year's presidential campaign, Trump regularly touted that his proposed tariffs would bring in vast sums in new revenue, which the US could then use to shrink its budget deficit, fund tax cuts and pay for new government programmes.",
      "A study last year by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimated that a 10% universal tariff \u2013 which is what Trump has landed on for at least the next 90 days \u2013 would generate $2tn in new revenue over the next 10 years.",
      "To put that in context, the tax cuts Congress recently included in its non-binding budget blueprint would cost approximately $5tn over the next 10 years, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.",
      "THE TAKEAWAY: Trump wanted more tariff revenue, and if he sticks with his baseline tariffs, plus the additional levies on certain imports and larger ones on China, he's going to get it \u2013 at least until Americans switch to more domestic production, when the tariff money gusher could turn to a trickle.",
      "Is the US making $2bn a day from tariffs?",
      "Is the US making $2bn a day from tariffs?",
      "5) Lower prices for US consumers",
      "WHAT TRUMP SAID: Ultimately, more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers. This will be indeed the golden age of America.",
      "Analysts and experts have offered a grab bag of other explanations about why Trump made such an aggressive move on trade last week. Was he trying to drive down interest rates, or devalue the US dollar or bring the world to the table for a new, global agreement on trade? The president himself hasn't spoken much about those kinds of elaborate schemes.",
      "One thing he has talked about relentlessly, however, is his desire to lower costs for American consumers - and he has promised that his trade policy will help address this. While energy prices dipped in the week since Trump announced his tariff plan, that may have been a result of fears that the trade wars could trigger a global recession.",
      "The consensus among economists is that new tariffs will drive up consumer prices, as tariffs are tacked on to the price of imports and, eventually, when there is less competition for US-made products. Last year, the Tax Foundation estimated that a 10% universal tariff would increase costs for American households by an average of $1,253 in its first year. Economists also warn that lower-income Americans will be hardest hit.",
      "THE TAKEAWAY: An increase in prices is an arrow moving in the wrong direction \u2013 and it represents an enormous potential liability for both Trump's political standing and his party's future electoral prospects.",

    "story": [
      "The head of the US military base in Greenland has been fired after she reportedly sent an email distancing herself from Vice-President JD Vance's criticism of Denmark.",
      "The US military's Space Operations Command said Col Susannah Meyers had been removed from her role at Pituffik Space Base due to a \"loss of confidence in her ability to lead\".",
      "Last month, Vance said Denmark had \"not done a good job\" for Greenlanders and had not spent enough on security while visiting the Danish territory.",
      "The alleged email, released by a military news site, told staff Vance's comments were \"not reflective\" of the base. A Pentagon spokesman cited the article, saying \"undermining\" US leadership was not tolerated.",
      "Following Vance's trip, on 31 March, Col Meyers is reported to have written: \"I do not presume to understand current politics, but what I do know is the concerns of the US administration discussed by Vice-President Vance on Friday are not reflective of Pituffik Space Base.\"",
      "Military.com - which published the email - said the contents had been confirmed as accurate to them by the US Space Force.",
      "Appearing to confirm this was the reason for her firing, chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell linked to the Military.com article in a post on X, writing: \"Actions [that] undermine the chain of command or to subvert President [Donald] Trump's agenda will not be tolerated at the Department of Defense.\"",
      "The Space Force's statement announcing Col Meyers' removal on Thursday said that Col Shawn Lee was replacing her.",

      "Col Meyers had assumed command of the Arctic station in July last year. Col Lee was previously a squadron commander at the Clear Space Force Station in Alaska.",
      "During his whirlwind trip, Vance had also reiterated Trump's desire to annex Greenland for security reasons.",

      "Earlier this month, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's official visit saw her stand side-by-side with her Greenlandic counterpart Jens-Frederik Nielsen and his predecessor, Mute Egede.",
      "Speaking to reporters, Frederiksen directly addressed Trump, telling him: \"You can't annex other countries.\"",
      "She added that Denmark was fortifying its military presence in the Arctic, and offered closer collaboration with the US in defending the region.",
      "The US has long maintained a security interest in Greenland as a strategically important territory. It has had a military presence on the island since occupying it following the occupation of Denmark by Nazi Germany during World War Two.",
      "\"If Russia were to send missiles towards the US, the shortest route for nuclear weapons would be via the North Pole and Greenland,\" Marc Jacobsen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, previously told the BBC.",

      "Greenland, the world's largest island, has been under Danish control for around 300 years.",
      "Polls show that the vast majority of Greenlanders want to gain independence from Denmark - but do not wish to become part of the US.",

      "Artist Eedris Abdulkareem's lyrics slam President Bola Tinubu and urge his influential son, Seyi, to let his father know \"people are dying\" through hardship and insecurity and there is \"hunger\" in the country.",
      "In a letter to TV and radio stations, the National Broadcast Commission (NBC), which issues licenses and regulates the industry, ordered the track not to be played, saying it violates the country's broadcast code.",
      "The NBC said it considered Tell Your Papa's content to be \"inappropriate\" and \"objectionable\" adding that it falls short of public decency standards.",
      "Released earlier in the week, the song has gained a lot of attention on social media in Nigeria and has sparked debate regarding the economic and security situation in the country.",
      "On becoming president in May 2023, Tinubu introduced a number of economic reforms which increased the cost of living.",
      "He dropped the fuel subsidy, which had long kept petrol prices low, saying that the government could no longer afford it. Fuel prices then jumped sharply which had a knock-on effect on the rest of the economy.",
      "Annual inflation was above 30% for most of last year and the price of some basic food items increased by even more.",
      "This has led some Nigerians to cut back on the number of meals they eat a day and the amount of food they consume.",
      "There are also worries about the level of insecurity in the country with kidnapping-for-ransom still a major issue and fears that Islamist militant group Boko Haram could make a resurgence in the north-east.",
      "On the track, in a mix of English, Yoruba and Pidgin, Abdulkareem tells Tinubu's son that his father \"is not trying\" and that he has made \"too many empty promises\".",
      "When it comes to insecurity, the artist urges Seyi to travel by road, instead of private jet, to experience the dangers faced by ordinary Nigerians.",
      "Tinubu's government has in the past defended its economic policies saying that the president was aiming to put the country on a stable footing in the long term.",
      "In order to deal with the short-term pain, the authorities have an on-going cash transfer scheme to help 15 million poorer Nigerian households.",
      "When it comes to security, the government has said that the situation has improved in the last 18 months.",
      "As the licensing authority, the NBC can sanction broadcasters for ignoring its orders. In the past they have fined stations and suspended licenses for violations.",
      "Abdulkareem is not new to controversy as he recorded a similar song in the past.",
      "In 2003, he released his most popular tune to date - Nigeria jaga jaga, meaning \"Nigeria has spoiled\".",
      "Then President Olusegun Obasanjo reacted harshly, publicly insulting Abdulkareem. The song was banned for broadcasters but gained  popularity among Nigerians and became a street anthem.",

      "During a visit to the area, Israel Katz said the military was leaving Gaza \"smaller\" and \"more isolated\" to pressure Hamas into releasing the hostages it is still holding.",
      "The military has already seized land running along the entirety of the Palestinian territory's borders, which it has characterised as a buffer zone to prevent attacks.",
      "The expansion to cover Rafah and its surrounding areas - which make up almost one fifth of Gaza - comes after the military ordered civilians to evacuate and established a new corridor separating them from nearby Khan Younis.",
      "Two-thirds of Gaza has been designated as \"no-go\" zones or placed under evacuation orders since Israel resumed its offensive against Hamas on 18 March following the collapse of a two-month ceasefire, according to the UN.",

      "It also seized a strategically important strip of land running along the nearby border with Egypt, known as the \"Philadelphi Corridor\", which it said was necessary to prevent weapons being smuggled into Gaza and Hamas rearming.",
      "During the ceasefire that began in January, about 100,000 residents returned to what was left of their homes in the city after troops pulled back to border areas.",
      "On 31 March, almost two weeks after the resumption of the war, the IDF issued a new sweeping evacuation order that the UN said covered 97% of Rafah and its surrounding governorate, spanning 64 sq km (25 sq miles).",
      "Displaced people were told to head to tent camps in the coastal al-Mawasi area, which the IDF previously designated as a \"humanitarian zone\".",
      "The Rafah area was reported to be almost completely empty when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced three days later that troops were \"seizing the Morag Corridor\" - a reference to a former Jewish settlement located between Rafah and Khan Younis.",
      "He said it would be \"the second Philadelphi\" and would increase pressure on Hamas to hand over the remaining 59 hostages, 24 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "On Wednesday, Defence Minister Israel Katz visited troops deployed in the new corridor with senior Israeli commanders and journalists.",
      "\"The IDF is eliminating terrorists, locating and thwarting terrorist infrastructure, and dismembering the Gaza Strip, even in places like the Morag corridor, where we have not operated to date,\" he said in a video later released by his office.",
      "\"The population of Gaza is being evacuated from the fighting zones, and many areas are being seized and added to the security zones of the State of Israel, leaving Gaza smaller and isolated.\"",
      "Katz also warned that \"if Hamas continues to refuse and does not release the hostages soon, the IDF will carry out intense military operations across all of Gaza\".",
      "An Israeli journalist for the Ynet news website who accompanied the minister separately quoted him as saying: \"All of Rafah will be evacuated and turned into a security area. This is what we are doing now.\"",
      "The BBC has asked the defence minister\u2019s office and the IDF for comment.",
      "On Thursday morning, it said troops were continuing to operate \"in the area of Rafah and along the Morag corridor\", and that they had \"eliminated several terrorists, located and dismantled terrorist infrastructure sites\" while working to \"establish operational control\".",
      "Israeli military analysts suggest there is a plan to push Palestinian civilians towards the coast so that Israeli forces can focus on eliminating Hamas in urban areas.",
      "According to local media, this strategy would also allow the IDF to take control of the delivery of aid to the coast - bypassing both Hamas and international aid agencies.",
      "On Tuesday, the UN said the IDF had issued 15 evacuation orders over the past three weeks, covering almost 131 sq km (51 sq miles), or 36% of Gaza.",
      "Another 30% of the territory was covered by the Israeli-designated \"no-go\" zone along Gaza's borders, and along the Wadi Gaza river valley that separates the north and south of the territory, it added.",

      "Israel's government said it was evacuating civilians to protect them from harm and from being used by Hamas as \"human shields\" in violation of international law.",
      "The UN has also said that Israel's five-week blockade of Gaza violates international law, which requires it to ensure the basic needs of the civilian population under its control are met and allow the rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian assistance.",
      "In a separate development on Thursday, the IDF announced that an strike in eastern Gaza City on Wednesday had killed the commander of Hamas's Shejaiya battalion, whom it identified as Haitham Sheikh Khalil and said had been planning attacks from the area.",

    "story": [
      "A controversial bill seeking to reinterpret New Zealand's founding document, which established the rights of both M\u0101ori and non-M\u0101ori in the country, has been defeated at its second reading.",
      "The Treaty Principles Bill was voted down 112 votes to 11, days after a government committee recommended that it should not proceed.",
      "The proposed legislation sought to legally define the principles of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi - causing widespread outrage that saw more than 40,000 people taking part in a protest outside parliament last year.",
      "The bill had already been widely expected to fail, with most major political parties committed to voting it down.",
      "Members of the right-wing Act Party, which tabled it, were the only MPs to vote for it at the second reading on Thursday. Act's leader David Seymour has promised to continue campaigning on the issue.",
      "\"I believe this Bill or something like it will pass one day because there are not good arguments against its contents,\" he wrote on social media.",
      "Tensions were high during a parliamentary debate on the bill in November. Labour MP Willie Jackson was told to leave after refusing to withdraw a comment he made calling Seymour a \"liar\".",
      "Labour leader Chris Hipkins said the proposed legislation would forever \"be a stain on our country\", while Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori (The M\u0101ori Party) MP Hana R\u0101whiti Maipi-Clarke - who gained international attention for starting a haka in parliament at the bill's first reading - said it had been \"annihilated\".",
      "\"Instead of dividing and conquering, this bill has backfired and united communities across the motu [country] in solidarity for our founding agreement and what it represents,\" Green Party co-leader Marama Davidson later said in a statement.",
      "The second reading came after a select committee, which had been looking into the proposed legislation released its final report - revealing that more than 300,000 submissions had been made on it, the vast majority of which were opposed.",
      "It is the largest response to proposed legislation that the New Zealand parliament has ever received.",
      "While the principles of the Treaty have never been defined in law, its core values have, over time, been woven into different pieces of legislation in an effort to offer redress to M\u0101ori for the wrong done to them during colonisation.",
      "Act's proposed legislation had three main principles: that the New Zealand government has the power to govern, and parliament to make laws; that the Crown would respect the rights of M\u0101ori at the time the Treaty was signed; and that everyone is equal before the law and entitled to equal protection.",
      "The party said the bill would not alter the Treaty itself but would \"continue the process of defining the Treaty principles\". This, they believe, would help to create equality for all New Zealanders and improve social cohesion.",
      "Among those backing it was Ruth Richardson, a former finance minister for the centre-right National Party, who told the select committee that the proposed legislation was \"a bill of consequence whose time has come\".",
      "She argued that while the Treaty itself could not be disputed, the idea of its principles was a \"relatively modern matter\", and that these principles had so far been largely defined by the courts, rather than parliament.",
      "\"There is a new imperative in New Zealand on the cultural front, the necessity to address and correct Treaty overreach that has increasingly and evidently become wayward and wrong,\" she said.",
      "Opponents of the bill, meanwhile, believe it would be detrimental to M\u0101ori and create greater social divides.",
      "Sharon Hawke, the daughter of the late M\u0101ori activist and MP Joe Hawke, spoke to the select committee on behalf of the Ng\u0101ti Wh\u0101tua \u014cr\u0101kei hap\u016b [sub-tribe] - telling it that the legislation \"strips the fabric of where we've been heading for in the last three decades at improving our people's [M\u0101ori's] ability to gain education, gain warm housing, gain good health\".",
      "She added that the bill \"polluted\" the idea of all New Zealanders having a future together.",
      "\"We will continue to show our opposition to this,\" she said.",
      "Key issues identified by members of the public who made submissions to the select committee included that it was inconsistent with the values of the Treaty, and that it had promoted equality with equity - not taking into account social disparities, such as those created by the legacy of colonisation.",
      "There were also concerns about the extent to which the bill complied with international law, and whether it would negatively impact New Zealand's reputation internationally.",
      "Submitters who supported the bill, meanwhile, referred to a current lack of clarity and certainty about the principles of the Treaty, and of the importance of equality for all.",
      "They also said that it was important to hold a referendum to facilitate a national conversation around the Treaty - something David Seymour believes is still needed.",
      "The Treaty Principles Bill passed its first reading in November, with support from National - the dominant party in New Zealand's ruling coalition - who had promised to back it as part of a coalition agreement with Act, but not any further.",
      "Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, who is also leader of the National Party, previously said there was nothing in the bill that he liked. He was not in parliament for its second reading, but remarked earlier in the day that it was time to move on from it.",

      "This week, excited to see a concert by the popular Dominican singer Rubby P\u00e9rez, he took his wife and his sister. Now all three are buried beneath the rubble of the collapsed discotheque, after the roof caved in part way through the performance, leaving at least 218 dead.",
      "\"I haven't heard any news about any of them,\" said Shailyn Pe\u00f1a, M\u00e1ximo's 17-year-old daughter as she sat on a wall outside the devastated venue.",
      "\"It was just another Monday night for them. In fact, my dad invited my mum to come too but at the last minute she decided not to go. It was a blessing in disguise.\"",
      "Behind her as she spoke to me on Wednesday afternoon, a team of rescue workers was meticulously going through the rubble inside the building, listening for the slightest sound of a survivor beneath them.",
      "They had been joined by Israeli and Mexican search teams and were using sophisticated heat-seeking equipment to try to locate anyone still alive.",
      "Shailyn told me her cousin was one of the rescue workers, sifting through the debris for her own uncle, which she said brought her peace of mind that a relative was inside doing everything in her power to try to track M\u00e1ximo down.",
      "But the uncertainty and the endless wait for information were becoming unbearable, Shailyn said.",
      "\"I feel the urge to just go in there and push aside all the rocks and pull him out. But as much as I want to, I really can't. I just have to sit here and wait it out.\"",
      "Hours later, the government released a statement saying that \"all reasonable chances of finding more survivors have been exhausted\" and so the search and rescue mission would give way to the recovery of bodies.",
      "The authorities have been doing what they can to keep the public informed, delivering grim updates on the number of dead, which has risen steadily with every passing hour.",
      "At regular intervals, teams have been emerging from the site carrying bodies covered by blankets on stretchers.",
      "Earlier on, some people were brought out alive, bolstering the hopes of the relatives.",
      "The head of the Emergency Operations Center (COE) said that since the roof collapse, 189 people had been \"rescued alive\".",
      "But by Wednesday evening, officials said that given the conditions at the site observed by the more than 300 rescue workers, they would conclude the rescue phase of their operations \"within hours\".",
      "The president of the Dominican Republic, Luis Abinader, has declared three days of national mourning, a reflection of the scale of the tragedy unfolding at the site.",
      "Among those confirmed to have lost their lives in the accident were some well-known national figures including P\u00e9rez himself, two much-loved former baseball players, Octavio Dotel and Tony Blanco, and a regional governor. And alongside them, scores of merengue music-lovers and P\u00e9rez fans also died in the collapse.",
      "For now, the authorities' focus remains on the recovery operation. However, eventually the questions will turn to the cause of the collapse and government investigators will have to provide meaningful answers to the families in due course.",
      "One theory is already circulating outside the venue. Many are pointing the finger of blame at a fire at the nightclub around two years ago. Some fear the blaze structurally weakened the site or that any repairs carried out were insufficient or not up to code.",
      "The owner of the Jet Set nightclub, Antonio Espaillat, delivered a video message via social media expressing his condolences and those of \"all the Jet Set family\", to the victims' relatives.",
      "He also insisted that he and his team were co-operating \"totally and transparently with the authorities\" over the disaster.",
      "Shailyn Pe\u00f1a has heard about the fire at the nightclub and is among those who thinks it played a part. However, for now she has bigger worries. Despite the family's efforts to protect them, her younger stepsisters found out that their father and mother were trapped under the rubble from other children at school.",
      "They are \"terrified\", she added.",
      "It is Shailyn's birthday on Thursday, a day she would normally celebrate alongside her father, stepmother and aunt.",
      "Instead, she must endure it in the worst possible circumstances, caught inside the worst such tragedy in her country's modern history.",

    "summary": "Amid a trade war with the US, our China correspondent explains why Beijing doesn't need to change tact.",
    "story": [
      "In response to why Beijing is not backing down to Donald Trump on tariffs, the answer is that it doesn't have to.",
      "China's leaders would say that they are not inclined to cave in to a bully \u2013 something its government has repeatedly labelled the Trump administration as \u2013 but it also has a capacity to do this way beyond any other country on Earth.",
      "Before the tariff war kicked in, China did have a massive volume of sales to the US but, to put it into context, this only amounted to 2% of its GDP.",
      "That said, the Communist Party would clearly prefer not to be locked in a trade war with the US at a time when it has been struggling to fix its own considerable economic headaches, after years of a real estate crisis, overblown regional debt and persistent youth unemployment.",
      "However, despite this, the government has told its people that it is in a strong position to resist the attacks from the US.",
      "It also knows its own tariffs are clearly going to hurt US exporters as well.",
      "Trump has been bragging to his supporters that it would be easy to force China into submission by simply hitting the country with tariffs, but this has proven to be misleading in the extreme.",
      "Beijing is not going to surrender.",
      "China's leader Xi Jinping told the visiting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Friday that his country and the European Union should \"jointly resist the unilateral bullying practices\" of the Trump administration.",
      "Sanchez, in turn, said that China's trade tensions with the US should not impede its cooperation with Europe.",
      "Their meeting took place in the Chinese capital in the hours before Beijing again increased its tariffs on goods from the US - though it has said it will not respond to further US tariff increases.",
      "Next week Xi will visit Malaysia, Vietnam and Cambodia. These are all countries which have been hit hard by Trump's tariffs.",
      "His ministers have been meeting counterparts from South Africa, Saudi Arabia and India, talking up greater trade co-operation.",
      "In addition, China and the EU are reportedly in talks about potentially removing European tariffs on Chinese cars, to be replaced by a minimum price instead, to rein in a new round of dumping.",
      "In short, wherever you look, you can see that China has options.",
      "And analysts have said that these mutual tariff increases by the two superpowers are now becoming almost meaningless, as they've already passed the point of cutting out much of the trade between them.",
      "So, the tit-for-tat tariff increases in both directions have become more like symbolism.",
      "China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning has, over the past two days, posted images of Chairman Mao on social media, including a clip during the Korean War when he told the US that \"no matter how long this war lasts we will never yield\".",

    "summary": "India's trade detachment may cushion it as others scramble to adjust to Trump\u2019s 90-day tariff pause.",
    "story": [
      "India is the world's fifth-largest and fastest-growing major economy.",
      "Yet, a recent legacy of protectionism and inward-focused trade policies have held back its global competitiveness.",
      "Its tariffs are high and the share of global exports remains under 2%. India's vast domestic market has fuelled its growth - outpacing many others, economists argue, largely because the rest of the world is slowing. But in a turbulent, increasingly protectionist era, India's instinct for self-reliance may oddly serve as a short-term shield.",
      "As countries scramble to recalibrate in response to shifting US trade policies -  like Donald Trump's latest 90-day tariff pause after weeks of sabre-rattling - India's relative detachment may have helped it weather shocks that have jolted more trade-dependent economies.",
      "\"India's lower exposure to global goods trade could work in our favour. If export-driven economies slow down under tariff pressure, and we continue growing at 6%, we'll start looking stronger by comparison - especially with our large domestic market to fall back on,\" says Rajeswari Sengupta, an associate professor of economics at Mumbai-based Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research.",
      "\"Being trade-shy has turned into an advantage - but we can't afford complacency. To seize new opportunities, India must stay nimble and open up more to trade gradually and strategically,\" she adds.",
      "It may not be easy, given India's long and complicated relationship with trade barriers and tariffs.",
      "In his book India's Trade Policy: The 1990s and Beyond, Columbia University economist and noted trade expert Arvind Panagariya traces the complex and often inconsistent evolution of India's approach to trade.",
      "During the inter-war years, industries like textiles and iron and steel lobbied for - and received - high levels of protection. The chronic shortages of World War Two led to even stricter import controls, enforced through an elaborate licensing system.",
      "While Asian peers such as Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore shifted to export-led strategies in the 1960s - and began posting impressive growth rates of 8\u201310% annually - India chose to double down on import substitution. As a result, imports as a share of GDP shrank from 10% in 1957\u201358 to just 4% by 1969\u201370.",
      "By the mid-1960s, India had banned imports of consumer goods altogether. This not only removed the pressure on domestic producers to improve quality but also denied them access to world-class inputs and technology.",
      "As a result, Indian products lost their competitiveness in global markets and exports stagnated. The resulting foreign exchange shortages led to even tighter import controls, creating a vicious cycle that stifled growth. Between 1951 and 1981, per capita income grew at a sluggish pace of just 1.5% a year.",
      "The turning point came in 1991. Faced with a balance-of-payments crisis, India dismantled many import controls and let the rupee depreciate - a move that gave a much-needed boost to exporters and domestic producers competing with imports. Import licensing on consumer goods ended only in 2001, after the World Trade Organisation (WTO) ruled against it.",
      "The impact was striking: between 2002\u201303 and 2011\u201312, India's exports of goods and services surged six-fold, soaring from $75bn to over $400bn.",
      "With trade liberalisation and other reforms, India's per capita income grew more in the first 17 years of the 21st Century than it did throughout the entire 20th Century, notes Prof Panagariya.",
      "But the pushback to trade didn't end.",
      "Trade liberalisation in India was reversed twice - in 1996\u201397 and again since 2018 - with extensive use of anti-dumping measures to block imports from the most competitive sources, according to Prof Panagariya.",
      "\"Many post-colonial states like India harbour a deep-rooted suspicion that international commerce and trade are simply new forms of colonisation. Unfortunately, this mindset still lingers among some policymakers -  and that's a shame,\" says Vivek Dehejia, a professor of economics at Carleton University in Canada.",
      "Many economists argue that a decade of protectionist policies has undercut Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Make in India initiative, which focused on capital and technology-intensive sectors while sidelining labour-intensive industries like textiles. As a result, the programme has struggled to deliver meaningful gains in manufacturing and exports.",
      "\"If foreigners cannot sell their goods to us, they will not have the revenues to pay for the goods they buy from us. If we cut back on their goods, they will have to cut back on ours,\" Prof Panagariya wrote.",
      "Such protectionism has also led to allegations of cronyism.",
      "\"Tariffs have created protectionism in several Indian industries, disincentivising investments in efficiency by cosy incumbents and allowing them to steadily garner market power by building up concentrated positions,\" according to Viral Acharya, a professor of economics at New York University Stern School of Business.",
      "With the US turning inward and China under pressure, countries belonging to the European Union are scrambling for reliable trade partners - and India could be one of them. To seize this moment, economists believe India must lower its tariffs, boost export competitiveness and signal its openness to global trade.",
      "Sectors like garments, textiles and toys present a golden opportunity, especially for the medium and small-scale sectors. But after a decade of stagnation, the big question is: can they scale up - and will the government back them?",
      "If Trump follows through on his tariff plans after the current pause, India could see a $7.76bn - or 6.4% - drop in exports to the US this year, according to an estimate by Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think tank. (In 2024, India exported $89bn worth of goods to the American market.)",
      "\"The Trump tariffs are expected to deliver a mild blow to India's merchandise exports to the US,\" says Ajay Srivastava of  GTRI.",
      "He emphasises the need for India to broaden its trade base after securing a balanced deal with the US. This includes fast-tracking agreements with the EU, UK and Canada, while deepening ties with China, Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Asean.",
      "At home, real impact hinges on reforms: simpler tariffs, a smoother goods and services tax (GST), better trade processes and fair implementation of quality controls. Without these, India risks missing the global moment.",

      "It was a typical Friday lunchtime in Beirut's southern suburb. Then, a single warning, posted in Arabic on X by a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), triggered panic and chaos in the densely populated area known as Dahieh.",
      "\"Urgent warning to those in the southern suburb of Beirut,\" it read. The post included a map of a residential area, marking a building in red and two nearby schools. The IDF identified the building as a Hezbollah facility, and ordered the immediate evacuation of the schools.",
      "An air strike was imminent.",
      "What followed were scenes of sheer panic. Parents rushed towards the threatened area to collect their children from the schools, while residents fled in the opposite direction, visibly shaken and fearful.",
      "\"It was total chaos,\" recalls Ahmad Alama, the director of St Georges School, one of those highlighted on the map. \"We tried to contain the situation as much as we could, but it was crazy.\"",
      "The area was soon cleared, and Israeli forces destroyed the marked building, which they said was a warehouse storing Hezbollah drones.",
      "The strike, carried out two weeks ago, was the first on Dahieh \u2013 an area with a strong Hezbollah presence \u2013 since a ceasefire ending the war between Israel and Hezbollah took effect last November.",
      "It came hours after two rockets were launched from southern Lebanon towards northern Israel. Israel said it intercepted one rocket, while the other fell short of the border.",
      "Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant and political group, denied involvement. Israel described the rocket fire as a ceasefire \"violation\", while the office of Lebanon's president, Joseph Aoun, condemned the Israeli strike as a \"violation of the agreement\".",

      "On 1 April, a second Israeli strike hit the area \u2013 this time without warning \u2013 killing a Hezbollah commander and three other people, according to the Lebanese health ministry.",
      "Evacuation drills",
      "Mr Alama has been running St Georges School for 30 years. It serves around 1,000 children of all ages, boys and girls. Although religion is part of the curriculum for older pupils, he describes the school as secular.",
      "It is also well-known in the community for its association with the Lebanese pop star and talent show judge, Ragheb Alama \u2013 Ahmad Alama's brother and the school's owner.",
      "The recently destroyed building lies just metres from the school. It isn't the only nearby scene of devastation. Another building, opposite one of St Georges' gates, remains a massive pile of rubble \u2013 brought down by Israeli air strikes before the ceasefire.",
      "During the war, the schools were closed. They didn't have to deal with situations such as the one they faced. Now reopened, they are braced for the possibility of more bombing.",
      "The school has devised evacuation plans, designating emergency meeting points in the basement and routes for pupils and staff to follow in case of any danger.",
      "There are also new communication plans with parents to prevent a repeat of the chaos of last month's strike. Children are now routinely reminded of these procedures, with regular evacuation drills.",
      "Students, staff, and parents alike are traumatised by what happened, Mr Alama says.",
      "Initially, the school considered cutting back on extracurricular activities to make up for lost learning, but they changed their minds.",
      "\"We decided otherwise,\" Mr Alama says. \"Pupils shouldn't pay the price for something they aren't responsible for. We've actually ended up increasing these activities \u2013 these kids need to release some of the pressure on them.\"",
      "Reminders everywhere",
      "Nearly five months into the ceasefire, the return of Israeli air strikes to Beirut has intensified fears of a return to all-out war.",
      "The ceasefire was meant to end more than 13 months of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, which began when Hezbollah launched attacks on Israeli military positions the day after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, saying it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.",

      "But amid these signs of normality, scenes of destruction serve as a reminder of the pounding this area endured just months ago.",
      "Some 346 buildings in the area were destroyed and another were 145 partly damaged by Israeli air strikes, according to a municipal official. Israel said it targeted Hezbollah facilities and weapons caches.",
      "In many neighbourhoods, the rubble is still being cleared. The roar of bulldozers and jackhammers drilling into piles of debris is almost constant.",

      "Before the war, Burj High School had around 600 pupils. Now, it has barely 100.",
      "Many parents are reluctant to send their children back amid the scenes of destruction and the constant buzz of machinery. Others were concerned about the health risks, with thick dust still filling the air.",
      "After the ceasefire, owners of the private school made some basic repairs at their own expense.",
      "Hezbollah, which is banned as a terrorist organisation in many countries but in Lebanon is a political and social movement as well as a paramilitary force, has given those who lost their homes $12,000 for a year's rent and has offered to cover the costs of repairs to apartments. However, schools and other institutions have not received any aid.",
      "The Lebanese government has pledged to set up a reconstruction fund, which the World Bank estimates will cost $11bn nationwide. But international donors are believed to be insisting on the disarmament of Hezbollah and political reform \u2013 conditions that appear a distant prospect.",

    "summary": "Some analysts say that if costs incurred by tariffs pass to consumers, US iPhone prices could rise by hundreds of dollars.",
    "story": [
      "The world's most popular gadgets - phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches - could be about to get a lot more expensive in the US.",
      "Many of them are made in China, which now faces a 145% tariff on its goods imported to the US, under President Donald Trump's controversial trade policy.",
      "The effect this may have on the iPhone and its maker Apple is under the spotlight - with some analysts saying if costs are passed onto consumers, iPhone prices in the US could rise by hundreds of dollars.",
      "And if the tariffs impact the value of the dollar, it could become more expensive to import iPhones and other devices around the world - potentially leading to higher prices in UK shops.",
      "Ben Wood of CCS Insight told the BBC that if tariffs remain in place, Apple may raise iPhone prices globally when the next iteration is launched.",
      "\"It is unlikely the company would want to have differentiated pricing globally,\" he said - as the tech giant would want to avoid people buying the device cheaply in the UK and selling it on for profit in the US.",
      "Though others say they believe it could result in cheaper prices if firms which normally send their goods to the US instead send them to countries which don't have such steep tariffs, like the UK.",
      "And there may be a significant change if the cost of tariffs is passed onto consumers globally - longer contracts to spread out the cost of the device.",
      "While a phone contract may typically last two years, Mr Wood said some firms already offer four year deals, and he believed \"we might see five-year contracts\" in 2025.",

      "When F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote \"The Great Gatsby\" at the height of the roaring '20s, he couldn't possibly realize that the book would emerge as one of the very top contenders for \"the great American novel.\"",
      "In fact, when Fitzgerald \u2013 a St. Paul, Minnesota native whose debut novel \"This Side of Paradise\" launched him into national prominence at the age of 24 \u2013 died in 1940 at the early age of 44, the book was already in danger of falling into obscurity.",
      "Now, 100 years after the book's first publication on April 10, 1925, it endures as one of the country's foremost tales of American hubris, modern yearning and class consciousness. And its clear-eyed assessment of the attainability of the American dream remains incisive with each passing decade.",
      "Fitzgerald's book, long a staple in high school literature classes, tells the story of Nick Carraway, a Midwesterner (and veiled Fitzgerald stand-in) who becomes enamored with the bon vivant, Jazz Age lifestyle on Long Island, specifically the effects of mutli-millioniare Jay Gatsby.",
      "Like Carraway, Gatsby is a Midwesterner who has trekked to the East Coast to make a name for himself. It's Carraway's cousin Daisy Buchanan who serves as the catalyst for Gatsby's downfall, and ultimately Carraway's own disillusionment. All the while, a symbolic green light beckons from the distance.",
      "When the book was first published, reviews were largely positive, though not unanimous. Fitzgerald, who originally wanted to title the book \"Trimalchio in West Egg\" before being persuaded to go with a title he thought far more generic, watched as the book languished on the vine commercially, selling fewer than 25,000 copies in the initial push.",
      "He would only complete one further novel in his lifetime: 1934's \"Tender is the Night,\" a thinly-veiled roman \u00e0 clef of Fitzgerald's own marriage to socialite Zelda Sayre, detailing their mutual descent into alcoholism and mental illness. Fitzgerald's early death from a heart attack was likely fuelled by years and years of alcohol abuse. Ironically, he'd gone sober just ahead of the cardiac event.",
      "If \"The Great Gatsby\" never achieved the level of esteem it now enjoys during the author's own life, it wasn't long after his death that Fitgerald's literary reputation took off.",
      "When the Modern Library asked authors, historians, critics and publishers on the eve of Y2K to rank their picks for the world's best novels of the 20th century, it was \"The Great Gatsby\" that\u00a0stood above all other U.S. contenders near the top of the poll. (The novel landed in second place, bookended by Irish author James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" and \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" in the top three.)",
      "The novel has since launched multiple film adaptations, has been transposed to the stage, and since going into the public domain in 2021, has been the subject of an endless array of reimaginings, remixes and mashups. It's even cleared space around itself as a modern-day meme, in the form of an animated .GIF depicting Leonardo Dicaprio (playing Gatsby in Baz Luhrmann's 2013 film adaptation) smirking as he offers a champagne toast flanked by ostentatious fireworks.",
      "Host of \"Gatsby\" centennial events planned in New York, Minnesota",

      "There is also a rowdy \"Roaring Twenties\" party scheduled at the Empire Steak House in New York, which was an opulent opera house in Fitzgerald's era. Billed as the \"nation's most extravagant celebration,\" the event will feature live jazz, period dancing, and speeches from officials with the New York Public Library.",
      "In Fitzgerald's hometown of St. Paul, the events include a new exhibit of the author's life and times at the Minnesota History Center, as well as various, less-than-sober events leaning into the novel's party-friendly Prohibition-era setting.",

What I'm trying to do is appeal to a particular segment that I don't feel has been approached properly. You know, you can't approach any two groups the same way, and I would like to get into the hearts and minds of women who, for example, wouldn't have a copy of Ms. magazine in their house.

      "\"The first thing my dad said is, 'This is an accurate portrayal of what it was to love and fear this woman.' Once I knew that I had gotten her right, everything else flowed,\" she said during an appearance on \"CBS Mornings\" on Wednesday.",
      "The book details Hanks' six-month journey along Interstate 10 from California to Florida, during which she sought to better understand Susan Dillingham \u2014 who died in 2002 \u2014 and reflect on her own difficult childhood.",
      "\"I'm just another girl trying to make sense of her dead, crazy mother,\" Hanks said.",
      "Hanks revealed that while growing up, she had language to understand addiction \u2014 her mother hosted 12-step programs in their home \u2014 but lacked vocabulary for mental illness.",
      "\"My mom \u2014 I had language for addiction because we used to host 12-step programs in our house, and my mom would have sponsees stay with us. I had a language even from 8 years old about addiction, but there was no language for mental health and what was sort of wrong in the house,\" Hanks explained. \"A lot of the book is me trying to create that language and share it.\"",
      "The author described her mother's \"fluid\" relationship with reality, saying in the book that \"mom's relationship with reality was fluid. Truth was fed through the meat grinder of mental illness.\"",
      "She detailed both emotional and physical abuse in her childhood home. Hanks explained that in California during the late 1980s, family law typically required evidence of physical abuse before a child could be removed from a situation.",
      "\"Family law in California in the late '80s wasn't enough room for it. At that time, you kind of had to have the receipts of physical abuse to get pulled out of a situation. And once we crossed that rubicon is when I moved to Los Angeles,\" she said.",
      "What Hanks learned about her mother",
      "Despite the difficult relationship, Hanks said she remained protective of her mother. In writing the memoir, she incorporated her mother's poetry as a way to reconnect with her.",
      "\"At the time, my mom kind of had this stance like a thoroughbred who had been put out to pasture too soon, and she didn't get her chance as an artist because of my dad's, as I describe it, catastrophic fame,\" Hanks said. \"I think including her poetry in the book is a way of treating her seriously as an artist and getting back into conversation with her. And anybody who's buried a parent knows that a two-way conversation suddenly becomes a one-way conversation.\"",
      "When asked about the truth she now understands, Hanks reflected, \"The truth is, my mother had good days and bad days. And I was lucky to experience the good days, and I was shaped by the bad days. All of the care and protection I had for the child that I was doesn't diminish what happened between us. But it means that as I get older, there's more wiggle room and acceptance for her flaws and mine.\"",
      "The memoir also explores themes of place and identity. As a journalist accustomed to interviewing others, Hanks discovered, \"When you're talking to stone-cold strangers, you can't start with, 'Tell me about your mom,' but you can start with, 'Tell me where you're from.' If someone wants to talk about their hometown, it's an elevator to their deepest self.\"",
      "She added, \"Identity and where you're from, that's the whole story. I learned that I'm the product of where I'm from.\"",

      "I had come from a world of higher-end restaurants, of finesse and creativity. So a tapas restaurant was not exactly what I was looking for. But my new partners in Washington, DC, had a clear idea: they wanted to open a Spanish restaurant that was fun. They called it Jaleo, which means \"merrymaking, a joyful celebration,\" inspired by the John Singer Sargent painting of a Spanish woman dancing to guitars. It lives in Boston, but it had traveled on loan to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and they had seen it there. They even painted a reproduction of it on a wall of the new restaurant.",
      "I understood that sense of joy. I'm the kind of guy who doesn't like tables. I prefer standing up at bars. If I can, I like to hop around to five different bars and eat good food at each one. Jaleo was a chance to show how I like to enjoy life. These little plates of tapas were also a chance to give people more access to different bites of Spanish food, different tastes of the various regions of Spain. Maybe people didn't know what they wanted to eat, and the small plates would be a way to move a little bit further out of their comfort zones. Of course, it was an opportunity to make a mark for myself. And I could do that while being a kind of ambassador for my country, in the capital of the United States, not too far from the White House and the US Capitol. It felt like an extension of my military service, going from port to port on a historic tall-mast ship, showing the best of Spain to the world.",
      "I knew there were immigrants before me who had brought Spanish food to every corner of America. They opened restaurants, maybe some of them played guitar or danced flamenco. They were mythical places. Tio Pepe in Baltimore. Caf\u00e9 San Martin in New York. Montse Guill\u00e9n's El Internacional in Tribeca, which was short-lived but put Spanish food and drink on the map. There was already a high-end Spanish restaurant in Washington called Taberna del Alabardero, and the more informal Churreria Madrid in Adams Morgan.",
      "Washington at that time was not seen as a culinary mecca, even by the people of DC, and Jaleo opened in a downtown neighborhood, known as Penn Quarter, that was empty at night. But it would not stay that way. It would become a very important part of the city, not too far away from where all the big decisions were made that affected the country and the world. It was a part of the city where senators, congressmen, lobbyists, and business executives would gather. It was the home of new businesses like America Online, and so many other amazing new companies. Slowly but surely, Jaleo became a huge success.",
      "That's not to say it was easy. I was young, just twenty-three years old, and I was still learning how to run a kitchen. The movie in my head cast me as the creative guy, but now I needed to learn how to run the place. Fortunately, I had a wonderful, patient teacher: Ann Cashion, who was the first executive chef of Jaleo, showed me how to do the job properly, even though I preferred the creative side of things.",
      "We didn't really know whether American diners would accept these little plates, or the idea of sharing plates at all. What happened if people didn't want to share? Our waiters were concerned and would often tell me how some people said they weren't comfortable with sharing. I had a simple answer. If they didn't want to share, they could move the plate ten inches closer to them and use their knife and fork to protect the dish for themselves. I wasn't going to Americanize tapas for them. It's what we did in the south of Spain and in Catalonia. They would adapt because it was a fun way to be with friends. Who doesn't want to dig a fork into the plate of the person across the table?",
      "My heart was full of the joy that comes from introducing Spanish food to new people. That joy translated into happy guests eating the dishes I knew. Jaleo was a place where I could share what I knew about Spanish food: croquetas, gazpacho, gambas al ajillo, sangria. But it was also a way to learn more about what I didn't know about Spanish food. I had not traveled all across Spain at the age of twenty-three, nor did I know about all of Spanish gastronomy. Far from it. The reality is that you need to keep learning in any line of work. People say I'm one of the biggest experts in Spanish cooking, but I still feel clueless sometimes. Every time I go back to Spain and discover a new ingredient or a new dish, it feels to me the same as looking at the stars. You can see a few, but how many more are out there that you cannot see? You can read books, and you can travel, but learning is a lifetime of curiosity and discovery.",
      "Sometimes that work can feel less joyful and more of struggle. In particular, in those early days, it was a struggle to buy the right ingredients. Believe it or not, I'm a pragmatic guy. You can support the local economy, buying local fruit and vegetables for instance. But there are some ingredients that cannot be replaced. I observed the success of Italy, where they have been amazingly successful in supporting the small towns where their unique food products are made. I believed we could do the same for the small towns and food producers of Spain. Manchego cheese is like no other. Sweet roasted piquillo peppers are unique. Our olive oil is the envy of Europe, and even gets repackaged under Italian names. Our sherry vinegar is unmatched. And nothing compares to our pure-bred Ib\u00e9rico ham, the very best ham in the world. You can't have Spanish cooking without some of the staples. It was a symbiotic relationship.",
      "Still, importing food is not always easy. There are regulations and policies, rules to protect consumers and businesses. The US Department of Agriculture insists that slaughterhouses operate according to American standards, not European ones, if they want to sell their meat in the United States. They need to be inspected, even though Europeans have been eating these foods for centuries without any problems. It was crazy but also fascinating. Of course, it wasn't just a question of safety; there were concerns that ham from Spain would hurt ham in America. So one day I met a bearded man visiting Washington, and he happened to be a great Ib\u00e9rico ham producer who was investing to comply with US regulations at his slaughterhouse: Santiago Mart\u00edn, the owner of Embutidos Ferm\u00edn. I helped producers like Santiago navigate these challenges with Congress and the administration, finding a lawyer who assisted the Italians in bringing Parma ham to America. Because in reality these European hams were much more expensive than the American hams, and they helped elevate the perception of all pork products in America. It was a win-win for America and Spain.",
      "That's the world of work. Your commitment to your values, to what's important, can turn a seemingly small decision\u2014like buying a type of roasted pepper or a slice of ham\u2014into something as big as international relations.",
      "Your sense of responsibility is what matters. How was I going to be a Spanish chef without all these ingredients? I had to do the work, just like other chefs and importers who made Spanish food available in the United States. People like Tim Harris, who created the incredible Spanish food store La Tienda, and Juana Gimeno Faraone, who started La Espa\u00f1ola Meats. Or Almudena de Llaguno and Steve Metzler bringing Spanish wines to America; and Jorge Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, who would walk the streets of Manhattan with a big bag filled with wine bottles, trying to get his wines into a few restaurants. The whole ecosystem of Spanish food people kept me going, and I needed to play my part, too.",
      "So Jaleo became much more than a restaurant; it was a way to build bridges between these two countries, to inspire American chefs to buy and cook with Spanish ingredients, to spread the culture that made me who I am. Something like 80 percent of all restaurants close before they reach their five-year anniversary. Jaleo has now been open for thirty years, and we have new Jaleos in Orlando, Las Vegas, and even Dubai. Because we committed from the first year to what we value\u2014to what matters\u2014even when we didn't yet have all the expertise to make it happen.",
      "I feel a sense of joy when I see Ib\u00e9rico ham, or Spanish anchovies, or wines from the Bierzo region in restaurants and shops. I know that nothing would have happened without the persistence and vision of so many people who may now be forgotten. They built the bridges that will last forever\u2014because they cared so deeply.",
      "Follow what you feel is your purpose\u2014not what others tell you to do. Otherwise you lose your soul and become a commodity. Don't be a commodity. Be true to yourself.",

      "Texas doctors on high alert",
      "The death of a second unvaccinated child with measles in West Texas has doctors in North Texas, like Dr. Carla Garcia Carreno, the Children's Medical Center Plano director for infection prevention and control, on high alert.",
      "\"Measles, as we know, it's a preventable disease. Unfortunately, a majority of the cases that we're seeing right now in the outbreak are in unvaccinated people,\" Garcia Carreno said.",
      "Garcia Carreno said the hospital has been preparing to see patients in North Texas since the measles outbreak started in West Texas in January.",
      "\"They need to be seen, and it's very important to try to get the test as early as possible and isolate those people that are suspected to have the measles or have the measles,\" Garcia Carreno said.",
      "Garcia Carreno   said to check your medical records to see if you've gotten the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. You can get a blood test if you can't find your vaccine history. The blood test checks for measles antibodies.",
      "\"We do need to have a population that is immune against measles,\" Garcia Carreno said. \"At least 95% of the population needs to be protected, either immune because of the vaccination or because they have a history of having had the infection.\"",
      "Garcia Carreno said the vaccine is 93% effective after one dose and 97% effective after two doses. Babies as young as six months can get an early dose.",
      "\"Unvaccinated adults can receive the vaccine with doses at least 28 days apart,\" Garcia Carreno said.",
      "About 20%of unvaccinated children who get measles may need to be hospitalized, and between one to three cases in every 1,000 is fatal.",
      "\"If you get the measles and are unvaccinated, your immune system is going to be suppressed for weeks to months and seven to 10 years later, even more than that, you can have a very fatal, brain inflammation,\" Garcia Carreno said.",
      "Experts said it's even more important to get vaccinated ahead of the busy summer travel season to keep the virus under control.",
      "CDC teams deploy",
      "Kennedy said Sunday that in March, he deployed a CDC team \"to bolster local and state capacity for response across multiple Texas regions, supply pharmacies and Texas-run clinics with needed MMR vaccines and other medicines and medical supplies, work with local schools and healthcare facilities to support contact investigations, and to reach out to communities, including faith leaders, to answer any questions or respond to locations seeking healthcare.\"",
      "The Health Secretary said, at Gov. Greg Abbott's request, CDC teams have been redeployed to Texas.",
      "Experts and local health officials expect the outbreak to go on for several more months if not a year. In West Texas, the vast majority of cases are in unvaccinated people and children younger than 17.",
      "With several states facing outbreaks of the vaccine-preventable disease, some worry that measles may cost the U.S. its status as having eliminated the disease.",
      "Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the CDC. The first shot is recommended for children ages 12 to 15 months, and the second for ages 4 to 6 years.",

    "summary": "Consumers fraudulently enrolled in Affordable Care Act coverage could receive unexpected tax bills \u2014 possibly their only clue they've been victimized.",
    "story": [
      "Because of past fraud by rogue brokers, some Affordable Care Act policyholders may get an unexpected tax bill this season.",
      "But that isn't the only potential shock. Other changes coming soon - stemming from proposals by the administration of President Donald Trump - could affect their coverage and its cost. And sorting out related problems and challenges may take longer as federal workers are laid off and funding for assistance programs is cut.",
      "First up: taxes",
      "Tax season is when some consumers learn they were fraudulently enrolled in an ACA plan or switched to a different one without their knowledge.",
      "Those unauthorized enrollments or changes took off in late 2023 and continued through last year, drawing more than 274,000 complaints in the first eight months of 2024 to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, mostly about rogue agents or call centers.",
      "Tax problems can arise if those enrollments resulted in premium tax credits exceeding the amount the consumer should have received. In those cases, consumers may have to pay all or part of those credits back. The amount owed could range from a few hundred dollars to thousands, with some caps based on income.",
      "The first clue some people have is when they get a 1095-A form in the mail.",
      "Those documents are sent out by the state and federal marketplaces to the IRS and ACA enrollees, showing any tax credit payments made to health insurers on a taxpayer's behalf. Taxpayers use the premium tax credit information from the 1095-A when completing their return.",
      "Returns can be held up if the IRS has information indicating the taxpayer has ACA coverage that they failed to report on their return, or if there are other discrepancies.",
      "The Biden administration last year took steps to slow the fraudulent switching, including requiring a three-way call between the broker, client, and marketplace for some enrollment issues.",
      "\"While we may be seeing less [fraud], we're still dealing with 2024 taxes,\" said Erin Kinard, director of systems and intake for the Health and Economic Opportunity Program at Pisgah Legal Services, a nonprofit serving western North Carolina that offers both legal help and assistance with ACA problems.",
      "Consumers who suspect they were fraudulently enrolled should immediately call their federal or state ACA marketplace, experts say. Some consumers will be referred to special federal caseworkers throught he marketplaces. But some of those caseworkers are now part of the broad reduction in force by theTrump administration.",
      "In recent days, \"they laid off two divisions on the Affordable Care Act side,\" said Jeffrey Grant, who oversaw ACA issues as CMS' deputy director for operations in the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight before leaving in February.",
      "With fewer caseworkers, \"it will take longer to get problems taken care of,\" said Grant, who is now president of Schedule F Healthcare Strategies, a consulting group that aims to help laid-off federal workers find new jobs. \"The marketplace is twice as big as it was the last time the Trump administration was here, and now they are cutting caseworkers to less than were around then.\"",
      "CBS News 24/7 is answering your questions about tariffs in a special airing on Wednesday at 6 p.m. ET. Download the\u00a0CBS News app\u00a0on your phone or connected TV to watch it live.",
      "And these cases are difficult because the rogue brokers who enrolled consumers sometimes misstated their income so they would qualify for the largest tax credits possible. Other consumers have found they were enrolled even though they had affordable employer coverage, making them ineligible for ACA subsidies.",
      "That's what happened to Anthony Akra and his wife, Ashley Zukoski, in Charlotte, North Carolina. They were enrolled in a plan without their knowledge in 2023, by a broker in Florida with whom they had never spoken. The couple had health insurance through Zukoski's employer. The broker listed an income that qualified the household for a large subsidy that fully offset the monthly premium cost, so the couple never received a bill. One day, a 1095-A form showed up in their mailbox.",
      "\"I didn't know what the hell it was,\" said Akra, who said the form showed that he had been receiving hundreds of dollars a month in premium tax credits.",
      "He would owe a big chunk of that back unless he could get the plan retroactively canceled. Because their pharmacy, part of a national chain, had switched them to the new plan, also without telling them, they had used the new coverage every time they filled a prescription. That inadvertent use of the policy complicated their efforts to get the fraudulent coverage revoked.",
      "Meanwhile, the IRS withheld more than $4,000 from their tax refund based on the information sent through that 1095-A form.\u00a0 Months passed, but with assistance from a \"navigator\" program \u2014 a government-fundednonprofit that helps people deal with insurance problems \u2014 they were able to get the incorrectinsurance canceled and a refund at the end of October.",
      "It is not unusual for people to spend weeks or even months trying to sort out the mess, said Kinard, whose organization is similar to the one that helped Akra.",
      "While navigator programs nationwide are still operating to help people sign up for health coverage or address issues, the Trump administration has targeted their funding for a 90% cut. Meanwhile, ACA enrollees may face a range of other surprises due to policy and budget steps proposed by the Trump administration.",
      "More Potential Changes",
      "Congress must decide whether to extend premium tax credits that were enhanced during the covid pandemic, which expanded eligibility for the credits and made them larger for many enrollees. Keeping them in place would be expensive, with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation estimating it would add $335 billion to the deficit through 2034.",
      "That debate will come amid another deficit-affecting decision: whether to extend tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration, which would add trillions to the budget deficit through 2034.",
      "If the enhanced subsidies are not renewed, monthly premium costs would rise by an average of over 75%, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. Premiums could more than double in some states, including many GOP-led ones, such as Texas, Mississippi, Utah, Wyoming, and West Virginia.",
      "That could spark a political backlash. Additionally, the enhanced subsidies are seen as a main reason for strong enrollment growth, leading to more than 24 million people signing up for ACA plans for this year.",
      "A recent KFF study found the 15 states with the most enrollment growth since 2020 were all won by Trump in 2024.",
      "A proposed rule released last month by the Trump administration includes provisions to shorten the annual enrollment period, get rid of a special open enrollment period that allows low-income people to sign up year-round, and require stricter verification of income and other information when people apply for coverage. The administration says most of these steps are needed to reduce fraud in the system.",
      "The administration estimates that 750,000 to 2 million fewer people would enroll in coverage as a result of the changes.",
      "The new rule, if finalized, will make it harder for people to enroll, said Xonjenese Jacobs, director of Florida Covering Kids & Families at the University of South Florida College of Public Health. Losing the year-round enrollment for very low-income people, for example, would affect people short on cash who move often to stay with relatives or friends, and those who have unsteady employment, making it hard to know when or where to enroll and what their income might be in the coming year.",
      "\"They don't have the same ability to plan,\" Jacobs said. \"It's definitely going to make a difference for a lot of the individuals that we service.\""

    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has begun redeploying staff to respond to the deadly outbreak of measles in Texas, a spokesperson said Monday, a week after steep layoffs at the agency impacted its response to the spread of the virus.",
      "\"A team of three deployed yesterday to meet with county and state officials to assess the immediate needs to respond to this outbreak. The team is meeting with officials again today,\" CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald said in an email.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. first said Sunday that the CDC would be redeploying to Texas at its governor's request, after another unvaccinated child died in the measles outbreak. An 8-year-old girl was the second fatality there this year.",
      "\"Once the assessment is complete, more CDC staff will be sent to Texas per Sec. Kennedy's order and the governor's request. The first teams deployed to Texas arrived on March and returned to CDC on April 1,\" McDonald said.",
      "Multiple agency staff working on the CDC's measles response were among the thousands cut from the agency last week, officials have told CBS News.",
      "A handful of employees at agencies within the department have been brought back to work so far, multiple officials said, at least through the end of the 60 day period before their layoff notices formally take effect.",
      "McDonald did not comment on whether laid-off staff who had been working on the agency's measles response would be among those Kennedy might reinstate.",
      "The ongoing outbreak in Texas and neighboring states has driven this year's tally of U.S. measles cases to the highest levels seen since a large wave of cases in 2019, which was the worst in the U.S. in decades.",
      "While dozens of measles cases are reported every year, usually linked to undervaccinated travelers returning from trips outside the country, health authorities have warned that ongoing community spread of the virus this year is now threatening America's status of having eliminated endemic spread of the virus.",
      "There have been six measles outbreaks so far this year, a CDC spokesperson told CBS News on Friday. The outbreak in Texas and neighboring states makes up the majority of cases. Smaller outbreaks are also ongoing in New Jersey, Georgia, Ohio and Kansas.",
      "Details of the sixth outbreak have not yet been released, the spokesperson said, citing patient privacy.",
      "Kennedy calls vaccine \"most effective way\" to stop measles spread",
      "While in Texas, Kennedy also posted on X that the \"most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.\" The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella, and is normally given in two doses in early childhood.",
      "Kennedy's range of statements about the measles vaccine in recent weeks have drawn scrutiny from health experts, including after a Fox News interview in which he falsely inflated the shot's risks.",
      "In a later post, Kennedy also said he had met with \"two extraordinary healers\" who he said have \"healed some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children using aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin.\"",
      "Budesonide can sometimes help to treat respiratory illnesses, reducing inflammation in the lungs, said pediatrics professor Dr. James Campbell of the University of Maryland in an email in March. CBS News reached out to Campbell after Kennedy previously hailed \"miraculous and instantaneous recovery\" from use of these treatments.",
      "\"In 2025, we should not have to treat measles in the US because it is completely preventable, but of course, like all preventable diseases, we do,\" said Campbell.",
      "Campbell is vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee that develops recommendations for treating measles and other infectious diseases.",
      "Clarithromycin, an antibacterial drug, has no effect on viruses like measles but can be used by doctors to treat coinfections from some bacterial pneumonias that sometimes develop in infected children, Campbell said. However, it does not work for all bacteria.",
      "\"These choices should be made on an individual basis by the doctors, not as sweeping recommendations for all children with measles,\" said Campbell. He said that the drugs don't have evidence proving they should be used as routine treatments for measles and cautioned against \"sweeping statements about how those singular choices related to treatment of measles in general.\"",
      "\"Vaccination will prevent measles, but for those who do get measles, rigorous studies, and not anecdotal reports, will help us to better treat them,\" said Campbell.",
      "Kennedy's embrace of alternative therapies has been contradicted by other health experts, including former Trump administration officials.",
      "\"My children and grandchildren will not die of measles, because they are vaccinated.\u00a0 And there is no substitute, nor any effective treatment, for measles,\" Dr. Brett Giroir, an adviser to the department this year, wrote in an opinion piece published by RealClearHealth last week.",
      "The editorial from Giroir, who previously worked as assistant secretary of health during President Trump's first term, was published before news of the second child to die in the Texas measles outbreak. In the U.S., a child last died from measles in 2015.",
      "\"One child's death from measles is a tragedy not only for the family and their community but also for our nation.\u00a0 If we can't stop measles, really what can we do?\u00a0 Let's not wait for another tragedy,\" Giroir said.",

      "Lululemon, Dell Computer, Amazon, the parent of Restoration Hardware and a few others hit hard by President Trump's tariff threats were down 40% on average late last week when the Georgia Republican pounced.",

Markets fell again Thursday, but remain above Wednesday morning's levels.",
      "RH, formerly called Restoration Hardware, is Greene's clear winner. It jumped more than a third since Friday's close, when she bought it after a stunning collapse in price that shook even the head of the furniture retailer.",
      "\"Oh, sh\u2026!,\" said RH CEO Gary Friedman in a conference call last week as the stock plunged.",

      "U.S. stocks surrendered a chunk of their historic gains from the day before as President Donald Trump's trade war continues to threaten the economy.",
      "The S&P 500 fell 189 points, or 3.5%, Thursday to close at 5,268. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1,015 points, or 2.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite sank 4.3%.",
      "China this week announced more countermeasures against the U.S., and market losses accelerated after the White House clarified that it will tax Chinese imports at 145%, not 125% as initially announced by Mr. Trump on social media. The swings also hit the bond market despite a better-than-expected report on inflation. U.S. crude oil prices fell more than 3%.",
      "It's been a wild couple of weeks on Wall Street with Mr. Trump's tariff announcements,\u00a0reversals and retaliation from U.S. trading partners. That volatility seems unlikely to change in the coming weeks with the U.S. and China still locked in a tit-for-tat tariff battle and earnings season kicking off on Friday with the latest results from some of the nation's biggest banks.",
      "\"Despite Wednesday's announcements to lower the reciprocal tariff rate for most countries to 10%, the escalation between the U.S. and China could dramatically impact trade between the world's two largest economies,\" said Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer for wealth management at UBS, in a research note.",
      "Taking into account Mr. Trump's 145% levy on Chinese imports, UBS currently estimates the overall U.S.\u00a0effective tariff rate at 27%, versus 9% prior to April 2. \"Excluding trade with China, the effective tariff rate is 11%,\" Haefele added.",
      "\"Everything is still very volatile, because with Donald Trump, you don't know what to expect,\" said Francis Lun, chief executive of Geo Securities. \"This is really big uncertainty in the market. The threat of recession has not faded.\"",
      "Markets had been sinking earlier Wednesday on worries that Mr. Trump's trade war could drag the global economy into a recession. But then came the posting on social media that investors worldwide had been waiting and wishing for.",
      "\"I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE,\" Mr. Trump said, saying more than 75 countries are negotiating on trade and not retaliating against his latest increases in tariffs. China was a huge exception, with the president raising tariffs\u00a0 on its products to 145%.",
      "Investors went \"from fear to euphoria,\" Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, said in a commentary. On Wednesday, following Mr. Trump's tariff-pause announcement, the S&P 500 surged 9.5%, its third-best day since 1940. The index is still below where it was when Trump announced his sweeping set of tariffs last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shot to a gain of nearly 3,000 points, or 7.9%. The Nasdaq composite leaped 12.2%.",
      "\"It's now a manageable risk, especially as global recession tail bets get unwound, and most of Asia's exporters breathe a massive sigh of relief,\" Innes said. Analysts had expected the global comeback given that U.S. stocks had one of their best days in history on Wednesday as investors registered their relief over Trump's decision.",
      "The trade war isn't over, and an escalating battle between the world's two largest economies can create plenty of damage. U.S. stocks are also still below where they were just a week ago. Technology stocks were the biggest drag on markets in early trading Thursday, followed by the industrial and the financial sectors.",
      "CPI report brings good news",
      "On a positive note, the U.S. government's latest consumer inflation data revealed inflation in March\u00a0rose\u00a02.4% on an annual basis, a sign of progress in the Federal Reserve's battle to\u00a0bring down inflation\u00a0to a 2% rate.",
      "\"This month's inflation report showed that CPI dropped across the board in March, which is welcome news for the Federal Reserve, which would like to cut rates if significant damage is done to the economy through increased tariffs, but otherwise would be reluctant to cut rates in the face of an inflation threat,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management.",
      "March \"saw a fairly big cooling in inflation (both headline and core) and this, coupled w/the healthy job adds from last week, point to robust underlying economic fundamentals. The downtick in inflation gives breathing room for the Fed to be more forceful in responding to market turmoil,\" said equity analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, in a report.",
      "From bear investors' perspective, however, \"inflation is still running above the Fed's target and regardless, Mar and Q1 numbers are irrelevant given how much the world has changed. Trump's tariffs are only hitting the economy now, and it will take months before they fully show up in the data,\" Crisafulli added.",
      "In other words, according to most analysts, the situation is still too uncertain to call.",
      "\"It's much too soon to blow the all clear \u2014 both on tariffs or on inflation \u2014 since the tariff damage has only been postponed as of now, and will only be relieved if tariff deals can be struck across the board,\" Zaccarelli said.",
      "\"Inflation still remains a concern because the full impact of tariffs is yet to be felt, however, at least the underlying trends (e.g. non-tariff related inflation) seems benign at this time. We will be keeping a close eye on PPI tomorrow in order to determine whether or not future inflation is already in the pipeline,\" he added.",
      "In report Thursday, TD Securities analysts echoed that sentiment, saying, \"Indeed, uncertainty remains in the air as the outlook for consumer price inflation remains blurred by ongoing trade policy developments.\"",

      "The Consumer Price Index in March rose 2.4% on an annual basis, showing progress in the Federal Reserve's battle to bring down inflation to a 2% rate.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was forecast to rise 2.6% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "March's report comes after\u00a0inflation rose 2.8% on an annual basis in February.",
      "On a monthly basis, prices actually fell 0.1% in March, the first monthly drop in nearly five years.",
      "Inflation eased last month due partly to lower fuel prices, with gasoline tumbling 9.8% on an annual basis, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said.",
      "Another reason prices fell was sharp drops in travel-related costs, including airfares, which decreased 5.3% just from February to March. Hotel room prices dropped 3.5%.",
      "Economists said those declines in part reflected much slower international demand as the number of tourists visiting the United States has fallen sharply amid Trump's aggressive trade policy.",
      "Visits to the United States from overseas fell nearly 12% last month, according to government data.",
      "What experts say",
      "Easing inflation combined with President Trump's announcement yesterday of a 90-day pause in his reciprocal tariffs should help alleviate some concerns for the Federal Reserve when it meets on May 7 to make its next interest rate decision, said Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank.",
      "But because other tariffs orchestrated by Mr. Trump have recently gone into effect \u2014 such as auto tariffs \u2013 inflation nevertheless could pick up later this year, experts say.",
      "Yet March's data is \"backward looking\" and doesn't reflect the trade policy changes orchestrated by the Trump administration, noted Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs are still expected to lift inflation later in the year as the impact of the import duties trickle through the economy. Because tariffs are paid by U.S. importers like Walmart when they accept shipments of foreign goods, they typically pass off all or some of the tariff cost onto consumers through higher prices.",
      "The president's 90-day pause excludes China, a major exporter to the U.S., which will continue to face tariffs of 125% on its goods. And Mr. Trump's 10% universal duty will also likely to push up prices in the coming months, economists say. The higher import taxes will likely weigh on the economy's growth as well.",
      "What the CPI shows about egg prices",
      "Although consumer prices cooled in March, the CPI data showed egg prices continued to inch higher last month. According to the CPI figures, egg prices increased in March to reach a new record-high of $6.23 despite a drop in wholesale prices and no egg farms having bird flu outbreaks.",
      "More recently, grocers have told CBS News that egg prices are\u00a0showing signs of easing.",
      "Bird flu outbreaks were cited as the major cause of price spikes in January and February after more than 30 million egg-laying chickens were killed to prevent the spread of the disease.",
      "Since the current bird flu outbreak began, more than 168 million birds have been slaughtered, most of them egg-laying chickens. Any time a bird gets sick, the entire flock is killed to help keep bird flu from spreading. That can have an effect on the egg supply because massive egg farms may have millions of birds.",
      "What the CPI means for your money",
      "Despite today's cooler-than-expected CPI numbers, inflationary risks are still a threat to the U.S. economy, especially as some of Mr. Trump's tariffs are still in place while others are merely delayed, experts say.",
      "\"Going forward, the Fed is likely to face a difficult trade-off as tariff-driven price increases start to feed through to the inflation data and activity remains soft,\" Haigh said. \"We expect the Fed's initial reaction to be cautious, but the risks remain that a sharper than expected slowdown in the economy could result in a resumption of the Fed's easing cycle.\"",
      "Three of four economists polled by FactSet expect the Fed will hold rates steady at its next meeting on May 7. The current federal funds \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 now stands in a range 4.5% to 4.75%.",
      "That means consumers and businesses are unlikely to see any relief on loan rates in the near term, although economists are penciling in cuts later in the year, with the majority forecasting a reduction at the Fed's June 18 meeting.",

      "Sony, which produces the two iconic game shows, filed a complaint in October 2024 alleging that CBS entered into unauthorized licensing agreements. Specifically, the entertainment company claimed CBS licensed the shows at below-market rates and failed to maximize advertising revenue, among other alleged contract violations (CBS News and CBS are owned by Paramount Global.)",

    "summary": "President Trump had brushed off the stock market's plunge, but turmoil in the bond market got his administration's attention.",
    "story": [
      "Even as stocks plunged in reaction to his administration's sweeping tariffs, President Trump expressed\u00a0confidence in his trade policies, saying last week that \"markets are going to boom.\" But by Wednesday, a collective thumb's down to the tariffs by bond investors had given Mr. Trump pause.",
      "With U.S. and global financial market tumbling, he abruptly suspended his administration's \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of other countries for 90 days, acknowledging that the bond market was \"getting a little queasy.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's about-face was by no means the first time a sitting American president had blinked in the face of bond investors expressing alarm over U.S. policies they viewed as fiscally reckless and harmful to their portfolios. In their first terms, both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama also found themselves knocked back when the bond market rebelled at the cost of some of their strategic priorities.",
      "The \"bond vigilantes\" ride again",
      "Americans might think of bonds as a less risky asset class they turn to in their 401(k)s to offset more volatile investments, such as stock. But the $2.8 trillion Treasury market is also a bedrock of the U.S. government. The federal government finances the country's debt by selling Treasury bills to investors, who prize the asset because of the country's sterling credit rating and its guarantee of making good on interest payments.",
      "As the Trump administration's reciprocal tariffs went into effect on Wednesday, the bond prices slid and the yield on 2-year Treasury notes rose by as much as 0.3 percentage points, marking the biggest intraday move since 2009, according to financial data firm FactSet. (Bond prices move in inverse relation to their interest rates, or yields.)",
      "Such sudden moves can signal that investors are dumping their bonds. That pushes bond prices lower but boosts yields, which are the returns that bond holders pay to investors.",
      "\"Why is this happening? Fixed-income investors may be starting to worry that the Chinese and other foreigners might start selling their U.S. Treasuries,\" economist Ed Yardeni said in an April 8 research note.",
      "Yardeni, who coined the term \"bond vigilantes\" in the 1980s to describe fixed-income investors who express their disapproval of government policies by dumping Treasuries, added that the bond market was cautioning that \"the Trump administration may be playing with liquid nitro.\"",
      "In another report after Mr. Trump announced the tariff pause, Yardeni noted, \"The Bond Vigilantes have struck again. As far as we can tell, at least with respect to U.S. financial markets, they are the only 1.000 hitters in history.\"",
      "Some Trump administration officials acknowledged that the bond market's hostile reaction to the tariffs influenced the decision to pause the tariffs.",
      "\"[The] bond market was telling us, 'Hey, it is probably time to move,'\" White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett\u00a0said\u00a0on CNBC on Thursday.",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump announced his April 2 tariffs, economists raised concerns\u00a0about the potential impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The president claimed the tariffs, which he called \"reciprocal\" because they were aimed at equalizing the trade barriers between the U.S. and its trading partners, would help revive manufacturing to the U.S. and raise revenue for the federal government.",
      "But experts warned that the tariffs, which ranged from a baseline 10% for most nations up to more than 100% for Chinese imports, raised the risks of a recession and would likely reignite inflation. Investors dumped stocks and bonds as they digested the economic risks of Mr. Trump's tariff barrage.",
      "While the stock market plunge hurt millions of Americans' retirement savings, the turmoil in the bond market creates very real pressures on the nation's finances. Because the Treasury Department pays interest to debt holders, any increase in yields puts more financial strain on the nation's coffers.",
      "\"Developments in the last 24 hours suggest we may be headed for serious financial crisis wholly induced by U.S. government tariff policy,\" Harvard University economist and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers\u00a0said\u00a0in an April 9 thread on social media.",
      "He added, \"Long-term interest rates are gapping up, even as the stock market moves sharply downwards. This highly unusual pattern suggests a generalized aversion to U.S. assets in global financial markets.  We are being treated by global financial markets like a problematic emerging market.\"",
      "An expensive problem",
      "Given the size of the Treasury market, the surging bond yields and broader market turmoil could create an expensive problem for the federal government. For Mr. Trump, the timing was especially poor as he pushes Congress to pass an extension of his 2017 tax cuts, which are forecast to cost trillions over the next decade.",
      "In 2024, the U.S. spent more than $1 trillion to service its debt, more than double its roughly $500 billion in 2020, according to Treasury data. That's largely due to higher interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve to battle the post-pandemic surge in inflation.",
      "An increase in bond yields could add to that expense, putting even more pressure on the federal budget.",
      "\"Although President Donald Trump was able to resist the stock market selloff, once the bond market began to weaken, too, it was only a matter of time before he folded on his eye-wateringly high tariffs,\" noted economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics in an April 9 research note.",

    "summary": "A new breed of veterinary clinic is changing how pets \u2014 and their owners \u2014 are treated. \"I'd rather see four pets a day,\" one vet said.",
    "story": [
      "When Kathleen Whitman's daughter's Bernadoodle, Cody, swallowed a Kong toy, the family faced a veterinary emergency requiring immediate surgery.",
      "X-rays at their local suburban clinic suggested what looked like a hair tie tangled in Cody's intestines. When referred to a corporate emergency hospital, the family was quoted $10,000 for the procedure.",
      "\"They literally told me in the waiting room with a clipboard, thinking I was just coming in and we were doing $10,000,\" Whitman said. \"I said, 'No, I'm just coming in to hear the price.\"",
      "Desperate for an alternative, Whitman reached out to Vetique, a boutique veterinary clinic in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood. There, Dr. Jessica Trice and Dr. Jennifer Remnes performed the surgery for what Whitman called \"an appropriate fee\" that was significantly less than $10,000.",
      "During the surgery, she and her daughter waited in the clinic's lobby with glasses of Prosecco while receiving regular updates.",
      "\"The humans were taken care of just as much as the puppy in distress was,\" Whitman said.",
      "This experience mirrors what many pet owners report when comparing corporate-owned emergency animal hospitals to independent practices. Kara Adams, whose 16-year-old rescue dog Shadow needed emergency eye surgery, also chose Vetique over corporate alternatives.",
      "When Adams called Vetique explaining she had only $1,000 available, staff accommodated her financial constraints.",
      "\"The planning manager came out with a payment plan for me,\" Adams said. \"I was crying because otherwise, what would I do? I didn't have any other options.\"",
      "\"You literally burn people out\"",
      "Drs. Trice and Remnes founded Vetique after witnessing firsthand how corporate consolidation was transforming veterinary medicine \u2014 often for the worse.",
      "\"Just coming from a corporation for many years, the whole thing is about quantity, getting all those pets,\" Trice explained after spending 10 years at Banfield Pet Hospital, followed by five years as a medical director at VCA Animal Hospitals. \"We feel the best way is not pushing about the number of quantity, because it gets very sloppy and you lose that interaction and relationship with the clients.\"",
      "Remnes' experience echoed her partner's concerns. At Banfield as a new graduate, she found herself overwhelmed by volume demands.",
      "\"As a new grad, you're still learning and trying to break into this brand-new world. I was seeing like 30 pets a day,\" Remnes said.",
      "She later moved to VCA before its Mars acquisition, initially enjoying the autonomy because \"each hospital was able to operate as they liked to.\" After the corporate takeover, however, the pressure intensified.",
      "\"It was like, 'Oh, you need to see this number of pets, or we're decreasing your salary.' That's what's burning out the industry,\" Remnes said. \"You literally burn people out doing that. You can't possibly offer your best when you're crammed with all of these patients.\"",
      "These pressures contribute to a profession in crisis. A 2024 study in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association found that U.S. veterinarians are more likely to experience serious mental health struggles than most people.",
      "\"We have forums on Facebook where our industry has one of the highest suicide rates,\" Remnes noted. \"It's because of things like this, when you're given spreadsheets and quotas rather than focusing on patient care.\"",
      "Their solution was to create a different business model. Instead of maximizing patient volume, Vetique prioritizes extended appointment times and a calming environment with luxury touches like sparkling epoxy floors, examination tables with faux fur coverings and exam rooms named after the founders' pets.",
      "\"I'd rather see four pets a day. That meant that family was getting my full attention, that pet was getting everything that I do,\" Remnes explained.",
      "Alongside traditional veterinary medicine, Trice offers acupuncture, herbal remedies and chiropractic treatments \u2014 holistic approaches she had wanted to pursue at corporate practices but was discouraged from using.",
      "Surging pet care prices",
      "Setting prices at Vetique involves balancing fair market rates with the clinic's added value. What Remnes found surprising was how significantly corporate prices have increased in recent years. \"Prices are so drastically different from when I was at VCA seven years ago. They're charging actually close to what we're charging as a general practice for an exam,\" she noted.",
      "This observation led her to reconsider Vetique's own pricing strategy.",
      "\"It's like, 'Well, we can actually probably charge more, because we offer all these experiences along with it.' It's trying to find a happy medium, trying to be fair, but also knowing our value.\"",
      "Despite the appeal of the boutique model, both Remnes and Trice acknowledge significant business challenges. The clinic is in its third year of operation, still within the typical three-to-five-year window before seeing substantial returns. Unlike corporate-backed veterinary chains, Vetique is entirely funded through a bank loan.",
      "Vetique's founders see their clinic not as a competitor to corporate chains but as an alternative model for the industry. \"We're not competing,\" Trice said. \"We're creating a new veterinary culture.\"",
      "Corporate giants reshape vet landscape",
      "John Volk, senior consultant with Brakke Consulting, said veterinary practices historically grow 4-5% annually and carry minimal accounts receivable, making them attractive to investors.",
      "\"Pet care in general is very attractive to the financial community,\" Volk said. \"It's a very steady growth industry, and it's a cash business, so they carry very little accounts receivable because pet owners pay for their services at time of service.\"",
      "Mars Inc., best known for candy brands like M&M's and Snickers, has quietly become the largest owner of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. through a series of major acquisitions.",
      "The privately held company owns three of the nation's largest veterinary chains: Banfield Pet Hospital, VCA Animal Hospitals, and BluePearl Specialty and Emergency Pet Hospital \u2014 giving it control of more than 2,000 clinics across North America.",
      "Mars entered the pet care industry in 2007 by acquiring Banfield, which primarily operates inside PetSmart locations. In 2017, it significantly expanded its footprint by purchasing VCA for $9.1 billion \u2014 one of the largest acquisitions in veterinary history,\u00a0according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.",
      "VCA operates more than 900 hospitals in the U.S. and Canada, while Banfield has over 1,000 clinics nationwide. Unlike VCA, which grew by acquiring independent practices, Banfield has mostly launched new locations within retail stores.",
      "Mars's scale allows for standardized protocols, shared technology platforms and subscription-based wellness plans across its network. According to the company website, Mars Veterinary Health serves more than 25 million pets annually.",
      "While private equity firms have been acquiring veterinary practices since the late 1980s, the trend has accelerated significantly over the past 15 years. Volk estimates approximately 30% of veterinary practices are now corporate-owned.",
      "Despite the growth in corporate ownership, Volk sees no evidence that care quality differs significantly between corporate and independent practices.",
      "\"I've not seen any data to suggest that the services provided by corporately owned practices are materially different than services provided by independently owned practices,\" he said.",
      "However, some policymakers have raised concerns about the impact of consolidation on pricing. In January 2023, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, specifically called out Mars Veterinary Health and other large veterinary corporations in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission. Warren cited \"troubling reports of anti-competitive consolidation\" and suggested these corporate entities were using market power to \"raise prices for consumers and lower wages for veterinarians.\"",
      "Even as consolidation continues, Volk finds that independent practices remain viable. \"If you have a DVM degree and don't have a bad personal history, you can get money to buy or start a practice,\" he said. \"Veterinarians are one of the lowest-risk borrowers of any category.\"",
      "For new veterinarians, the industry offers growing opportunities. The American Veterinary Medical Association reports the average starting salary in companion animal medicine reached approximately $137,000 in 2024.",
      "Design, investment, and a human touch",
      "When clients walk into a Bond Vet clinic, they won't find the sterile environment or cluttered waiting rooms traditionally associated with veterinary offices. Instead, they'll encounter soft pastel colors, comfortable seating and an atmosphere deliberately designed to feel more like a high-end hospitality experience than a medical facility.",
      "\"The industry has two categories of clinics historically \u2014 many designed very clinical, cold and sterile, and then others called mom and pop, which could be cluttered or dirty,\" said Garrett Lewis, CEO of Bond Vet. \"The question is how to solve both problems.\"",
      "That solution \u2013 creating premium veterinary experiences with transparent pricing and greater accessibility \u2013 has attracted significant private equity investment.",
      "While these premium services might suggest significantly higher costs, Lewis emphasizes transparency in Bond Vet's pricing model. \"When someone comes in, you can look at the laptop and see exactly what the pricing is,\" he said. \"Our prices are just a little bit above average, but the experience is what differentiates us.\"",
      "This transparency extends to digital platforms, where clients can check prices online or via text before visiting. During appointments, veterinarians show pricing information directly to clients on laptops, allowing for discussion about options.",
      "Bond Vet, backed by a $170 million investment from Warburg Pincus, has expanded to 57 locations across the Northeast and Midwest since its founding in 2019. The company was inspired by human-focused healthcare models like One Medical, focusing on convenience, design, and a better experience for both pets and owners.",
      "\"They saw the same issue, which was that the industry wasn't serving clients and pets at a much higher level,\" Lewis said of Bond Vet's founders, who included a veterinarian and her husband. \"They quickly found it was very different to change culture and design in existing practices, so they rebooted from the ground up.\"",
      "Bond Vet's approach represents a broader trend in veterinary medicine, where traditional practices are being reinvented with a focus on client experience alongside medical care.",
      "Bond Vet's model bridges the gap between traditional veterinary practices and emergency hospitals, offering urgent care alongside preventative services \u2013 all with a hospitality-focused approach.",
      "\"In the 90s, if you needed sick care, your veterinarian would say, 'Come on in.' If you needed preventive care, they'd say, 'Come on in,'\" Lewis explained. \"What happened in the 2000s is a lot of specialization occurred where practices became just preventative and started referring out anything that looked urgent or sick.\"",
      "Bond Vet handles non-emergency urgent cases that might otherwise end up in expensive emergency rooms. \"ER practices see about 40% of their volume as urgent rather than emergent cases. Clients go to ER and spend twice as much, often having to wait longer,\" Lewis noted.",
      "These clinics feature design elements specifically created to reduce stress for pets \u2014 an approach that appears to be working. \"I always see dogs dragging their owners into the clinic, which is not a common thing,\" Lewis said.",
      "The \"no walls\" philosophy breaking ground",
      "Imagine walking into a veterinary emergency room and instead of being separated from your pet during a crisis, you're welcomed directly onto the treatment floor. At  VEG ER for Pets, this isn't just possible \u2014 it's mandatory.",
      "\"We built an entire business around it,\" said Dr. David Bessler, founder and CEO of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's much easier doing something 100% of the time than trying to do it 90% of the time.\"",
      "With 102 locations across 28 states, VEG ER for Pets represents an approach to emergency veterinary medicine that stands apart from both traditional practices and newer primary care models.",
      "Unlike other veterinary innovators that blend primary and urgent care, VEG ER for Pets focuses exclusively on emergency medicine \u2013 a deliberate strategy that Bessler calls \"a bit of a crazy bet.\"",
      "\"We took the hardest part of an industry, emergency, and created an entire business around that,\" said David Gladstein, co-founder and president of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's hard to make money, it's hard to get the team, it's hard to recruit, it's hard to train.\"",
      "VEG ER for Pets' most distinctive feature is its commitment to keeping pets with their owners throughout the entire treatment process, even during emergencies \u2014 an approach not found in traditional emergency hospitals, where pets are typically treated in back rooms away from owners.",
      "This transparency extends to the physical design of newer hospitals, which have eliminated traditional waiting rooms entirely. \"Our newer hospitals don't even have a lobby,\" Gladstein explained. \"You literally walk in and you're in the middle of the treatment floor.\"",
      "In a notable departure from many veterinary innovators, VEG ER for Pets has achieved financial independence from its initial investors and now funds its expansion through its own operations.",
      "\"VEG ER for Pets is now independently able to do that,\" Gladstein stated. \"We don't need anyone else to advocate for us or to pay for us. We're not beholden to anybody. We're beholden to our customers, and we're beholden to our veggies.\"",
      "This independence allows the company to maintain its distinctive approach while continuing to open 25-30 new locations annually.",
      "The company's exclusive focus on emergency care, while limiting in some ways, has allowed it to \"crack the code\" on veterinary emergencies according to Gladstein. \"We've kind of cracked the code on one way of doing things in emergency that results in a better experience for all of the souls that are there experiencing that at the same time.\"",

      "U.S. stocks soar in relief rally",
      "On Wall Street, the S&P 500 surged 9.5%, an amount that would count as a good year for the market. It had been sinking earlier in the day on worries that Mr. Trump's trade war could drag the global economy into a recession. But then came the posting on social media that investors worldwide had been waiting and wishing for.",
      "\"I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE,\" the president said, after recognizing the more than 75 countries that he said have been negotiating on trade and hadn't retaliated against his latest increases in tariffs.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later told reporters Mr. Trump was pausing his so-called \"reciprocal' tariffs\" on most of the country's biggest trading partners but maintaining his 10% tariff on nearly all global imports.",
      "China was a huge exception, though, with Mr. Trump saying tariffs are going up to 125% against its products. That raises the possibility of more swings ahead that could stun financial markets. The trade war isn't over, and an escalating battle between the world's two largest economies can create plenty of damage. U.S. stocks are also still below where they were just a week ago, when Trump announced worldwide tariffs on what he called \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "But on Wednesday, at least, the focus on Wall Street was on the positive. The Dow shot to a gain of 2,962 points, or 7.9%. The Nasdaq composite leaped 12.2%. And the S&P 500 had its third-best day since 1940.",
      "The relief came after doubts had crept in about whether Mr. Trump cared about the financial pain the U.S. stock market was taking because of his tariffs. The S&P 500, the index that sits at the center of many 401(k) accounts, came into the day nearly 19% below the record its set less than two months ago.",
      "That surprised many professional investors who'd long thought a president who used to crow about records for the Dow under his watch would pull back on policies if they sent markets reeling.",
      "Wednesday's rally pulled the S&P 500 index away from the edge of what's called a \"bear market.\" That's what professionals call it when a run-of-the-mill drop of 10% for U.S. stocks, which happens every year or so, graduates into a more vicious fall of 20%. The index is now down 11.2% from its record.",
      "Bonds rebound",
      "Wall Street also got a boost from a relatively smooth auction of U.S. Treasurys on Wednesday. Earlier jumps in Treasury yields had indicated increasing levels of stress and Trump said he had been watching the bond market \"getting a little queasy.\"",
      "Higher yields on Treasurys put pressure on the stock market and push upward on rates for mortgages and other loans for U.S. households and businesses. U.S. Treasury yields have historically dropped - not risen - during volatile times because the bonds are usually seen as some of the safest possible investments.",
      "This week's sharp rise had brought the yield on the 10-year Treasury back to where it was in late February.",
      "After approaching 4.50% in the morning, the 10-year yield pulled back to 4.34% following Trump's pause and the Treasury's auction.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 08:42:32 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's aggressive use of tariffs has fueled concerns about the economy and roiled the stock market.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's barrage of \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on countries around the world this year has rattled consumers, businesses and investors. Although President Trump on Wednesday announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs, he upped import duties on Chinese goods to 125% \u2014 escalating a conflict between the world's two largest economies.",
      "We asked you what questions you had about tariffs and answered some of those in a CBS News 24/7 special. Read on for some answers to your questions below.",
      "Are global tariffs legal, and have U.S. levies on other countries risen or fallen over the years?",
      "CBS MoneyWatch: Tariffs are legal under World Trade Organization rules, although participating countries must comply with certain restrictions and levies are generally capped.",
      "As a result, nations have long had the right to impose multilateral tariffs, although those costs vary widely based on trade agreements, product type and many other factors.",
      "In the 19th century, average U.S. tariff rates on trading partners routinely exceeded 30%. The government sharply reduced those levies after the Great Depression, cutting them to single digits. After resuming power in 2025, President Trump raised the effective U.S. tariff to 22% \u2014 the highest since 1909.",
      "For the Trump administration, are these massive tariffs intended to pressure other nations into more favorable trade deals, or is the goal to push American businesses to invest more in domestic manufacturing? Or both?",
      "Both, correct. These historically large tariffs have several main objectives. In the short term, the tariffs are intended to pressure countries to come to the table to negotiate what Mr. Trump sees as more favorable trade deals.",
      "Over the long term, Trump administration officials say that sharply raising U.S. tariffs will spur both domestic and foreign companies eager to avoid the added costs to expand here at home, creating jobs, reinvigorating manufacturers and boosting economic growth.",
      "President Trump has also long argued that global trade rules, enshrined in entities like the World Trade Organization, disdvantage the U.S. by, for example, permitting countries like China, Germany and Japan to subsidize key industries. He blames those rules for fueling large global trade imbalances that have saddled the U.S. with a large, and growing, trade deficit.",
      "Another goal of tariffs is to generate federal revenue \u2014 funds that Mr. Trump will likely need to offset additional tax cuts he has promised to Americans and to corporations.",
      "Why do some people oppose deploying tariffs against countries that impose tariffs on the U.S.?",
      "Most mainstream economists think the kind of sweeping tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump on nearly all U.S. imports act as a tax on businesses and consumers. Such levies raise the cost of many essential items, leading to higher prices for American households; depress economic growth; and could even trigger a recession.",
      "Under this view, a trade war in which countries jack up tariffs on their economic partners effectively makes them all poorer.",
      "By contrast, trade experts also say that targeted tariffs \u2014 implemented as but one element in a larger industrial strategy \u2014 can help protect critical U.S. industries and workers from unfair foreign competition.",
      "How do these tariffs impact consumers, especially when it comes to prices on everyday items like groceries or housewares?",
      "Tariffs are taxes paid by importers such as Walmart, which must pay the fees to the U.S.\u00a0 Customs and Border Protection when it accepts shipments at American ports. As a result, U.S. businesses typically pass on most or all of that cost to consumers through higher prices.",
      "For instance, after Mr. Trump added tariffs to imported washing machines during his first term, the median price of those appliances jumped more than 11%, tacking on about $86 to the cost of a new unit, according to University of Chicago researchers.",
      "While consumers can opt for U.S.-made merchandise, domestic manufacturers also may raise their prices due to tariffs. Sometimes that's due to an increase in the cost of imported goods they need to manufacture their products. But some companies also take the opportunity to hike prices because the newly expensive foreign-made products provide them with more pricing flexibility.",
      "Without Mr. Trump's pause, imported vegetables, fruit and nuts were set to rise by 19% due to the tariffs, according to a recent analysis from the Yale Budget Lab, a public policy think tank. That would have boosted prices for those foods by more than 6%, after adjusting for an expected 0.6% increase in the cost of the same items grown in the U.S.",
      "What's the long-term outlook \u2014 are these tariffs likely to strengthen the U.S. economy or just cause temporary disruption?",
      "Economists say Mr. Trump's tariffs have increased the risk that the U.S. and other nations could tumble into a recession in the next year. Because tariffs raise prices, Americans are expected to cut back on spending \u2014 a potentially major problem given that 70 cents of every $1 in the nation's gross domestic product is based on consumer spending.",
      "For instance, the tariffs could slow GDP growth to 1.4% in 2025, while core inflation could rise to 3.9% this year, according to an April 2 forecast from Oxford Economics. That would represent a significant slowdown from the economy's 2.8% growth rate in 2024.",
      "Other experts say leaving sharply higher U.S. tariffs in place could leave much deeper scars. GDP growth could fall by 0.6 percentage points over the next decade, the Yale Budget Lab estimated.",
      "What is the end goal for the Trump administration's tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump has said he believes tariffs will bring back manufacturing jobs. By making it more expensive to sell foreign-made goods in the U.S., the president wants to convince American and foreign companies to build factories here.",
      "But he's also highlighted other goals for his tariff barrage, such as convincing other nations to give more favorable trading terms to the U.S.",
      "Lastly, Mr. Trump has pointed to tariffs as a way to raise billions in revenue for the U.S. government, even though economists point out that tariffs are essentially a sales tax which are paid by American consumers.",
      "Does Mr. Trump really think he's going to be able to rebuild manufacturing in America again?",
      "Mr. Trump is adamant that tariffs can revive manufacturing in the U.S., which has been on the decline for at least half a century. Yet economists and other experts aren't so sure.",
      "There are several reasons for their skepticism. For one, building the types of factories and infrastructure to support the manufacturing that is now handled by other nations, such as China and Vietnam, would require years and billions in investment.",
      "The U.S. manufacturing sector has been shrinking for decades, so companies repatriating factories from abroad would struggle to find enough skilled workers, especially in technology and other areas higher up the industrial value chain",
      "And because of the uncertainty caused by Mr. Trump's tariffs, some businesses might not want to commit to such an investment given that the import duties might disappear or be sharply lowered \u2014 as they were today.",
      "What could happen to block the U.S. tariff increases?",
      "Several factors could halt the tariffs imposed by Mr. Trump, according to experts.",
      "First, Congress could introduce a resolution to terminate the emergency declaration used by Mr. Trump to issue the tariffs. Since both the Senate and House are controlled by Republicans, that would require several members of the GOP to join Democrats in voting against Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "But Mr. Trump would likely veto any such measure that reached his desk, which means that two-thirds of both chambers would need to vote in favor of the measure in order to make it veto-proof.",
      "Second, the courts could intervene and rule that Mr. Trump has exceeded his authority. Already, there has been a lawsuit filed by a small business in Florida that argues that Mr. Trump has overstepped by issuing the April 2 tariffs, and that the power should belong to Congress alone.",
      "Third, the violent reaction in financial markets that followed Mr. Trump's latest tariff salvo could persuade him to change course. His move on Wednesday to pause many of the tariffs followed a five-day plunge in stocks that put the S&P 500 on the verge of entering a bear market \u2014 when equities fall at least 20% from their most recent high.",
      "That steep decline in stock prices hurts tens of millions of Americans saving for retirement and could lead them to cut their spending, a big drag on economic growth.",

      "The S&P 500's gain was the biggest one-day increase since October 2008, according to financial services company Factset. The Nasdaq's gains were its\u00a0largest since 2001, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "One notable exception to Mr. Trump's decision is China, with the president saying he's increasing the tariff rate on goods imported from that nation to 125%.",
      "\"Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,\" he wrote.",
      "Prior to the announcement, the S&P 500 had been down about 17% from its mid-February peak, pushing stocks toward a bear market, or when shares fall more than 20% from their most recent high, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "Even with today's gain, the S&P 500 remains 11% below its February 19 peak of 6,147.",
      "Investors have been spooked by Mr. Trump's escalating trade war, which Wall Street economists warn could raise the risk of a recession and hurt U.S. corporations and consumers by hiking prices on products from almost every nation.",
      "Even before Mr. Trump's announcement, some on Wall Street had expressed optimism that the White House could back down from the latest tariffs, which slapped rates of between 10% to 84% on U.S. trade partners.",
      "Despite the pause, experts noted that uncertainty remains an issue for U.S. businesses, given that the tariffs could restart in 90 days and that the penalties on China \u2014 a major trading partner \u2014 are likely to dampen economic growth.",
      "\"Businesses will be relieved that the destination for trade policy looks like it could be less disruptive than seemed possible yesterday,\" said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank. \"Even so, the huge overhang of policy uncertainty will weigh on investment and weak decisions in the next few months.\"",
      "He noted, \"Also, 125% tariffs on Chinese imports will be a huge problem for many businesses if they stay in place.\"",
      "Best stock performers today",
      "The gains were widespread across the U.S. stock market, and 98% of the stocks in the S&P 500 index rallied.",
      "Among the best performers were tech stocks, including chipmaker Nvidia, which gained 18.7%, and Apple, which jumped more than 15%.",
      "Also leading the way were airlines and other stocks that depend on customers feeling confident enough to travel for work or for vacation. Delta Air Lines soared 23.4%, while American Airlines gained 22.6%.",
      "China trade war intensifies",
      "Still, the trade war continues between the U.S. and China continues to rage. On Wednesday, China said it is raising its tariffs on U.S. products to 84%, up from its previously announced 34%, after President Trump's import duties on Chinese good\u00a0went into effect\u00a0today at a rate of 104%. The retaliation signals Beijing isn't backing down from Mr. Trump's global trade war.",
      "Mr. Trump's broad-based \"reciprocal tariffs,\" which apply to imports of almost every nation, had kicked in after midnight Eastern time in the U.S.",
      "Already, there are signs that some corporations are feeling the impact of Mr. Trump's tariff policies, with Delta on Wednesday pulling its guidance for 2025 as the trade war depresses bookings across the travel sector.",
      "\"With broad economic uncertainty around global trade, growth has largely stalled,\" CEO Ed Bastian said in a statement on Wednesday. \"In this slower-growth environment, we are protecting margins and cash flow by focusing on what we can control.\"",
      "With corporate earnings season starting in the U.S., investors will be carefully watching the guidance from large companies such as Delta. On Wednesday, Walmart said it is standing behind its full-year sales and operating income outlook even amidst the growing trade war.",

      "President Trump has shaken up\u00a0stock markets\u00a0around the world as he announced\u00a0sweeping tariffs\u00a0on what he dubbed \"Liberation Day\"\u00a0last week, then partially reversed course shortly after. The Trump administration's imposition and walkback of tariffs has led to stock volatility and sparked worries of a global trade war and recession.",
      "In the United States, many are concerned about levies driving up the price of everyday goods, and Goldman Sachs economists on Monday cited them in a report\u00a0raising the odds of a recession to 45%. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned the tariffs could slow the economy and\u00a0\"will likely increase inflation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's April 2 announcement set out a baseline 10% tax on all U.S. imports, plus additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on imports from 90 countries. He pitched the tariffs as a strategy to reduce the trade deficit between the U.S. and other global powers, including China and the European Union.",
      "Exactly a week later, the president paused many of the newly announced reciprocal duties, with the exception of those placed on China.",
      "The reversal came a little over a month after Mr. Trump imposed 25% tariffs\u00a0on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and\u00a0then announced a pause just two days later.",

      "As markets fluctuate, and with many of his most recent\u00a0reciprocal import duties\u00a0paused, here's what Mr. Trump has said about the tariffs.",
      "Trump reverses course, pauses tariffs",
      "Two days after Mr. Trump said during a\u00a0meeting with Israeli Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu that he's not looking at any pauses in tariffs, he announced a 90-day pause on most of his planned tariffs and a lowering of the \"reciprocal tariff\" rate to 10% \u2014 with the exception of China.",
      "The U.S.\u00a0stock market surged\u00a0immediately after the president's announcement.",
      "When reporters asked about mixed messages from his administration on whether the tariffs are permanent or open to negotiation, the president said on April 7, \"they both can be true.\"",
      "\"We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they're going to be fair deals,\" Mr. Trump said. \"No other president's going to do this, what I'm doing.\"",
      "On April 9, citing China's unwillingness to negotiate, Mr. Trump announced on Truth Social that he's raising taxes on China to 125%. China announced earlier in the day that it would\u00a0raise its tariffs on U.S. products to 84%.",
      "The president previously said there are \"other things besides tariffs\" that could be open to negotiation, like other countries' \"standards and tests\" that Mr. Trump said make trading more difficult, but he didn't provide further details.",
      "\"Hang tough\"",
      "In a Truth Social post on April 5 as his 10% universal tariffs took effect, Mr. Trump urged Americans to \"hang tough\" and acknowledged things \"won't be easy.\"",
      "\"China has been hit much harder than the USA, not even close. They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly,\" he wrote.",
      "\"We have been the dumb and helpless 'whipping post,' but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before. Already, more than FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT, and rising fast! THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"",
      "\"Sometimes you have to take medicine\"",
      "Mr. Trump doubled down on his trade position while speaking to reporters on April 6 on Air Force One, making clear he did not intend to budge on the reciprocal tariffs set to take effect later this week, nor the universal levies already implemented.",
      "Addressing the U.S. market plunge\u00a0that followed his April 2 announcement \u2014 Wall Street's worst in five years \u2014 and seemingly preparing Americans for more potential market pain to come, the president said, \"I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"",
      "\"What's going to happen with the market I can't tell you, but I can tell you our country has gotten a lot stronger,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "He also said various world leaders had expressed interest in negotiating to roll back tariffs as global markets, reacting to the levies, began to nosedive, too.",
      "\"I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They're dying to make a deal. And I said, we're not going to have deficits with your country. We're not going to do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We're going to have surpluses or at worst, going to be breaking even.\"",
      "Echoing Mr. Trump's sentiment, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick suggested the administration would not waver on the new round of tariffs, in an interview on\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"\u00a0Arguing the policies will help protect U.S. factories and \"reset the power of the United States of America,\" Lutnick acknowledged that \"it is going to be a big change.\"",
      "\"This is the moment that the United States of America takes hold of itself, and Donald Trump has been talking about this his whole life,\" Lutnick said. \"This is Donald Trump's agenda, and we're all here to help him execute.\"",
      "\"Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!)\"",
      "In the hour before trading opened on Wall Street on Monday, April 7, the president took to Truth Social to support his flurry of tariffs and appeared to coin a new Trump-ism referencing panic.",
      "\"The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,\" Mr. Trump said in the post. \"Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!\"",
      "He posted as international markets were experienced significant losses, with indices in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Shanghai, South Korea, Taiwan and Tokyo all dropping. U.S. markets went on to have a roller-coaster day, with the S&P 500 ending down a modest 12 points, or 0.2%, at 5,062, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 349 points, or 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite eked out a small gain, rising 15 points to close up 0.1%.",
      "Additional tariffs on China",
      "Mr. Trump vowed on Monday, April 7, to raise duties imposed on China to 50% after Beijing issued retaliatory tariffs of 34% on the U.S. over the weekend.",
      "On Truth Social, the president said Beijing had acted despite his previous \"warning\" that the U.S. would only respond to retaliatory tariffs with even higher taxes for the issuing country, and urged its leaders to withdraw the 34% increase or face higher costs.",
      "\"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\" Mr. Trump said. \"Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "China did not withdraw its tariffs and the ratcheting up continued, with Mr. Trump increasing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 104% and then and then 125% as China upped\u00a0its tariffs on U.S. goods to 84%.",

      "A global trade war is brewing as the U.S. imposes tariffs on a growing list of countries, heightening concerns about economic growth and roiling stock markets around the world.",
      "President Trump on April 2 announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations that are above a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the new taxes are needed to erase a trade deficit between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to the European Union.",
      "Some nations are facing only the universal tariff of 10%, while imports from dozens of other countries are charged a higher specific reciprocal import levy. For instance, Australian imports face the baseline rate of 10%, while China-made products are now paying an import duty that has jumped to 104%\u00a0\u2014 the reciprocal tariffs combined with previously announced duties of 20% \u2014 after slapping its own tariffs on U.S. imports.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his April 2 remarks.",
      "However, on April 9 Mr. Trump backed away from parts of his plan, announcing a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs and lowering the tariff rate to 10% for almost all nations. The notable exception was China, with Mr. Trump saying that he's instead raising the tariff rate on the country's imports to 125%.",
      "\"Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Stocks soared after Mr. Trump's April 9 announcement, with the S&P 500 gaining 8.4% in afternoon trading and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging 7%. Still, some on Wall Street cautioned that the pause is still on track to end in 90 days, which could signal more volatility ahead.",
      "\"The tariff clouds parted for the first time today, but it's too soon to know how sunny the skies will be tomorrow \u2014 or 90 days from now,\" said Daniel Skelly, head of Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management Market Research & Strategy Team, in an email.",
      "Worst-hit countries",
      "Before he announced the pause, Asian nations were set to face the worst of the brunt, with Cambodia facing a tax rate at 49% and Vietnam at 46%, according to Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic.",
      "Mr. Trump also said such levies will boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products. Still, economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.",
      "If the tariffs are maintained by the Trump administration and if other nations impose retaliatory tariffs, both the U.S. and other countries \"will suffer serious recessions,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "China retaliated by saying it planned to impose a retaliatory\u00a034% import fee\u00a0on American products, followed by Mr. Trump retaliating with plans to impose an additional 50% tariff on its imports and China ratcheting up its rate to 84%.",
      "Full list of Trump's reciprocal tariffs by country",
      "When do these tariffs go into effect?",
      "The reciprocal rates were originally set to go into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 9, but later that day President Trump announced a\u00a0postponement for 90 days. That's in addition to a baseline 10% tariff which took effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5.",
      "How did the Trump administration decide what tariffs to charge which countries?",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration determined the tariff rate for each country based on the monetary levies those nations charge on U.S. imports, as well as non-monetary trade barriers like regulations that make it tougher for American products to enter those markets.",
      "The president added that the reciprocal tariffs are still only half the rates charged by those nations on U.S. products, characterizing his new levies as \"kind.\"",
      "Are other countries retaliating against U.S. tariffs?",
      "Yes. China said it would impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10, and then raised the level to 84%. The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose 27 additional U.S. companies to trade sanctions.",

      "Apple iPhones could become even pricier under President Trump's reciprocal tariffs on roughly 90 foreign nations, which were slated to take effect Wednesday, but are now on hold for 90 days, with the exception of levies on China.",
      "In a move that threatens to raise costs on all electronics, including iPhones, the White House on Tuesday said it would follow through on a threat to enact a 104% tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the U.S. The levy took effect Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. EDT. Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump raised the tariff rate to 125%, effective immediately.",
      "The price for the popular tech tool, which starts at $599 for the most basic model, the iPhone 16e, is poised to increase by hundreds of dollars, depending on how Apple responds to the sweeping levies. The iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which features Apple Intelligence, costs $999.",
      "The iPhone accounts for about half of Apple's revenue. Most of its smartphones are manufactured in China.",
      "Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives said in a research note Tuesday that the added levies could create a \"category 5 price storm\" for personal electronics and other gadgets. Taxing China and other nations at such rates is the equivalent of \"flipping a boat upside down in the ocean with no life rafts,\" he added.",
      "How much more could an iPhone cost?",
      "The iPhone 16 Pro Max 256 GB, which is among the devices that are assembled in China, retails for $1,199. Under the new tariffs on Chinese imports, the price of the device could rise by $675, or 56%, lifting the price tag to $1,874, an April 9 analysts from UBS Investment Research shows.",
      "The cost of an iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which is made in India and costs $999, could increase to $1,119, an increase of 12%, the investment bank found.",

      "Apple didn't respond to a request for comment on how the Trump tariffs could affect iPhone prices.",
      "What if Apple moved production to the U.S.?",
      "President Trump has said the new U.S. tariffs are aimed at spurring both domestic and foreign companies to build in the U.S. But for Apple and other companies, manufacturing their products in the U.S. entail significantly higher labor costs \u2014 costs that would largely be passed on to consumers.",
      "If Apple were to begin assembling iPhones in the U.S, a Chinese-made device that previously sold for $1,000 would cost $3,500 if manufactured in New Jersey, Texas or some other state, Ives estimated.",
      "\"Saying we can just make this in the USA is a statement that incredibly understates the complexity of the Asia supply chain and the way electronics, chips, semi fabs, hardware, smartphones, etc. are made for U.S. consumers over the last 30 years,\" he said in a report.",
      "As a result, Ives is highly skeptical that tariffs alone will lead companies to shift their manufacturing plants from low-cost havens like China to the U.S., calling the idea \"absurd.\"",
      "But some companies, including Apple, could attempt to rejigger supply chains to avoid the steepest tariffs. For example, Apple plans to manufacture more iPhones in India to reduce its reliance on China, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported, citing people familiar with the matter.",

      "London \u2014\u00a0Producers and importers of alcoholic beverages say President Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs will hit many American drinkers right in the wallet, with price hikes on some favored tipples even exceeding the rates of the levies he's imposed.",
      "On April 2, Mr. Trump announced what he called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on virtually every nation the U.S. does trade with. Despite stock markets around the globe descending into tumult and economists warning for months that it will be consumers who pay the price for the levies, Mr. Trump has not backed down, insisting the measures will help the U.S. balance its trade deficit with other nations in the longer term.",
      "But in the near term, many Americans' adult beverages of choice, including European wines and Scotch whisky, are likely to come at more of a premium, according to industry insiders.",
      "Bartholomew Broadbent, who owns the Virginia-based wine wholesaler and importer Broadbent Selections, warned the impact on retail prices in the U.S. is going to be \"a lot worse than people think.\"",
      "French wines, as an example, will be subject to 20% tariffs under the measures announced by Mr. Trump. But Broadbent told CBS News the real-world price increase will be closer to 30%, because the cost of the tariff will be compounded at every stage of a bottle or crate's journey to a store shelf \u2014 with producers in France and other nations, along with importers like himself and then distributors and retailers all adding their own mark-ups.",
      "\"The price is going to have to go up,\" he said.",
      "In real terms, Broadbent estimated that the retail price on a bottle of wine that currently sells for $9.99 could go up to $13 or $14.",
      "Broadbent, whose company imports wines from 11 different countries and it also works with wineries in California, said more than 80% of his business will now face new tariffs. Wines from South Africa will be the most heavily impacted, he said, as the White House has hit the country with a steep 30% tariff.",
      "\"I don't see a single person who can benefit from this,\" Broadbent said. \"Even the wineries in America will suffer badly because they're all buying barrels and corks from Europe.\"",
      "The tariffs sent shockwaves through the global wine industry, with France's Bourgogne Wine Board (BIVB) warning the levies risked \"pushing our wines past a psychological price threshold.\"",
      "Bourgogne \u2014 or the Burgundy region as it's known in English \u2014 exported nearly 21 million bottles of wine to the U.S. in 2024, according to the BIVB, which agreed with the assessment that Mr. Trump's tariffs will have a negative impact on everyone, from French exporters and their distributor partners to American consumers.",
      "\"The industry deeply regrets this decision,\" the BIVB said in a press release",
      "The people who make, sell and enjoy Scotland's world renowned distilled spirits are also staring down the barrel of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Last year alone, about 132 million bottles of Scotch whisky were imported into the U.S. market, according to the Scotch Whisky Association.",
      "The mood in Scotland is one of \"frustration and uncertainty,\" according to Drew McKenzie Smith, who founded and runs the Lindores Abbey Distillery just north of Edinburgh.",
      "McKenzie Smith estimated that the 10% baseline tariff Mr. Trump imposed on the U.K. would see the price of a bottle of his Scotch hiked by about the same amount for American consumers. So a bottle that currently costs $60 will soon jump to $66, be believes.",
      "While that \"may not sound severe,\" McKenzie Smith told CBS News, \"it still adds a meaningful burden \u2014 especially for smaller producers like us.\"",

Although Johnson has in the past been able to overcome pockets of opposition, this time, the Louisiana Republican faces objections from multiple corners of the GOP conference.",

      "In the resolution, the Senate set relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts for several committees, at just about $4 billion dollars, though they expect to find far more. At the same time, it allows for House plans to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending. Some House Republicans argue the spending cuts aren't deep enough.",

The House budget resolution relied on the current law baseline and acknowledges that continuing the tax cuts will cost $3.8 trillion. The 2017 Trump tax cuts are set to expire this year, and if they are not extended, taxes will go up for many filers.",

      "Tax season is when some consumers learn they were fraudulently enrolled in an ACA plan or switched to a different one without their knowledge.",
      "Those unauthorized enrollments or changes took off in late 2023 and continued through last year, drawing more than 274,000 complaints in the first eight months of 2024 to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, mostly about rogue agents or call centers.",
      "Tax problems can arise if those enrollments resulted in premium tax credits exceeding the amount the consumer should have received. In those cases, consumers may have to pay all or part of those credits back. The amount owed could range from a few hundred dollars to thousands, with some caps based on income.",
      "The first clue some people have is when they get a 1095-A form in the mail.",
      "Those documents are sent out by the state and federal marketplaces to the IRS and ACA enrollees, showing any tax credit payments made to health insurers on a taxpayer's behalf. Taxpayers use the premium tax credit information from the 1095-A when completing their return.",
      "Returns can be held up if the IRS has information indicating the taxpayer has ACA coverage that they failed to report on their return, or if there are other discrepancies.",
      "The Biden administration last year took steps to slow the fraudulent switching, including requiring a three-way call between the broker, client, and marketplace for some enrollment issues.",
      "\"While we may be seeing less [fraud], we're still dealing with 2024 taxes,\" said Erin Kinard, director of systems and intake for the Health and Economic Opportunity Program at Pisgah Legal Services, a nonprofit serving western North Carolina that offers both legal help and assistance with ACA problems.",
      "Consumers who suspect they were fraudulently enrolled should immediately call their federal or state ACA marketplace, experts say. Some consumers will be referred to special federal caseworkers throught he marketplaces. But some of those caseworkers are now part of the broad reduction in force by theTrump administration.",
      "In recent days, \"they laid off two divisions on the Affordable Care Act side,\" said Jeffrey Grant, who oversaw ACA issues as CMS' deputy director for operations in the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight before leaving in February.",
      "With fewer caseworkers, \"it will take longer to get problems taken care of,\" said Grant, who is now president of Schedule F Healthcare Strategies, a consulting group that aims to help laid-off federal workers find new jobs. \"The marketplace is twice as big as it was the last time the Trump administration was here, and now they are cutting caseworkers to less than were around then.\"",

      "And these cases are difficult because the rogue brokers who enrolled consumers sometimes misstated their income so they would qualify for the largest tax credits possible. Other consumers have found they were enrolled even though they had affordable employer coverage, making them ineligible for ACA subsidies.",
      "That's what happened to Anthony Akra and his wife, Ashley Zukoski, in Charlotte, North Carolina. They were enrolled in a plan without their knowledge in 2023, by a broker in Florida with whom they had never spoken. The couple had health insurance through Zukoski's employer. The broker listed an income that qualified the household for a large subsidy that fully offset the monthly premium cost, so the couple never received a bill. One day, a 1095-A form showed up in their mailbox.",
      "\"I didn't know what the hell it was,\" said Akra, who said the form showed that he had been receiving hundreds of dollars a month in premium tax credits.",
      "He would owe a big chunk of that back unless he could get the plan retroactively canceled. Because their pharmacy, part of a national chain, had switched them to the new plan, also without telling them, they had used the new coverage every time they filled a prescription. That inadvertent use of the policy complicated their efforts to get the fraudulent coverage revoked.",
      "Meanwhile, the IRS withheld more than $4,000 from their tax refund based on the information sent through that 1095-A form.\u00a0 Months passed, but with assistance from a \"navigator\" program \u2014 a government-fundednonprofit that helps people deal with insurance problems \u2014 they were able to get the incorrectinsurance canceled and a refund at the end of October.",
      "It is not unusual for people to spend weeks or even months trying to sort out the mess, said Kinard, whose organization is similar to the one that helped Akra.",
      "While navigator programs nationwide are still operating to help people sign up for health coverage or address issues, the Trump administration has targeted their funding for a 90% cut. Meanwhile, ACA enrollees may face a range of other surprises due to policy and budget steps proposed by the Trump administration.",
      "More Potential Changes",
      "Congress must decide whether to extend premium tax credits that were enhanced during the covid pandemic, which expanded eligibility for the credits and made them larger for many enrollees. Keeping them in place would be expensive, with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation estimating it would add $335 billion to the deficit through 2034.",
      "That debate will come amid another deficit-affecting decision: whether to extend tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration, which would add trillions to the budget deficit through 2034.",
      "If the enhanced subsidies are not renewed, monthly premium costs would rise by an average of over 75%, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. Premiums could more than double in some states, including many GOP-led ones, such as Texas, Mississippi, Utah, Wyoming, and West Virginia.",
      "That could spark a political backlash. Additionally, the enhanced subsidies are seen as a main reason for strong enrollment growth, leading to more than 24 million people signing up for ACA plans for this year.",
      "A recent KFF study found the 15 states with the most enrollment growth since 2020 were all won by Trump in 2024.",
      "A proposed rule released last month by the Trump administration includes provisions to shorten the annual enrollment period, get rid of a special open enrollment period that allows low-income people to sign up year-round, and require stricter verification of income and other information when people apply for coverage. The administration says most of these steps are needed to reduce fraud in the system.",
      "The administration estimates that 750,000 to 2 million fewer people would enroll in coverage as a result of the changes.",
      "The new rule, if finalized, will make it harder for people to enroll, said Xonjenese Jacobs, director of Florida Covering Kids & Families at the University of South Florida College of Public Health. Losing the year-round enrollment for very low-income people, for example, would affect people short on cash who move often to stay with relatives or friends, and those who have unsteady employment, making it hard to know when or where to enroll and what their income might be in the coming year.",
      "\"They don't have the same ability to plan,\" Jacobs said. \"It's definitely going to make a difference for a lot of the individuals that we service.\""

    "summary": "U.S. and Russian intelligence agencies negotiated an agreement to free American Ksenia Karelina in exchange for a Russian detainee.",
    "story": [
      "Russia released Ksenia Karelina, a dual U.S.-Russian national who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for treason in August last year, in a new prison swap on Thursday. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed her release in a social media post early Thursday, but offered no information about the terms of her release.",
      "The Wall Street Journal first reported\u00a0Karelina's release, saying she was freed in a swap arranged by the two countries' intelligence agencies, and a CIA official later told CBS News that the agency had played a central role in the deal on behalf of the U.S. government.",
      "\"American Ksenia Karelina is on a plane back home to the United States,\" Rubio said in his post. \"She was wrongfully detained by Russia for over a year and President Trump secured her release.\"",
      "The plane landed around 11 p.m. EDT at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, where she was greeted by several people including her boyfriend, professional boxer Chris van Heerden. In a touching moment, Karelina and van Heerden had a long embrace.",
      "In a statement first published by the Journal and later provided to CBS News, CIA Director John Ratcliffe said, \"President Trump brought home another wrongfully detained American from Russia,\" and added his praise for \"the CIA officers who worked tirelessly to support this effort\" and for the United Arab Emirate of Abu Dhabi, which he said had enabled the exchange. The swap of the two detainees was carried out in Abu Dhabi.",
      "Ratcliffe was directly involved in the negotiations, which he conducted with an unnamed senior Russian intelligence official, the CIA said.",
      "The top level communication indicates a deepening of efforts by the Trump administration to improve ties with Moscow. Mr. Trump has been pushing both Russia and Ukraine to negotiate a peace agreement to end the three-year war sparked by Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion of its neighbor.",
      "In exchange for Karelina, who lives in California, the CIA official confirmed that the U.S. had freed Arthur Petrov, a German-Russian national arrested in Cyprus 2023 at the request of U.S. authorities. According to the Journal, he was being held on allegations of exporting sensitive microelectronics.",
      "\"Much of the swap was negotiated by the U.S. government, with CIA playing a key role engaging with Russian intelligence,\" a CIA spokesperson said Thursday, adding, \"The exchange shows the importance of keeping lines of communication open with Russia, despite the deep challenges in our bilateral relationship.\"",
      "Karelina was sentenced to 12 years in a Russian penal colony after pleading guilty to treason. She was arrested while on visit to Russia for donating about $51 to an American-based humanitarian group that was helping Ukrainians impacted by the war, according to Russian state media.",
      "Her lawyers said she acknowledged transferring the funds, though she did not admit she intentionally directed them to organizations that might have used the money for actions against Russia. She didn't expect that her donation would end up supporting anti-Russian activities, according to her lawyers.",
      "Van Heerden\u00a0told CBS News last year that she had made the small donation in 2022, \"exercising her First Amendment rights,\" adding that \"she has done nothing wrong.\"",
      "Van Heerden said he was uneasy about Karelina's decision to return to Russia for a visit, given the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, but he said she \"had no worry in the world,\" and that she had assured him it would be safe since she was entering the country as a dual American-Russian citizen.",
      "\"She wanted to go home. She made it very clear that she wanted to go home,\" Van Heerden told Gayle King on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Wanting to fulfill her wish to visit home, Van Heerden said he bought her a plane ticket as a birthday gift, and the pair first traveled together to Istanbul. He had originally intended to travel with her to Russia from there, but he didn't feel comfortable, so she traveled alone to Russia, and he returned to Los Angeles.",
      "Russia imprisoned a number of Americans as tension with Washington soared amid the build up to, and eventually the full-scale war in Ukraine. Paul Whelan, Wall Street Journal reporter\u00a0Evan Gershkovich\u00a0and teacher\u00a0Marc Fogel\u00a0were all designated wrongfully detained like Karelina and freed in previous prisoner swaps with Moscow.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 23:21:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal immigration official acknowledged last week that the removal of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man, to El Salvador was an \"administrative error.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday said the Trump administration must facilitate the release of a Maryland man mistakenly deported from custody in El Salvador, but ordered additional proceedings before a federal district court.",
      "In an unsigned decision, the high court acknowledged that a late Monday deadline set by the district court judge to secure the return to the U.S. of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, and paused by Chief Justice John Roberts had already passed, effectively granting in part the emergency relief sought by the Trump administration.",
      "But the court said that the district court's order \"properly requires the government to 'facilitate'\" Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody and to \"ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\"",
      "The Supreme Court went on to say that the intended scope of the term \"effectuate\" in the lower court's decision is unclear and may exceed its authority. The high court directed the district court to provide more clarification with the case sent back for further proceedings.",
      "\"The district court should clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs,\" the court said in an unsigned opinion. \"For its part, the Government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.\"",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Paula Xinis issued an order Thursday evening following the Supreme Court's decision directing the Trump administration to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia \"as soon as possible.\"",
      "She gave the Department of Justice until 9:30 a.m. Friday to detail where Abrego Garcia is and the plans to bring him back to the U.S.",
      "There were no noted dissents, and the three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, noted their respect for the court's disposition of the application. Sotomayor said in a statement joined by Kagan and Jackson that there is agreement among the justices \"that the proper remedy is to provide Abrego Garcia with all the process to which he would have been entitled had he not been unlawfully removed to El Salvador.\"",
      "\"As the Supreme Court correctly recognized, it is the exclusive prerogative of the President to conduct foreign affairs,\" a DOJ spokesperson said Thursday. \"By directly noting the deference owed to the Executive Branch, this ruling once again illustrates that activist judges do not have the jurisdiction to seize control of the President's authority to conduct foreign policy.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers asked the Trump administration in a court filing to facilitate his release from the notorious Salvadoran supermax prison known as CECOT Thursday evening and to dispatch a plane to retrieve him. They cited the \"grave risk to his safety in El Salvador.\"",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to step in after a federal district judge on Friday ordered it to take immediate action to return Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. The 29-year-old Salvadoran national was arrested by immigration authorities on March 15 and was among the more than 200 people sent on deportation flights to El Salvador last month.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case sparked backlash after a federal immigration official acknowledged in a court filing last week that his removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error\" and \"oversight.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. illegally in 2011 when he was 16 years old and was arrested in 2019, according to court documents. During immigration proceedings, the Department of Homeland Security claimed that Abrego Garcia was a member of the gang MS-13, citing a Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie he was wearing and allegations from a confidential informant who said he belonged to a branch of MS-13 that operates on Long Island, New York, court records show.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers said he has never lived on Long Island and has no affiliation with MS-13. They also said he has no criminal history and has never been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses in the U.S. or El Salvador.",
      "An immigration judge detained Abrego Garcia after denying a request for release on bond, which was upheld by an immigration appeals board. But he was ultimately granted withholding of removal to El Salvador, a legal status that prohibits the government from returning him to his home country because he is more likely than not to face persecution from local gangs, according to court records.",
      "Abrego Garcia was released from custody following that decision and has lived for six years in Maryland with his wife and their children. He had regular check-ins with immigration authorities, according to court filings, but was arrested on March 12 after he was stopped by immigration agents while driving with his son in the back seat. Abrego Garcia was taken into custody and transported to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in Baltimore, Louisiana and Texas before he was flown to El Salvador, according to legal filings.",
      "After Abrego Garcia was sent to the Salvarodan prison last month, he and his wife, a U.S. citizen, filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Maryland alleging his removal violated federal immigration law and seeking an order requiring his return to U.S. custody.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis granted that request following a hearing Friday and directed the government to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. no later than 11:59 p.m. Monday. The Justice Department asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit to halt that order, and while its request was pending, asked the Supreme Court to intervene. The 4th Circuit then declined to pause the district court's decision.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the lower court order \"sets the United States up for failure\" because it interfered with President Trump's ability to conduct foreign diplomacy and set a tight timeline for compliance. He wrote that the U.S. cannot force the release of Abrego Garcia because he is now in the custody of the Salvadoran government.",
      "\"The United States does not control the sovereign nation of El Salvador, nor can it compel El Salvador to follow a federal judge's bidding,\" the solicitor general wrote.",
      "Sotomayor warned in her statement that the government's argument \"implies that it could deport and incarcerate any person, including U. S. citizens, without legal consequence, so long as it does so before a court can intervene.\"",
      "Lawyers for Abrego Garcia called his case \"one of one,\" and argued in court papers that requiring the government to facilitate their client's return is \"not novel,\" because the district court's order just requires the Trump administration to correct its own error.",
      "\"The executive branch may not seize individuals from the streets, deposit them in foreign prisons in violation of court orders, and then invoke the separation of powers to insulate its unlawful actions from judicial scrutiny,\" they wrote.",
      "Abrego Garcia's legal team called the government's mistake in removing him \"Kafka-esque,\" and noted that he has lived in the U.S. for several years without any issues.",
      "\"The government offers no evidence that he has become a threat overnight,\" they wrote.",
      "Migrants removed from the U.S. are being housed in CECOT as a result of a temporary agreement the Trump administration reached with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, under which the U.S. government is paying the Salvadoran government $6 million to hold U.S. detainees for a year.",
      "Citing this arrangement, Abrego Garcia's lawyers argued that the U.S. government \"functionally controls Abrego Garcia's detention \u2014 it has simply contracted with El Salvador to be the jailer.\"",
      "Lower courts also said that the government has control over Abrego Garcia, since he is being temporarily housed in CECOT at the Trump administration's request.",
      "\"The government's claim that it can remove an individual from the United States pursuant to such an agreement and thereby lose the ability to reclaim that individual and return him to the country for process (or for any other purpose) cannot stand,\" Judge Stephanie Thacker, who sits on the 4th Circuit, wrote in an opinion. She added that \"the government's actions in this case most assuredly violated the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.\"",
      "Thacker, who was joined by Judge Robert King, wrote that \"the government cannot escape its responsibility to return Abrego Garcia to the United States by claiming it now lacks authority to control El Salvador.\"",
      "While the Trump administration has acknowledged that it inadvertently sent Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, it has argued that the federal courts do not have the power to demand his return since he's no longer in U.S. custody. Administration officials have also claimed that he is an MS-13 \"leader,\" though they have not produced evidence to support the allegations.",
      "During last week's hearing before Xinis, Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni repeatedly struggled to answer the judge's questions but said he wasn't given sufficient information by the administration.",
      "\"The facts are conceded, plaintiff Abrego Garcia should not have been removed,\" Reuveni said.",
      "When questioned about why the government is not able to return Abrego Garcia, Reuveni said he \"asked the government the same question\" and did not receive an answer. The Justice Department lawyer said multiple times he was \"frustrated\" with the government's lack of cooperation in the case.",
      "Following Friday's argument, Reuveni was placed on administrative leave, and Sauer said in a filing that his statements were \"inappropriate\" and \"do not reflect the position of the United States.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News about Reuveni's employment status, Attorney General Pam Bondi said, \"At my direction, every Department of Justice attorney is required to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States. Any attorney who fails to abide by this direction will face consequences.\"",

    "story": [
      "Faced with a deadline to provide evidence in its deportation case against activist Mahmoud Khalil, lawyers for the federal government instead filed a memorandum by Secretary of State Marco Rubio to a Louisiana immigration court.",
      "In the memo, which was obtained by CBS News, Rubio wrote that Khalil's role in protests on the campus of Columbia University is in conflict with American foreign policy objectives. Rubio did not cite specific evidence against Khalil. He stated that Khalil is deportable under a little-known statute in federal immigration law that provides the government is entitled to deport noncitizens whose presence in the U.S. damages national foreign policy interests.",
      "Rubio argued that the presence of Khalil, a 30-year-old legal permanent resident, undermines \"U.S. policy to combat anti-Semitism around the world and in the United States, in addition to efforts to protect Jewish students from harassment and violence in the United States.\"",
      "Khalil was a prominent voice in the spring 2024 pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, where he earned a master's degree from the School of International and Public Affairs in December 2024. He was detained by federal immigration authorities at his university-owned apartment as his pregnant wife looked on. He was moved from New York to a detention center in New Jersey before being flown to a remote facility in Jena, Louisiana.",
      "The government claims that Khalil has supported Hamas, and can be deported if it is determined his presence and activities threaten the foreign policy interests of the U.S., citing alleged support for Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group. To date, CBS News has not found evidence that Khalil has said he supports Hamas.",
      "Assistant chief immigration Judge Jamee Comans on Tuesday said she would terminate the case unless the government showed evidence supporting the removal of the former Columbia student. Khalil's attorney Marc Van Der Hout said at the hearing that he had \"not received a single document\" of evidence from the government.",
      "\"I'd like to see the evidence,\" Comans said, demanding that the government make a filing within 24 hours.",
      "In response, the Department of Homeland Security submitted the two-page memo from Rubio, which includes references to Khalil and one other lawful permanent resident whose name was redacted.",
      "Rubio wrote that they should be removed from the country because their \"presence or activities would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest.\"",
      "\"The foreign policy of the United States champions core American interests and American citizens,\" he continued, \"and condoning anti-Semitic conduct and disruptive protests in the United States would severely undermine that significant foreign policy objective.\"",
      "Rubio pointed to Khalil's participation in what he descirbed as \"antisemitic protests and disruptive activities,\" which he said creates a \"hostile environment for Jewish students,\" as well as \"unlawful activity\" during those protests.",
      "\"The government can't just operate on hidden law based on one executive official's say so,\" said Baher Azmy, Legal Director of the Center of Constitutional Rights during a press call about Khalil on Thursday. \"Does anyone here know what conduct they would have to engage in that would trigger an adverse foreign policy interest to The United States? No one does. No one can. Which is what's so dangerous about this law.\"",
      "Comans has set a removability hearing for Khalil on Friday at 1 p.m., at which she could determine whether sufficient evidence has been provided to support the continuation of his immigration case.",
      "The government had previously said Khalil should be expelled for what it's described as \"material support\" for the militant group Hamas via his role in campus protests against Israel.",
      "Khalil's attorneys, who have also sued the government on his behalf, lambasted the government, saying the government was depriving him of his right to free speech.",
      "\"After a month of hiding the ball since Mahmoud's late-night unjust arrest in New York and taking him away to a remote detention center in Louisiana, immigration authorities have finally admitted that they have no case whatsoever against him,\" said Van Der Hout. \"Instead, the government is clearly going after Mahmoud and persecuting him for exercising his First Amendment rights.\"",
      "After Khalil's arrest, President Trump said it was just the first \"of many to come.\" His statement heralded a crackdown on students and alleged \"agitators\" who have protested against Israel.",
      "Foreign-born students across the country have since faced the knocks of immigration agents at the door, and deportation proceedings.",
      "\"If the secretary of state claims the power to arrest, detain and deport someone, including a lawful permanent resident, simply because that person dissents from US foreign policy, there are no limits. There's no beginning and no end to that kind of executive power,\" said Johnny Sinodis, an attorney for Khalil's immigration case.",
      "\"This is not a routine immigration case or even routine habeas case,\" he added. \"This case is intentionally projecting a message of repression about who can say what in this country and the consequences to your liberty and your life if you object to U.S. policy.\""

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/save-act-voter-registration-citizenship-married-women-name-change/",
    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 16:36:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The SAVE Act could change voter registration requirements for millions of people. Here's how.",
    "story": [
      "A claim circulating on social media suggests that married people who changed their last name will face difficulties when trying to vote under the proposed Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act.",
      "Experts say the bill, which\u00a0passed in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday, April 10, would not explicitly prevent these voters from casting a ballot, but it could create barriers to registration by requiring them to show additional documentation.",
      "The measure now heads to the Senate. If it passes in the Senate and is\u00a0signed into law, the act would amend the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which requires states\u00a0to offer voter registration when obtaining a driver's license, to mandate documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration.",
      "This means that common forms of ID used for voter registration, including driver's licenses, would no longer be accepted as they are not generally considered proof of citizenship. Instead, voters would have to present documents such as a U.S. passport, a birth certificate, or naturalization paperwork to register.",
      "The Center for American Progress analysis estimated as many as 69 million have taken their spouse's name but do not have a matching birth certificate. \"The fate of those 69 million women are basically up in the air, the way the bill is written,\" said Greta Bedekovics, associate director of democracy policy at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy and advocacy group.",
      "Opponents argue that the law could also make voting more difficult for military and rural voters by upending both mail-in and online voter registration. Bedekovic said it would make an in-person trip to the election office the only \"viable way for Americans across the country to register to vote,\" adding that rural voters are less likely to have a passport and may have to travel hours to obtain and submit documents.",
      "According to Congress.gov, the bill also \"establishes criminal penalties\" for registering someone who does not have the right documents to vote.",
      "Eliza Sweren-Becker, senior counsel in the Brennan Center's Voting Rights and Elections Program, noted that the bill \"does not specify what extra documents\" married individuals would need to produce, adding that \"election officials, who would face legal risks under the bill, would be hesitant to register women whose documentation name does not match their current name.\"",
      "\"This in-person 'show your papers' requirement would keep many eligible voters out of the voting booth \u2014 beyond the millions who already lack ready access to their citizenship documents \u2014 and cause chaos for election administration,\" said Sweren-Becker.",
      "As of January 2025, eight states require proof of citizenship to register to vote, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Americans widely support both voter ID requirements and proof of citizenship. A\u00a02024 Gallup survey found more than 4 in 5 respondents supported proof of citizenship requirements for first-time voters.",
      "Supporters of the bill, including U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly, a Republican from Pennsylvania, argue that it is necessary to prevent noncitizens from voting.",
      "However,\u00a0noncitizen voting is already illegal and rare. In a study following the 2016 election, the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice found just 30 suspected cases of noncitizen voting out of 23.5 million votes cast in the 42 jurisdictions reviewed.",
      "A 2023 Pew Research survey found\u00a0that about 80% of women married to men in the U.S. take their husband's last name. Under the SAVE Act, if their voter registration name differs from the name on their birth certificate or passport, they may need to show additional documents.",
      "If the SAVE Act were to become law, Bedekovics said married women who have changed their names should obtain certified copies of all marriage certificates, locate their birth certificates, and keep any change-of-name documentation on hand for any updates to their voter registration.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 16:14:04 -0400",
    "summary": "The vote was initially delayed amid conservatives' concerns about the level of spending cuts.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Thursday adopted a budget blueprint for President Trump's agenda after Republican leaders scrambled to convince GOP holdouts who want deeper spending cuts to back it.",
      "The resolution was adopted in a 216-214 vote, with two Republicans \u2014 Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Victoria Spartz of Indiana \u2014 joining all Democrats to vote against it.",
      "About a dozen House conservatives ultimately flipped their opposition after receiving assurances from leaders that the Senate would pursue $1.5 trillion in savings, at a minimum.",
      "\"Our two chambers are directly aligned,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said before the vote. \"We're committed to finding at least $1.5 trillion in savings for the American people while also preserving our essential programs.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, echoed that the Senate is \"aligned with the House in terms of what their budget resolution outlined in terms of savings.\"",
      "\"The speaker talked about $1.5 trillion dollars. We have a lot of United States senators who believe that is a minimum,\" Thune said.",
      "The lower chamber was set to vote Wednesday evening on the budget resolution but punted after several House conservatives resisted increasing pressure from Mr. Trump to accept the blueprint that would open the door to implementing his border security, defense, energy priorities and extending expiring tax cuts.",
      "Approving the budget plan in both chambers is the first step in the reconciliation process, which allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate and pass Mr. Trump's agenda with a simple majority. Going that route allows Republicans, who have control of the House and Senate, to pass the measure without any support from Democrats.",
      "The House and Senate worked on separate blueprints earlier this year but more recently reached a compromise resolution, which the Senate adopted early Saturday morning. Republican leaders in the House worked to unite their divided party behind the budget plan this week before Congress leaves town for a two-week recess.",
      "The Senate set much lower minimum floors for spending cuts at just about $4 billion, though committees could find far more. The compromise resolution also allows for the House to slash at least $1.5 trillion in spending.",
      "The Senate also wants to account for tax cuts enacted during Mr. Trump's first term with a tactic known as \"current policy baseline,\" which assumes that continuing expiring policies will cost nothing. Under that baseline, the nearly $4 trillion it would cost to extend the 2017 tax cuts would not be counted, further frustrating House conservatives.",
      "Johnson said House and Senate committees would be working in a \"collaborative fashion\" over the two-week recess to find savings.",
      "Before backing the resolution, House conservatives wanted assurances from the Senate that there will be deeper spending cuts, which sent leadership scrambling to find another compromise.",
      "\"We just don't trust the Senate,\" Rep. Eric Burlison, a Missouri Republican, told reporters Wednesday night after fiscal hawks huddled with Johnson for more than hour as the vote was delayed. \"We all campaign on spending cuts, but again and again, that doesn't happen. And when the Senate sent over something that said $4 billion is their floor, that was unacceptable to a lot of us.\"",
      "Burlison was among those who changed their minds and voted in favor of the resolution. Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas said he and other holdouts were moved to support the resolution by a White House commitment to making \"significant cuts,\" Johnson's \"firm commitment\" to maintain House Republicans' framework of tying tax cuts to spending cuts and Thune's \"strong statement\" promising at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts.",
      "Massie, one of the two Republicans who held firm on his \"no\" vote, called it \"a framework for financial collapse.\"",
      "\"I don't believe they're going to make any cuts of any consequence. Now they may change spending, reduce spending here, and increase spending there, but overall, the money spent next year is going to be more than the money spent this year,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump increased pressure on House Republicans in recent days to swallow the blueprint, telling holdouts on Tuesday night, \"close your eyes and get there.\" He added that individual lawmakers may not get \"every little ounce\" of what they want in the legislation.",
      "\"It's a phenomenal bill. Stop grandstanding,\" Mr. Trump said at the House GOP campaign arm's fundraising dinner.",
      "Democrats have railed against the proposed cuts, arguing the Republican plan will lead to massive cuts in entitlement programs such as Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security.",
      "\"The budget resolution that passed the House today will set in motion some of the most extreme cuts to health care, nutritional assistance and the things that matter to everyday Americans in our nation's nearly 250-year history,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said Thursday. \"It's a disgrace.\"",

    "story": [
      "A Senate committee heard from several experts Thursday on setting a year-round time standard instead of switching back and forth with daylight saving time. President Trump recently called it a \"50/50 issue,\" but he previously vowed to get rid of daylight saving.",
      "At the hearing, the committee's chairman, Sen. Ted Cruz, said there is a general consensus among his colleagues that the system of switching the clocks needs to be changed, but he said there is disagreement about whether to adopt universal standard time or daylight saving time.",
      "\"I personally struggle with the two choices here, because it's a question of what do you care about more: sunshine and joy and fun and money, or health, mental health, physical health,\" said Cruz, a Republican from Texas. \"And the honest answer for most people, gosh, I care about all that stuff.\"",
      "Cruz said an alternative has been discussed to pick daylight saving time, but letting states opt out. Arizona and Hawaii current opt out of changing the clock. But others said in Thursday's hearing that having different standards for different states could cause widespread confusion.",
      "The Senate Commerce Committee hearing notice did not set a preference for daylight saving time or standard time, but instead said it would focus on \"various issues around whether the country should continue 'springing forward' and 'falling back' each year with time.\"",
      "Daylight saving time begins in March, when clocks are moved forward an hour, and ends in October, when the clocks go back to standard time.",
      "The twice-yearly time changes are\u00a0generally unpopular\u00a0among Americans, with 63% saying they\u00a0would like to eliminate\u00a0them completely, compared to just 16% who said they would not, according to an Economist/YouGov poll in November 2021.",
      "\"People across our country are tired of the constant cycle of falling back and springing forward,\" Democratic Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware said, calling it time for a \"thoughtful solution\" across the country.",
      "\"The important thing is that we land of something consistent and make smart investments to keep people safe,\" she said.",
      "\"Time is always complicated and the system we have is complicated, but it's complicated because it's a human creation,\" said Scott Yates, the founder of the Lock\u00a0the Clock movement, which supports getting rid of twice-yearly time changes.",
      "\"The sun moving around the earth doesn't actually have anything to do with time,\" Yates said. \"We need this system, but this system has this bug right now, and the bug is daylight saving time, the switching of the clocks. And so if we have a little bit of time, a couple of years, so the individual states can address all of these complexities and make those decisions, then we will be able to get rid of this bug permanently. It is something we have been stuck with since World War I, and this is our opportunity to finally fix it.\"",
      "A 2020\u00a0commentary\u00a0for the journal JAMA Neurology found evidence linking the annual transition to daylight saving time to\u00a0increased strokes,\u00a0heart attacks\u00a0and\u00a0teen sleep deprivation.",
      "The Senate in 2022 passed a bill called the Sunshine Protection Act to make daylight saving time permanent, but the bill never went anywhere in the House. The 2022 bill had 17 cosponsors from both parties and was spearheaded by then-Sen. Marco Rubio, who is now the Secretary of State in the Trump administration.",
      "It's unclear where President Trump stands on the issue. Mr. Trump said in March that it's a \"50/50 issue,\" saying \"it's hard to get excited about it. I assume people would like to have more light later, but some people want to have more light earlier because they don't want to take their kids to school in the dark.\"",
      "But back in December, he posted on social media: \"Daylight Saving Time is inconvenient, and very costly to our Nation.\" In the same post, he said the \"Republican Party will use its best efforts to eliminate Daylight Saving Time, which has a small but strong constituency, but shouldn't!\"",

      "Wynn-Williams began working at Meta, then known as Facebook, as the director of Global Public Policy in 2011. In her almost seven years with the company, Wynn-Williams told the panel she witnessed the company provide \"custom built censorship tools\" for the Chinese Communist Party. She said a Chinese dissident living in the United States was removed from Facebook in 2017 after pressure from Chinese officials. Facebook said at the time it took action against the regime critic, Guo Wengui, for sharing someone else's personal information.",
      "Wynn-Williams described the use of a \"virality counter\" that flagged posts with over 10,000 views for review by a \"chief editor,\" which Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called \"an Orwellian censor.\" These \"virality counters\" were used not only in Mainland China, but also in Hong Kong and Taiwan, according to Wynn-Williams's testimony.",

DeepSeek is a Chinese AI company that sent shockwaves through the American technology industry earlier this year when its AI model was shown to be competitive with OpenAI's ChatGPT at a fraction of the cost.",
      "In a statement last year on Llama, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone wrote, \"The alleged role of a single and outdated version of an American open-source model is irrelevant when we know China is already investing over 1T to surpass the US technologically, and Chinese tech companies are releasing their own open AI models as fast, or faster, than US ones.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams encouraged senators to continue investigating Meta's role in the development of artificial intelligence in China, as they continue their probe into the social media company founded by Zuckerberg.",
      "\"The greatest trick Mark Zuckerberg ever pulled was wrapping the American flag around himself and calling himself a patriot and saying he didn't offer services in China, while he spent the last decade building an $18 billion business there,\" she said.",

      "\"While Mark Zuckerberg himself was public about our interest in offering our services in China and details were widely reported beginning over a decade ago, the fact is this: we do not operate our services in China today,\" Meta said in a statement.",
      "Meta, which changed its name from Facebook in 2021, operates some of the most popular social media platforms in the United States, including its previous namesake Facebook as well as Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads.",
      "Washington is taking a more aggressive posture toward China and its growing threat to American economic interests and national security.

    "summary": "Bridget Brink's resignation comes at a pivotal moment for U.S.-Ukraine relations.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink intends to resign from her post early, three sources told CBS News.",
      "The State Department confirmed her intent to step down\u00a0Thursday afternoon.",
      "\"Ambassador Brink is stepping down. She's been the ambassador there for three years \u2013 that's a long time in a war zone. And frankly, the war has gone on for far too long,\" a State Department spokesperson said in a statement. \"The real issue is whether the Russians and Ukrainians are ready to do what's necessary to end this war.\"",
      "Brink has not formally submitted resignation papers but she has been making farewell calls to colleagues, sources said.",
      "Ambassador Brink has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "One senior U.S. official told CBS that her resignation stems from an unusual mix of personal and policy concerns, including the recent USAID layoffs. Brink is serving in a war zone far from her family, since Kyiv is designated as an unaccompanied post, where officers serve without bringing their families with them.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio intended to keep Brink, a career foreign service officer, in the job and declined the initial resignation she had submitted in January as part of the standard turnover between administrations.",
      "Brink's resignation comes at a pivotal moment for U.S.-Ukraine relations. The Trump administration has tried to broker an end to the Russian invasion in part by ending the policy of diplomatically isolating Vladimir Putin, who invaded Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "While Ukraine accepted a U.S. ceasefire proposal, Russia has not. It is not clear whether President Trump has set any deadline for conclusion of the diplomacy, but he's continuing to have special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff at the fore of outreach to Russia.",
      "At NATO meeting last week, Rubio indicated U.S. patience with Russia was wearing thin.",
      "\"We will know soon enough, in a matter of weeks, not months, whether Russia is serious about peace or not. I hope they are,\" Rubio said on April 4.",
      "Mr. Trump's longtime fascination with Putin and frustration with Ukraine's Zelenskyy has complicated the diplomacy, and prompted concern from Western allies.",
      "His distrust of Zelenskyy was visible in an explosive Oval Office confrontation in February. Mr. Trump told Zelenskyy to reach a ceasefire agreement with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vice President JD Vance accused the Ukrainian president of being \"disrespectful\" after he challenged the vice president's assertion that the war had dragged on because of a lack of diplomacy from Ukraine and the Biden administration. Vice President JD Vance also admonished Zelensky: \"Have you said 'thank you' once, this entire meeting?\"",
      "The Trump administration subsequently paused military and intelligence aid to Ukraine amid the fallout. That intelligence support resumed once Ukraine agreed to go along with the Trump administration's outreach to Putin. Mr. Trump continues to sit on the nearly $4 billion in remaining U.S. military aid already designated for Ukraine. The U.S. has been a key supplier of weapons since the Russian invasion began.",

      "As President Trump announced a pause to his sweeping reciprocal tariffs Wednesday, his trade representative, Jamieson Greer, was in the middle of testifying at a House hearing on the administration's trade policy.",
      "Greer appeared to learn of the president's decision to pause the tariffs for 90 days the same time the public did, as he was sitting before members of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade.",
      "Asked when he was made aware of the pause by Rep. Steven Horsford, a Democrat from Nevada, Greer said, \"Well, I understood the decision was made a few minutes ago. It's something that's been under discussion.\"",
      "\"So did you know that this was under discussion and why did you not include that as part of your opening remarks?\" Horsford asked.",
      "Greer replied he doesn't share the contents of his discussions with Mr. Trump.",
      "Immediately after Mr. Trump announced the pause, the U.S. stock market surged. It had fallen significantly after the president's initial announcement on the tariffs. A universal tariff of 10% remained in place for nearly every country, except China, which faces an even higher tariff of 125%. China raised its own tariffs against the U.S.",
      "Horsford pressed Greer for details of the pause.",
      "\"I understand it's 90 days. I haven't spoken to the president since I've been in this hearing,\" Greer said.",
      "Horsford interrupted, \"So the trade representative hasn't spoken to the president of the United States about a global re-ordering of trade?\"",
      "\"Yes I have, I'm just here in a hearing with you,\" Greer interjected.",
      "\"And yet he announced it on a tweet? W.T.F.? Who's in charge?\" Horsford yelled.",
      "\"The president of the United States is in charge,\" Greer said.",
      "\"And what do you know about those details?\" Horsford asked. Before Greer could answer, he said, \"It looks like your boss just pulled the rug out from under you.\"",
      "\"There's no strategy,\" Horsford said. \"You just found out. Three seconds ago. Sitting here. We saw you. If you came here knowing that you were going to be turned off, that these tariffs were going to be turned off, why didn't you include that in your opening statement? Why didn't you reference that as part of your testimony?\"",
      "Greer repeated he doesn't disclose his conversations with the president.",
      "\"These were specific questions we asked you all along,\" Horsford said. \"What's the strategy? These are real consequences for the American people and small businesses. \u2026 This is amateur hour and it needs to stop. What does this even mean for your negotiating strategy? How are you in charge of negotiation if the president is tweeting about this from wherever the hell he is?\"",
      "\"The president was elected and he runs the trade policy and I advise him and execute his policy,\" Greer said.",
      "\"Did you know that this was happening?\" Horsford pressed.",
      "\"We had been discussing all kinds of options, Sir,\" Greer said.",
      "\"There was no strategy. There was no plan,\" Horsford said, adding that Mr. Trump \"put our economy in disarray and near collapse.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued the tariffs were a \"negotiating strategy.\"",
      "Horsford asked Greer if this was market manipulation.",
      "When Greer answered, \"No,\" Horsford, said \"Why not? If it was a plan. If it was always the plan, how is this not market manipulation?\"",
      "\"We're trying to reset the global trade system,\" Greer said.",
      "\"And what has that done? How have you achieved any of that? But to enact enormous harm on the American people?\" Horsford said. \"Tariffs are a tool. It can be used in the appropriate way to protect U.S. jobs and small businesses, but that's not what this does, so if it's not market manipulation, what is it? Who's benefitting? What billionaire just got richer?\"",
      "Horsford then slammed Republicans for their budget plan and repeated to Greer, \"Who's in charge? Because it sure doesn't look like it's the trade representative. You just got the rug pulled out from under you.\"",
      "\"I wish I could feel some empathy, but the empathy I have is for the American people whose very wellbeing and livelihoods are being effected. This is not a game. This is real life,\" Horsford said before yielding his time.",

      "Work likely to be halted by the cuts includes the collection of data for studying Americans with sickle cell, a painful blood disorder that predominantly affects Black families, as well as supporting testing for its more dangerous complications.",
      "\"If it is not restored, it will disrupt life-saving public health programs, halt critical research, and increase preventable hospitalizations, complications, and deaths. Its elimination runs counter to the Administration's stated commitment to addressing chronic disease,\" said Dr. Belinda Avalos, president of the American Society of Hematology, in a statement this week.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed openness to restoring some programs he gutted, like the CDC's lead poisoning experts, though for now they have yet to be reinstated.",

This is to ensure that HHS better serves the American people at the highest and most efficient standard,\" HHS spokesperson Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano said in a statement.",
      "In addition to the blood disorders division, Kennedy's layoffs wiped out the entire leadership team atop CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities that housed it. Support staff for the center, as well as its Disability and Health Promotion Branch, were also cut.",
      "That branch had been responsible for a federal database tracking state-level rates of adults with disabilities. Researchers and health authorities rely on the data to target resources where they're needed most, and to study patterns and trends in disabilities.",
      "A now-stalled upcoming release of data had been expected to help shed light on a recent increase in cognitive disability among younger adults, an official said.",
      "\"There seems to be a step back to see developmental disabilities, like autism, being only in childhood. The branch provided key public health expertise for disability in adulthood, where people spend most of their lives,\" said a current CDC official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",

      "Nearly all U.S. newborns are now screened for hearing loss thanks in part to the program, according to the center's data, up from less than half of newborns 25 years ago. States had also been working with the branch on efforts to increase\u00a0 follow-up rates.",
      "Also eliminated in the cuts were CDC staff overseeing a partnership with the Special Olympics \u2014 an organization founded by Kennedy's aunt, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, and now chaired by his cousin, Timothy Shriver. The CDC program had provided health screenings and collected data on people with intellectual disabilities.",
      "Only a handful of researchers remain on the job in the center, in the agency's Child and Development and Disability Branch and Division of Birth Defects and Infant Disorders.",

    "story": [
      "In what could be a key 2025 bellwether, Virginia's race for governor will also make history, all but guaranteeing the Commonwealth's first female governor. Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a former congresswoman and CIA officer, will face Republican Lt. Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, a Marine veteran, after both state parties confirmed their nominees in recent days.",
      "One of the only competitive races of the year, the Virginia gubernatorial contest will be closely watched by both parties \u2014 and is often treated as a referendum on the president's party. Historically, Virginia has voted for a governor of the opposite political party, every time a new president has been elected since 1977.",
      "The race is already breaking state records for fundraising, with Earle-Sears raising more than $3 million from January to March and Spanberger raising around $6.7 million during the same period, according to the campaigns.",
      "In an interview with \"America Decides,\" Spanberger told CBS News she believes national issues will weigh heavily on the race, from the Trump administration's mass layoffs of federal employees, more than 144,000 of whom live in Virginia, as well as what she called an \"antagonistic trade war.\"",
      "\"All of this impacts Virginia, and the stakes of this election reflect that,\" said Spanberger.",
      "When asked whether Earle-Sears supports President Trump's tariff policy, her campaign deflected but said in a statement, \"After leftists like Joe Biden and Abigail Spanberger devastated our economy and standing in the world\u2014President Trump is doing the work to put America first again.\"",
      "Earle-Sears has attacked Spanberger for her votes in Congress supporting Biden administration policies including the Inflation Reduction Act, which passed in 2022 with no Republican support. Earle-Sears argues it has contributed to inflation.",
      "\"I think it's a ridiculous assertion given that my opponent has been eager to claim credit for some of the funding that came through some of those federal dollars to Virginia's Commonwealth,\" Spanberger told CBS News. \"But, the reality is that my opponent is endeavoring to distract, because she's not talking about the fact that we've seen an absolute tanking of the stock market because of Donald Trump's actions.\"",
      "While the economy is a top issue for Virginians and both candidates, advocates are also hoping gun safety mobilizes voters.",
      "Spanberger is set to receive the endorsement of Everytown for Gun Safety Thursday, the group first told CBS News. Everytown, established by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, is also contributing $1 million to the race, which will include organizing efforts and political ads.",
      "Spanberger herself became a volunteer for pro-gun control group Moms Demand Action after leaving the CIA.",
      "\"Abigail Spanberger understands that common-sense laws to keep guns out of dangerous hands are crucial to ensuring public safety,\" John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said of the endorsement.",
      "Everytown also points to their success at the state legislative level in 2023 when nine gun safety volunteers won races and helped flip the House of Delegates, the lower house of Virginia's legislature, to Democratic control.",
      "The group says internal polling from that year revealed it's a top three issue for Virginia voters in battleground districts across Northern Virginia, Richmond and Hampton Roads.",
      "Youngkin vetoed an assault weapons ban and other gun control bills that passed the state legislature last year.",
      "He did sign two other gun measures, including one that bans auto sears, a device that converts semi-automatic handguns into automatic weapons. He also signed \"Lucia's Law,\" making it a crime for parents who allow children deemed as threats to access firearms.",
      "Earle-Sears has supported the governor's vetoes.",
      "In 2021, Earle-Sears became the first Black woman ever elected to statewide office in Virginia. She will have to appeal to moderates and independent voters in the blue-leaning state but has given mixed messages on her support for Mr. Trump in recent years.",
      "In 2020, she co-chaired the group \"Black Americans to re-elect President Trump,\" but in 2022, following the midterms, she told FOX Business it was \"time to move on.\"",
      "\"A true leader understands when they have become a liability,\" she said during the interview. \"A true leader understands when it's time to step off the stage.\"",
      "She went on to vote for Mr. Trump in 2024. A source close to the campaign says she sees the president as a federal partner. It remains to be seen if Mr. Trump offers Earle-Sears an endorsement given the high stakes of this year's few marquee races.",
      "While Mr. Trump made inroads in Virginia during the 2024 presidential election, the state comfortably went for Vice President Kamala Harris in November.",

They have to get there,\" Mr. Trump said at the House GOP campaign arm's fundraising dinner, adding that he had a great meeting with some of the holdouts, but \"just in case there are a couple of Republicans out there \u2014 you just got to get there. Close your eyes and get there. It's a phenomenal bill. Stop grandstanding.\"",
      "The president criticized Democrats on their policies, but admired the fact that \"they always vote in unison,\" saying, \"you don't see somebody that's holding up.\"",
      "\"One little thing the Republican Party has to do is get together and damn vote,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that individual lawmakers may not get \"every little ounce \u2014 it doesn't work that way.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, who's played a key role in shepherding the House GOP on legislation in recent months, promised a \"massive victory\" in the 2026 midterm elections if Republicans follow through on the budget resolution and enact his agenda more broadly. He argued \"they will not be able to even touch your seat,\" and he predicted they'd pick up \"40, 50, or even 60\" seats in the House, an outcome that would defy conventional political dynamics, with the party in control of the White House often losing control of the House in the midterms.",
      "\"If we don't get it done because of stupidity or a couple of people that want to show how great they are, you just have to laugh at them or smile at them or cry right in their face,\" the president continued.",
      "On Wednesday morning, as the House Rules Committee prepared to consider the budget resolution, the president posted on Truth Social to coax the conference to fall in line.",
      "\"Republicans, it is more important now, than ever, that we pass THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL,\" he said. \"The USA will Soar like never before!!!\"",
      "Congressional leaders are pushing to get the budget plan adopted this week before they leave town for a two-week recess. Adopting the budget resolution marks the first step in the reconciliation process, a maneuver that enables Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate and pass the measure with a simple majority. It will allow Republicans to approve the legislation funding the president's agenda without support from Democrats.",
      "After Republicans in the House and Senate had forged ahead on their own budget blueprints earlier this year, the Senate on Saturday adopted the compromise resolution, giving the House just days to overcome opposition and get it over the finish line before the recess. And while GOP leaders came together on the path forward in recent weeks, the approach has frustrated many House Republicans.",
      "The Senate set relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts for several committees, at just about $4 billion dollars, though they expect to find far more. At the same time, it allows for House plans to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending. On top of that, the Senate-adopted plan relies on a budget scoring method known as \"current policy,\" which assumes that continuing the expiring current policies will incur no cost. Under that baseline, the $3.8 trillion it would cost to extend the Trump tax cuts would not be counted.",
      "The Trump tax cuts were originally passed in 2017 using a \"current law\" baseline, and they were set to expire this year. This scoring method, which was also used in the House budget resolution, means that the $3.8 trillion cost to extend the tax cuts is counted as new spending.",
      "Fiscal hawks have criticized the Senate-backed plan, including Rep. Eric Burlison, a Missouri Republican, who told reporters Tuesday that \"there's no way\" the House adopts it at this point. Burlison said he could be convinced by a guarantee that the Senate will make deeper spending cuts, calling the levels currently outlined in the resolution \"anemic\" and \"a joke.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Eli Crane of Arizona, when asked if he'd consider backing the measure if he had assurances on spending cuts from the president, told reporters he would have to \"see some product from the Senate that actually shows that they're serious about cutting.\"",
      "Crane called the pressure from House GOP leadership to fall in line on the resolution to avoid jeopardizing the president's agenda \"nonsense.\"",
      "\"I think it's just another tactic to try and pressure us into the status quo,\" he added.",
      "During the House Rules Committee hearing on the resolution Wednesday, House Budget Committee chairman Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican, said he has \"concerns\" about the Senate's resolution guiding the reconciliation process.",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican, reiterated during the meeting that \"the math still doesn't math.\"",
      "\"The Senate budget is all tax cuts and no spending cuts,\" Roy said, adding that he doesn't trust a promise from the Senate to cut spending.",
      "Roy said his message to the Senate and House GOP leaders, along with the White House, is to \"come show me the math.\"",
      "\"I will not vote for this bill,\" Roy said. \"Because it is not responsible.\"",

      "President Trump on Wednesday announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs, and a lowering of the \"reciprocal tariff\" rate to 10%, effective immediately, he\u00a0said on Truth Social.",
      "The U.S. stock market surged immediately after the president's announcement. At the same time, the president said he's increasing the tariff rate on goods imported from China to 125%.",
      "\"Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,\" he wrote.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified to reporters moments later that the universal tariff rate for the next 90 days will be 10% for virtually all countries, with the exception of China.",
      "The tariff rate of 10% includes the European Union. It's unclear what will happen after the 90-day period concludes, while countries negotiate with the Trump administration. Previous tariff rates on steel, aluminum and auto imports remain unchanged, a White House official said.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote: \"Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters during a race car event at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, the president was asked to explain how he reached a decision to issue the pause.",
      "\"Well, l thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line, they were getting yippy, you know?\" the president said. \"They were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid, unlike these champions.\"",
      "\"I was watching the bond market,\" he added. \"The bond market is very tricky. I was watching it. But if you look at it now, it's, it's beautiful. The bond market right now is beautiful. But yeah, I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy.\"",
      "The president said he \"did a 90-day pause for the people that didn't retaliate.\"",
      "Bessent said he expects the number of countries trying to negotiate with the U.S., which is over 75 now, to climb even higher.",
      "\"President Trump wants to be personally involved,\" Bessent said in explaining the reason for the 90-day pause.",
      "\"No one creates leverage for himself like President Trump,\" Bessent said. Despite the days of market volatility since the tariffs were announced, Bessent said this was Mr. Trump's \"strategy all along.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Leavitt reiterated Mr. Trump's insistence that he wasn't considering an extension or delay.",
      "But on Wednesday, the president said he'd been mulling a pause \"over the last few days.\" The president said he decided to forward with the pause early Wednesday morning. He and his top advisers wrote the statement without lawyers present, he said, and came \"from the heart.\"",
      "The so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs above the baseline 10% worldwide rate went into effect Wednesday.",
      "\"It's unfolded exactly the way it should. It's a beautiful thing,\" said top White House adviser Peter Navarro on Fox Business Channel.",
      "Shortly before announcing the pause Wednesday, Mr. Trump took to Truth Social to write, \"THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!\"",

      "The nation's 988 hotline works like 911, bringing critical access to care for those battling mental health emergencies. Counselor Alejandra takes calls at the nation's largest suicide prevention center \u2014 Los Angeles' Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services. That one center receives 20,000 calls and texts a month.",

One SAMHSA employee said about a quarter of the agency's communication team, who work to raise awareness about the hotline, were let go.",
      "\"The ultimate goal is for all Americans to have access to crisis care for mental health and substance use issues, in the way that 911 provides rapid response for physical health emergencies,\" SAMHSA told CBS News in a statement. \"The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration is working diligently to support the development and sustainability of local treatment and support connected to 988, including the expansion of mobile crisis services and 24/7 walk-in crisis care clinics across the country. Transformation of this scale and building a cohesive crisis care system takes time, and there is more work needed to be able to deliver these critical services to the American public.\"",
      "Morris said additional cuts could lead to \"a very dire situation.\"",

      "Roberts issued an administrative stay that gives the Supreme Court more time to consider a Justice Department request to allow Mr. Trump's removal of Cathy Harris from the Merit Systems Protection Board and Gwynne Wilcox from the National Labor Relations Board. He gave lawyers for Harris and Wilcox until 5 p.m. on April 15 to file a response with the court.",
      "The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court earlier Wednesday to block a pair of district court decisions that restored Harris and Wilcox to their roles at the two independent boards. In a request for emergency relief from the high court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the orders harm the president and the separation of powers.",
      "Sauer asked the high court to issue a stay of district court decisions that found the firings unlawful and said the justices could also take up the case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rules. If the Supreme Court chooses that route, Sauer asked it to consider the constitutionality of federal laws that provide removal protections for members of the NLRB and MSPB.",
      "\"The president should not be forced to delegate his executive power to agency heads who are demonstrably at odds with the administration's policy objectives for a single day \u2014 much less for the months that it would likely take for the courts to resolve this litigation,\" he wrote.",

More than 150 cases challenging Mr. Trump's second-term agenda have been filed in courts across the country and are progressing through the federal judiciary.",
      "At the center of these disputes is the president's authority to remove executive branch officers from their positions at independent agencies. Wilcox was appointed to the NLRB by former President Joe Biden in 2021 and confirmed to a second, five-year term in 2023. Harris, meanwhile, was named to the MSPB for a seven-year term by Biden in 2022 and designated its chair in 2024.",
      "But Wilcox and Harris received emails soon after Mr. Trump returned to the White House informing them that they were being removed from their positions on their respective boards. They each challenged their firing in federal district court, asserting that their termination violated federal laws that limited the grounds for their removal to neglect of duty or malfeasance, and sought relief restoring them to their roles.",
      "In early March, two separate federal judges in Washington, D.C., ruled for Harris and Wilcox, finding that it was unlawful for Mr. Trump to fire them. The judges declared the removals null and void, and said the two each remained members of their respective boards.",
      "But the D.C. Circuit last month agreed to pause those decisions, clearing the way for the president to remove Harris and Wilcox once again. The officials asked the full complement of judges to reconsider their cases, and earlier this week, the full D.C. Circuit ruled 7-4 to put the district court orders back in place, meaning Wilcox and Harris could go back to their jobs at the NLRB and MSPB while they challenged the removals.",
      "In the emergency appeal with the Supreme Court, Sauer argued that Article II of the Constitution empowers the president to remove at-will members of multi-member boards that exercise \"substantial executive power,\" like the NLRB and MSPB.",
      "\"Federal courts lack any constitutional, statutory, or equitable authority to order the reinstatement of agency heads whom the president has removed and to force the president to rely on principal officers whom the president believes should not be exercising any executive power,\" he wrote.",
      "Sauer said that the NLRB and MSPB both fall outside an exception to the president's power to remove executive officers established by the Supreme Court in 1935. In that case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States, the high court found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections to multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",

The Trump administration's imposition and walkback of tariffs has led to stock volatility and sparked worries of a global trade war and recession.",
      "In the United States, many are concerned about levies driving up the price of everyday goods, and Goldman Sachs economists on Monday cited them in a report\u00a0raising the odds of a recession to 45%. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned the tariffs could slow the economy and\u00a0\"will likely increase inflation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's April 2 announcement set out a baseline 10% tax on all U.S. imports, plus additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on imports from 90 countries. He pitched the tariffs as a strategy to reduce the trade deficit between the U.S. and other global powers, including China and the European Union.",

      "Two days after Mr. Trump said during a\u00a0meeting with Israeli Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu that he's not looking at any pauses in tariffs, he announced a 90-day pause on most of his planned tariffs and a lowering of the \"reciprocal tariff\" rate to 10% \u2014 with the exception of China.",
      "The U.S.\u00a0stock market surged\u00a0immediately after the president's announcement.",

      "\"We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they're going to be fair deals,\" Mr. Trump said. \"No other president's going to do this, what I'm doing.\"",
      "On April 9, citing China's unwillingness to negotiate, Mr. Trump announced on Truth Social that he's raising taxes on China to 125%. China announced earlier in the day that it would\u00a0raise its tariffs on U.S. products to 84%.",
      "The president previously said there are \"other things besides tariffs\" that could be open to negotiation, like other countries' \"standards and tests\" that Mr. Trump said make trading more difficult, but he didn't provide further details.",

We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"",
      "\"Sometimes you have to take medicine\"",
      "Mr. Trump doubled down on his trade position while speaking to reporters on April 6 on Air Force One, making clear he did not intend to budge on the reciprocal tariffs set to take effect later this week, nor the universal levies already implemented.",
      "Addressing the U.S. market plunge\u00a0that followed his April 2 announcement \u2014 Wall Street's worst in five years \u2014 and seemingly preparing Americans for more potential market pain to come, the president said, \"I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"",
      "\"What's going to happen with the market I can't tell you, but I can tell you our country has gotten a lot stronger,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "He also said various world leaders had expressed interest in negotiating to roll back tariffs as global markets, reacting to the levies, began to nosedive, too.",
      "\"I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They're dying to make a deal. And I said, we're not going to have deficits with your country. We're not going to do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We're going to have surpluses or at worst, going to be breaking even.\"",
      "Echoing Mr. Trump's sentiment, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick suggested the administration would not waver on the new round of tariffs, in an interview on\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"\u00a0Arguing the policies will help protect U.S. factories and \"reset the power of the United States of America,\" Lutnick acknowledged that \"it is going to be a big change.\"",

Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!\"",
      "He posted as international markets were experienced significant losses, with indices in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Shanghai, South Korea, Taiwan and Tokyo all dropping. U.S. markets went on to have a roller-coaster day, with the S&P 500 ending down a modest 12 points, or 0.2%, at 5,062, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 349 points, or 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite eked out a small gain, rising 15 points to close up 0.1%.",
      "Additional tariffs on China",
      "Mr. Trump vowed on Monday, April 7, to raise duties imposed on China to 50% after Beijing issued retaliatory tariffs of 34% on the U.S. over the weekend.",
      "On Truth Social, the president said Beijing had acted despite his previous \"warning\" that the U.S. would only respond to retaliatory tariffs with even higher taxes for the issuing country, and urged its leaders to withdraw the 34% increase or face higher costs.",
      "\"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\" Mr. Trump said. \"Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",

    "story": [
      "A global trade war is brewing as the U.S. imposes tariffs on a growing list of countries, heightening concerns about economic growth and roiling stock markets around the world.",
      "President Trump on April 2 announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations that are above a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the new taxes are needed to erase a trade deficit between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to the European Union.",
      "Some nations are facing only the universal tariff of 10%, while imports from dozens of other countries are charged a higher specific reciprocal import levy. For instance, Australian imports face the baseline rate of 10%, while China-made products are now paying an import duty that has jumped to 104%\u00a0\u2014 the reciprocal tariffs combined with previously announced duties of 20% \u2014 after slapping its own tariffs on U.S. imports.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his April 2 remarks.",
      "However, on April 9 Mr. Trump backed away from parts of his plan, announcing a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs and lowering the tariff rate to 10% for almost all nations. The notable exception was China, with Mr. Trump saying that he's instead raising the tariff rate on the country's imports to 125%.",
      "\"Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Stocks soared after Mr. Trump's April 9 announcement, with the S&P 500 gaining 8.4% in afternoon trading and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging 7%. Still, some on Wall Street cautioned that the pause is still on track to end in 90 days, which could signal more volatility ahead.",
      "\"The tariff clouds parted for the first time today, but it's too soon to know how sunny the skies will be tomorrow \u2014 or 90 days from now,\" said Daniel Skelly, head of Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management Market Research & Strategy Team, in an email.",
      "Worst-hit countries",
      "Before he announced the pause, Asian nations were set to face the worst of the brunt, with Cambodia facing a tax rate at 49% and Vietnam at 46%, according to Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic.",
      "Mr. Trump also said such levies will boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products. Still, economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.",
      "If the tariffs are maintained by the Trump administration and if other nations impose retaliatory tariffs, both the U.S. and other countries \"will suffer serious recessions,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "China retaliated by saying it planned to impose a retaliatory\u00a034% import fee\u00a0on American products, followed by Mr. Trump retaliating with plans to impose an additional 50% tariff on its imports and China ratcheting up its rate to 84%.",
      "Full list of Trump's reciprocal tariffs by country",
      "When do these tariffs go into effect?",
      "The reciprocal rates were originally set to go into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 9, but later that day President Trump announced a\u00a0postponement for 90 days. That's in addition to a baseline 10% tariff which took effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5.",
      "How did the Trump administration decide what tariffs to charge which countries?",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration determined the tariff rate for each country based on the monetary levies those nations charge on U.S. imports, as well as non-monetary trade barriers like regulations that make it tougher for American products to enter those markets.",
      "The president added that the reciprocal tariffs are still only half the rates charged by those nations on U.S. products, characterizing his new levies as \"kind.\"",
      "Are other countries retaliating against U.S. tariffs?",
      "Yes. China said it would impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10, and then raised the level to 84%. The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose 27 additional U.S. companies to trade sanctions.",
      "\"This is an aggressive, escalatory response that makes a near-term deal to end the trade war between the two superpowers highly unlikely,\" analysts with investment adviser Capital Economics said in a research note.",
      "The European Union announced on April 9 tariffs on more than $22 billion in U.S. products, including beauty products, soybeans and motorcycles, according to AFP.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Backlash to President Trump's tariffs cropped up throughout Capitol Hill in recent days, as Democrats, and some Republicans, expressed concern about the sweeping levies on foreign imports \u2014 while putting forward a handful of possible methods to counter them.",
      "On April 2, the president announced a 10% baseline tariff on all U.S. trading partners while increasing levies on dozens of countries that charge higher taxes on American exports. And after what Mr. Trump described as \"Liberation Day,\" investors appeared spooked, with members of Congress unclear on the path forward.",
      "The response from some lawmakers was swift. Sens. Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat and Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, introduced bipartisan legislation the next day aimed at reasserting Congress' role over trade policy. The measure, known as the Trade Review Act of 2025, would require the president to give Congress 48 hours' notice before imposing or raising tariffs. The president would have to include an explanation and analysis of the potential impact, while lawmakers would have the ability to end the levy with a joint resolution.",
      "Grassley said in a statement that Congress has for too long \"delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch,\" while Cantwell argued that the same check and balance that prevents the president from unilaterally declaring war should exist \"as it relates to protecting our commerce activities.\"Rep. Don Bacon is sponsoring\u00a0companion legislation\u00a0in the House, which he introduced Monday.",
      "Another House effort to address the president's tariffs also got underway this week. Rep. Gregory Meeks, a New York Democrat who serves as the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, introduced a resolution Tuesday to force a vote to block the president's newest round of tariffs, after pledging to do so when Mr. Trump made the announcement.",
      "\"Republicans can't keep ducking this \u2014 it's time they show whether they support the economic pain Trump is inflicting on their constituents,\" Meeks said in a post on X last week.",
      "The move would force a vote on the House floor within 15 days. But the resolution would ultimately require the president's signature or a veto-proof majority, making it a gambit unlikely to succeed.",
      "The efforts come after the Senate approved a resolution last week aimed at blocking the president's Canada tariffs, as a handful of Republicans bucked their party leader to support the measure. The bill would have to be approved by the House, and Meeks announced plans last week to introduce a discharge petition to force the House to take a vote on the issue.",
      "Meanwhile, House Republican leadership has taken steps to quash efforts to block Mr. Trump's tariffs. Last month, they included as part of a\u00a0bill to keep the government funded\u00a0a provision that widely blocks members from forcing a vote on the Canada and Mexico tariffs amid a similar push by Meeks. And this week, as the House prepared to vote on another major piece of legislation, a provision that would prevent members from forcing a vote to block Mr. Trump's tariffs announced April 2 was tucked into a rule governing the measure. When Democratic Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez of New Mexico introduced an amendment to strike the provision, Republicans on the House Rules Committee opposed it.",
      "\"Republicans, through this rule, are refusing to follow the Constitution, which says that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations,\" Leger Fernandez said, noting that just a handful of Republican would need to side with Democrats to review and effectively block the tariffs. \"But Republicans think that they can stop time and stop debate, and in that way, avoid actually voting on the tariffs, actually debating on the tariffs, which is our job.\"",
      "Whether any of the moves can make it through both chambers and have an impact on the tariffs or trade situation more broadly remains to be seen.",

    "summary": "A federal judge granted the Associated Press' request for a preliminary injunction and ordered White House officials to restore its access to certain spaces.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday ruled for the Associated Press in its ongoing legal dispute with the White House and ordered top officials to restore the news outlet's access to the Oval Office, Air Force One and other spaces and events when they are open to White House reporters.",
      "In a 41-page decision, U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden granted the AP a preliminary injunction blocking the federal government from restricting its access to certain media events because of its decision to continue using the name Gulf of Mexico. President Trump on his first day in office issued an executive order renaming the body of water the Gulf of America.",
      "\"The AP seeks restored eligibility for admission to the press pool and limited-access press events, untainted by an impermissible viewpoint-based exclusion,\" McFadden wrote. \"That is all the court orders today: For the government to put the AP on an equal playing field as similarly situated outlets, despite the AP's use of disfavored terminology.\"",
      "McFadden, appointed to the federal bench by Mr. Trump, said his injunction doesn't limit the \"various permissible reasons\" the government may have from excluding journalists from events where access is limited or mandate that all eligible reporters be given access to the president or private government spaces.",
      "He clarified that his decision also does not bar government officials from choosing which journalists to participate in interviews with or from publicly expressing their own views.",
      "\"The court simply holds that under the First Amendment, if the government opens its doors to some journalists \u2014 be it to the Oval Office, the East Room, or elsewhere \u2014 it cannot then shut those doors to other journalists because of their viewpoints.\u00a0 The Constitution requires no less,\" McFadden wrote in his opinion.",
      "McFadden put his decision on hold through April 13 to allow the government time to seek emergency relief from a higher court and prepare to implement the injunction. The Trump administration notified the court\u00a0on Wednesday that it is appealing the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "McFadden found that AP reporters have been \"systematically banned\" from White House events that the broader press corps has been able to attend since Feb. 13, resulting in an \"erosion of quality and capability\" of the news outlet's reporting, and leaving the agency with a product that is \"a shadow of its former self.\"",
      "\"To state the obvious, if the AP's wire reporters are not in the room when news happens, they can hardly be the first to break the news.\u00a0 Instead, they are forced to wait and pick up whatever scraps of verifiable information they can find as they watch their competitors break the story first,\" McFadden wrote, adding that AP reporters \"cannot ask questions from outside a closed door.\"",
      "The dispute between the AP and the White House began after Mr. Trump declared that the name for the Gulf of Mexico would be changed to the Gulf of America. In the wake of that decision, the AP declined to update its influential Stylebook \u2014 used in many newsrooms worldwide \u2014 to reflect the name-change.",
      "The AP said in an announcement on Jan. 23 that Mr. Trump's order renaming the Gulf of Mexico only carries authority within the United States, and other countries did not have to recognize the change. It said that as an international news agency, \"the AP must ensure that places, names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.\"",
      "The AP, a news wire service, is a regular outlet in the White House press pool, which is a group of rotating reporters, videographers and photographers who cover the president daily and travel with him when he leaves the White House grounds. Because of the broad reach of the AP's coverage, local newspapers increasingly rely on it and other syndicated news outlets.",
      "An estimated 4 billion people read the AP daily, the wire service estimates, and it has journalists reporting in nearly 100 countries.",
      "After the AP said it would continue using the name Gulf of Mexico, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt informed its chief White House correspondent on February 11 that the outlet would no longer be allowed in the Oval Office as part of the press pool until the AP changed its Stylebook to use Gulf of America, according to court filings.",
      "AP reporters were then barred from attending press pool events at the White House, including executive order signings in the Oval Office and a press conference, as well as other gatherings covered by the pool in places where Mr. Trump was speaking, the outlet said.",
      "Reporters with the AP who have credentials, known as a \"hard pass,\" that allow general access to White House facilities have also been denied access to events including Mr. Trump's Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as the president's meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda at a convention center in Maryland, according to filings.",
      "But the AP has argued that its access has been restricted beyond those events covered by the press pool to include those covered by the wider White House press corps.",
      "The news outlet filed its lawsuit against White House officials in late February, and the court initially denied the AP's request for a temporary restraining order. But following a hearing last month for a longer preliminary injunction, McFadden granted that relief.",
      "\"The court concludes that the AP is likely to succeed on the merits of its First Amendment viewpoint-discrimination and retaliation claims for both its press pool and East Room allegations,\" the judge wrote.",
      "McFadden found that while the AP does not have a constitutional right to enter the Oval Office, it does have a right not to be excluded based on viewpoint.",
      "\"The AP says that is exactly what is happening. The court agrees,\" he said. \"Indeed, the government has been brazen about this. Several high ranking officials have repeatedly said that they are restricting the AP's access precisely because of the organization's viewpoint.\"",
      "While the White House has said that the AP enjoys the same general media access as other hard-pass holders, McFadden wrote in his decision that \"the AP indeed has been excluded from large events far more often than its peers,\" and found that the wire service is likely to succeed on its claim that White House officials are impermissibly excluding it from limited-access events, like those held in the East Room of the White House and off its grounds.",
      "\"The AP made an editorial decision to continue using 'Gulf of Mexico' in its Stylebook. The government responded publicly with displeasure and explicitly announced it was curtailing the AP's access to the Oval Office, press pool events, and East Room activities,\" the judge wrote. \"If there is a benign explanation for the government's decision, it has not been presented here.\"",
      "McFadden said the disadvantages of having its access restricted have \"poisoned the AP's business model,\" as its ability to disseminate photographs and breaking news has dwindled.",
      "The AP, he said \"cannot be treated worse than its peer wire services either. The court merely declares that the AP's exclusion has been contrary to the First Amendment, and it enjoins the government from continuing down that unlawful path.\"",
      "During the preliminary injunction hearing last month, AP photographer Evan Vucci, who took the infamous photo of Mr. Trump with his fist in the air after the president was hit in the ear with a bullet last July in Pennsylvania, testified on the stand in support of returning his access.",
      "\"It kills us,\" Vucci said, arguing that the outlet's photographers are the \"gold standard\" of photojournalism.",
      "In initial arguments in the case, an attorney for the Trump administration argued that the \"content of a journalist's speech\" can be considered in whether to grant access or not and that Mr. Trump has the ability to block any media he wants from access.",
      "\"There is no right to have special access to the Oval Office,\" the attorney said.",
      "White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, one of three administration officials sued by the AP, argued in a court filing in support of the administration's ban that the determination to ban the outlet from covering Mr. Trump as part of the White House press pool was not about cutting it off entirely from accessing the White House, but rather, \"losing special media access to the president \u2014 a quintessentially discretionary presidential choice that infringes no constitutional right.\"",

    "story": [
      "Federal judges in both New York and Texas have blocked the deportations of Venezuelan men likely to be deported under the Trump administration's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, again stopping the White House's attempts to remove alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang after the Supreme Court cleared the way for their deportations this week.",
      "In one case filed in Manhattan, attorneys for two Venezuelan men who are currently being detained in Orange County, New York, successfully argued to block their clients' deportations and movement outside of the state and the United States. U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein, appointed to the federal bench by President Clinton, granted the temporary relief.",
      "After their arrests, both men were first transferred to an ICE detention center in Texas before being moved to New York. One man, who is 21, came to the U.S. to escape Tren de Aragua violence, and the other, who is 32, actively protested the regime of Venezuelan dictator Nicholas Maduro, their attorneys wrote.",
      "The new case in Texas was brought on behalf of the same Venezuelans who challenged their potential deportation in Washington, D.C., where the initial block of the deportations was entered by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg before it was lifted by the Supreme Court on Monday in a 5-4 decision. The Texas judge overseeing the petition, Fernando Rodriguez Jr., was appointed to the federal bench by President Trump during his first term.",
      "In a brief order shortly after the habeas petition was filed, Rodriguez blocked the Trump administration from transferring or removing from the El Valle Detention Center the three Venezuelan men or any other Venezuelan citizen held in the Southern District of Texas who are subject to deportation under Mr. Trump's proclamation.",
      "The temporary order also prevents the Trump administration from unilaterally transporting those migrants outside of Willacy County \u2014 where the detention facility is located \u2014 or neighboring Cameron County, Texas.",
      "The temporary restraining order from Rodriguez will remain in place until April 23, or until he weighs in further. He is set to consider whether to extend his order or issue other forms of emergency relief at a hearing set for Friday.",
      "Rodriguez wrote in his decision that absent emergency relief, there is a \"substantial likelihood\" that federal immigration officials will remove the Venezuelan migrants who face deportation under the Alien Enemies Act from the U.S.",
      "\"In the present matter, the court finds that the removal of J.A.V, J.G.G., W.G.H., or any other individual subject to the proclamation, by the United States would cause immediate and irreparable injury to the removed individuals, as they would be unable to seek habeas relief,\" he wrote. \"Furthermore, if the United States erroneously removed an individual to another country based on the proclamation, a substantial likelihood exists that the individual could not be returned to the United States\"",
      "Rodriguez referenced the ongoing case brought by a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was arrested by immigration authorities last month and sent to El Salvador, where he is currently in the notorious prison known as CECOT. A Trump administration official acknowledged Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error,\" but the government has said he is now in custody of the Salvadoran government.",
      "An emergency appeal involving Abrego Garcia is currently pending before the Supreme Court.",
      "Both sets of plaintiffs are attempting to convince judges not just to block the deportations of the men who filed suit, but to block all future deportations of any Venezuelans under this statute. They argue that the Trump administration's invocation of the law is unconstitutional because the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela and dispute the government's categorization of the plaintiffs as gang members, arguing they have been falsely accused of being in the Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "\"Tren de Aragua, a criminal organization, is not a nation or a foreign government and is not part of the Venezuelan government,\" the complaint filed in Texas says, adding that the government's evidence for Tren de Aragua membership \"relies heavily on physical attributes like tattoos, hand gestures, symbols, logos, graffiti and manner of dress,\" none of which, attorneys argue, are \"reliable ways of identifying gang members.\"",
      "The Alien Enemies Act of 1798 has only been used three times, and all during declared wars.",
      "Attorneys in the New York case argued in their habeas petition that the two men \"and others similarly situated to them are now all at imminent risk of removal,\" under the Alien Enemies Act, adding that since Monday, \"the government is resuming its summary removals of Venezuelans who are in ongoing immigration proceedings, including petitioners here, without any judicial review.\"",
      "The new cases were filed after the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to restart for now deportations of migrants it claims are members of a Venezuelan gang. But the court specified that any migrants facing removal under the Alien Enemies Act are subject to due process, and said that as of Monday night, detainees must receive notice that they are subject to deportation.",
      "The Supreme Court said in an unsigned opinion that \"the notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs.\"",
      "The court also specified that any claims brought by migrants that the administration says are covered by Mr. Trump's proclamation belong in habeas corpus proceedings to be brought in the district where they are confined.",
      "While the high court struck down the judge's lower court block on further deportations under the statute after the Trump administration sent two planes carrying alleged gang members deported under the Alien Enemies Act to El Salvador, it also ruled that those subject to removal under the law are entitled to judicial review. There was no judicial review, multiple courts found, for over 230 migrants who were sent to El Salvador in March, where they remain detained at a maximum security prison there.",

      "The probable identification of the jawbone from Taiwan as Denisovan expands the region where scientists know these ancient people once lived, said Tsutaya.",
      "\"Denisovans must therefore have been capable of adapting to a wide range of habitat types,\" study co-author Frido Welker told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The partial jawbone was first recovered when a fishing operation dredged the seafloor in the Penghu Channel near the Taiwan Strait. After it was sold to an antique shop, a collector spotted it and purchased it in 2008, then later donated it to Taiwan's National Museum of Natural Science.",
      "Based on the composition of marine invertebrates found attached to it, the fossil was dated to the Pleistocene era. But exactly which species of early human ancestor it belonged to remained a mystery.",
      "The condition of the fossil made it impossible to study ancient DNA. But recently, scientists in Taiwan, Japan and Denmark were able to extract some protein sequences from the incomplete jawbone.",
      "An analysis showed some protein sequences resembled those contained in the genome of a Denisovan fossil recovered in Siberia. The findings were published in the journal Science.",

      "Eight minutes and 46 seconds later, the third stage engine of the Soyuz 2.1a rocket shut down and the crew ship was released to fly on its own, followed moments later by deployment of its two solar panels and navigation antennas.",
      "The ferry ship then carried out an automated rendezvous with the space station, moving in for docking at the multiport Prichal module at 4:57 a.m. as the two spacecraft sailed 260 miles above western Russia.",
      "\"Congratulations, Sergey, congratulations on your arrival at the International Space Station,\" Russian mission control radioed. After extensive leak checks to verify an airtight structural seal, hatches were opened at 7:28 a.m., allowing Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim to float into the station.",
      "Welcoming them aboard were Soyuz MS-26/72S crewmates Alexey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Donald Pettit, along with SpaceX Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, NASA astronaut Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov.",
      "\"It was the trip of a lifetime and an honor to be here,\" Kim told flight controllers during a traditional postdocking video conference.",
      "Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim are replacing Ovchinin, Vagner and Pettit, who were launched to the ISS on Sept. 11 and who plan to return to Earth aboard their own Soyuz on April 19 to wrap up a 219-day stay in space.",
      "The Crew 10 fliers, launched on March 14, replaced their Crew 9 predecessors \u2014 Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov and Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams \u2014 who returned to Earth on March 18.",
      "Rotating space station crews have typically carried out, on average, six-month tours of duty aboard the lab complex. But starting with Kim's flight, the Russians are increasing Soyuz durations to eight months to gather more data on the effects of long-term stays in space.",
      "As such, Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim are expected to return to Earth around Dec. 9.",
      "In a pre-flight interview with CBS News, Jonathan Yong \"Jonny\" Kim, the son of South Korean immigrants and a father of three, said he first heard of the Navy's SEALs when he was 16 years old. He eventually joined the elite corps and went on to participate in more than 100 combat operations as a member of SEAL Team Three in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.",
      "\"To me, it is the strongest calling I've ever had in my life, even to this day,\" he said. \"I've had additional callings in life. But it was really that first calling I had to be a SEAL that I will remember for the rest of my life. Because it was the first time that I felt I had a purpose, and I had a dream.\"",
      "That dream was to serve as a warrior.",
      "\"Back then, I used to have a really narrow focus on that,\" he said. \"But to me, a warrior is someone that is in continued pursuit of excellence in their craft. It doesn't have to be combat. It can be in medicine. It can be as a NASA astronaut. It can be in politics. It can be anything.",
      "\"But it's someone who's passionate and in pursuit of continued excellence. And the reason why it just resonated so well with me is because it was everything I wasn't at the time, but I wanted to be.\"",
      "Kim said he had \"some terrible moments\" in combat and ended up \"just really burnt out. I was very burnt out from the combat, from the war and the loss. ... I needed a way to continue serving, and it seemed logical that medicine would be that vehicle.\"",
      "Already a veteran combat medic, Kim was accepted in Harvard Medical School. Along the way, he said, he \"probably went a little too extreme in ensuring that previous successes did not set myself up for the future.\"",
      "\"I ensured that the people I worked with in the hospital didn't know I was previously a SEAL, because I wanted my patients, I wanted my colleagues to think of me as dependable and proficient and a good physician. Not because I used to be a SEAL, but because that's who I was.\"",
      "Then, as he was wrapping up medical school and preparing for his residency, Kim watched the initial test flight of NASA's Orion moonship in 2014 on YouTube and became a self-described \"space nerd.\" He met physician and former astronaut Scott Parazynski, who encouraged him to apply to NASA for astronaut training.",
      "Out of 18,000 applications for the class of 2017, NASA chose 12, including Kim.",
      "He said learning Russian was the most challenging aspect of training to fly aboard a Soyuz, but added that his crewmates spoke excellent English and had gone out of their way to welcome him aboard.",
      "\"We are friends. I mean, we're very, very professional,\" Kim said. \"We work well together. ... I've had Alexey and Sergey over for dinner and they've done the same thing for me. So our relationships are personal and there's a lot of trust and friendship there.",
      "As for being assigned to a Soyuz flight, riding a vehicle that's been around for decades as opposed to the roomier touchscreen-equipped SpaceX Crew Dragon, Kim said he was more than happy to fly with the Russians.",
      "\"I just love technology (but) there's also something to be said about reliability, or as the saying goes, 'If it's not broke, don't fix it,'\" he said. \"The amount of testing and the reliability the Soyuz has shown over decades is unsurpassed and is absolutely admirable.\"",
      "During the course of his stay aboard the station, Kim said, he hopes to venture outside the lab for a spacewalk at some point, but added he would be more that happy to serve in any capacity.",
      "\"The modern day astronaut is a jack of all trades,\" he told CBS News. \"You know, we train to do spacewalks. We train to support space walks, train to do research. One day we might be plumbers or mechanics, we might be technicians repairing a radio or we might be pipetting various fluids into other fluids for research.",
      "\"So it's kind of all of the above, whatever the demands that the space station need at a time.\"",

      "Path of totality for the 2045 total solar eclipse",

      "It will be visible in many states as it moves from coast to coast. The eclipse will start in California and move east to end in Florida, similar to 2017, Arav said.",

    "summary": "Meta whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams testified Wednesday afternoon before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism.",
    "story": [
      "Meta whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams told senators in testimony Wednesday on Capitol Hill that the social media company worked \"hand in glove\" with the Chinese government to censor its platforms, among other allegations.",
      "\"I saw Meta executives repeatedly undermine U.S. national security and betray American values,\" Wynn-Williams said in her opening remarks, which were obtained by CBS News before the hearing.",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism and led the bipartisan hearing, said Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \"made censorship his business model.\"",
      "\"The evidence that we have in black and white is a company and leadership that is willing to do anything, anything, work with America's chief competitor, work with our chief adversary,\" Hawley said.",
      "Hawley sent a letter to Zuckerberg Thursday requesting his testimony before the subcommittee, writing, \"The American people deserve to know the truth about your company.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams began working at Meta, then known as Facebook, as the director of Global Public Policy in 2011. In her almost seven years with the company, Wynn-Williams told the panel she witnessed the company provide \"custom built censorship tools\" for the Chinese Communist Party. She said a Chinese dissident living in the United States was removed from Facebook in 2017 after pressure from Chinese officials. Facebook said at the time it took action against the regime critic, Guo Wengui, for sharing someone else's personal information.",
      "Wynn-Williams described the use of a \"virality counter\" that flagged posts with over 10,000 views for review by a \"chief editor,\" which Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called \"an Orwellian censor.\" These \"virality counters\" were used not only in Mainland China, but also in Hong Kong and Taiwan, according to Wynn-Williams's testimony.",
      "Wynn-Williams also told senators Chinese officials could \"potentially access\" the data of American users. When Meta engineers expressed concern about data security, Wynn-Williams testified that Meta leadership, including Zuckerberg, were indifferent.",
      "Wynn-Williams testified Zuckerberg was \"personally invested\" in Meta's business relationship with China, claiming he committed to learning Mandarin and \"had weekly Mandarin sessions with employees.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams alleged Meta's artificial intelligence model known as \"Llama\" was used to help DeepSeek. DeepSeek is a Chinese AI company that sent shockwaves through the American technology industry earlier this year when its AI model was shown to be competitive with OpenAI's ChatGPT at a fraction of the cost.",
      "In a statement last year on Llama, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone wrote, \"The alleged role of a single and outdated version of an American open-source model is irrelevant when we know China is already investing over 1T to surpass the US technologically, and Chinese tech companies are releasing their own open AI models as fast, or faster, than US ones.\"",
      "Wynn-Williams encouraged senators to continue investigating Meta's role in the development of artificial intelligence in China, as they continue their probe into the social media company founded by Zuckerberg.",
      "\"The greatest trick Mark Zuckerberg ever pulled was wrapping the American flag around himself and calling himself a patriot and saying he didn't offer services in China, while he spent the last decade building an $18 billion business there,\" she said.",
      "In response to her opening statement, a Meta spokesperson called Wynn-Williams' testimony \"divorced from reality and riddled with false claims.\"",
      "\"While Mark Zuckerberg himself was public about our interest in offering our services in China and details were widely reported beginning over a decade ago, the fact is this: we do not operate our services in China today,\" Meta said in a statement.",
      "Meta, which changed its name from Facebook in 2021, operates some of the most popular social media platforms in the United States, including its previous namesake Facebook as well as Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads.",
      "Washington is taking a more aggressive posture toward China and its growing threat to American economic interests and national security. The Trump administration increased tariffs on imported goods from China to 125% Wednesday. The administration also continues to pursue the sale of TikTtok, a short-form video platform owned by Chinese company ByteDance, to an American buyer. And on Capitol Hill in 2023, the House of Representatives created the Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party to investigate China's challenge to American global power.",
      "In March, Wynn-Williams published a memoir called \"Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed and Lost Idealism\" about her time at Meta.",

      "The technology giant has taken a number of steps to mitigate the impact of President Trump's steep tariffs on China. That includes ramping up iPhone production in India, which is subject to far lower levies than China, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week. Apple continues to make most iPhones in China.",
      "Apple has added workers in its main India factory, extending shifts to reach its goal of ramping up production by 20%, Reuters reported.",
      "Mr. Trump on April 2 announced a 27% tariff on India, which Mr. Trump on Wednesday\u00a0paused for 90 days\u00a0along with import taxes on dozens of other countries as the U.S. seeks to negotiate more favorable trade deals. By contrast, a 125% \"reciprocal tariff\" on China remains in effect.",
      "Apple chartered cargo flights to transport the smartphones to the U.S. because it \"wanted to beat the tariff,\" a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Apple reportedly spent eight months lobbying Indian airport authorities to cut the phones' customs clearance time down from 30 hours to six hours.

      "In a move that threatens to raise costs on all electronics, including iPhones, the White House on Tuesday said it would follow through on a threat to enact a 104% tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the U.S. The levy took effect Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. EDT. Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump raised the tariff rate to 125%, effective immediately.",
      "The price for the popular tech tool, which starts at $599 for the most basic model, the iPhone 16e, is poised to increase by hundreds of dollars, depending on how Apple responds to the sweeping levies. The iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which features Apple Intelligence, costs $999.",
      "The iPhone accounts for about half of Apple's revenue. Most of its smartphones are manufactured in China.",
      "Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives said in a research note Tuesday that the added levies could create a \"category 5 price storm\" for personal electronics and other gadgets. Taxing China and other nations at such rates is the equivalent of \"flipping a boat upside down in the ocean with no life rafts,\" he added.",
      "How much more could an iPhone cost?",
      "The iPhone 16 Pro Max 256 GB, which is among the devices that are assembled in China, retails for $1,199. Under the new tariffs on Chinese imports, the price of the device could rise by $675, or 56%, lifting the price tag to $1,874, an April 9 analysts from UBS Investment Research shows.",
      "The cost of an iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which is made in India and costs $999, could increase to $1,119, an increase of 12%, the investment bank found.",
      "An April 3 analysis from Rosenblatt Securities found that the Cupertino, California-based company could raise iPhone prices by 43% to offset the effects of reciprocal tariffs.",
      "Apple didn't respond to a request for comment on how the Trump tariffs could affect iPhone prices.",
      "What if Apple moved production to the U.S.?",
      "President Trump has said the new U.S. tariffs are aimed at spurring both domestic and foreign companies to build in the U.S. But for Apple and other companies, manufacturing their products in the U.S. entail significantly higher labor costs \u2014 costs that would largely be passed on to consumers.",
      "If Apple were to begin assembling iPhones in the U.S, a Chinese-made device that previously sold for $1,000 would cost $3,500 if manufactured in New Jersey, Texas or some other state, Ives estimated.",
      "\"Saying we can just make this in the USA is a statement that incredibly understates the complexity of the Asia supply chain and the way electronics, chips, semi fabs, hardware, smartphones, etc. are made for U.S. consumers over the last 30 years,\" he said in a report.",
      "As a result, Ives is highly skeptical that tariffs alone will lead companies to shift their manufacturing plants from low-cost havens like China to the U.S., calling the idea \"absurd.\"",
      "But some companies, including Apple, could attempt to rejigger supply chains to avoid the steepest tariffs. For example, Apple plans to manufacture more iPhones in India to reduce its reliance on China, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported, citing people familiar with the matter.",

    "summary": "A federal immigration official acknowledged last week that the removal of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man, to El Salvador was an \"administrative error.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday said the Trump administration must facilitate the release of a Maryland man mistakenly deported from custody in El Salvador, but ordered additional proceedings before a federal district court.",
      "In an unsigned decision, the high court acknowledged that a late Monday deadline set by the district court judge to secure the return to the U.S. of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, and paused by Chief Justice John Roberts had already passed, effectively granting in part the emergency relief sought by the Trump administration.",
      "But the court said that the district court's order \"properly requires the government to 'facilitate'\" Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody and to \"ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\"",
      "The Supreme Court went on to say that the intended scope of the term \"effectuate\" in the lower court's decision is unclear and may exceed its authority. The high court directed the district court to provide more clarification with the case sent back for further proceedings.",
      "\"The district court should clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs,\" the court said in an unsigned opinion. \"For its part, the Government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.\"",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Paula Xinis issued an order Thursday evening following the Supreme Court's decision directing the Trump administration to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia \"as soon as possible.\"",
      "She gave the Department of Justice until 9:30 a.m. Friday to detail where Abrego Garcia is and the plans to bring him back to the U.S.",
      "There were no noted dissents, and the three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, noted their respect for the court's disposition of the application. Sotomayor said in a statement joined by Kagan and Jackson that there is agreement among the justices \"that the proper remedy is to provide Abrego Garcia with all the process to which he would have been entitled had he not been unlawfully removed to El Salvador.\"",
      "\"As the Supreme Court correctly recognized, it is the exclusive prerogative of the President to conduct foreign affairs,\" a DOJ spokesperson said Thursday. \"By directly noting the deference owed to the Executive Branch, this ruling once again illustrates that activist judges do not have the jurisdiction to seize control of the President's authority to conduct foreign policy.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers asked the Trump administration in a court filing to facilitate his release from the notorious Salvadoran supermax prison known as CECOT Thursday evening and to dispatch a plane to retrieve him. They cited the \"grave risk to his safety in El Salvador.\"",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to step in after a federal district judge on Friday ordered it to take immediate action to return Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. The 29-year-old Salvadoran national was arrested by immigration authorities on March 15 and was among the more than 200 people sent on deportation flights to El Salvador last month.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case sparked backlash after a federal immigration official acknowledged in a court filing last week that his removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error\" and \"oversight.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. illegally in 2011 when he was 16 years old and was arrested in 2019, according to court documents. During immigration proceedings, the Department of Homeland Security claimed that Abrego Garcia was a member of the gang MS-13, citing a Chicago Bulls hat and hoodie he was wearing and allegations from a confidential informant who said he belonged to a branch of MS-13 that operates on Long Island, New York, court records show.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers said he has never lived on Long Island and has no affiliation with MS-13. They also said he has no criminal history and has never been charged or convicted of any criminal offenses in the U.S. or El Salvador.",
      "An immigration judge detained Abrego Garcia after denying a request for release on bond, which was upheld by an immigration appeals board. But he was ultimately granted withholding of removal to El Salvador, a legal status that prohibits the government from returning him to his home country because he is more likely than not to face persecution from local gangs, according to court records.",
      "Abrego Garcia was released from custody following that decision and has lived for six years in Maryland with his wife and their children. He had regular check-ins with immigration authorities, according to court filings, but was arrested on March 12 after he was stopped by immigration agents while driving with his son in the back seat. Abrego Garcia was taken into custody and transported to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in Baltimore, Louisiana and Texas before he was flown to El Salvador, according to legal filings.",
      "After Abrego Garcia was sent to the Salvarodan prison last month, he and his wife, a U.S. citizen, filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Maryland alleging his removal violated federal immigration law and seeking an order requiring his return to U.S. custody.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis granted that request following a hearing Friday and directed the government to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. no later than 11:59 p.m. Monday. The Justice Department asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit to halt that order, and while its request was pending, asked the Supreme Court to intervene. The 4th Circuit then declined to pause the district court's decision.",
      "In a filing with the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the lower court order \"sets the United States up for failure\" because it interfered with President Trump's ability to conduct foreign diplomacy and set a tight timeline for compliance. He wrote that the U.S. cannot force the release of Abrego Garcia because he is now in the custody of the Salvadoran government.",
      "\"The United States does not control the sovereign nation of El Salvador, nor can it compel El Salvador to follow a federal judge's bidding,\" the solicitor general wrote.",
      "Sotomayor warned in her statement that the government's argument \"implies that it could deport and incarcerate any person, including U. S. citizens, without legal consequence, so long as it does so before a court can intervene.\"",
      "Lawyers for Abrego Garcia called his case \"one of one,\" and argued in court papers that requiring the government to facilitate their client's return is \"not novel,\" because the district court's order just requires the Trump administration to correct its own error.",
      "\"The executive branch may not seize individuals from the streets, deposit them in foreign prisons in violation of court orders, and then invoke the separation of powers to insulate its unlawful actions from judicial scrutiny,\" they wrote.",
      "Abrego Garcia's legal team called the government's mistake in removing him \"Kafka-esque,\" and noted that he has lived in the U.S. for several years without any issues.",
      "\"The government offers no evidence that he has become a threat overnight,\" they wrote.",
      "Migrants removed from the U.S. are being housed in CECOT as a result of a temporary agreement the Trump administration reached with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, under which the U.S. government is paying the Salvadoran government $6 million to hold U.S. detainees for a year.",
      "Citing this arrangement, Abrego Garcia's lawyers argued that the U.S. government \"functionally controls Abrego Garcia's detention \u2014 it has simply contracted with El Salvador to be the jailer.\"",
      "Lower courts also said that the government has control over Abrego Garcia, since he is being temporarily housed in CECOT at the Trump administration's request.",
      "\"The government's claim that it can remove an individual from the United States pursuant to such an agreement and thereby lose the ability to reclaim that individual and return him to the country for process (or for any other purpose) cannot stand,\" Judge Stephanie Thacker, who sits on the 4th Circuit, wrote in an opinion. She added that \"the government's actions in this case most assuredly violated the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.\"",
      "Thacker, who was joined by Judge Robert King, wrote that \"the government cannot escape its responsibility to return Abrego Garcia to the United States by claiming it now lacks authority to control El Salvador.\"",
      "While the Trump administration has acknowledged that it inadvertently sent Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, it has argued that the federal courts do not have the power to demand his return since he's no longer in U.S. custody. Administration officials have also claimed that he is an MS-13 \"leader,\" though they have not produced evidence to support the allegations.",
      "During last week's hearing before Xinis, Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni repeatedly struggled to answer the judge's questions but said he wasn't given sufficient information by the administration.",
      "\"The facts are conceded, plaintiff Abrego Garcia should not have been removed,\" Reuveni said.",
      "When questioned about why the government is not able to return Abrego Garcia, Reuveni said he \"asked the government the same question\" and did not receive an answer. The Justice Department lawyer said multiple times he was \"frustrated\" with the government's lack of cooperation in the case.",
      "Following Friday's argument, Reuveni was placed on administrative leave, and Sauer said in a filing that his statements were \"inappropriate\" and \"do not reflect the position of the United States.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News about Reuveni's employment status, Attorney General Pam Bondi said, \"At my direction, every Department of Justice attorney is required to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States. Any attorney who fails to abide by this direction will face consequences.\"",

      "The S&P 500 fell 189 points, or 3.5%, Thursday to close at 5,268. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1,015 points, or 2.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite sank 4.3%.",
      "China this week announced more countermeasures against the U.S., and market losses accelerated after the White House clarified that it will tax Chinese imports at 145%, not 125% as initially announced by Mr. Trump on social media. The swings also hit the bond market despite a better-than-expected report on inflation. U.S. crude oil prices fell more than 3%.",
      "It's been a wild couple of weeks on Wall Street with Mr. Trump's tariff announcements,\u00a0reversals and retaliation from U.S. trading partners. That volatility seems unlikely to change in the coming weeks with the U.S. and China still locked in a tit-for-tat tariff battle and earnings season kicking off on Friday with the latest results from some of the nation's biggest banks.",
      "\"Despite Wednesday's announcements to lower the reciprocal tariff rate for most countries to 10%, the escalation between the U.S. and China could dramatically impact trade between the world's two largest economies,\" said Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer for wealth management at UBS, in a research note.",
      "Taking into account Mr. Trump's 145% levy on Chinese imports, UBS currently estimates the overall U.S.\u00a0effective tariff rate at 27%, versus 9% prior to April 2. \"Excluding trade with China, the effective tariff rate is 11%,\" Haefele added.",
      "\"Everything is still very volatile, because with Donald Trump, you don't know what to expect,\" said Francis Lun, chief executive of Geo Securities. \"This is really big uncertainty in the market. The threat of recession has not faded.\"",
      "Markets had been sinking earlier Wednesday on worries that Mr. Trump's trade war could drag the global economy into a recession. But then came the posting on social media that investors worldwide had been waiting and wishing for.",
      "\"I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE,\" Mr. Trump said, saying more than 75 countries are negotiating on trade and not retaliating against his latest increases in tariffs. China was a huge exception, with the president raising tariffs\u00a0 on its products to 145%.",
      "Investors went \"from fear to euphoria,\" Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, said in a commentary. On Wednesday, following Mr. Trump's tariff-pause announcement, the S&P 500 surged 9.5%, its third-best day since 1940. The index is still below where it was when Trump announced his sweeping set of tariffs last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shot to a gain of nearly 3,000 points, or 7.9%. The Nasdaq composite leaped 12.2%.",
      "\"It's now a manageable risk, especially as global recession tail bets get unwound, and most of Asia's exporters breathe a massive sigh of relief,\" Innes said. Analysts had expected the global comeback given that U.S. stocks had one of their best days in history on Wednesday as investors registered their relief over Trump's decision.",
      "The trade war isn't over, and an escalating battle between the world's two largest economies can create plenty of damage. U.S. stocks are also still below where they were just a week ago. Technology stocks were the biggest drag on markets in early trading Thursday, followed by the industrial and the financial sectors.",
      "CPI report brings good news",
      "On a positive note, the U.S. government's latest consumer inflation data revealed inflation in March\u00a0rose\u00a02.4% on an annual basis, a sign of progress in the Federal Reserve's battle to\u00a0bring down inflation\u00a0to a 2% rate.",
      "\"This month's inflation report showed that CPI dropped across the board in March, which is welcome news for the Federal Reserve, which would like to cut rates if significant damage is done to the economy through increased tariffs, but otherwise would be reluctant to cut rates in the face of an inflation threat,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management.",
      "March \"saw a fairly big cooling in inflation (both headline and core) and this, coupled w/the healthy job adds from last week, point to robust underlying economic fundamentals. The downtick in inflation gives breathing room for the Fed to be more forceful in responding to market turmoil,\" said equity analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, in a report.",
      "From bear investors' perspective, however, \"inflation is still running above the Fed's target and regardless, Mar and Q1 numbers are irrelevant given how much the world has changed. Trump's tariffs are only hitting the economy now, and it will take months before they fully show up in the data,\" Crisafulli added.",
      "In other words, according to most analysts, the situation is still too uncertain to call.",
      "\"It's much too soon to blow the all clear \u2014 both on tariffs or on inflation \u2014 since the tariff damage has only been postponed as of now, and will only be relieved if tariff deals can be struck across the board,\" Zaccarelli said.",
      "\"Inflation still remains a concern because the full impact of tariffs is yet to be felt, however, at least the underlying trends (e.g. non-tariff related inflation) seems benign at this time. We will be keeping a close eye on PPI tomorrow in order to determine whether or not future inflation is already in the pipeline,\" he added.",
      "In report Thursday, TD Securities analysts echoed that sentiment, saying, \"Indeed, uncertainty remains in the air as the outlook for consumer price inflation remains blurred by ongoing trade policy developments.\"",

    "summary": "Inflation cooled in March, but economists expect prices to reaccelerate as some of President Trump's tariffs kick in.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index in March rose 2.4% on an annual basis, showing progress in the Federal Reserve's battle to bring down inflation to a 2% rate.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was forecast to rise 2.6% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in those prices over time.",
      "March's report comes after\u00a0inflation rose 2.8% on an annual basis in February.",
      "On a monthly basis, prices actually fell 0.1% in March, the first monthly drop in nearly five years.",
      "Inflation eased last month due partly to lower fuel prices, with gasoline tumbling 9.8% on an annual basis, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said.",
      "Another reason prices fell was sharp drops in travel-related costs, including airfares, which decreased 5.3% just from February to March. Hotel room prices dropped 3.5%.",
      "Economists said those declines in part reflected much slower international demand as the number of tourists visiting the United States has fallen sharply amid Trump's aggressive trade policy.",
      "Visits to the United States from overseas fell nearly 12% last month, according to government data.",
      "What experts say",
      "Easing inflation combined with President Trump's announcement yesterday of a 90-day pause in his reciprocal tariffs should help alleviate some concerns for the Federal Reserve when it meets on May 7 to make its next interest rate decision, said Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank.",
      "But because other tariffs orchestrated by Mr. Trump have recently gone into effect \u2014 such as auto tariffs \u2013 inflation nevertheless could pick up later this year, experts say.",
      "Yet March's data is \"backward looking\" and doesn't reflect the trade policy changes orchestrated by the Trump administration, noted Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs are still expected to lift inflation later in the year as the impact of the import duties trickle through the economy. Because tariffs are paid by U.S. importers like Walmart when they accept shipments of foreign goods, they typically pass off all or some of the tariff cost onto consumers through higher prices.",
      "The president's 90-day pause excludes China, a major exporter to the U.S., which will continue to face tariffs of 125% on its goods. And Mr. Trump's 10% universal duty will also likely to push up prices in the coming months, economists say. The higher import taxes will likely weigh on the economy's growth as well.",
      "What the CPI shows about egg prices",
      "Although consumer prices cooled in March, the CPI data showed egg prices continued to inch higher last month. According to the CPI figures, egg prices increased in March to reach a new record-high of $6.23 despite a drop in wholesale prices and no egg farms having bird flu outbreaks.",
      "More recently, grocers have told CBS News that egg prices are\u00a0showing signs of easing.",
      "Bird flu outbreaks were cited as the major cause of price spikes in January and February after more than 30 million egg-laying chickens were killed to prevent the spread of the disease.",
      "Since the current bird flu outbreak began, more than 168 million birds have been slaughtered, most of them egg-laying chickens. Any time a bird gets sick, the entire flock is killed to help keep bird flu from spreading. That can have an effect on the egg supply because massive egg farms may have millions of birds.",
      "What the CPI means for your money",
      "Despite today's cooler-than-expected CPI numbers, inflationary risks are still a threat to the U.S. economy, especially as some of Mr. Trump's tariffs are still in place while others are merely delayed, experts say.",
      "\"Going forward, the Fed is likely to face a difficult trade-off as tariff-driven price increases start to feed through to the inflation data and activity remains soft,\" Haigh said. \"We expect the Fed's initial reaction to be cautious, but the risks remain that a sharper than expected slowdown in the economy could result in a resumption of the Fed's easing cycle.\"",
      "Three of four economists polled by FactSet expect the Fed will hold rates steady at its next meeting on May 7. The current federal funds \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 now stands in a range 4.5% to 4.75%.",
      "That means consumers and businesses are unlikely to see any relief on loan rates in the near term, although economists are penciling in cuts later in the year, with the majority forecasting a reduction at the Fed's June 18 meeting.",

    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now backing an additional measles vaccine shot for some travelers within the United States, multiple health officials tell CBS News, in response to record outbreaks of the highly contagious virus this year.",
      "In a letter shared with health departments on April 8, the CDC said it would now be recommending that visitors to areas affected by measles outbreaks within the United States follow stepped up vaccination guidance issued by local authorities.",
      "Most adults still do not need an additional dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, the CDC says. But for \"people going to or living in areas in the United States with ongoing community-wide measles transmission,\" the CDC says doctors should \"reassess need\" for vaccination.",
      "This means that adult and teen travelers to some counties in Texas and Kansas \u2014 the states that have updated their recommendations \u2014 should get a second dose if they have not received two doses already or get two doses if they are unvaccinated. Infants should get an early first dose before the typically recommended age of 12 months old, followed by two more doses, and children over 12 months old should get an early second dose if they already have one, or two doses if they are unvaccinated.",
      "Previously, the CDC had said that one dose of the measles vaccine or other evidence of immunity was \"sufficient for most adults.\"",
      "But the CDC has long had stepped up recommendations for Americans preparing for international travel. Under those recommendations, children over 12 months old, teenagers and adults should have two doses if they do not have other evidence of immunity, and infants should get an early first dose.",
      "Local outbreaks of the virus have also been reported to the CDC from New Jersey, Georgia and Ohio, the agency said last week. Other states have since reported local spread, including Indiana and Colorado.",
      "More than 600 measles cases across at least 21 states have been reported so far this year, the most since a record 2019 wave of the virus that reached 1,274 cases nationwide. Two unvaccinated children in Texas, and an unvaccinated adult in neighboring New Mexico, have died.",
      "While the CDC said that health departments could share the updated guidance with providers in their state, it is unclear why the agency did not publish their latest recommendations on its own website. A bulletin issued by the agency on April 8 about measles did not mention the new vaccination recommendations for domestic travel.",
      "\"CDC's clinical vaccination guidance for measles outbreaks has not changed. During measles outbreaks, health departments may provide additional recommendations to protect their communities,\" a spokesperson for the agency said in a statement.",
      "They said that the decision to offer an early dose of vaccine to young children \"should be made carefully after weighing the risks of the potential long-term impact of lower immune responses\" compared to the benefit of early protection.",
      "\"There are no recommendations to receive a third dose of MMR vaccine during measles outbreaks,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Who should get another measles shot?",
      "Vaccination of visitors to areas affected by outbreaks should follow the same recommendations issued by health authorities for those areas, which are being published on the agency's website, the CDC told doctors.",
      "So far, only two states \u2014 Texas and Kansas \u2014 are listed by the CDC as having issued \"updated outbreak recommendations\" in response to the virus, which are broken down by age for most residents.",
      "The states say in counties facing outbreaks, adults and teenagers should get a second dose if they've only had one previously. If they are unvaccinated, they should get one dose immediately, followed by a second dose at least 28 days later.",

    "story": [
      "Faced with a deadline to provide evidence in its deportation case against activist Mahmoud Khalil, lawyers for the federal government instead filed a memorandum by Secretary of State Marco Rubio to a Louisiana immigration court.",
      "In the memo, which was obtained by CBS News, Rubio wrote that Khalil's role in protests on the campus of Columbia University is in conflict with American foreign policy objectives. Rubio did not cite specific evidence against Khalil. He stated that Khalil is deportable under a little-known statute in federal immigration law that provides the government is entitled to deport noncitizens whose presence in the U.S. damages national foreign policy interests.",
      "Rubio argued that the presence of Khalil, a 30-year-old legal permanent resident, undermines \"U.S. policy to combat anti-Semitism around the world and in the United States, in addition to efforts to protect Jewish students from harassment and violence in the United States.\"",
      "Khalil was a prominent voice in the spring 2024 pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, where he earned a master's degree from the School of International and Public Affairs in December 2024. He was detained by federal immigration authorities at his university-owned apartment as his pregnant wife looked on. He was moved from New York to a detention center in New Jersey before being flown to a remote facility in Jena, Louisiana.",
      "The government claims that Khalil has supported Hamas, and can be deported if it is determined his presence and activities threaten the foreign policy interests of the U.S., citing alleged support for Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group. To date, CBS News has not found evidence that Khalil has said he supports Hamas.",
      "Assistant chief immigration Judge Jamee Comans on Tuesday said she would terminate the case unless the government showed evidence supporting the removal of the former Columbia student. Khalil's attorney Marc Van Der Hout said at the hearing that he had \"not received a single document\" of evidence from the government.",
      "\"I'd like to see the evidence,\" Comans said, demanding that the government make a filing within 24 hours.",
      "In response, the Department of Homeland Security submitted the two-page memo from Rubio, which includes references to Khalil and one other lawful permanent resident whose name was redacted.",
      "Rubio wrote that they should be removed from the country because their \"presence or activities would compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest.\"",
      "\"The foreign policy of the United States champions core American interests and American citizens,\" he continued, \"and condoning anti-Semitic conduct and disruptive protests in the United States would severely undermine that significant foreign policy objective.\"",
      "Rubio pointed to Khalil's participation in what he descirbed as \"antisemitic protests and disruptive activities,\" which he said creates a \"hostile environment for Jewish students,\" as well as \"unlawful activity\" during those protests.",
      "\"The government can't just operate on hidden law based on one executive official's say so,\" said Baher Azmy, Legal Director of the Center of Constitutional Rights during a press call about Khalil on Thursday. \"Does anyone here know what conduct they would have to engage in that would trigger an adverse foreign policy interest to The United States? No one does. No one can. Which is what's so dangerous about this law.\"",
      "Comans has set a removability hearing for Khalil on Friday at 1 p.m., at which she could determine whether sufficient evidence has been provided to support the continuation of his immigration case.",
      "The government had previously said Khalil should be expelled for what it's described as \"material support\" for the militant group Hamas via his role in campus protests against Israel.",
      "Khalil's attorneys, who have also sued the government on his behalf, lambasted the government, saying the government was depriving him of his right to free speech.",
      "\"After a month of hiding the ball since Mahmoud's late-night unjust arrest in New York and taking him away to a remote detention center in Louisiana, immigration authorities have finally admitted that they have no case whatsoever against him,\" said Van Der Hout. \"Instead, the government is clearly going after Mahmoud and persecuting him for exercising his First Amendment rights.\"",
      "After Khalil's arrest, President Trump said it was just the first \"of many to come.\" His statement heralded a crackdown on students and alleged \"agitators\" who have protested against Israel.",
      "Foreign-born students across the country have since faced the knocks of immigration agents at the door, and deportation proceedings.",
      "\"If the secretary of state claims the power to arrest, detain and deport someone, including a lawful permanent resident, simply because that person dissents from US foreign policy, there are no limits. There's no beginning and no end to that kind of executive power,\" said Johnny Sinodis, an attorney for Khalil's immigration case.",
      "\"This is not a routine immigration case or even routine habeas case,\" he added. \"This case is intentionally projecting a message of repression about who can say what in this country and the consequences to your liberty and your life if you object to U.S. policy.\""

    "story": [
      "Even as stocks plunged in reaction to his administration's sweeping tariffs, President Trump expressed\u00a0confidence in his trade policies, saying last week that \"markets are going to boom.\" But by Wednesday, a collective thumb's down to the tariffs by bond investors had given Mr. Trump pause.",
      "With U.S. and global financial market tumbling, he abruptly suspended his administration's \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of other countries for 90 days, acknowledging that the bond market was \"getting a little queasy.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's about-face was by no means the first time a sitting American president had blinked in the face of bond investors expressing alarm over U.S. policies they viewed as fiscally reckless and harmful to their portfolios. In their first terms, both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama also found themselves knocked back when the bond market rebelled at the cost of some of their strategic priorities.",
      "The \"bond vigilantes\" ride again",
      "Americans might think of bonds as a less risky asset class they turn to in their 401(k)s to offset more volatile investments, such as stock. But the $2.8 trillion Treasury market is also a bedrock of the U.S. government. The federal government finances the country's debt by selling Treasury bills to investors, who prize the asset because of the country's sterling credit rating and its guarantee of making good on interest payments.",
      "As the Trump administration's reciprocal tariffs went into effect on Wednesday, the bond prices slid and the yield on 2-year Treasury notes rose by as much as 0.3 percentage points, marking the biggest intraday move since 2009, according to financial data firm FactSet. (Bond prices move in inverse relation to their interest rates, or yields.)",
      "Such sudden moves can signal that investors are dumping their bonds. That pushes bond prices lower but boosts yields, which are the returns that bond holders pay to investors.",
      "\"Why is this happening? Fixed-income investors may be starting to worry that the Chinese and other foreigners might start selling their U.S. Treasuries,\" economist Ed Yardeni said in an April 8 research note.",
      "Yardeni, who coined the term \"bond vigilantes\" in the 1980s to describe fixed-income investors who express their disapproval of government policies by dumping Treasuries, added that the bond market was cautioning that \"the Trump administration may be playing with liquid nitro.\"",
      "In another report after Mr. Trump announced the tariff pause, Yardeni noted, \"The Bond Vigilantes have struck again. As far as we can tell, at least with respect to U.S. financial markets, they are the only 1.000 hitters in history.\"",
      "Some Trump administration officials acknowledged that the bond market's hostile reaction to the tariffs influenced the decision to pause the tariffs.",
      "\"[The] bond market was telling us, 'Hey, it is probably time to move,'\" White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett\u00a0said\u00a0on CNBC on Thursday.",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump announced his April 2 tariffs, economists raised concerns\u00a0about the potential impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The president claimed the tariffs, which he called \"reciprocal\" because they were aimed at equalizing the trade barriers between the U.S. and its trading partners, would help revive manufacturing to the U.S. and raise revenue for the federal government.",
      "But experts warned that the tariffs, which ranged from a baseline 10% for most nations up to more than 100% for Chinese imports, raised the risks of a recession and would likely reignite inflation. Investors dumped stocks and bonds as they digested the economic risks of Mr. Trump's tariff barrage.",
      "While the stock market plunge hurt millions of Americans' retirement savings, the turmoil in the bond market creates very real pressures on the nation's finances. Because the Treasury Department pays interest to debt holders, any increase in yields puts more financial strain on the nation's coffers.",
      "\"Developments in the last 24 hours suggest we may be headed for serious financial crisis wholly induced by U.S. government tariff policy,\" Harvard University economist and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers\u00a0said\u00a0in an April 9 thread on social media.",
      "He added, \"Long-term interest rates are gapping up, even as the stock market moves sharply downwards. This highly unusual pattern suggests a generalized aversion to U.S. assets in global financial markets.  We are being treated by global financial markets like a problematic emerging market.\"",
      "An expensive problem",
      "Given the size of the Treasury market, the surging bond yields and broader market turmoil could create an expensive problem for the federal government. For Mr. Trump, the timing was especially poor as he pushes Congress to pass an extension of his 2017 tax cuts, which are forecast to cost trillions over the next decade.",
      "In 2024, the U.S. spent more than $1 trillion to service its debt, more than double its roughly $500 billion in 2020, according to Treasury data. That's largely due to higher interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve to battle the post-pandemic surge in inflation.",
      "An increase in bond yields could add to that expense, putting even more pressure on the federal budget.",
      "\"Although President Donald Trump was able to resist the stock market selloff, once the bond market began to weaken, too, it was only a matter of time before he folded on his eye-wateringly high tariffs,\" noted economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics in an April 9 research note.",

    "summary": "The vote was initially delayed amid conservatives' concerns about the level of spending cuts.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Thursday adopted a budget blueprint for President Trump's agenda after Republican leaders scrambled to convince GOP holdouts who want deeper spending cuts to back it.",
      "The resolution was adopted in a 216-214 vote, with two Republicans \u2014 Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Victoria Spartz of Indiana \u2014 joining all Democrats to vote against it.",
      "About a dozen House conservatives ultimately flipped their opposition after receiving assurances from leaders that the Senate would pursue $1.5 trillion in savings, at a minimum.",
      "\"Our two chambers are directly aligned,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said before the vote. \"We're committed to finding at least $1.5 trillion in savings for the American people while also preserving our essential programs.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, echoed that the Senate is \"aligned with the House in terms of what their budget resolution outlined in terms of savings.\"",
      "\"The speaker talked about $1.5 trillion dollars. We have a lot of United States senators who believe that is a minimum,\" Thune said.",
      "The lower chamber was set to vote Wednesday evening on the budget resolution but punted after several House conservatives resisted increasing pressure from Mr. Trump to accept the blueprint that would open the door to implementing his border security, defense, energy priorities and extending expiring tax cuts.",
      "Approving the budget plan in both chambers is the first step in the reconciliation process, which allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate and pass Mr. Trump's agenda with a simple majority. Going that route allows Republicans, who have control of the House and Senate, to pass the measure without any support from Democrats.",
      "The House and Senate worked on separate blueprints earlier this year but more recently reached a compromise resolution, which the Senate adopted early Saturday morning. Republican leaders in the House worked to unite their divided party behind the budget plan this week before Congress leaves town for a two-week recess.",
      "The Senate set much lower minimum floors for spending cuts at just about $4 billion, though committees could find far more. The compromise resolution also allows for the House to slash at least $1.5 trillion in spending.",
      "The Senate also wants to account for tax cuts enacted during Mr. Trump's first term with a tactic known as \"current policy baseline,\" which assumes that continuing expiring policies will cost nothing. Under that baseline, the nearly $4 trillion it would cost to extend the 2017 tax cuts would not be counted, further frustrating House conservatives.",
      "Johnson said House and Senate committees would be working in a \"collaborative fashion\" over the two-week recess to find savings.",
      "Before backing the resolution, House conservatives wanted assurances from the Senate that there will be deeper spending cuts, which sent leadership scrambling to find another compromise.",
      "\"We just don't trust the Senate,\" Rep. Eric Burlison, a Missouri Republican, told reporters Wednesday night after fiscal hawks huddled with Johnson for more than hour as the vote was delayed. \"We all campaign on spending cuts, but again and again, that doesn't happen. And when the Senate sent over something that said $4 billion is their floor, that was unacceptable to a lot of us.\"",
      "Burlison was among those who changed their minds and voted in favor of the resolution. Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas said he and other holdouts were moved to support the resolution by a White House commitment to making \"significant cuts,\" Johnson's \"firm commitment\" to maintain House Republicans' framework of tying tax cuts to spending cuts and Thune's \"strong statement\" promising at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts.",
      "Massie, one of the two Republicans who held firm on his \"no\" vote, called it \"a framework for financial collapse.\"",
      "\"I don't believe they're going to make any cuts of any consequence. Now they may change spending, reduce spending here, and increase spending there, but overall, the money spent next year is going to be more than the money spent this year,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump increased pressure on House Republicans in recent days to swallow the blueprint, telling holdouts on Tuesday night, \"close your eyes and get there.\" He added that individual lawmakers may not get \"every little ounce\" of what they want in the legislation.",
      "\"It's a phenomenal bill. Stop grandstanding,\" Mr. Trump said at the House GOP campaign arm's fundraising dinner.",
      "Democrats have railed against the proposed cuts, arguing the Republican plan will lead to massive cuts in entitlement programs such as Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security.",
      "\"The budget resolution that passed the House today will set in motion some of the most extreme cuts to health care, nutritional assistance and the things that matter to everyday Americans in our nation's nearly 250-year history,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said Thursday. \"It's a disgrace.\"",

And so if we have a little bit of time, a couple of years, so the individual states can address all of these complexities and make those decisions, then we will be able to get rid of this bug permanently. It is something we have been stuck with since World War I, and this is our opportunity to finally fix it.\"",
      "A 2020\u00a0commentary\u00a0for the journal JAMA Neurology found evidence linking the annual transition to daylight saving time to\u00a0increased strokes,\u00a0heart attacks\u00a0and\u00a0teen sleep deprivation.",
      "The Senate in 2022 passed a bill called the Sunshine Protection Act to make daylight saving time permanent, but the bill never went anywhere in the House. The 2022 bill had 17 cosponsors from both parties and was spearheaded by then-Sen. Marco Rubio, who is now the Secretary of State in the Trump administration.",
      "It's unclear where President Trump stands on the issue. Mr. Trump said in March that it's a \"50/50 issue,\" saying \"it's hard to get excited about it. I assume people would like to have more light later, but some people want to have more light earlier because they don't want to take their kids to school in the dark.\"",
      "But back in December, he posted on social media: \"Daylight Saving Time is inconvenient, and very costly to our Nation.\" In the same post, he said the \"Republican Party will use its best efforts to eliminate Daylight Saving Time, which has a small but strong constituency, but shouldn't!\"",
      "Mr. Trump in the past had supported making daylight saving time\u00a0permanent \u2014 that is, keeping clocks shifted one hour ahead, which happens in the spring. His\u00a0December comment\u00a0called for daylight saving time to be eliminated.",
      "In addition to Yates, testifying Thursday was Jay Karen, chief executive officer of the National Golf Course Owners Association; Karin Johnson, practicing physician and professor of neurology at UMass Chan School of Medicine Baystate, on behalf of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine; and David Harkey, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.",

      "\"Attempting to take the life of a former president and a leading presidential candidate isn't just an attack on one man, this was a political attack against our Republican form of government and our shares American values,\" Uthmeier said.",
      "Routh's lead attorney, Kristy Militello, didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "According to prosecutors, Routh plotted to kill Mr. Trump as Trump golfed at his West Palm Beach golf course in September. Secret Service officers spotted Routh before Trump came into view. Routh aimed his rifle at an agent, who opened fire, which led Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing, they said.",
      "Uthmeier, a Republican, criticized the Biden administration, accusing it of trying to \"frustrate our efforts\" and \"block\" his office's investigation. He lauded FBI director Kash Patel and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi for being willing to \"work together to pursue justice.\"",
      "Routh is jailed on federal charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, assaulting a federal officer, being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, and possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number.",
      "He is due in court on the federal charges in September. The lag between his arrest and his next court date was granted to give his attorneys time to review hundreds of hours of footage from police body cameras and surveillance cameras, and to pore over material from Routh's 17 cellphones and other electronic devices.",
      "On Tuesday, the government submitted new evidence against Routh, alleging that in March and April 2024, Routh spent over a week in West Palm Beach, \"engaging in apparent reconnaissance for his assassination attempt.\"",
      "\"Routh's acidity is undeniably necessary context for the jury to understand the significance of Routh's conduct on September 15 at Trump International because it shows his planning for what happened that day and his familiarity with locations he revisited on and leading up to September 15, including the South Bay area where he camped in the weeks beforehand, and Southern Boulevard, the main road from South Bay to Trump International,\" the government wrote in the court documents.",
      "The government also alleged that Routh sought to acquire anti-aircraft weapons to shoot down Mr. Trump's plane.",

      "There are 95 players in the field, the largest in a decade, even without five-time champion Tiger Woods, who had surgery in March to repair a torn Achilles tendon. Last year, Woods set a record by making the cut for the 24th time in a row.",
      "There is still a schism in the game, and just 12 from the breakaway LIV Golf league will be teeing up among the pink dogwoods and blooming azaleas. That includes Jon Rahm, the winner two years ago, and U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau.",
      "Here is a look at what you need to know about the Masters. CBS Sports will update its live leaderboard with player standings as the tournament goes on.",
      "When will the Masters start?",
      "The first round began at about 7:25 a.m. EDT Thursday, when honorary starters Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Tom Watson teed off on Tea Olive, the first hole at Augusta National. Jock Hutchison and Fred McLeod were the first honorary starters in 1963, but it was not until Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen took over in 1981 that it became a treasured tradition.",
      "Who is playing in the Masters?",
      "Davis Riley and Patton Kizzire were the first competitors off at 7:40 a.m., followed by groups of three. After the second round, the top 50 players and ties make the cut for the weekend and are paired according to score for the final two rounds.",
      "Scheffler, who has yet to win this season, is the 9-2 favorite, according to BetMGM Sportsbook. McIlory is second at 13-2 after his wins at Pebble Beach and The Players Championship. Collin Morikawa is 14-1 while Rahm and DeChambeau are 16-1.",
      "Scheffler, who along with his green jacket and Olympic gold medal won seven times on the PGA Tour last year, got a late start to this season after cutting himself on a wine glass in December. But the world No. 1 comes into the Masters with momentum after a final-round 63 left him one shot back of winner Min Woo Lee in his last start at the Houston Open.",
      "McIlroy has been playing some of the best golf of his career. His collapse in the U.S. Open at Pinehurst last year in a Sunday duel with DeChambeau seems to have made the 35-year-old from Northern Ireland an even bigger sentimental favorite.",
      "Xander Schauffele won two majors last year and is seeking his first green jacket, though he seems to be still rounding into form following a rib injury. Five-time major winner Brooks Koepka has twice finished second at Augusta National.",
      "Morikawa, Lee and Joaquin Niemann teed off at 9:47 a.m. Thursday, beginning a run of high-profile groups. Phil Mickelson, Jason Day and Keegan Bradley played next, followed by Scheffler, who is grouped with Justin Thomas and U.S. Amateur champ Jose Luis Ballester. Jordan Spieth, Tom Kim and Tyrrell Hatton went off at 10:26 a.m.",
      "In the afternoon, McIlroy is grouped with Ludvig Aberg and Akshay Bhatia and tees off at 1:12 p.m., just behind the group of Schauffele, Adam Scott and Viktor Hoveland. DeChambeau, Hideki Matsuyama and Shane Lowery are off at 1:23 p.m., followed by Rahm, Wyndham Clark and Tommy Fleetwood.",
      "How to watch the Masters",
      "The Masters stream on its website began Thursday at 7:15 a.m. and runs throughout the day. Cameras highlight holes and featured groups. The first two rounds are broadcast on ESPN beginning at 3 p.m. Thursday and Friday. CBS takes over Saturday and Sunday with coverage on its Paramount+ platform at noon and on the network beginning at 2 p.m.",
      "What has happened at the Masters so far?",
      "While most of Monday's practice round was washed out, Tuesday and Wednesday were warm and sunny. The forecast for Thursday is clear, but storms could arrive overnight and the rain could continue into the early part of Friday.",
      "Scheffler birdied the fourth hole of the course for the first time in his career. He has now birdied, or scored one stroke under par, on all 18 holes at the course at least once, CBS Sports reported.",
      "Before the competition got underway Thursday, players took part in the Masters Par 3 Contest, where golfers aim to complete each step of the nine-hole course in three strokes or less. The contest was held Wednesday. It dates back to 1960 and is set around DeSoto Springs Pond and Ike's Pond, the PGA said.",
      "Nicolas Echavarria and J.J. Spaun finished atop the leaderboard at 5 under in the family friendly event, but they may come to regret it \u2014 nobody has won the\u00a0Par 3 Tournament and gone on to win the Masters in the same year.",

      "As President Trump announced a pause to his sweeping reciprocal tariffs Wednesday, his trade representative, Jamieson Greer, was in the middle of testifying at a House hearing on the administration's trade policy.",
      "Greer appeared to learn of the president's decision to pause the tariffs for 90 days the same time the public did, as he was sitting before members of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade.",

      "\"So did you know that this was under discussion and why did you not include that as part of your opening remarks?\" Horsford asked.",

A universal tariff of 10% remained in place for nearly every country, except China, which faces an even higher tariff of 125%. China raised its own tariffs against the U.S.",
      "Horsford pressed Greer for details of the pause.",
      "\"I understand it's 90 days. I haven't spoken to the president since I've been in this hearing,\" Greer said.",
      "Horsford interrupted, \"So the trade representative hasn't spoken to the president of the United States about a global re-ordering of trade?\"",
      "\"Yes I have, I'm just here in a hearing with you,\" Greer interjected.",
      "\"And yet he announced it on a tweet? W.T.F.? Who's in charge?\" Horsford yelled.",
      "\"The president of the United States is in charge,\" Greer said.",
      "\"And what do you know about those details?\" Horsford asked. Before Greer could answer, he said, \"It looks like your boss just pulled the rug out from under you.\"",
      "\"There's no strategy,\" Horsford said. \"You just found out. Three seconds ago. Sitting here. We saw you. If you came here knowing that you were going to be turned off, that these tariffs were going to be turned off, why didn't you include that in your opening statement? Why didn't you reference that as part of your testimony?\"",
      "Greer repeated he doesn't disclose his conversations with the president.",
      "\"These were specific questions we asked you all along,\" Horsford said. \"What's the strategy? These are real consequences for the American people and small businesses. \u2026 This is amateur hour and it needs to stop. What does this even mean for your negotiating strategy? How are you in charge of negotiation if the president is tweeting about this from wherever the hell he is?\"",
      "\"The president was elected and he runs the trade policy and I advise him and execute his policy,\" Greer said.",
      "\"Did you know that this was happening?\" Horsford pressed.",
      "\"We had been discussing all kinds of options, Sir,\" Greer said.",
      "\"There was no strategy. There was no plan,\" Horsford said, adding that Mr. Trump \"put our economy in disarray and near collapse.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued the tariffs were a \"negotiating strategy.\"",
      "Horsford asked Greer if this was market manipulation.",
      "When Greer answered, \"No,\" Horsford, said \"Why not? If it was a plan. If it was always the plan, how is this not market manipulation?\"",
      "\"We're trying to reset the global trade system,\" Greer said.",
      "\"And what has that done? How have you achieved any of that? But to enact enormous harm on the American people?\" Horsford said. \"Tariffs are a tool. It can be used in the appropriate way to protect U.S. jobs and small businesses, but that's not what this does, so if it's not market manipulation, what is it? Who's benefitting? What billionaire just got richer?\"",
      "Horsford then slammed Republicans for their budget plan and repeated to Greer, \"Who's in charge? Because it sure doesn't look like it's the trade representative. You just got the rug pulled out from under you.\"",
      "\"I wish I could feel some empathy, but the empathy I have is for the American people whose very wellbeing and livelihoods are being effected. This is not a game. This is real life,\" Horsford said before yielding his time.",

    "summary": "A new breed of veterinary clinic is changing how pets \u2014 and their owners \u2014 are treated. \"I'd rather see four pets a day,\" one vet said.",
    "story": [
      "When Kathleen Whitman's daughter's Bernadoodle, Cody, swallowed a Kong toy, the family faced a veterinary emergency requiring immediate surgery.",
      "X-rays at their local suburban clinic suggested what looked like a hair tie tangled in Cody's intestines. When referred to a corporate emergency hospital, the family was quoted $10,000 for the procedure.",
      "\"They literally told me in the waiting room with a clipboard, thinking I was just coming in and we were doing $10,000,\" Whitman said. \"I said, 'No, I'm just coming in to hear the price.\"",
      "Desperate for an alternative, Whitman reached out to Vetique, a boutique veterinary clinic in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood. There, Dr. Jessica Trice and Dr. Jennifer Remnes performed the surgery for what Whitman called \"an appropriate fee\" that was significantly less than $10,000.",
      "During the surgery, she and her daughter waited in the clinic's lobby with glasses of Prosecco while receiving regular updates.",
      "\"The humans were taken care of just as much as the puppy in distress was,\" Whitman said.",
      "This experience mirrors what many pet owners report when comparing corporate-owned emergency animal hospitals to independent practices. Kara Adams, whose 16-year-old rescue dog Shadow needed emergency eye surgery, also chose Vetique over corporate alternatives.",
      "When Adams called Vetique explaining she had only $1,000 available, staff accommodated her financial constraints.",
      "\"The planning manager came out with a payment plan for me,\" Adams said. \"I was crying because otherwise, what would I do? I didn't have any other options.\"",
      "\"You literally burn people out\"",
      "Drs. Trice and Remnes founded Vetique after witnessing firsthand how corporate consolidation was transforming veterinary medicine \u2014 often for the worse.",
      "\"Just coming from a corporation for many years, the whole thing is about quantity, getting all those pets,\" Trice explained after spending 10 years at Banfield Pet Hospital, followed by five years as a medical director at VCA Animal Hospitals. \"We feel the best way is not pushing about the number of quantity, because it gets very sloppy and you lose that interaction and relationship with the clients.\"",
      "Remnes' experience echoed her partner's concerns. At Banfield as a new graduate, she found herself overwhelmed by volume demands.",
      "\"As a new grad, you're still learning and trying to break into this brand-new world. I was seeing like 30 pets a day,\" Remnes said.",
      "She later moved to VCA before its Mars acquisition, initially enjoying the autonomy because \"each hospital was able to operate as they liked to.\" After the corporate takeover, however, the pressure intensified.",
      "\"It was like, 'Oh, you need to see this number of pets, or we're decreasing your salary.' That's what's burning out the industry,\" Remnes said. \"You literally burn people out doing that. You can't possibly offer your best when you're crammed with all of these patients.\"",
      "These pressures contribute to a profession in crisis. A 2024 study in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association found that U.S. veterinarians are more likely to experience serious mental health struggles than most people.",
      "\"We have forums on Facebook where our industry has one of the highest suicide rates,\" Remnes noted. \"It's because of things like this, when you're given spreadsheets and quotas rather than focusing on patient care.\"",
      "Their solution was to create a different business model. Instead of maximizing patient volume, Vetique prioritizes extended appointment times and a calming environment with luxury touches like sparkling epoxy floors, examination tables with faux fur coverings and exam rooms named after the founders' pets.",
      "\"I'd rather see four pets a day. That meant that family was getting my full attention, that pet was getting everything that I do,\" Remnes explained.",
      "Alongside traditional veterinary medicine, Trice offers acupuncture, herbal remedies and chiropractic treatments \u2014 holistic approaches she had wanted to pursue at corporate practices but was discouraged from using.",
      "Surging pet care prices",
      "Setting prices at Vetique involves balancing fair market rates with the clinic's added value. What Remnes found surprising was how significantly corporate prices have increased in recent years. \"Prices are so drastically different from when I was at VCA seven years ago. They're charging actually close to what we're charging as a general practice for an exam,\" she noted.",
      "This observation led her to reconsider Vetique's own pricing strategy.",
      "\"It's like, 'Well, we can actually probably charge more, because we offer all these experiences along with it.' It's trying to find a happy medium, trying to be fair, but also knowing our value.\"",
      "Despite the appeal of the boutique model, both Remnes and Trice acknowledge significant business challenges. The clinic is in its third year of operation, still within the typical three-to-five-year window before seeing substantial returns. Unlike corporate-backed veterinary chains, Vetique is entirely funded through a bank loan.",
      "Vetique's founders see their clinic not as a competitor to corporate chains but as an alternative model for the industry. \"We're not competing,\" Trice said. \"We're creating a new veterinary culture.\"",
      "Corporate giants reshape vet landscape",
      "John Volk, senior consultant with Brakke Consulting, said veterinary practices historically grow 4-5% annually and carry minimal accounts receivable, making them attractive to investors.",
      "\"Pet care in general is very attractive to the financial community,\" Volk said. \"It's a very steady growth industry, and it's a cash business, so they carry very little accounts receivable because pet owners pay for their services at time of service.\"",
      "Mars Inc., best known for candy brands like M&M's and Snickers, has quietly become the largest owner of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. through a series of major acquisitions.",
      "The privately held company owns three of the nation's largest veterinary chains: Banfield Pet Hospital, VCA Animal Hospitals, and BluePearl Specialty and Emergency Pet Hospital \u2014 giving it control of more than 2,000 clinics across North America.",
      "Mars entered the pet care industry in 2007 by acquiring Banfield, which primarily operates inside PetSmart locations. In 2017, it significantly expanded its footprint by purchasing VCA for $9.1 billion \u2014 one of the largest acquisitions in veterinary history,\u00a0according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.",
      "VCA operates more than 900 hospitals in the U.S. and Canada, while Banfield has over 1,000 clinics nationwide. Unlike VCA, which grew by acquiring independent practices, Banfield has mostly launched new locations within retail stores.",
      "Mars's scale allows for standardized protocols, shared technology platforms and subscription-based wellness plans across its network. According to the company website, Mars Veterinary Health serves more than 25 million pets annually.",
      "While private equity firms have been acquiring veterinary practices since the late 1980s, the trend has accelerated significantly over the past 15 years. Volk estimates approximately 30% of veterinary practices are now corporate-owned.",
      "Despite the growth in corporate ownership, Volk sees no evidence that care quality differs significantly between corporate and independent practices.",
      "\"I've not seen any data to suggest that the services provided by corporately owned practices are materially different than services provided by independently owned practices,\" he said.",
      "However, some policymakers have raised concerns about the impact of consolidation on pricing. In January 2023, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, specifically called out Mars Veterinary Health and other large veterinary corporations in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission. Warren cited \"troubling reports of anti-competitive consolidation\" and suggested these corporate entities were using market power to \"raise prices for consumers and lower wages for veterinarians.\"",
      "Even as consolidation continues, Volk finds that independent practices remain viable. \"If you have a DVM degree and don't have a bad personal history, you can get money to buy or start a practice,\" he said. \"Veterinarians are one of the lowest-risk borrowers of any category.\"",
      "For new veterinarians, the industry offers growing opportunities. The American Veterinary Medical Association reports the average starting salary in companion animal medicine reached approximately $137,000 in 2024.",
      "Design, investment, and a human touch",
      "When clients walk into a Bond Vet clinic, they won't find the sterile environment or cluttered waiting rooms traditionally associated with veterinary offices. Instead, they'll encounter soft pastel colors, comfortable seating and an atmosphere deliberately designed to feel more like a high-end hospitality experience than a medical facility.",
      "\"The industry has two categories of clinics historically \u2014 many designed very clinical, cold and sterile, and then others called mom and pop, which could be cluttered or dirty,\" said Garrett Lewis, CEO of Bond Vet. \"The question is how to solve both problems.\"",
      "That solution \u2013 creating premium veterinary experiences with transparent pricing and greater accessibility \u2013 has attracted significant private equity investment.",
      "While these premium services might suggest significantly higher costs, Lewis emphasizes transparency in Bond Vet's pricing model. \"When someone comes in, you can look at the laptop and see exactly what the pricing is,\" he said. \"Our prices are just a little bit above average, but the experience is what differentiates us.\"",
      "This transparency extends to digital platforms, where clients can check prices online or via text before visiting. During appointments, veterinarians show pricing information directly to clients on laptops, allowing for discussion about options.",
      "Bond Vet, backed by a $170 million investment from Warburg Pincus, has expanded to 57 locations across the Northeast and Midwest since its founding in 2019. The company was inspired by human-focused healthcare models like One Medical, focusing on convenience, design, and a better experience for both pets and owners.",
      "\"They saw the same issue, which was that the industry wasn't serving clients and pets at a much higher level,\" Lewis said of Bond Vet's founders, who included a veterinarian and her husband. \"They quickly found it was very different to change culture and design in existing practices, so they rebooted from the ground up.\"",
      "Bond Vet's approach represents a broader trend in veterinary medicine, where traditional practices are being reinvented with a focus on client experience alongside medical care.",
      "Bond Vet's model bridges the gap between traditional veterinary practices and emergency hospitals, offering urgent care alongside preventative services \u2013 all with a hospitality-focused approach.",
      "\"In the 90s, if you needed sick care, your veterinarian would say, 'Come on in.' If you needed preventive care, they'd say, 'Come on in,'\" Lewis explained. \"What happened in the 2000s is a lot of specialization occurred where practices became just preventative and started referring out anything that looked urgent or sick.\"",
      "Bond Vet handles non-emergency urgent cases that might otherwise end up in expensive emergency rooms. \"ER practices see about 40% of their volume as urgent rather than emergent cases. Clients go to ER and spend twice as much, often having to wait longer,\" Lewis noted.",
      "These clinics feature design elements specifically created to reduce stress for pets \u2014 an approach that appears to be working. \"I always see dogs dragging their owners into the clinic, which is not a common thing,\" Lewis said.",
      "The \"no walls\" philosophy breaking ground",
      "Imagine walking into a veterinary emergency room and instead of being separated from your pet during a crisis, you're welcomed directly onto the treatment floor. At  VEG ER for Pets, this isn't just possible \u2014 it's mandatory.",
      "\"We built an entire business around it,\" said Dr. David Bessler, founder and CEO of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's much easier doing something 100% of the time than trying to do it 90% of the time.\"",
      "With 102 locations across 28 states, VEG ER for Pets represents an approach to emergency veterinary medicine that stands apart from both traditional practices and newer primary care models.",
      "Unlike other veterinary innovators that blend primary and urgent care, VEG ER for Pets focuses exclusively on emergency medicine \u2013 a deliberate strategy that Bessler calls \"a bit of a crazy bet.\"",
      "\"We took the hardest part of an industry, emergency, and created an entire business around that,\" said David Gladstein, co-founder and president of VEG ER for Pets. \"It's hard to make money, it's hard to get the team, it's hard to recruit, it's hard to train.\"",
      "VEG ER for Pets' most distinctive feature is its commitment to keeping pets with their owners throughout the entire treatment process, even during emergencies \u2014 an approach not found in traditional emergency hospitals, where pets are typically treated in back rooms away from owners.",
      "This transparency extends to the physical design of newer hospitals, which have eliminated traditional waiting rooms entirely. \"Our newer hospitals don't even have a lobby,\" Gladstein explained. \"You literally walk in and you're in the middle of the treatment floor.\"",
      "In a notable departure from many veterinary innovators, VEG ER for Pets has achieved financial independence from its initial investors and now funds its expansion through its own operations.",
      "\"VEG ER for Pets is now independently able to do that,\" Gladstein stated. \"We don't need anyone else to advocate for us or to pay for us. We're not beholden to anybody. We're beholden to our customers, and we're beholden to our veggies.\"",
      "This independence allows the company to maintain its distinctive approach while continuing to open 25-30 new locations annually.",
      "The company's exclusive focus on emergency care, while limiting in some ways, has allowed it to \"crack the code\" on veterinary emergencies according to Gladstein. \"We've kind of cracked the code on one way of doing things in emergency that results in a better experience for all of the souls that are there experiencing that at the same time.\"",

      "The Kansas Bureau of Investigation said in a news release that the decomposing remains of an unidentified young man were found three miles southeast of Garnett, Kansas on April 18, 1973. The man was believed to have brown hair and a slender build, and was wearing a brown corduroy jacket, green long-sleeved buttoned shirt, jeans, black leather belt with a large buckle, brown hiking boots and a navy blue stocking cap. He also wore two gold rings with crosses, a ring with the number \"78,\" and a silver chain with a large cross, the bureau said.",

      "\"Many attempts\" were made to identify the man over the years, the bureau said, including listing the man's description in the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, but to no avail. In 2024, DNA extracted from the remains was sent to the forensic company Othram for forensic genetic genealogy testing, the bureau said. Othram created a DNA profile and searched for relatives of the unknown man.",
      "In early 2025, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation learned that Othram had identified a match. Agents from the bureau and officials from the Anderson County Sheriff's Office were able to locate people who DNA showed were the siblings of the unidentified man.",
      "Interviews and a DNA sample from one sibling allowed officials to identify the remains as belonging to Jimmy Allen Dollison, the bureau said.",
      "Dollison had been living in Kansas City, Kansas when he went missing, sometime in October or November 1972, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation said. He was 16 at the time of his disappearance. He was reported missing by his parents, family members told the bureau, but relatives never received any answers.",
      "The bureau did not say how long the remains had been decomposing when they were found in April 1973, six months after Dollison's disappearance. Dollison's entry in the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System notes that he \"had likely been deceased 2-4 weeks\" before his remains were found.",
      "Kansas City is about 80 miles from Garnett, where the remains were found.",

      "The Air Force's F-35 Joint Program Office conceived of the idea for \"Frankenjet\" in late 2022. Working with the 388th Fighter Wing Maintenance Group and the defense manufacturer Lockheed Martin, they sought to remove the nose from one inoperative jet and transfer it onto another, an undertaking that the Air Force called a \"first-of-its-kind and seemingly impossible task.\"",
      "Past accidents had rendered both planes involved in the project out of service. One had experienced an engine fire in 2014, and the other's landing gear malfunctioned in 2020, according to the Air Force. To minimize waste \u2014 and the cost of military aircraft repairs for taxpayers \u2014 engineers put their experiment to the test.",
      "\"The scope and complexity of this project was an exemplary demonstration of overcoming barriers,\" said Tomas Barber, an F-35 repair team engineer, in a statement. Barber also said its completion marked a new level of repair capabilities for advanced stealth fighters.",

      "The warplane took its first flight in January from Hill Air Force Base in Utah to the Lockheed Martin facility in Fort Worth, Texas, the Air Force said. By the end of March, it was prepared to resume full service as part of the 4th Fighter Generation Squadron's 388th Fighter Wing.

      "When F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote \"The Great Gatsby\" at the height of the roaring '20s, he couldn't possibly realize that the book would emerge as one of the very top contenders for \"the great American novel.\"",
      "In fact, when Fitzgerald \u2013 a St. Paul, Minnesota native whose debut novel \"This Side of Paradise\" launched him into national prominence at the age of 24 \u2013 died in 1940 at the early age of 44, the book was already in danger of falling into obscurity.",
      "Now, 100 years after the book's first publication on April 10, 1925, it endures as one of the country's foremost tales of American hubris, modern yearning and class consciousness. And its clear-eyed assessment of the attainability of the American dream remains incisive with each passing decade.",
      "Fitzgerald's book, long a staple in high school literature classes, tells the story of Nick Carraway, a Midwesterner (and veiled Fitzgerald stand-in) who becomes enamored with the bon vivant, Jazz Age lifestyle on Long Island, specifically the effects of mutli-millioniare Jay Gatsby.",
      "Like Carraway, Gatsby is a Midwesterner who has trekked to the East Coast to make a name for himself. It's Carraway's cousin Daisy Buchanan who serves as the catalyst for Gatsby's downfall, and ultimately Carraway's own disillusionment. All the while, a symbolic green light beckons from the distance.",
      "When the book was first published, reviews were largely positive, though not unanimous. Fitzgerald, who originally wanted to title the book \"Trimalchio in West Egg\" before being persuaded to go with a title he thought far more generic, watched as the book languished on the vine commercially, selling fewer than 25,000 copies in the initial push.",
      "He would only complete one further novel in his lifetime: 1934's \"Tender is the Night,\" a thinly-veiled roman \u00e0 clef of Fitzgerald's own marriage to socialite Zelda Sayre, detailing their mutual descent into alcoholism and mental illness. Fitzgerald's early death from a heart attack was likely fuelled by years and years of alcohol abuse. Ironically, he'd gone sober just ahead of the cardiac event.",
      "If \"The Great Gatsby\" never achieved the level of esteem it now enjoys during the author's own life, it wasn't long after his death that Fitgerald's literary reputation took off.",
      "When the Modern Library asked authors, historians, critics and publishers on the eve of Y2K to rank their picks for the world's best novels of the 20th century, it was \"The Great Gatsby\" that\u00a0stood above all other U.S. contenders near the top of the poll. (The novel landed in second place, bookended by Irish author James Joyce's \"Ulysses\" and \"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\" in the top three.)",
      "The novel has since launched multiple film adaptations, has been transposed to the stage, and since going into the public domain in 2021, has been the subject of an endless array of reimaginings, remixes and mashups. It's even cleared space around itself as a modern-day meme, in the form of an animated .GIF depicting Leonardo Dicaprio (playing Gatsby in Baz Luhrmann's 2013 film adaptation) smirking as he offers a champagne toast flanked by ostentatious fireworks.",

      "There is also a rowdy \"Roaring Twenties\" party scheduled at the Empire Steak House in New York, which was an opulent opera house in Fitzgerald's era. Billed as the \"nation's most extravagant celebration,\" the event will feature live jazz, period dancing, and speeches from officials with the New York Public Library.",
      "In Fitzgerald's hometown of St. Paul, the events include a new exhibit of the author's life and times at the Minnesota History Center, as well as various, less-than-sober events leaning into the novel's party-friendly Prohibition-era setting.",

      "\"This verdict is about justice,\" Beckworth said in a statement. \"But more importantly, It's about taking power back from the abusers \u2014 and their and enablers \u2014 and returning it to those he tried to control and silence.\"",
      "Beckworth said the abuse took place between 1979 and 2014.",
      "Toback was nominated for an Oscar for writing 1991's \"Bugsy,\" and his career in Hollywood has spanned more than 40 years.",
      "Accusations that he engaged in years of sexual abuse surfaced in late 2017 as the #MeToo movement gained attention. They were first reported by the Los Angeles Times. In that report, 38 women accused Toback of sexual harassment, with many alleging he approached them on the streets of New York City and promised them stardom. Thirty-one of the women spoke on the record.",
      "In 2018, Los Angeles prosecutors said the statutes of limitations had expired in five cases they reviewed, and declined to bring criminal charges against Toback.",
      "The plaintiffs then filed a lawsuit in New York a few days after the state's Adult Survivors Act went into effect. The lawyers said they discovered a pattern of Toback attempting to lure young women on the streets of New York into meeting him by falsely promising roles in his films and then subjecting them to sexual acts, threats and psychological coercion.",
      "Mary Monahan, a lead plaintiff in the case, called the jury award \"validation\" for her and the other women.",
      "\"For decades, I carried this trauma in silence, and today, a jury believed me. Believed us. That changes everything,\" she said in a statement. \"This verdict is more than a number \u2014 it's a declaration. We are not disposable. We are not liars. We are not collateral damage in someone else's power trip. The world knows now what we've always known: what he did was real.\"",
      "Toback, 80, who most recently had represented himself, denied numerous times in court documents that he \"committed any sexual offense\" and that \"any sexual encounter or contact between Plaintiffs and Defendant was consensual.\"",
      "He also argued that New York's law extending the statute of limitations on sexual abuse cases violated his constitutional rights.",
      "A message sent to an email address listed for him seeking comment was not immediately answered.",
      "In January, the judge in the case entered a default judgment against Toback, who had failed to appear in court when ordered to do so. The judge then scheduled a trial for only damages last month to determine how much Toback had to pay the women.",

      "An ancient jawbone discovered in Taiwan belonged to an enigmatic group of early human ancestors called Denisovans, scientists reported Thursday.",
      "Relatively little is known about Denisovans, an extinct group of human cousins that interacted with Neanderthals and our own species, Homo sapiens.",
      "\"Denisovan fossils are very scarce,\" with only a few confirmed finds in East Asia, said study co-author Takumi Tsutaya at the Graduate University for Advanced Studies in Japan.",
      "So far, the only known Denisovan fossils include partial jawbones, a few teeth and part of a finger bone found in caves in Siberia and Tibet. Some scientists believe fossils found in a cave in Laos may also belong to Denisovans.",
      "The probable identification of the jawbone from Taiwan as Denisovan expands the region where scientists know these ancient people once lived, said Tsutaya.",
      "\"Denisovans must therefore have been capable of adapting to a wide range of habitat types,\" study co-author Frido Welker told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The partial jawbone was first recovered when a fishing operation dredged the seafloor in the Penghu Channel near the Taiwan Strait. After it was sold to an antique shop, a collector spotted it and purchased it in 2008, then later donated it to Taiwan's National Museum of Natural Science.",
      "Based on the composition of marine invertebrates found attached to it, the fossil was dated to the Pleistocene era. But exactly which species of early human ancestor it belonged to remained a mystery.",
      "The condition of the fossil made it impossible to study ancient DNA. But recently, scientists in Taiwan, Japan and Denmark were able to extract some protein sequences from the incomplete jawbone.",
      "An analysis showed some protein sequences resembled those contained in the genome of a Denisovan fossil recovered in Siberia. The findings were published in the journal Science.",
      "While the new research is promising, Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Project, said he would like to see further data before confirming the Taiwan fossil as Denisovan.",
      "Potts, who was not involved in the new research, praised the study for \"a fantastic job of recovering some proteins.\" But he added, such a small sliver of material may not give a full picture.",

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed her release in a social media post early Thursday, but offered no information about the terms of her release.",
      "The Wall Street Journal first reported\u00a0Karelina's release, saying she was freed in a swap arranged by the two countries' intelligence agencies, and a CIA official later told CBS News that the agency had played a central role in the deal on behalf of the U.S. government.",

      "Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic \u2014 Rescue crews in the Dominican Republic dug through the remains of a legendary nightclub Thursday whose roof collapsed earlier this week, killing at least 221 people, but hopes of finding survivors were slim.",
      "Meanwhile, dozens of people in the capital of Santo Domingo were still searching for their loved ones and growing frustrated that they weren't getting any answers after visiting hospitals and the country's forensic institute.",
      "Doctors warned that some of the two dozen patients who remained hospitalized were still not in the clear, especially the eight who were in critical condition.",
      "\"If the trauma is too great, there's not a lot of time\" left to save patients in that condition, said Health Minister Dr. V\u00edctor Atallah.",
      "He and other doctors said injuries include fractures of the skull, femur and pelvis caused by cement slabs falling on people attending a merengue concert at the Jet Set nightclub in Santo Domingo. More than 200 were injured.",
      "The government said Wednesday night that it was moving to a recovery phase focused on finding bodies, but Juan Manuel M\u00e9ndez, director of the Center of Emergency Operations, said crews at the scene were still looking for victims and potential survivors, though no one has been found alive since Tuesday afternoon.",
      "\"We're not going to abandon anyone. Our work will continue,\" he said.",
      "Names of victims emerging",
      "The legendary club was packed with musicians, professional athletes and government officials when dust began falling from the ceiling and into people's drinks early Tuesday. Minutes later, the roof collapsed.",
      "Victims include merengue icon Rubby P\u00e9rez, who'd been singing to the crowd before the roof fell; former MLB players Octavio Dotel and Tony Enrique Blanco Cabrera; and Nelsy Cruz, the governor of the northwestern province of Montecristi whose brother is seven-time Major League Baseball All-Star Nelson Cruz.",
      "Also killed were a retired United Nations official; saxophonist Luis Sol\u00eds, who was playing onstage when the roof fell; New York-based fashion designer Mart\u00edn Polanco; the son and daughter-in-law of the minister of public works; the brother of the vice minister of the Ministry of Youth; and three employees of Grupo Popular, a financial services company, including the president of AFP Popular Bank and his wife.",
      "Randolfo Rijo G\u00f3mez, director of the country's 911 system, said it received more than 100 calls, including several from people buried under the rubble. He noted that police arrived at the scene in 90 seconds, followed minutes later by first response units. In less than half an hour, 25 soldiers, seven fire brigades and 77 ambulances were activated, he said.",
      "Crews used dogs and thermal cameras to search for victims and rescued 145 survivors from the rubble, authorities said.",
      "Attention to turn soon to probing collapse's cause",
      "It wasn't immediately clear what caused the roof to collapse, or when the Jet Set building was last inspected.",
      "The government said late Wednesday that once the recovery phase ends, it will launch a thorough investigation.",
      "The club issued a statement saying it was cooperating with authorities. A spokesperson for the family that owns the club told The Associated Press that she passed along questions about potential inspections.",
      "Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Public Works referred questions to the mayor's office. A spokesperson for the mayor's office didn't respond to a request for comment.",

      "U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink intends to resign from her post early, three sources told CBS News.",
      "The State Department confirmed her intent to step down\u00a0Thursday afternoon.",
      "\"Ambassador Brink is stepping down. She's been the ambassador there for three years \u2013 that's a long time in a war zone. And frankly, the war has gone on for far too long,\" a State Department spokesperson said in a statement. \"The real issue is whether the Russians and Ukrainians are ready to do what's necessary to end this war.\"",
      "Brink has not formally submitted resignation papers but she has been making farewell calls to colleagues, sources said.",
      "Ambassador Brink has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "One senior U.S. official told CBS that her resignation stems from an unusual mix of personal and policy concerns, including the recent USAID layoffs. Brink is serving in a war zone far from her family, since Kyiv is designated as an unaccompanied post, where officers serve without bringing their families with them.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio intended to keep Brink, a career foreign service officer, in the job and declined the initial resignation she had submitted in January as part of the standard turnover between administrations.",
      "Brink's resignation comes at a pivotal moment for U.S.-Ukraine relations. The Trump administration has tried to broker an end to the Russian invasion in part by ending the policy of diplomatically isolating Vladimir Putin, who invaded Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "While Ukraine accepted a U.S. ceasefire proposal, Russia has not. It is not clear whether President Trump has set any deadline for conclusion of the diplomacy, but he's continuing to have special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff at the fore of outreach to Russia.",
      "At NATO meeting last week, Rubio indicated U.S. patience with Russia was wearing thin.",
      "\"We will know soon enough, in a matter of weeks, not months, whether Russia is serious about peace or not. I hope they are,\" Rubio said on April 4.",
      "Mr. Trump's longtime fascination with Putin and frustration with Ukraine's Zelenskyy has complicated the diplomacy, and prompted concern from Western allies.",
      "His distrust of Zelenskyy was visible in an explosive Oval Office confrontation in February. Mr. Trump told Zelenskyy to reach a ceasefire agreement with Russia or \"we're out,\" and Vice President JD Vance accused the Ukrainian president of being \"disrespectful\" after he challenged the vice president's assertion that the war had dragged on because of a lack of diplomacy from Ukraine and the Biden administration. Vice President JD Vance also admonished Zelensky: \"Have you said 'thank you' once, this entire meeting?\"",
      "The Trump administration subsequently paused military and intelligence aid to Ukraine amid the fallout. That intelligence support resumed once Ukraine agreed to go along with the Trump administration's outreach to Putin. Mr. Trump continues to sit on the nearly $4 billion in remaining U.S. military aid already designated for Ukraine. The U.S. has been a key supplier of weapons since the Russian invasion began.",

      "\"The Teotihuacan were traders who traveled all over the country (Guatemala),\" Paiz said. \"The Teotihuacan residential complexes were houses with rooms and in the center altars; that's what the residence that was found is like, with an altar with the figure representing the Storm Goddess.\"",

      "On April 2, Mr. Trump announced what he called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on virtually every nation the U.S. does trade with. Despite stock markets around the globe descending into tumult and economists warning for months that it will be consumers who pay the price for the levies, Mr. Trump has not backed down, insisting the measures will help the U.S. balance its trade deficit with other nations in the longer term.",

      "Bartholomew Broadbent, who owns the Virginia-based wine wholesaler and importer Broadbent Selections, warned the impact on retail prices in the U.S. is going to be \"a lot worse than people think.\"",
      "French wines, as an example, will be subject to 20% tariffs under the measures announced by Mr. Trump. But Broadbent told CBS News the real-world price increase will be closer to 30%, because the cost of the tariff will be compounded at every stage of a bottle or crate's journey to a store shelf \u2014 with producers in France and other nations, along with importers like himself and then distributors and retailers all adding their own mark-ups.",
      "\"The price is going to have to go up,\" he said.",
      "In real terms, Broadbent estimated that the retail price on a bottle of wine that currently sells for $9.99 could go up to $13 or $14.",
      "Broadbent, whose company imports wines from 11 different countries and it also works with wineries in California, said more than 80% of his business will now face new tariffs. Wines from South Africa will be the most heavily impacted, he said, as the White House has hit the country with a steep 30% tariff.",
      "\"I don't see a single person who can benefit from this,\" Broadbent said. \"Even the wineries in America will suffer badly because they're all buying barrels and corks from Europe.\"",
      "The tariffs sent shockwaves through the global wine industry, with France's Bourgogne Wine Board (BIVB) warning the levies risked \"pushing our wines past a psychological price threshold.\"",
      "Bourgogne \u2014 or the Burgundy region as it's known in English \u2014 exported nearly 21 million bottles of wine to the U.S. in 2024, according to the BIVB, which agreed with the assessment that Mr. Trump's tariffs will have a negative impact on everyone, from French exporters and their distributor partners to American consumers.",
      "\"The industry deeply regrets this decision,\" the BIVB said in a press release",
      "The people who make, sell and enjoy Scotland's world renowned distilled spirits are also staring down the barrel of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Last year alone, about 132 million bottles of Scotch whisky were imported into the U.S. market, according to the Scotch Whisky Association.",
      "The mood in Scotland is one of \"frustration and uncertainty,\" according to Drew McKenzie Smith, who founded and runs the Lindores Abbey Distillery just north of Edinburgh.",
      "McKenzie Smith estimated that the 10% baseline tariff Mr. Trump imposed on the U.K. would see the price of a bottle of his Scotch hiked by about the same amount for American consumers. So a bottle that currently costs $60 will soon jump to $66, be believes.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News correspondent William La Jeunesse joins 'Fox News Sunday' to discuss the evolution of AI and the push lawmakers are making to regulate it.",
      "The use of artifical intelligence to reimagine the classic film \"The Wizard of Oz\" will likely see mixed reactions from fans, experts told Fox News Digital.",
      "While \"film purists\" may resist the idea of using generative AI to give classic films an entire makeover, the technology could \"breathe new life\" into hit movies \u2014 including \"The Wizard of Oz.\"",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery, Google Cloud and Magnopus have set out to do just that by creating an immersive experience for fans of the 1939 classic. The new \"Wizard of Oz\" experience is set to premiere at the Las Vegas Sphere on Aug. 28.",
      "\"The fan reaction will likely split into two distinct camps,\" Michael Walker, CEO of AI-First at Trilogy, told Fox News Digital. \"Film purists will object \u2014 and they have valid concerns about artistic integrity. The original work represents specific creative choices by directors, cinematographers and set designers who worked within the constraints of their era. Expanding and reimagining with AI creates something fundamentally different from their vision.\"",

      "\"On the other hand, this represents an exciting new way to connect classic films with audiences who increasingly expect immersive experiences,\" he explained. \"The technology could breathe new life into works that might otherwise fade from cultural relevance.\"",
      "\"The Wizard of Oz\" was originally shot in four-by-three images on a 35mm film, but had to be transformed to fit the Las Vegas Sphere's 160,000-square-foot screen.",
      "The LED screen at Las Vegas Sphere wraps over and behind the audience \u2014 creating a problem when trying to transform the original film of the classic feature.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "\"Using versions of Veo, Imagen and Gemini specially tuned for the task, the Google teams and their partners developed an AI-based \u2018super resolution\u2019 tool to turn those tiny celluloid frames from 1939 into ultra-ultra-high definition imagery that will pop inside Sphere,\" according to a Google blog explaining the technology. \"Then, the teams perform AI outpainting, to expand the scope of scenes to both fill the space and fill in the gaps created by camera cuts and framing limitations. Finally, through performance generation, they\u2019re incorporating composites of those famed performances into the expanded environments. Together, these techniques help achieve the natural gestures, staging and fine details that conventional CGI struggles to match.\"",
      "Jim Dolan, executive chairman and CEO of Sphere Entertainment, said: \"When you have innovation like this, you don't always know where it's going to go. You have to be able to take a leap of faith. What you're going to see in \u2018The Wizard of Oz at Sphere\u2019 is clearly a leap of faith.\"",

      "\"The Wizard of Oz at Sphere\" is set to premiere on Aug. 28. (Moviestore/Shutterstock)",
      "Fans' reactions to this leap of faith will \"span the spectrum,\" Boon Chew, founder of CentaurLab.AI, told Fox News Digital: \"Some will be excited, others resistant. Predicting the majority reaction is tough, and in any case, popular opinion doesn\u2019t determine whether something is right or meaningful. Innovation isn't a democracy \u2014 it\u2019s a process of exploration.\"",
      "\"What truly matters is the outcome,\" Chew explained. \"If a reimagined classic resonates, its value will speak for itself. Dismissing it without seeing the result is less about merit and more about discomfort with change. A classic doesn\u2019t stop being a classic because it\u2019s expressed in a new way. In fact, the heart of a classic is its ability to endure, evolve, and inspire across generations. Some may say reimagining beloved films with AI is gimmicky or disrespectful. My take? Don\u2019t engage with the remake if it\u2019s not your thing \u2014 but let others explore and create. The only real line we shouldn\u2019t cross is legal or ethical: copyright, attribution and transparency.\"",
      "He continued: \"From an evolutionary standpoint, nothing should be frozen in time. Reimagining classics with generative AI opens up new doors \u2014 for education, storytelling and accessibility.\"",

      "\"Is this presented as a new interpretation rather than a replacement? Does it respect the spirit of the original while creating something new?

      "Prior to Bon Jovi's organization, Rodrick told Fox News Digital his concerns began after he took office about a year ago, when he was able to close down two homeless encampments and get individuals into housing. But then the Ocean County Board decided to open a warming center, and according to Rodrick, nonprofits began \"bussing people into town.\"",
      "Rodrick said he raised his concerns to the board, but \"they did it anyway and engaged a nonprofit that has various warming centers across the state and, inevitably, they start bussing people into town. Because if their beds are full in one town, they're incentivized to hang on to these people, and they start putting them in your warming center.\"",
      "\"We wound up with dozens and dozens of people being dropped off downtown every single day at the library no less, where a mom should feel comfortable walking into the library with her daughter and get a book. You shouldn't have to walk through gangs of two dozen intoxicated or mentally ill homeless individuals, and that's the real issue here,\" adding there have been numerous police and EMS calls since March from the library.",
      "He also claims that there is \"a lot of money that chases around this issue.\"",

      "\"The influenza vaccine can be highly effective in reducing the severity of illness, preventing hospitalizations, and minimizing the spread of the virus, but its effectiveness can vary depending on the virus strain and individual factors, such as age and underlying health conditions,\" the Cleveland Clinic said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital.",
      "While previous work by these researchers on vaccine effectiveness has been published in major journals, this most recent study is still in the pre-print stage, which means it has not yet been peer-reviewed.",

      "Siegel added that it rarely affects humans \"because only some of the rodents have it, and they don't all come into contact \u2014 but one-third to one-half of cases are fatal.\"",
      "Symptoms and treatment",
      "Early symptoms of hantavirus include fever, muscle aches, fatigue and\u00a0gastrointestinal issues that appear anywhere from one to eight weeks after exposure, according to Parry.",
      "\"These progress to serious respiratory symptoms like coughing, shortness of breath and fluid in the lungs four to 10 days later,\" he said.",
      "Hantavirus is an RNA virus that can be transmitted to humans through rodent droppings, causing severe illness. (iStock)",

      "Early symptoms of hantavirus include fever, muscle aches, fatigue and\u00a0gastrointestinal issues that appear anywhere from one to eight weeks after exposure. (iStock)",
      "\"If a patient is experiencing full distress, it is less likely the treatment will be effective.\"",
      "Supportive care can include monitoring\u00a0heart function, administering fluids and oxygen, and placing the patient on a ventilator as needed. Patients may also receive broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, fever reducers and\u00a0pain relievers.",
      "\"Early intensive medical care is critical, because patients who have sudden acute disease can rapidly become severely sick and die.\"",

      "Over time, people who clear their throat often may find themselves doing it even more because of muscle memory. (iStock)",

      "\"I've actually seen throat-clearing irritation get worse when people start allergy pills or antihistamines without actually having an allergy,\" she cautioned.",

Colorado is number one in the nation again, three of the last five years running, for our auto theft rate. We're number two in the nation for teenagers overdosing and dying on fentanyl.

      "While the Trump administration's decision to pull federal funding from Maine\u2019s Department of Corrections due to a transgender inmate being housed in a women\u2019s facility is not an isolated case, similar situations involving transgender inmates in female facilities have occurred across the country.",

As federal changes to those regulations are expected, current PREA guidelines discourage housing inmates in isolation. That, the spokesperson said, has led some states to feel obligated to house transgender women in female facilities, even if they might prefer to create separate spaces.",

Initially misdiagnosed with anxiety and gallbladder issues, she even underwent unnecessary surgery before doctors finally identified the real culprit: epilepsy. But this wasn\u2019t just any epilepsy; Clara had multifocal epilepsy, a rare and severe form that resists all medication.",

The device, known as the\u00a0NeuroOne OneRF Ablation System, is the first of its kind FDA-cleared technology designed for both diagnosing and treating neurological disorders in one procedure.",
      "\"It took them maybe 30 minutes, and the longest part was setting up,\" Clara said about the procedure that transformed her life.",
      "Dr. Brin Freund, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, explained Clara\u2019s case in more detail:",
      "\"Clara has had a history of seizures that, unfortunately, were uncontrolled with medications. In these cases, surgery may be the only option to reduce and potentially cure the seizure disorder. After a thorough diagnostic evaluation, our group at Mayo Clinic Florida recommended implantation of electrodes (stereoelectroencephalography, or stereo EEG) in the brain to determine where her seizures were originating, in order to develop a surgical plan to treat them.",
      "\"Clara and her family were very much in agreement with this plan, given how debilitating her seizures had been and the failure to control her seizures with medications. Clara underwent implantation of NeuroOne electrodes in order to record seizure activity to determine where her seizures were arising from and then to potentially treat them by performing radiofrequency ablation in these areas.\"",

      "HOW ELON MUSK\u2019S NEURALINK BRAIN CHIP WORKS",
      "How NeuroOne\u2019s dual-function system works",
      "The NeuroOne system uses ultra-thin electrodes to pinpoint the exact source of seizures in the brain. Once identified, it employs radiofrequency energy to disrupt abnormal electrical signals in problematic brain tissue without permanently damaging surrounding areas. This dual functionality, diagnostic and therapeutic, is what sets it apart from traditional methods that require two separate surgeries.",
      "NeuroOne CEO Dave Rosa explained:",
      "\"What separates our technology from others is that our device can be used for both the diagnostic part \u2013 finding the area of the brain \u2013 and then ablating or destroying that tissue, all in the same hospitalization.\"",
      "He added that this approach minimizes patient risk by reducing the number of procedures and hospitalizations required.",
      "Freund emphasized this advantage:",
      "\"Stereo EEG electrodes provide the ability to localize seizure onset with excellent precision as long as the electrode implantation is planned thoroughly and accurately. With regards to the NeuroOne electrodes, they allow for radiofrequency ablation to be performed while the electrodes are still implanted without having to remove them. We can therefore not only localize the seizure onset but provide a surgical treatment and potentially avoid a second and potentially more extensive or invasive procedure such as a craniotomy and resection of brain tissue.",
      "\"The NeuroOne electrodes allow us to control the conditions of the ablative procedure. They also provide us more confidence that the electrodes will withstand the duration of the implantation, which would include recording seizure data, performing the ablation and then recording more data after the ablation to ensure that the treatment achieved the intended goal.\"",
      "Brain implant patient Clara Fuller (NeuroOne)",
      "THIS MIND-READING TECH USING AI CAN CONVERT BRAIN ACTIVITY INTO TEXT",
      "The results",
      "The results have been nothing short of life-changing for Clara. Since undergoing the procedure, she has been completely seizure-free. She\u2019s now back to enjoying school, sports and uninterrupted sleep \u2013 things most people take for granted but were once unimaginable for her.",
      "According to Freund:",
      "\"Regarding the implantation itself, she did very well and there were no adverse effects. The first ablation did not cause any acute complications. We then performed a second ablation a few days later after data was recorded from the electrodes demonstrating ongoing seizure activity to ensure that her seizures would not recur. This was also well-tolerated without complications. We have now followed up months after the electrodes were removed and there have been no signs of ill effects due to the implantation or the ablations. She has been seizure-free since the ablation and has done amazingly well.\"",
      "Clara\u2019s story offers hope for others living with drug-resistant epilepsy, which affects about one-third of the 3 million Americans with epilepsy. According to Rosa, \"The desire to expand ablation therapy to patients suffering from seizures that do not respond to drug therapy was our driving force.\"",
      "NeuroOne One RF Ablation System (NeuroOne)",
      "A broader impact on medicine",
      "NeuroOne\u2019s innovative technology isn\u2019t just limited to epilepsy treatment. The company plans to expand its applications to other areas, such as pain management for facial pain and lower back pain, using the same RF ablation technology. Rosa also sees potential for treating neurological conditions beyond epilepsy:\u00a0\"Pain management appears to be the largest opportunity outside of brain ablation.\"",
      "Dr. Freund believes this technology could dramatically improve long-term care for pediatric epilepsy patients like Clara:",
      "\"This technology could allow for limiting the number of procedures that are required to treat drug-resistant focal epilepsy and also provide immediate feedback as to whether or not a surgical treatment was effective. This could potentially reduce the risk of adverse events by limiting the number of times that a brain surgery would be needed. This technology also allows us to access deeper parts of the brain to provide surgical treatment.\"",
      "He added that the impact may soon be widespread:",
      "\"In our practice, we are now using these electrodes in every case that requires Stereo EEG for treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. I think as these types of electrodes are used at more centers and they get more experience, there would be no reason not to use them.\"",

      "Illustration of a crook stealing credit card info (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How it happens",
      "Even if a new credit card hasn\u2019t arrived yet, it may already be vulnerable. In many cases, the issue isn\u2019t about the card being physically stolen but about someone gaining access to your information digitally. Criminals can exploit online account features, mobile wallets or leaked personal data to start using your card before you\u2019ve even opened the envelope. Below are some of the most common ways this type of fraud happens.",
      "If a scammer already has access to your account, either through stolen login credentials, a hacked email or\u00a0malware, they can view the newly issued card number in the online dashboard or mobile app. Many credit card companies now allow instant access to digital card numbers for use in Apple Pay, Google Wallet or online purchases. This means that as soon as a new card is issued, it may be visible digitally before the physical card is even shipped. If a fraudster has access to your account, they can add the number to a digital wallet and begin spending before the envelope ever hits your mailbox.",
      "Some card issuers allow you to add your credit card to mobile wallets instantly, even before the physical card arrives. While this feature is convenient, it can also expose you to specific security risks tied to mobile wallet activation. Criminals may exploit this process by using stolen personal information to bypass security checks and add your card to their own Apple Pay or Google Wallet accounts. They might pose as you to request a new card, intercept or reroute the digital activation process, or even start making fraudulent purchases immediately. This type of fraud can be hard to detect, especially if you're not expecting a new card or if unauthorized charges blend in with legitimate transactions.",
      "Illustration of someone using their digital wallet (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THIS IS HOW TO PROTECT YOUR CREDIT AND BANK CARDS FROM GETTING HACKED",
      "Another common scenario involves your personal information being compromised in a\u00a0phishing attack or large-scale\u00a0data breach. Thieves use this stolen data, such as your name, Social Security number, address and security question answers, to impersonate you and gain access to your account dashboard or reset login credentials. Once inside, they can retrieve new card details directly from the source or request a replacement card. Phishing scams often trick victims into revealing sensitive information through fake emails or websites, while data breaches expose vast amounts of personal data that criminals can exploit for fraudulent activities.",
      "Although charges made before a new credit card is received are rarely due to mail theft, this type of traditional fraud still poses a risk. Criminals may intercept your mail to steal sensitive documents, including credit cards, which can then be used for unauthorized purchases. To reduce this risk, avoid leaving important mail unattended in your mailbox. Consider using\u00a0Informed Delivery by USPS to track incoming mail or request that your credit card be delivered to a secure location, such as a P.O. box or directly to your bank branch.",

To protect yourself, install strong antivirus software on all your devices.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable multifactor authentication (MFA): Add\u00a0MFA to all accounts tied to your financial information. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second verification step (e.g., a code sent to your phone) before accessing sensitive accounts.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4.\u00a0Use an identity theft protection service:\u00a0Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5. Invest in personal data removal services: Consider using a personal data removal service to reduce your online exposure. These services continuously monitor and remove your sensitive information from data brokers and websites that could be exploited by criminals. This lowers the chances of your data being used in phishing scams or other fraudulent activities. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6. Ask your credit card company to investigate:\u00a0Contact your credit card provider directly and request a full investigation. Ask if there was any suspicious account activity, such as a login from a new device, before the fraudulent charges occurred. They may be able to trace when and how your account was accessed. Most card issuers will reverse fraudulent charges and can reissue a new card with a different number.",
      "7. Notify law enforcement:\u00a0File a report with the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission. If necessary, a police report should also be filed to document the fraud. This can be helpful for disputing charges and clearing your record.",
      "DON\u2019T LET THIS CREDIT CARD FRAUD NIGHTMARE HAPPEN TO YOU",

      "So, we've uncovered how those sneaky credit card charges can surface even before you've held the card in your hands. It's a reflection of the increasingly digital world we live in, where our personal information can be vulnerable in surprising ways. Remember, use strong antivirus software and consider a personal data removal service to minimize your online footprint.

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk announces his platform X is experiencing a major coordinated cyberattack.",
      "X, formerly known as Twitter, has been making headlines recently, with Elon Musk claiming that hackers have been trying to disrupt the platform. However, the most recent news involving the social media site is particularly alarming and puts its users at serious risk.",
      "Earlier this month, reports emerged of a major data breach involving X, after a self-proclaimed data enthusiast known as \"ThinkingOne\" claimed to have released a database containing over 200 million user records on a popular hacker forum. The leaked data includes names, email addresses and nearly everything else associated with a user\u2019s X profile.",

      "X app on an iPhone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "The X data leak is believed to stem from a combination of breaches, including a massive one that allegedly occurred in January 2025 and another in 2023. The leaked dataset, reportedly a 34 GB CSV file, contains 201,186,753 entries with information such as X screen names, user IDs, full names, locations, email addresses (from the 2023 breach), follower counts, profile data, time zones and profile images.",
      "ThinkingOne claimed that the data was cross-referenced from a larger breach involving 2.8 billion unique Twitter IDs and screen names. This breach may have been linked to an insider job during layoffs at X, although the company has not verified this claim. Cybersecurity researchers, including those from\u00a0Safety Detectives, partially confirmed the authenticity of the data by matching a sample with public X profiles and verifying some email addresses. However, they were not able to fully confirm ownership.",
      "The breach appears to trace back to a vulnerability identified in January 2022 through Twitter\u2019s bug bounty program. This flaw allowed attackers to access user data using only an email address or phone number. Although the vulnerability was patched, the compromised data seems to have resurfaced in later leaks.",

      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "The data breach puts X users at risk",
      "The 2025 incident alone does not include passwords or financial information, but when combined with the email addresses from the 2023 leak, it significantly increases the risk of phishing and social engineering attacks. X has not officially acknowledged this specific breach at the time of writing, although it previously downplayed the 2023 incident by claiming it involved mostly public data.",
      "The total of 2.8 billion records far exceeds X\u2019s estimated 335 to 600 million active users, suggesting that the dataset may include inactive accounts, bots or historical data. While the full scope and impact of the breach remain unclear, the incident highlights ongoing security challenges for the platform, especially following its acquisition by xAI in late March 2025.",

      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "7 ways you can stay safe from the X data breach",
      "If you have an account on X or think your data may have been part of the breach, here are seven important steps you can take to protect yourself.",
      "1) Use strong antivirus software",
      "This breach included email addresses linked to X accounts, prime fuel for phishing attacks. Hackers may now send emails that look like they\u2019re from X, Musk or support, asking you to \"verify your account\" or \"reset your password.\" These often contain links or attachments that can install malware or steal personal data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Remove your personal data from the internet",
      "Since this X leak exposed full names, email addresses and other public-facing profile details, hackers can easily cross-reference it with other data broker sites to build a full profile on you. This could lead to impersonation or spear-phishing.",
      "To reduce your exposure, use a trusted data removal service that scans data broker websites and requests the deletion of your personal information. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3) Change your X account password",
      "Even though this particular breach may not have included passwords, there\u2019s still a significant risk, especially if you use the same password across multiple platforms. Once attackers have your email, they often try using it with common or previously leaked passwords to break into accounts.",
      "To change your X account password, go to Settings and privacy from your profile menu, then select\u00a0Your account and tap on\u00a0Change your password. Enter your current password, set a new strong password and confirm the change. You can do this via the mobile app or by logging in through the web. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "4) Make your X profile more private to reduce future risk",
      "Adjust your X account's privacy settings to limit the visibility of personal information, such as making your profile private. Ensure that only necessary information is publicly visible. Information that seems harmless, like your location, job title or birthday, can be used by cybercriminals to impersonate you or guess your login credentials. If your X profile includes any personal details that aren\u2019t necessary, now is the time to remove them.",
      "Keeping your profile minimal not only protects your privacy but also makes it harder for scammers to craft convincing phishing messages or social engineering attacks. Think twice before posting personal updates or details publicly, especially if they can be used to guess passwords or verify your identity.",
      "Go to\u00a0Settings > Privacy and safety and lock down your account visibility.",
      "5) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your X and email accounts",
      "If hackers got your email from the X breach, they may try to reset your password.\u00a02FA helps stop this by requiring a second code to log in:",
      "Use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy, not SMS, which can be interceptedSecure your email accounts, too, since they can be used to reset your X credentials",

      "Secure your email accounts, too, since they can be used to reset your X credentials",
      "6) Use a VPN on public Wi-Fi",
      "Protect your data when accessing X or other platforms on public networks by using a VPN to encrypt your connection. This will help safeguard your information from being intercepted by malicious actors. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7) Sign up for identity theft protection to catch if your X-linked info is abused",
      "With 200-plus million names and email addresses exposed, scammers may try opening accounts in your name or use your email in fraud attempts. Good identity protection can alert you if your info is being sold on the dark web. It can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my\u00a0tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "NEW PHISHING SCAM OUTSMARTS SECURITY CODES TO STEAL YOUR INFO",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The X breach is yet another reminder that patching a vulnerability is only one piece of a much larger puzzle. The persistence of leaked data \u2013 years after the original flaw was disclosed and fixed \u2013 highlights the long tail of exposure that comes with large-scale breaches. Even when credentials aren\u2019t involved, the combination of identifiers like email addresses, names and social connections can be weaponized through correlation attacks, data enrichment and AI-assisted social engineering.",

      "With more and more companies letting us use our own phones for work, it\u2019s getting harder to keep our work and personal lives separate. This is where having a dedicated device for each role can help. Think about setting up your old phone as your work device or personal phone and using your current phone for the opposite. That way, you\u2019ll have two devices for two separate parts of your life without the headache of constantly switching between profiles or worrying about mixing business with pleasure.",

      "What is doubleclickjacking?",
      "Doubleclickjacking is a new spin on an old hacking trick known as clickjacking. Normally, clickjacking works by hiding malicious buttons underneath real ones, so when you think you\u2019re clicking something harmless, you\u2019re actually giving permission for something dangerous. With doubleclickjacking, it takes things a step further. It\u2019s triggered when you double-click, allowing hackers to sneak in an extra, invisible command. Your first click might do something normal. The second click? That\u2019s where the damage happens.",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",

      "Click \"Allow\" on a hidden pop-up",
      "Share your location",
      "Approve a login, payment or even a crypto transaction",
      "What makes doubleclickjacking especially dangerous is that most websites weren\u2019t designed to defend against it. Traditional security features usually protect against a single click, but they often fail when a second click is involved. That small detail opens the door for attackers to bypass layers of protection.",
      "This trick doesn\u2019t just affect websites, either. It can also interfere with browser extensions like crypto wallets and VPNs, sometimes tricking users into approving actions or turning off protection without realizing it. On mobile devices, a simple double-tap can trigger the same effect. To make matters worse, this vulnerability is more widespread than you might expect. Many well-known websites haven\u2019t fixed it yet. All it takes is one quick double-click in the wrong place, and you could unknowingly give away access to sensitive parts of your device.",
      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "How does doubleclickjacking work?",
      "Here\u2019s a simplified version of how the trick plays out. A malicious website quietly loads invisible elements behind or over visible ones, like an embedded frame, hidden button, or disguised pop-up. On your first click, the attacker uses that action to reposition those hidden elements so that your next click lands exactly where they want it. On your second click, you unknowingly interact with the hidden content. You might be clicking \"Allow\" on a browser permission, authorizing a login, or disabling a setting, without ever realizing it. Because modern browsers are lightning fast, this all happens in a split second. The entire setup and switch are virtually invisible to the user. From your perspective, it just feels like a normal double-click.",

      "Doubleclickjacking might be sneaky, but there are simple ways to keep yourself safer online. Here are some practical steps you can take right now:",
      "1. Be cautious about double-clicking on unfamiliar websites: It might sound obvious, but most of us click (and double-click) automatically. If a site prompts you to double-click anything, especially for a login, permission or download, ask yourself if it\u2019s really necessary. Hackers rely on you acting quickly without thinking.",
      "2. Keep your browser updated: Browsers like Chrome, Edge and Safari regularly release patches for these vulnerabilities. That means delaying updates could leave you exposed to tricks like doubleclickjacking. Turn on automatic updates if possible, or make sure to manually keep up with updates so you\u2019re always protected.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software: Browser-based tools and extensions can help block hidden or malicious scripts before they run, but they\u2019re not foolproof. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Use strong, unique passwords for every account:\u00a0Don\u2019t reuse passwords. If one account gets compromised, hackers can use it to access your other accounts. A password manager helps you create and store strong passwords effortlessly. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Limit unnecessary permissions: Take control of your privacy by reviewing which websites have access to your camera, microphone, and location. Many sites request these permissions by default, even when they don\u2019t need them. Head into your browser\u2019s privacy settings and revoke access from any site you don\u2019t fully trust. For example, here's a guide on\u00a0how to navigate Google's privacy settings.",
      "6. Avoid sketchy sites and pop-ups: If a website looks outdated, spammy or aggressively pushes you to click something, get out of there. Avoid downloading random files, and don\u2019t trust pop-ups that claim you\u2019ve won something, need to \"fix\" your device or \"verify\" your login info.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Doubleclickjacking is a clever new spin on a classic hacking trick that allows cybercriminals to take control over your device or account, just from a simple double-click. Because this kind of attack is nearly invisible and works on popular browsers, it\u2019s important to stay alert. Always be cautious when interacting with unfamiliar websites, especially if you're being asked to double-click. Keeping your browser updated and limiting unnecessary permissions can go a long way in reducing your risk. Most importantly, having the right digital protection tools in place can help stop these types of threats before they ever reach you.",

      "Mikal Mahdi, 42, is set to be executed on Friday at 6 p.m. at a prison in Columbia after pleading guilty to the 2004 killing of an off-duty police officer.",
      "In an interview with Fox News Digital, Mahdi's lawyer, David Weiss, said his client's case raises questions about \"appropriate punishment\" given the inmate's life struggles and growth as a person in the years since the crime was committed.",
      "\"It's a question of what's the appropriate punishment, given the life experiences of the person, everything they went through and the reasons why things ended up as they did, with really tragic crimes being committed,\" Weiss said. \"But almost without exception, what you see is when tragic crimes are committed, the person who committed them also went through incredibly difficult life experiences that led them down that path. And that's what happened here.\"",
      "SECOND SOUTH CAROLINA INMATE CHOOSES EXECUTION BY FIRING SQUAD",
      "Mikal Mahdi, 42, is set to be executed on Friday at 6 p.m. at a prison in Columbia. (South Carolina Department of Corrections via AP)",
      "Mahdi is a \"much different person\" now than when he committed the capital crimes at age 21, Weiss said, saying that his client was a \"confused, angry kid\" at the time who has since grown up and matured a lot. Weiss explained that Mahdi is now an \"intelligent, thoughtful person who spends as much time as he can reading and learning about the world.\"",
      "Weiss said Mahdi accepts responsibility for what he did and knows what he did was horrible. He said Mahdi understands that he must be punished for his crimes and that he could be executed.",
      "But Weiss warned that if South Carolina carries out the execution, it will be killing someone who is a \"very different person from the person who committed the capital crimes in the first place.\"",
      "Mahdi would be the fifth person to be executed by firing squad in the U.S. since 1976 \u2013 with the first three carried out in Utah \u2013 and the second in South Carolina after Brad Sigmon, 67, was put to death using that method last month. Sigmon was the first person to be executed by firing squad in 15 years.",
      "Given the choice of lethal injection, electrocution and firing squad, Weiss said Mahdi chose the lesser of three evils. He noted that lethal injection was previously believed to be more humane before it was later determined to be \"quite torturous\" and that electrocution is cruel since a person is being \"cook[ed] from the inside out.\"",
      "\"If the execution goes through, they're going to fire three high-powered rifles at our client's chest,\" Weiss said. \"It's a horrible thing for him to go through. It's a horrible thing to have to witness for everybody involved, from the legal team to witnesses to prison staff who have to carry it out.\"",
      "In the death chamber, Mahdi will be strapped to a chair and have a hood over his head and a target over his heart. Three shooters will fire at him through a small opening about 15 feet away.",
      "Bo King, a lawyer who represented Sigmon, detailed what he witnessed when his client was put to death on March 7.",
      "\"Seeing how he was restrained, he was tied to the chair with his arms pulled back far enough, almost as if someone had him in a wrestling hold, holding his arms behind his back. And then with his chin and jaw secured to the chair with some kind of strap,\" King told Fox News Digital.",
      "SOUTH CAROLINA SETS DATE FOR 5th EXECUTION IN UNDER 7 MONTHS",
      "Brad Sigmon was executed in March for beating to death his estranged girlfriend\u2019s parents in Greenville County in 2001. (South Carolina Department of Corrections via AP)",
      "\"What has stayed with me and continues to trouble me is how he reacted after being shot, specifically watching his right arm pull so frantically on the straps, tying it to the chair,\" he continued. \"And every muscle in his arm popped out, and it looked like an anatomical drawing. It just looked like he was trying so desperately to pull his arm free and cover the hole in his chest.\"",
      "King said he remembers watching the wound open in the middle of Sigmon's chest.",
      "\"It's a difficult sight to reconcile in real time,\" he said. \"You're watching it happening. You're thinking, I just saw a hole open up in that person.\"",
      "King also explained that he believes it is inhumane to tie someone down to kill them, emphasizing that \"the amount of damage that I saw done to Brad's body is beyond anything that I would consider.\"",
      "Three other prisoners have been put to death in South Carolina since the state resumed executions in September. Freddie Owens on Sept. 20, Richard Moore on Nov. 1 and Marion Bowman Jr. on Jan. 31 all died by lethal injection. Sigmon chose the firing squad due to concerns about the prolonged suffering the three other inmates had faced when they were killed by lethal injection, King said.",
      "In Mahdi's case, Weiss expressed concern that his client would be executed \"even though he never had the fair trial that the Constitution is supposed to guarantee.\"",
      "\"The whole question at his trial was what punishment did he deserve? In order to make a reasoned decision about that, the trial judge needed to be given all the information about who Mikal was, what he went through in his life, tragically,\" Weiss explained.",
      "Earlier this week, South Carolina's highest court rejected a final appeal from Mahdi's lawyers. His lawyers argued that his original attorneys made a poor case in attempting to spare his life and failed to call on relatives, teachers or other people who knew him in his sentencing defense, but the state Supreme Court ruled that many of those same arguments had been made in previous unsuccessful appeals.",
      "During his trial, Mahdi\u2019s lawyers said their client was the second son of a woman who was wedded in an arranged marriage at 16 years old. His family described a chaotic childhood, although nobody testified about abuse or mental illness.",
      "Weiss told Fox News Digital that the trial judge who handed down the sentence was given very little information and Mahdi's defense called a single witness who testified for just a few minutes, giving only a broad outline of Mahdi's \"extraordinarily traumatic childhood\" that began when he was a toddler and extended through his early adolescent years.",
      "\"When he needed additional support at school, the teachers tried to provide it, but his dad pulled him out of school rather than allowing him to get that support for his depression, for his suicidal feelings and things just spiraled from there where he went into the juvenile prison system for fairly minor crimes, and he ends up spending thousands of hours in solitary confinement as a kid,\" Weiss said.",
      "As early as second grade, Mahdi suffered from mental despair and discussed self-harm. He already had a criminal record by the time he was a teenager, spending weeks in solitary confinement after being convicted of breaking and entering and attacking a police officer in Virginia.",
      "\"We know today in a way that we just didn't appreciate back then when Mikal was in the system, how damaging that is to a person's development,\" he continued. \"And the judge who decided what sentence Mikal should have was told almost nothing about his story.\"",
      "CONVICTED DOUBLE MURDERER EXECUTED BY FIRING SQUAD IN SOUTH CAROLINA",
      "This photo provided by the South Carolina Department of Corrections shows the state's death chamber in Columbia, including the electric chair, right, and a firing squad chair, left. (South Carolina Department of Corrections/AP)",
      "Weiss added: \"That's the real injustice here, and that's the real outrage here.\"",
      "Mahdi stole a gun and a car in Virginia on July 14, 2004, arrest records show. The next day, he shot and killed a North Carolina store clerk as the clerk was checking his identification. A couple of days later, he carjacked someone at an intersection in Columbia, South Carolina.",
      "On July 18, 2004, while on the run after those crimes, Mahdi hid in the shed of Orangeburg, South Carolina, public safety officer James Myers. Mahdi ambushed Meyers when the officer returned from a birthday celebration for his wife, sister and daughter, prosecutors said.",
      "Myers, 56, was shot eight or nine times, including twice in the head after falling to the ground. A pathologist testified that at least seven of the shots would have been fatal.",
      "Mahdi then set Myers' body on fire and ran away. Myers' wife discovered her husband's dead body in the shed, which they had used for the backdrop of their wedding.",
      "On July 21, 2004, Mahdi was taken into custody in Florida. When one of the officers involved in his arrest learned what he was wanted for in South Carolina, he thanked Mahdi for not shooting at him. Mahdi told him that the only reason he did not was because he was skeptical that he could successfully shoot two officers and their K-9 and get away with it.",
      "While behind bars, Mahdi was caught three times with tools he could have used to escape. One was an Allen wrench and the others were homemade handcuff keys, including one that was found under his tongue at his trial.",
      "On death row, Mahdi stabbed a guard and struck another worker with a concrete block. On three occasions, prison staff found sharpened metal in his cell that could be used as a knife.",
      "After he pleaded guilty to murder, Mahdi was sentenced by Judge Clifton Newman, who at the time told The Post and Courier that he was not sure he believed in the death penalty, but the case became bigger than his beliefs.",
      "\"My challenge and my commitment throughout my judicial career has been to temper justice with mercy and to seek to find the humanity in every defendant that I sentence,\" Newman said as he handed down Mahdi\u2019s punishment. \"That sense of humanity seems not to exist in Mikal Deen Mahdi\"",
      "Once one of the busiest for executions, South Carolina resumed executions in September after a 13-year pause caused in part by the state having difficulty obtaining lethal injection drugs due to pharmaceutical companies' concerns that they would have to disclose they had sold the drugs to state officials.",
      "The room where inmates are executed in Columbus, South Carolina. (South Carolina Department of Corrections via AP)",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "The state legislature then passed a shield law allowing officials to keep lethal injection drug suppliers private. The legislature also approved the firing squad as another execution method over difficulties obtaining the drugs.",
      "South Carolina has executed 47 inmates since the death penalty was resumed in the U.S. in 1976. In the early 2000s, the state was carrying out an average of three executions per year. Only nine states have killed more inmates.",
      "If Mahdi runs out of legal appeals, including petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court to review the issues in the state high court's ruling, his only remaining option would be for Republican Gov. Henry McMaster to reduce his sentence to life without parole, which Mahdi's lawyers have already requested. But no South Carolina governor has granted clemency in the 49 years since the death penalty resumed in the U.S.",
      "\"I think Gov. McMaster has an opportunity to change that, and he should change it,\" Weiss said.",
      "A spokesperson for McMaster's office confirmed to Fox News Digital that the governor had received the petition from Mahdi's lawyers asking for clemency.",
      "\"As the governor has done previously, he will review and carefully consider the petition,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Fox News Digital has reached out to the South Carolina Department of Corrections for comment."

      "The fate of the Menendez brothers is one step closer to a decision as the possibility of being freed from prison could soon become a reality.",
      "A judge will consider Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman\u2019s request to withdraw his predecessor George Gascon\u2019s motion to resentence Erik\u00a0and Lyle Menendez\u00a0on Friday, days before their resentencing hearing is set to take place.",
      "Friday's hearing is set for 10 a.m. local time, when the brothers are expected to appear remotely.",
      "Hochman announced on Wednesday that his office has filed a reply on the resentencing matter, saying he does not agree with the resentencing, but is prepared to move forward. The brothers' attorneys have argued they should have been convicted of manslaughter rather than murder, in which case they would already have been released from prison.",

      "Incoming Los Angeles County DA Nate Hochman says he hasn't seen any of the media about the Menendez brothers before he assumes office. (Getty Images)",
      "Hochman's office said that after \"a thorough and exhaustive review of over tens of thousands of pages of trial transcripts, thousands of pages of prison records, and hundreds of hours of videotaped trial testimony,\" his office is prepared to move forward with the hearing on the Court\u2019s initiation of resentencing proceedings for the Menendez brothers, but are requesting that the prior District Attorney\u2019s motion for resentencing be withdrawn.",
      "Joseph Menendez, who goes by his middle name Lyle, and younger brother Erik Menendez have been in California prisons since 1996, serving sentences of life without the possibility of parole for their parents' 1989 slayings.",
      "Before losing his bid for reelection in November, former district attorney George Gascon asked the court to\u00a0resentence the brothers\u00a0to life with parole instead of the current sentence of life without the possibility of parole.",
      "Hochman has opposed resentencing, but said his office is ready to proceed with the resentencing hearing, which he said could still happen even if the judge agrees to withdraw the Gascon motion.",
      "California criminal defense attorney Brian Claypool, who is not involved in the case, told Fox News Digital that no matter what comes out of Friday's hearing, the Menendez brothers' fate will be up to a judge.",

      "Lyle, left, and Erik Menendez sit with defense attorney Leslie Abramson, right, in Beverly Hills Municipal Court during a hearing, Nov. 26, 1990.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Nick Ut)",
      "\"At the end of the day, I think the judge is going to grant Hochman's request to remove Gascon motion to support resentencing, but what we really need to have is a ruling by the trial judge,\" Claypool explained. \"So in other words, it doesn't matter really what the LA County DA says, whether it's Hochman's position or the prior DA Gascon's decision. It's ultimately up to this judge to make a decision on resentencing, irrespective of what Hochmon is requesting to be done.\"",
      "Two of the brothers' older relatives had already provided testimony at a November hearing as a precaution and the only relative against the brother's release, their uncle Milton Anderson, died last month at age 90.",
      "Subject to the court\u2019s ruling, a resentencing hearing is tentatively scheduled for April 17 and 18. If that goes forward, prosecutors are expecting the defense to call several Menendez family members who support resentencing.",
      "The hearing was postponed due to the impact of recent wildfires on the parties' extensive preparations.",
      "Claypool, who is based in Los Angeles County, believes that resentencing hearing is \"a political tug-of-war\" between Hochman and Gov. Gavin Newsom, more than anything else.",
      "\"The reason I say that is because Gavin Newsom has already requested weeks ago that the California Parole Board conduct what's called a risk assessment on the Menendez brothers. Why is that important? Because that portends that Newsom is likely to grant clemency if this judge doesn't grant resentencing. And in many respects, I believe that Newsom did that on purpose to put some implied pressure on this judge to grant resentencing,\" Claypool said.",
      "Hochman's office has said that despite the \"defense arguing that this decision is political, such an argument is devoid of merit.\"",
      "\"Though this pathway to resentencing has been offered to the Menendez brothers, they have chosen to stubbornly remain hunkered down in their over 30-year-old bunker of lies, deceit, and denials.\"",
      "\"The basis for this withdrawal request is that the prior DA\u2019s motion did not examine or consider whether the Menendez brothers have exhibited full insight and taken complete responsibility for their crimes by continuing for the past over 30 years to lie about their claims of self-defense, that is, their fear that their mother and father were going to kill them the night of Aug. 20, 1989, justifying the brutal murders of their parents with shotgun blasts through the back of their father\u2019s head, a point-blank blast through their mother\u2019s face, and shots to their kneecaps to stage it as a Mafia killing,\" Hochman said.",
      "\"As a full examination of the record reveals, the Menendez brothers have never come clean over the past three decades and admitted that they lied about their self-defense as well as suborned perjury and attempted to suborn perjury by their friends for the lies, among others, of their father violently raping Lyle\u2019s girlfriend, their mother poisoning the family, and their attempt to get a handgun the day before the murders.\"",
      "FOLLOW THE FOX TRUE CRIME TEAM ON X",
      "Hochman's office also told Fox News Digital that this has nothing to do with politics and that there is \"no political tug-of-war between the DA and the Governor.\"",
      "\"Politics was one of the chief driving forces behind the timing of the prior District Attorney's decision to file a resentencing motion in the Menendez case, coming 12 days before the election instead of eight months earlier when he first received the resentencing request,\" Hochman said.",
      "\"The facts and the law \u2014 not politics \u2014 are now what drives DA Hochman\u2019s request to withdraw that motion as laid out in detail in the over 85-page response filed on March 10, 2025. There is no political tug-of-war between the DA and the Governor. The DA has done his job involving a thorough and detailed review of the facts and the law, and the DA assumes the Governor will honor his similar obligations.\"",
      "Hochman has said that it is up to the court to factor in whether the \"lack of acceptance of responsibility for their murderous actions\" is enough to decide whether the Menendez brothers pose an unreasonable risk of danger to the community.",
      "\"Though this pathway to resentencing has been offered to the Menendez brothers, they have chosen to stubbornly remain hunkered down in their over 30-year-old bunker of lies, deceit, and denials,\" Hochman said.",
      "MENENDEZ BROTHERS RESENTENCING: WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?",
      "Claypool said he believes that Hochman knows deep down that they will lose this battle due to the \"public sentiment flowing in favor of the Menendez brothers getting a second chance.\"",
      "\"Hochman has to come out and vigorously oppose this because that is his mantra. That is his campaign message, but I think deep down he knows that it's not about winning or losing right now, for Hochman, it's about where does he stand politically on this issue,\" Claypool shared.",

      "\"Erik and Lyle have apologized, taken responsibility, and expressed sincere remorse, again and again, with no underlining motive other than to grow, mature, and rehabilitate,\" said Tamara Goodell, cousin of Erik and Lyle Menendez. \"They recognize the wide-scale impact their actions have had on us, their family. Since then, we have seen their relentless commitment to emotional growth, earning degrees and uplifting those around them. That is the definition of rehabilitation in my eyes.\"",

      "But even if Russia objects to reimposing sanctions on Iran, as Tehran has become a close ally of Moscow\u2019s, it actually has very few options for blocking the snapback mechanism that it previously agreed to, so long as at least one other nation actually calls for the sanction tool.",

    "summary": "In Egypt, ancient treasure dating back 3,300 years is being So'oud Aten. Dubbed the lost golden city, its residents left at the whim of Pharaoh Akhenaten.",
    "story": [
      "SO\u2019OUD ATEN, Egypt \u2014 It\u2019s a familiar story: The whim of a leader upends citizens\u2019 lives\u00a0and leads them into the wilderness.",
      "In ancient Egypt, Pharaoh Akhenaten was no different. Determined that his population should stop from worshipping multiple gods, more than 3,300 years ago he told residents to seal up their homes and workshops in the city of So\u2019oud Aten with mud and clay bricks and move to a new home, a leading Egyptologist, Zawi Hawass, told NBC News last month.",
      "\u201cWhen the king makes a decision, everyone has to obey the decision,\u201d Hawass said. \u201cThis is the pharaoh.\u201d",
      "So quick was their exodus that many left behind an array of items including jewelry, pottery, children's shoes and toys, as well as a pizza peel similar to those used to make bread by their modern day descendants \u2014 a treasure trove that is now being recovered by archeologists.\u00a0NBC News was given exclusive access to the latest findings.",
      "Learn more about this story on \u201cTODAY\u201d this morning at 7 a.m. ET.",
      "But much is still a mystery in a city that was only discovered four years ago by archeologists searching for a mortuary temple where animal skeletons were arranged for religious rights. Egyptologists may never figure out why a fish was covered in gold.",
      "\u201cNobody really can explain it,\u201d Hawass said, adding that around 500 statues of the Sekhmet, the goddess of healing, have also been found at the site, which he has dubbed the \u201clost golden city,\u201d in part because it thrived during Egypt\u2019s golden age.",
      "Today it is a sleepy patch of desert, surrounded by a metal fence, and a dusty road. Archeologists work in the blazing sun at the site where an artificial lake with boat moorings was recently unearthed, likely created to deliver and dispatch goods to the Nile.",
      "Its location though is hugely significant. Situated near Luxor, an ancient city in central Egypt, it is surrounded by historical monuments, including the Colossi of Memnon, the Madinat Habu Temple and the Ramesseum. During the 18th dynasty, this was royal Egypt.",
      "Hawass, who served as Egypt\u2019s minister for antiquities, said that So\u2019oud Aten provides important information about the high standard of living for artisans and craftsmen as well as \u201cthe daily life of the people,\u201d who were so well off that archeologists \u201cfound many showers inside the houses,\u201d he said.",
      "In the past few months Hawass said a set of administrative buildings akin to a police station or town hall have also been uncovered.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a snapshot in time,\u201d said Salima Ikram, a professor of Egyptology at the American University of Cairo.",
      "Workmen just laid down their tools, she said, adding, \u201cTheir stuff is lying around. They\u2019re in the middle of making, you know, pegging out a cow hide. They\u2019re cutting out sandals, and suddenly, all of this.\u201d",
      "Another recent discovery, a sun image etched onto the wall of a room in the district of the city where spinning, leatherwork and jewelry production took place, appears to signal a shift in religious thinking over time, Hawass said.",
      "Then in his life changing ruling, Akhenaten decided that his citizens should worship Aten, who was represented by the sun, he said, adding that it was possibly the first historical example of monotheism.",
      "Others like Ikram, prefer to define him as a henotheist \u2014 someone who worships one particular god, while acknowledging the existence and potential worship of other deities.",
      "Akhenaten, Hawass said, was \u201chated\u201d by religious priests who profited from the worship of multiple gods.",
      "\u201cHe wanted to go to a place to worship Aten,\u201d Hawass said, adding that he chose a site known today as Tell-el Amarna, around 200 miles south of Egypt\u2019s capital, Cairo.",
      "He called the new city the \u201cRise of Aten,\u201d Hawass said, adding that he believed that he was inspired to build the city by his father, Amenhotep III, who ruled Egypt from 1391 till 1353 B.C.",
      "Queen Nefertiti, Akhenaten\u2019s far more famous wife, would have walked the streets alongside him, Hawass added.",
      "The move was a \u201creligious revolution,\u201d said Yasmin El Shazly, the deputy director of the American Research Center in Egypt, which , which offers financial assistance to some archeologists. \u201cWe know that during the reign of Amenhotep lll, the religion became increasingly solar. There is evidence of the Aten, but there are other deities as well. So we know that it was not monotheistic at the time.\u201d",
      "But mentioning other gods, even the major deity Amun, \u201cbecame almost taboo,\u201d she said.",
      "After Akhenaten\u2019s death the city continued to be used by pharaohs including Tutankhamun, whose nearly intact tomb was discovered in the Valley of the Kings by British archaeologist Howard Carter in 1922.",
      "What the citizens thought about leaving their original home in So\u2019oud Aten remains unclear.",
      "By blocking the doors, Hawass said it appeared that they were thinking they may come back and they wanted to \u201ckeep it safe.\u201d",
      "But at the time, he said no one could raise their objections to the pharaoh. \u201cNo one can talk to the king,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "Faced with a judge's deadline to provide evidence that Mahmoud Khalil poses a national security threat to the U.S., the Trump administration responded with a brief memo citing the Columbia student protester's beliefs in justifying his deportation.",
      "Khalil, a graduate student who helped lead protests against the war in Gaza last year, was arrested by immigration authorities on March 8. On Tuesday, an immigration judge in Louisiana ordered the federal government to provide evidence by Wednesday justifying its attempt to deport him.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio responded Wednesday evening in a memo obtained by NBC News. In a one-and-a-half-page memo, he cited an obscure\u00a0provision of the\u00a0Immigration and Nationality Act\u00a0of 1952 to justify Khalil\u2019s removal from the U.S.",
      "Rubio said that while Khalil's \u201cpast, current or expected beliefs, statements, or associations that are otherwise lawful,\" the provision allows the secretary of state alone to \u201cpersonally determine\u201d whether he should remain in the country.",
      "He said that allowing Khalil to stay in the U.S. would create a \"hostile environment for Jewish students in the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe foreign policy of the United States champions core American interests and American citizens and condoning anti-Semitic conduct and disruptive protests in the United States would severely undermine that significant foreign policy objective,\u201d he wrote.",
      "In response, Khalil's lawyer, Baher Azmy, said that \"immigration authorities have finally admitted that they have no case whatsoever against him.\"",
      "\"What this case is really about is whether lawful permanent residents \u2014 and other immigrants to this country \u2014 can speak out about Israel\u2019s brutal attacks on Gaza and Palestine, or any other important matters of discussion in the national discourse, without fear of deportation for expressing beliefs that the First Amendment completely protects,\" Azmy said at a virtual news briefing Thursday. \"Are U.S. citizens going to be next?\u201d",
      "Assistant Chief Immigration Judge Jamee Comans will decide at a hearing scheduled for Friday in Louisiana whether Khalil can be removed from the United States or should be released. If she rules that Khalil can be deported, his legal team can appeal.",
      "Marc Van Der Hout, another attorney for Khalil, said at the briefing that the Rubio memo is the only piece of evidence the government submitted to justify that Khalil\u2019s presence in the U.S. would have \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe government submitted, as you all have seen now, a two-page document. Two pages, that\u2019s it,\" Van Der Hout said. \"And in that, Secretary of State Rubio says that Mahmoud\u2019s presence here would create adverse foreign policy interests. But what does he talk about? He talks about First Amendment activity in the United States and the effect on people in the United States. His determination, quote, unquote, has absolutely nothing to do with foreign policy.\u201d",
      "In less than five weeks since Khalil's arrest, immigration authorities have arrested dozens of foreign students \u2014 many of whom are Muslim \u2014 at universities across the country or revoked their visas.",
      "Rubio\u00a0said last month that the State Department had revoked more than 300 student visas. \u201cWe do it every day,\" he said. \"Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visas.\"",
      "On Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security announced the creation of a task force to monitor the social media activity of immigrants, including foreign students, for antisemitism. Three sources familiar with the operation told NBC News that the task force will be screening an estimated 1.5 million foreign students studying in the United States for potential grounds to revoke their visas.",
      "The unprecedented actions by the immigration system come amid the federal government's broader crackdown on universities in the name of combatting antisemitism.",
      "In February, the Department of Justice launched a task force to \u201croot out\u201d what it calls\u00a0\u201canti-Semitic harassment in schools and on college campuses.\u201d",
      "The administration has also halted hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding to several universities in recent weeks, including Columbia, Harvard and Princeton, citing dissatisfaction with how they handled last year\u2019s protests against the war in Gaza."

    "summary": "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called for people to get the measles vaccine, while falsely claiming it has not been \u201csafety tested\u201d and its protection is short-lived.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called for people to get the measles vaccine while in the same breath falsely claiming it hasn\u2019t been \u201csafety tested\u201d and its protection is short-lived.",
      "Kennedy, an anti-vaccine activist now overseeing federal health agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had shied away from a full-throated endorsement of measles vaccinations, instead claiming the vaccine is the \u201cmost effective way\u201d to prevent the virus\u2019 spread.",
      "In an interview Wednesday with CBS News, Kennedy said the Trump administration was focused on finding ways to treat people who choose not to get vaccinated. However, there are no approved treatments for measles, which kills almost 3 out of every 1,000 people diagnosed.",
      "Many medical experts have taken issue with his approach to the current measles outbreak, which has included emphasizing unproven treatments and framing vaccination as a personal choice (which some doctors view as a nod to his anti-vaccine supporters).",
      "Kennedy also suggested that measles cases are inevitable in the United States because of ebbing immunity from vaccines \u2014 a notion doctors say is false.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re always going to have measles, no matter what happens, as the vaccine wanes very quickly,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine offer lifelong protection. That\u2019s because the vaccine stimulates the production of memory cells, he said, which can recognize the virus over a lifetime.",
      "\u201cWe eliminated measles from this country. That could never happen if immunity waned,\u201d said Offit, who serves on an independent vaccine advisory committee for the FDA.",
      "Aside from occasional outbreaks, measles hasn\u2019t been constantly present in the United States since before 2000. It is introduced locally by international travelers, and from there it can spread among undervaccinated communities.",
      "\u201cThe federal government\u2019s position is, my position is, people should get the measles vaccine. But the government should not be mandating those,\u201d Kennedy told CBS News.",
      "The federal government doesn\u2019t mandate childhood vaccines; rather, all 50 states require them for children attending public school. The FDA approves vaccines based on safety and efficacy, and the CDC makes recommendations about who should get them, which states often choose to follow.",
      "According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, all 50 states have exemptions to vaccine mandates for medical reasons, and all but five have additional exemptions for other reasons, such as religious or personal objections.",
      "The current outbreak was fueled by transmission in a primarily Mennonite community in Gaines County, Texas, where vaccine hesitancy is prevalent. There have been 668 total cases since January, according to NBC News\u2019 tally, including two pediatric deaths and one suspected death in an unvaccinated adult. Before those deaths, the United States hadn\u2019t had a measles death in a decade, and a child hadn\u2019t died of measles since 2003.",
      "Kennedy has pointed to higher case numbers in Europe as evidence that the United States is responding appropriately to the outbreak. But the figure he has cited recently \u2014 roughly 127,000 measles cases in Europe \u2014 is the total for last year across 53 countries. Low vaccination rates in southeastern Europe were a major contributor, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "\u201cHe has this way of kind of twisting things,\u201d said Dr. William Moss, director of the Johns Hopkins International Vaccine Access Center. \u201cWe should be comparing measles in the United States this year to measles in the United States and prior years. To say Europe has more cases over one year than we\u2019ve had in three months this year, it\u2019s just a false comparison.\u201d",
      "This year\u2019s count in the United States is the highest since 2019, when there was a major outbreak in Orthodox Jewish communities in New York. Doctors fear the United States could be on the verge of losing its measles elimination status as Kennedy continues to sow doubt about vaccine safety.",
      "\u201cRight now we don\u2019t know the risks of many of these products because they\u2019re not safety tested,\u201d Kennedy told CBS News. \u201cMany of the vaccines are only tested for three or four days with no placebo group.\u201d",
      "Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines program at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, said vaccine development usually takes 10 to 20 years, with the notable exception of Covid shots, which were brought to market in less than a year thanks to mRNA technology and a coordinated, worldwide effort. (Even then, the foundational research behind mRNA vaccines dates to 1997.)",
      "When it comes to childhood immunizations, many of which were approved decades ago, there may not have been placebo controls or long-term safety follow-ups for each one, Levy said. However, he noted that even after vaccines are approved, various government-led surveillance systems monitor for adverse reactions. And in the rare case they find anything, that vaccine is pulled from the market, he added.",
      "Moss agreed that the types of clinical trials for vaccines have changed over time. However, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other product we use that\u2019s more rigorously evaluated for both safety and efficacy,\u201d he said.",
      "Offit said Kennedy \u201cjust keeps picking and picking\u201d at vaccine safety with statements that aren\u2019t scientifically valid \u2014 for instance, by suggesting that all childhood vaccines weren\u2019t tested against placebos, when, in fact, many were.",

      "The people tasked with keeping the country safe from foreign government hackers and cybercriminal gangs say they feel like they\u2019re under attack, not from their usual adversaries but from the administration they work under.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s Wednesday order calling for a Justice Department investigation into Chris Krebs, the former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), has sent fresh shock waves through that agency\u2019s hallways, according to five employees who spoke with NBC News. Each spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "The order comes as the White House is downsizing the agency for at least the third time in three months.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really tough time for all of us right now,\u201d said one employee. \u201cEvery day feels somehow more bizarre than the last. It is incredibly difficult to focus on our mission.\u201d",
      "Krebs, whom Trump appointed as CISA\u2019s inaugural director during his first term, quickly built the agency into the country\u2019s front-line digital defender of critical systems. But he also emerged as a surprising counterpoint to the president, particularly around his efforts to advance false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.",
      "The order Trump signed cites Krebs\u2019 insistence that there is no credible evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, despite Trump\u2019s false but often-repeated claims. Also signed by the homeland security secretary, it directs the attorney general to \u201ctake all appropriate action to review\u201d Krebs\u2019 activities.",
      "Employees who spoke to NBC News largely believe Trump\u2019s action was politically motivated. Trump also revoked Krebs\u2019 security clearance.",
      "\u201cI feel so sickened by this. It\u2019s a shocking abuse of power,\u201d one said.",
      "Trump\u2019s moves on Krebs and CISA come as the U.S. faces mounting cybersecurity challenges, most notably from China, which has in just the last two years shown its capability to penetrate deep into sensitive U.S. infrastructure as well as government systems, federal officials say. For-profit hackers have also turned ransomware into a  billion dollar criminal enterprise that shuts down hospitals, schools and many businesses.",
      "Republicans quickly coalesced around Trump\u2019s election claims and politicized the agency\u2019s efforts to coordinate with technology companies to secure elections, including how to counter the spread of foreign propaganda.",
      "Under Krebs, CISA coordinated a unified response from government agencies and states disputing false claims of election fraud, many of which Trump and his allies used to justify his attempts to stay in office. Trump fired Krebs two weeks after that election.",
      "\u201cThis EO targeting former director Krebs seems based in personal vendetta, and no American should be comfortable with that,\u201d another CISA employee said.",
      "Krebs declined to comment. On Wednesday evening, he reposted to X the message he first published in 2020 after Trump fired him: \u201cHonored to serve. We did it right. Defend Today, Secure Tomorrow. #Protect2020.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration is also currently purging CISA\u2019s workforce, according to emails to staff obtained by NBC News. The Department of Homeland Security, CISA\u2019s parent agency, sent a memo Monday evening that encouraged employees to retire early or take a buyout package by Monday.",
      "A\u00a0second email, sent by CISA acting director Bridget Bean, reiterated that offer.\u00a0Trump has nominated a permanent director, Sean Plankey, who has yet to be confirmed by the Senate. A CISA spokesperson declined to comment. The White House didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "A DHS spokesperson declined to share how many employees it expected to cut, but said in an emailed statement: \u201cEvery dollar spent and position filled at DHS should be focused on our core mission of securing our homeland and keeping the American people safe.\u201d",
      "Those buyout offers echo a round of emails that DHS sent to CISA employees in February. A DHS spokesperson told NBC News that month it had also cut more than 130 employees who had probationary status and that it deemed \u201cnon-mission critical personnel.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, before the Krebs news and as rumors spread that the second round of buyout offers was going out, Jen Easterly, who succeeded Krebs as CISA\u2019s director under President Joe Biden, posted to LinkedIn about why the cuts could hurt U.S. security.",
      "\u201cDegrading the capability and capacity of the federal cyber ecosystem\u2014whether by laying off hundreds of highly talented cyber professionals at America\u2019s cyber defense agency or by decapitating the highly effective, nonpartisan, and principled leadership of America\u2019s most important technical intelligence agency\u2014will only make Americans less safe and more vulnerable to our adversaries,\u201d Easterly wrote.",
      "One CISA employee said the repeated staff reductions hampered the agency\u2019s ability to secure critical infrastructure, which often relies on experts who are familiar with highly specialized computer programs and operating systems.",
      "\u201cThe cuts that happened initially have already severely degraded our capacity to defend critical infrastructure,\u201d the employee said. \u201cThe cuts that may come \u2014 I don\u2019t know what the numbers are going to look like \u2014 but they without a doubt will further degrade our ability to defend critical infrastructure.\u201c",
      "Trump\u2019s executive order also suspended the security clearances of employees at the cybersecurity company where Krebs works, SentinelOne.",
      "SentinelOne released a statement Thursday evening it would \u201cactively cooperate in any review of security clearances held by any of our personnel\u201d and that it views \u201cthe White House as a crucial collaborator.\u201d It did not defend Krebs.",
      "Another CISA employee said Trump\u2019s decision to target SentinelOne could start a chilling effect where employees feel pressured to ignore software vulnerabilities that might upset the president.",
      "\u201cWill there be pressure to not have a public vulnerability in a car company if the CEO is close to the president?\u201d the employee said. \u201cIt\u2019s like Iraq war intelligence. We\u2019re only going to say what they want to be the message, rather than telling the country about real threat.\u201d"

      "As the Feb. 17 post went viral in conservative media, it drew the attention of the Trump administration, which had, in an executive order, effectively banned transgender students from participating in girls' and women's sports. President Donald Trump confronted Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, demanding that her state comply with the order. She hasn\u2019t agreed. And the school district hasn\u2019t backed down.",
      "Now Greely High School is at the center of a conflict over Title IX, the civil rights law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in education. The Trump administration has threatened to pull all federal education funding \u2014 over $200 million per year \u2014 if the state doesn\u2019t comply by Friday. Outsiders see the showdown as an important test of how far the administration will go to force states to follow executive orders.",

    "story": [
      "SO\u2019OUD ATEN, Egypt \u2014 It\u2019s a familiar story: The whim of a leader upends citizens\u2019 lives\u00a0and leads them into the wilderness.",
      "In ancient Egypt, Pharaoh Akhenaten was no different. Determined that his population should stop from worshipping multiple gods, more than 3,300 years ago he told residents to seal up their homes and workshops in the city of So\u2019oud Aten with mud and clay bricks and move to a new home, a leading Egyptologist, Zawi Hawass, told NBC News last month.",
      "\u201cWhen the king makes a decision, everyone has to obey the decision,\u201d Hawass said. \u201cThis is the pharaoh.\u201d",
      "So quick was their exodus that many left behind an array of items including jewelry, pottery, children's shoes and toys, as well as a pizza peel similar to those used to make bread by their modern day descendants \u2014 a treasure trove that is now being recovered by archeologists.\u00a0NBC News was given exclusive access to the latest findings.",
      "Learn more about this story on \u201cTODAY\u201d this morning at 7 a.m. ET.",
      "But much is still a mystery in a city that was only discovered four years ago by archeologists searching for a mortuary temple where animal skeletons were arranged for religious rights. Egyptologists may never figure out why a fish was covered in gold.",
      "\u201cNobody really can explain it,\u201d Hawass said, adding that around 500 statues of the Sekhmet, the goddess of healing, have also been found at the site, which he has dubbed the \u201clost golden city,\u201d in part because it thrived during Egypt\u2019s golden age.",
      "Today it is a sleepy patch of desert, surrounded by a metal fence, and a dusty road. Archeologists work in the blazing sun at the site where an artificial lake with boat moorings was recently unearthed, likely created to deliver and dispatch goods to the Nile.",
      "Its location though is hugely significant. Situated near Luxor, an ancient city in central Egypt, it is surrounded by historical monuments, including the Colossi of Memnon, the Madinat Habu Temple and the Ramesseum. During the 18th dynasty, this was royal Egypt.",
      "Hawass, who served as Egypt\u2019s minister for antiquities, said that So\u2019oud Aten provides important information about the high standard of living for artisans and craftsmen as well as \u201cthe daily life of the people,\u201d who were so well off that archeologists \u201cfound many showers inside the houses,\u201d he said.",
      "In the past few months Hawass said a set of administrative buildings akin to a police station or town hall have also been uncovered.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a snapshot in time,\u201d said Salima Ikram, a professor of Egyptology at the American University of Cairo.",
      "Workmen just laid down their tools, she said, adding, \u201cTheir stuff is lying around. They\u2019re in the middle of making, you know, pegging out a cow hide. They\u2019re cutting out sandals, and suddenly, all of this.\u201d",
      "Another recent discovery, a sun image etched onto the wall of a room in the district of the city where spinning, leatherwork and jewelry production took place, appears to signal a shift in religious thinking over time, Hawass said.",
      "Then in his life changing ruling, Akhenaten decided that his citizens should worship Aten, who was represented by the sun, he said, adding that it was possibly the first historical example of monotheism.",
      "Others like Ikram, prefer to define him as a henotheist \u2014 someone who worships one particular god, while acknowledging the existence and potential worship of other deities.",
      "Akhenaten, Hawass said, was \u201chated\u201d by religious priests who profited from the worship of multiple gods.",
      "\u201cHe wanted to go to a place to worship Aten,\u201d Hawass said, adding that he chose a site known today as Tell-el Amarna, around 200 miles south of Egypt\u2019s capital, Cairo.",
      "He called the new city the \u201cRise of Aten,\u201d Hawass said, adding that he believed that he was inspired to build the city by his father, Amenhotep III, who ruled Egypt from 1391 till 1353 B.C.",
      "Queen Nefertiti, Akhenaten\u2019s far more famous wife, would have walked the streets alongside him, Hawass added.",
      "The move was a \u201creligious revolution,\u201d said Yasmin El Shazly, the deputy director of the American Research Center in Egypt, which , which offers financial assistance to some archeologists. \u201cWe know that during the reign of Amenhotep lll, the religion became increasingly solar. There is evidence of the Aten, but there are other deities as well. So we know that it was not monotheistic at the time.\u201d",
      "But mentioning other gods, even the major deity Amun, \u201cbecame almost taboo,\u201d she said.",
      "After Akhenaten\u2019s death the city continued to be used by pharaohs including Tutankhamun, whose nearly intact tomb was discovered in the Valley of the Kings by British archaeologist Howard Carter in 1922.",
      "What the citizens thought about leaving their original home in So\u2019oud Aten remains unclear.",
      "By blocking the doors, Hawass said it appeared that they were thinking they may come back and they wanted to \u201ckeep it safe.\u201d",
      "But at the time, he said no one could raise their objections to the pharaoh. \u201cNo one can talk to the king,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called for people to get the measles vaccine while in the same breath falsely claiming it hasn\u2019t been \u201csafety tested\u201d and its protection is short-lived.",
      "Kennedy, an anti-vaccine activist now overseeing federal health agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had shied away from a full-throated endorsement of measles vaccinations, instead claiming the vaccine is the \u201cmost effective way\u201d to prevent the virus\u2019 spread.",
      "In an interview Wednesday with CBS News, Kennedy said the Trump administration was focused on finding ways to treat people who choose not to get vaccinated. However, there are no approved treatments for measles, which kills almost 3 out of every 1,000 people diagnosed.",
      "Many medical experts have taken issue with his approach to the current measles outbreak, which has included emphasizing unproven treatments and framing vaccination as a personal choice (which some doctors view as a nod to his anti-vaccine supporters).",
      "Kennedy also suggested that measles cases are inevitable in the United States because of ebbing immunity from vaccines \u2014 a notion doctors say is false.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re always going to have measles, no matter what happens, as the vaccine wanes very quickly,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine offer lifelong protection. That\u2019s because the vaccine stimulates the production of memory cells, he said, which can recognize the virus over a lifetime.",
      "\u201cWe eliminated measles from this country. That could never happen if immunity waned,\u201d said Offit, who serves on an independent vaccine advisory committee for the FDA.",
      "Aside from occasional outbreaks, measles hasn\u2019t been constantly present in the United States since before 2000. It is introduced locally by international travelers, and from there it can spread among undervaccinated communities.",
      "\u201cThe federal government\u2019s position is, my position is, people should get the measles vaccine. But the government should not be mandating those,\u201d Kennedy told CBS News.",
      "The federal government doesn\u2019t mandate childhood vaccines; rather, all 50 states require them for children attending public school. The FDA approves vaccines based on safety and efficacy, and the CDC makes recommendations about who should get them, which states often choose to follow.",
      "According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, all 50 states have exemptions to vaccine mandates for medical reasons, and all but five have additional exemptions for other reasons, such as religious or personal objections.",
      "The current outbreak was fueled by transmission in a primarily Mennonite community in Gaines County, Texas, where vaccine hesitancy is prevalent. There have been 668 total cases since January, according to NBC News\u2019 tally, including two pediatric deaths and one suspected death in an unvaccinated adult. Before those deaths, the United States hadn\u2019t had a measles death in a decade, and a child hadn\u2019t died of measles since 2003.",
      "Kennedy has pointed to higher case numbers in Europe as evidence that the United States is responding appropriately to the outbreak. But the figure he has cited recently \u2014 roughly 127,000 measles cases in Europe \u2014 is the total for last year across 53 countries. Low vaccination rates in southeastern Europe were a major contributor, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "\u201cHe has this way of kind of twisting things,\u201d said Dr. William Moss, director of the Johns Hopkins International Vaccine Access Center. \u201cWe should be comparing measles in the United States this year to measles in the United States and prior years. To say Europe has more cases over one year than we\u2019ve had in three months this year, it\u2019s just a false comparison.\u201d",
      "This year\u2019s count in the United States is the highest since 2019, when there was a major outbreak in Orthodox Jewish communities in New York. Doctors fear the United States could be on the verge of losing its measles elimination status as Kennedy continues to sow doubt about vaccine safety.",
      "\u201cRight now we don\u2019t know the risks of many of these products because they\u2019re not safety tested,\u201d Kennedy told CBS News. \u201cMany of the vaccines are only tested for three or four days with no placebo group.\u201d",
      "Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the precision vaccines program at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, said vaccine development usually takes 10 to 20 years, with the notable exception of Covid shots, which were brought to market in less than a year thanks to mRNA technology and a coordinated, worldwide effort. (Even then, the foundational research behind mRNA vaccines dates to 1997.)",
      "When it comes to childhood immunizations, many of which were approved decades ago, there may not have been placebo controls or long-term safety follow-ups for each one, Levy said. However, he noted that even after vaccines are approved, various government-led surveillance systems monitor for adverse reactions. And in the rare case they find anything, that vaccine is pulled from the market, he added.",
      "Moss agreed that the types of clinical trials for vaccines have changed over time. However, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other product we use that\u2019s more rigorously evaluated for both safety and efficacy,\u201d he said.",
      "Offit said Kennedy \u201cjust keeps picking and picking\u201d at vaccine safety with statements that aren\u2019t scientifically valid \u2014 for instance, by suggesting that all childhood vaccines weren\u2019t tested against placebos, when, in fact, many were.",
      "\u201cThe problem with RFK Jr. is his definition of \u2018placebo,\u2019\u201d Offit said. \u201cHis definition of placebo is either water or saline, meaning just normal sodium chloride, but that\u2019s not the FDA\u2019s definition. The FDA\u2019s definition is something that\u2019s inert.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said Kennedy \u201craised valid concerns about vaccine trial practices, including the use of active comparators instead of inert placebos and short observation windows \u2014 issues backed by public data.\u201d",
      "But doctors said there\u2019s a legitimate reason to use active comparators \u2014 vaccines that have already been approved for given infections \u2014 instead of placebos: It would be unethical to withhold the benefit of a vaccine from study participants, so trials often test new vaccines against older versions.",
      "Levy said there\u2019s always room for more safety studies or longer-term follow-up.",
      "\u201cI think the secretary is right that we could do more to study vaccine safety,\u201d he said. \u201cBy all means, let\u2019s dig in. Let\u2019s see, did we miss anything? Should we learn more? But let\u2019s not forget that these vaccines in childhood have averted severe disease in children.\u201d"

      "Democrats are at a crossroads. And different potential party leaders are already scoping out different potential paths back to power in a few years.",
      "After the party lost November\u2019s presidential election, its image has slipped to historic lows, and it lacks significant power in Washington to push back against President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to bend the federal government to his will \u2014 even as Democratic voters warm to the idea of an all-out fight against Trump.",
      "It\u2019s against that backdrop that key Democratic leaders are making early, yet important, moves about how to position themselves as the party looks toward a wide-open 2028 presidential race. Some seek to resist Trump at all opportunities, others concede victories to Republicans on cultural issues, and still more hope to split the difference \u2014 working with Trump when necessary and criticizing him when they disagree.",
      "The early moves are, in many cases, nuanced and layered, and it\u2019s clear that not everything these Democrats do should be viewed solely through the lens of potential presidential campaigns. Here\u2019s a look at some of the high-profile ways key Democrats have been handling Trump and Republicans in the early months of the administration \u2014 and how those moves could set up future presidential campaigns.",
      "Grab a slice of conservatives' pie",
      "Two days after Election Day, California Gov. Gavin Newsom convened a special legislative session that his office declared in a news release was intended to \u201csafeguard California values and fundamental rights in the face of an incoming Trump administration.\u201d And he has been vocally criticizing Trump over tariffs, asking countries to exclude California-made goods from retaliatory tariffs.",
      "But he has also been making headlines for podcast comments like saying transgender athletes\u2019 participating in women\u2019s sports is \u201cdeeply unfair,\u201d as well as for hosting former Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon on his podcast, letting Bannon\u2019s false claims about the 2020 election go unchallenged and emphasizing populist policies on which they agree.",
      "After days of criticism from the left for letting Bannon slide, Newsom responded on his podcast in an interview with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz: \u201cWe can dismiss the notion of election denialism, we can completely dismiss what he did on Jan. 6, but I don\u2019t think you can dismiss what he\u2019s saying \u2014 reminds me a lot of what Bernie Sanders was saying, reminds me a lot of what Democrats said 20, 30 years ago.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania has prompted unfounded speculation that he could consider switching parties, a possibility he has forcefully shot down. But he has notably broken from his party with his ardent support for Israel in its war against Hamas in Gaza, he met with Trump at his Florida home, and he was among the dozen Senate Democrats who backed a high-profile federal law requiring Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain undocumented immigrants who have been arrested or convicted or who face certain charges locally.",
      "Colorado Gov. Jared Polis has been a trickier case. He was among the few Democrats who sang the praises of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., extolling his work in having \u201chelped us defeat vaccine mandates in Colorado\u201d \u2014 before he later posted in support of getting vaccinated.",
      "But while Polis said in his State of the State address in January that he hoped to work with Trump on securing the border, he warned against \u201cefforts to deport American citizens, to target those on pending legal status, to break up families,\u201d and he has since pressed the administration over the detention of an undocumented immigration and labor activist in the state.",
      "He has also been a vocal critic of Trump\u2019s tariffs, taking a shot at another potential Democratic candidate, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, over the issue.",
      "Resist Trump at all costs",
      "Some Democrats are fashioning themselves as the tip of the spear in the Democratic Resistance 2.0 against Trump, in and outside Washington. While some aren\u2019t necessarily seen as surefire potential presidential candidates, their attempts to step into the party\u2019s leadership vacuum are garnering notice.",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has spent much of his political career positioning himself as a potential Trump foil. Now, he has repeatedly invoked Nazi Germany as he launches broadsides against Trump, and he has also been fiercely critical of billionaire Elon Musk. Pritzker also blocked anyone who took part in the 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol from working in state jobs.",
      "Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut is taking a similar tack: He has spent almost $1.9 million this year on Meta ads alone (more than twice the amount he spent from the middle of 2019 through 2024), largely attacking Trump, all while he has been front and center in the Senate and in news interviews warning that Trump is a threat to American democracy.",
      "Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, who ran for president in 2020, gave deflated Democrats an emotional boost with his record-breaking 25-hour floor speech that excoriated Trump and his policies.",
      "Walz, who had second billing on the ticket that lost to Trump last fall, has made direct broadsides at Trump a centerpiece of his message since he has re-entered the national political fray. He has held town halls in Republican districts in states like Iowa and Wisconsin, and he has criticized Trump as an \u201carsonist,\u201d a \u201ccaricature that had a reality TV show that pretended like he knew how to run a business\u201d and the \u201cworst possible business executive\u201d in a recent appearance on MSNBC.",
      "Then there\u2019s Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who has for years been lionized among progressives who see her as an heir-apparent to Sanders\u2019 political movement. The 2028 presidential election will be the first in which Ocasio-Cortez, 35, will be old enough to run for president, and she has been barnstorming the country with Sanders, I-Vt., in recent weeks. She has also been spending heavily on social media to get her message out. But it\u2019s unclear whether she would take such a big swing to try to jump to national office.",
      "Head down and govern",
      "Yet another group of Democrats are threading the needle between expressing outright support for Trump or joining The Resistance 2.0, evaluating their approach to him case by case while still sending a message of willingness for bipartisan collaboration.",
      "Whitmer, the governor of Michigan, has joined several of her fellow Democratic governors in seeking to strike a balance, saying in a speech in Washington on Wednesday, \u201cMy oath to the people of Michigan is to continue to show up ... no matter who is at the other side of the table.\u201d",
      "Whitmer made the remarks hours before she met with Trump at the White House for the second time in less than a month and stood by in the Oval Office while he signed executive orders targeting his political critics. Whitmer\u2019s presence drew swift condemnation from some fellow Democrats, while her spokesperson was quick to make it clear that she wasn\u2019t aware the executive orders would be signed while she was there and that her presence in the Oval Office was \u201cnot an endorsement of the actions taken or statements made at that event.\u201d",
      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who has been very critical of Trump's tariffs, is also performing a balancing act in approaching the Trump administration, telling HBO\u2019s Bill Maher in an interview this month, \u201cI think it is a false choice to suggest you need either/or \u2014 either you need that resistance, that fight, that opposition, or you need to find ways to compromise and come together.\u201d",
      "In a budget address to state lawmakers last month, Shapiro announced his intention to work with Republicans when he can: \u201cFolks in this building have been talking about cutting taxes for years. But here I am, a Democratic governor with an aggressive plan to cut taxes, ready to work with you to get it done.\u201d",
      "Days later, Shapiro invoked his \u201cjob as governor to protect Pennsylvania\u2019s interests\u201d when his administration sued the Trump administration after it halted federal funds that had previously been committed to the state.",
      "While Shapiro and Whitmer, Democratic governors of states Trump won last year, navigate the tightrope of working with Trump on some issues and working against him on others, other Democrats who govern in states Vice President Kamala Harris won by double digits aren\u2019t heeding their optimistic calls to work alongside the new administration.",
      "In his State of the State address this year, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said that he hoped to \u201cwork together [with the new presidential administration] to make progress for Maryland\u201d but that \u201cif the policy decisions of these past few weeks are any preview, I fear that our most charitable expectations will be met with harsh realities.\u201d",
      "Since then, Moore has been at odds with the Trump administration over tariffs, the imperiled future of the FBI headquarters\u2019 move to Maryland and Trump\u2019s executive order targeting the Smithsonian Institution, which Trump said was influenced by \u201ca divisive, race-centered ideology.\u201d",
      "\u201cLoving your country does not mean lying about its history,\u201d Moore, Maryland\u2019s first Black governor, told CNN. \u201cLoving your country does not mean dismantling those who have helped to make this country so powerful.\u201d",
      "Charting their own paths",
      "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear delivered his State of the Commonwealth address in early January, days before Trump\u2019s inauguration \u2014 and didn\u2019t mention him at all, instead arguing that the state has \u201cmade progress by pushing out that national noise, by working together.\u201d",
      "But Beshear has since waded into criticism of Trump not just on tariffs but more broadly, too.",
      "\u201cHis policies are going to specifically hurt my people. Tariff policy is going to hit Kentucky harder than just about anywhere else,\u201d he said last month on an episode of the liberal podcast \u201cPod Save America.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople should be alarmed in the very least that we have a president who apparently does not believe in his oath of office and doesn\u2019t value the fact the Constitution only makes him one branch of government.\u201d",
      "Rep. Ro Khanna of California, who for years has been seen as a possible presidential hopeful, spent last summer touring steel and coal towns trying to connect with rural workers. Khanna has spent recent months laying out a road map for Democrats that includes grounding the party in prioritizing workers while keeping up the pressure on Trump and not demonizing those \u201cwho have differing viewpoints on social or cultural issues.\u201d",
      "Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg made some veiled criticism of Trump in a Substack post explaining his decision not to run for the Senate or governor in Michigan in 2026, clearing the way for him to pursue another presidential campaign in 2028.",
      "But after The Atlantic revealed that senior Trump administration officials used a Signal chat to discuss planned strikes against Houthi rebels, Buttigieg has been more direct.",
      "\u201cFrom an operational security perspective, this is the highest level of f--- up imaginable. These people cannot keep America safe,\u201d Buttigieg, a former Naval Reserve intelligence officer, wrote on X."

      "Bondi\u00a0said\u00a0Villatoro Santos\u00a0had taken\u00a0part in \u201cvery violent crimes, anything you can associate with MS-13. He was the leader over it \u2014 all of the violent crimes.\u201d",

      "SANTA MONICA, Calif. \u2014 A jury on Thursday found that rapper Soulja Boy was liable for sexually assaulting and physically and emotionally abusing a former assistant, awarding the woman more than $4 million in damages.",
      "The decision from the Los Angeles County jurors came after a three-week trial in Santa Monica, California.",
      "The 34-year-old Soulja Boy, whose legal name is DeAndre Cortez Way, was found liable for assault, sexual battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Jurors did not find him liable for false imprisonment and other allegations. They found the woman should get about $4 million in compensatory damages and another $250,000 in punitive damages.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s verdict is just the beginning of justice for Soulja Boy\u2019s victims, and other victims in the music industry,\u201d plaintiff\u2019s attorney Neama Rahmani said in a statement.",
      "Lead defense attorney Rickey Ivie said in his own statement: \u201cWe maintain that the evidence does not support the verdict. It is unfortunate that aspersions and misperceptions of a culture were allowed to influence the trial. Mr. Way fully intends to pursue his post-trial remedies and to fight for a just result in this case.\u201d",
      "The woman was not identified by name in the lawsuit she filed in 2021.",
      "She said she began working for Soulja Boy in 2018, and he agreed to pay her $500 a week for cleaning his house, cooking for him and doing other personal tasks. But she says she was never paid.",
      "The two began a romantic relationship, and soon after he began abusing her, raping her, kicking her, punching her and threatening her with violence and death, her lawsuit alleges.",
      "She believed she was in love with him, and he manipulated her into staying until 2020 despite repeated acts of violence, the lawsuit says.",
      "She was beaten and raped again when she returned to retrieve her things months after leaving him, the lawsuit says.",
      "The Chicago hip-hop artist is best known for his 2007 single \u201cCrank That (Soulja Boy),\u201d which went to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and brought him a Grammy nomination for best rap song."

      "On April 10, \"Celebrity Big Brother U.K.\" and ITV, the British network on which it airs, released a clip of the most recent episode in which the incidents occurred. In it, Rourke is heard making comments about Siwa in the backyard, including suggesting he could change the 21-year-old performer's sexuality.",
      "ITV did not immediately respond to TODAY.com's request for comment. A representative for Siwa did not return TODAY.com\u2019s request for comment either, nor did Rourke\u2019s team.",
      "The first of the exchanges began when the 72-year-old actor asked Siwa if she was attracted to boys or girls.",
      "\u201cGirls. My partner is non-binary,\u201d responded Siwa, who \u2014 according to E! News \u2014 is currently dating Kath Ebbs, an Australian influencer",
      "Rourke then replied, \u201cIf I stay longer than four days, you won\u2019t be gay anymore.\u201d",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s homophobic, if that was your reasoning,\u201d Siwa said as she sat nearby.",

      "Moments later, Rourke shouted, \u201cI need a f\u2014!\u201d before gesturing toward Siwa and adding, \u201cI\u2019m not talking to you.\u201d",
      "Once again, Hughes stepped in, repeating, \u201cMickey, you can\u2019t say that.\u201d",
      "After Rourke left the backyard, Siwa told Hughes, \"It's crazy to me that that still exists.\" She then became visibly upset by the exchange and began to cry. Hughes comforted her. Inside, Rourke was summoned to the diary room.",
      "There, the voice of \"Big Brother\" addressed Rourke's behavior, according to ITV\u2019s summary of the episode.",
      "\u201cMickey, before you entered the Big Brother house, the rules regarding unacceptable language and behavior were explained to you,\u201d a voice told him. His remarks were read back, and he was asked, \u201cDo you understand how this language could be offensive to your housemates or the viewing public?\u201d",
      "Rourke replied, \u201cYes, I do. It\u2019s some serious stuff.\u201d",

      "\u201cYes,\u201d Rourke responded. \u201cI apologize. I don\u2019t have dishonorable intentions \u2014 I\u2019m just talking smack, you know. I wasn\u2019t taking it all so serious. I didn\u2019t mean any bad intentions, and if I did, sorry.\u201d",
      "Later, Rourke addressed the group and offered an apology directly to Siwa.",
      "\u201cI want to apologize. I\u2019ve got a habit of having a short fuse, and I don\u2019t mean nothing by it,\u201d he said.",
      "During a later conversation involving Rourke, Siwa and castmate Danny Beard, the winner of season four of \"RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK,\" Rourke asked whether the term \u201cdrag\u201d was still appropriate to use.",
      "Siwa responded saying, \u201cAnything is OK to say in context and intention\u2026 and if you say something wrong but you didn\u2019t know and you\u2019re open to hearing, it\u2019s all good.\u201d",

      "\u201cHe said some pretty hurtful things,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think one thing you really have to do in the Big Brother house is care about others. Him saying that flat out today, honestly, made the killer nomination choice pretty easy.\u201d",
      "Siwa continued, \u201cI feel like a lot of the public isn\u2019t going to be too happy with Mickey after seeing how this day went. So I do think it\u2019s possible that he could be evicted from the house.\u201d"

      "Titled \u201cToo Hurty Without It,\u201d Episode 5 puts the spotlight on Natalia Grace \u2014 portrayed by 27-year-old British actor Imogen Faith Reed \u2014 after her adoptive parents, Michael and Kristine Barnett, move and leave her on her own in a small apartment.",
      "The episode, creator and co-showrunner Katie Robbins tells TODAY.com, was meant to make viewers question \u201ceverything they\u2019ve seen before and their assumptions that they\u2019ve made\u201d surrounding Natalia and her circumstances.",
      "\u201cGood American Family\u201d is a fictionalization of Grace\u2019s true story. Born in Ukraine with a rare form of dwarfism, Grace was adopted by a New Hampshire couple in 2008, before they put her up for re-adoption in 2010, according to a 2021 document from the Court of Appeals in Indiana obtained by TODAY.com.",
      "Grace was then adopted by Michael and Christine Barnett, who began to suspect that she was not a little girl, but a grown adult who was trying to kill them. According to the Court of Appeals document, Grace's Ukrainian adoption paperwork stated she was born in 2003.",
      "The couple had Grace medically and psychologically tested, before they successfully had a court order to change her birth year from 2003 to 1989, \u201cbased on age estimates provided by a primary care physician and social worker,\u201d per the document from the Indiana Court of Appeals.",
      "Grace has maintained that she was a child at the time of her adoption, and that Kristine Barnett told her to say she was older. \u201cI was terrified of her. I was terrified, so when Kristine told me to tell people that I was 22, I listened because I didn\u2019t know what she would have me do. I didn\u2019t know what she would do to me,\u201d Grace says in the documentary \"The Curious Case of Natalia Grace.\"",
      "\u201cShe threatened me into telling people lies. At first I said, \u2018No, I\u2019m a kid,\u2019 and I guess she just got so mad,\" she continued.",
      "According to a 2019 affidavit filed in the Tippecanoe Court in Indiana obtained by\u00a0TODAY.com, a doctor at Peyton Manning Children\u2019s Hospital examined Grace and determined her age was about 8. A skeletal examination of Grace found she was 11 years old in 2012, per the affidavit.",
      "The document from the Indiana Court of Appeals also states that in 2013, the Barnetts did in fact move Grace into two apartments in Indiana and helped her get federal disability benefits and supportive services to help her \u201cas an adult.\u201d The couple then relocated to Canada with their three biological children.",
      "This is where Episode 5 starts. Prior to that, \u201cGood American Family\u201d was told from Kristine Barnett (Ellen Pompeo) and Michael Barnett\u2019s (Mark Duplass) perspective, depicting Natalia as a sinister adult pretending to be a child.",
      "The latest episode details Natalia living on her own without her walker. She struggles with everyday tasks like turning on the shower and getting into the bathtub, which makes her unable to bathe herself. Because of her small stature, she isn't able to reach the top cabinets in the kitchen and finds it difficult to make herself a meal. She is seen spending her days in front of the television, eating junk food as the apartment becomes a mess.",
      "All alone, at one point, she accidentally cuts her hand trying to open a can of food.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Natalia says, as her hand is covered in blood. \u201cMommy, please mommy. I don\u2019t know how to take care of this.\u201d",
      "She seeks help from a neighbor, who confuses her for a child, but Natalia tells her she's an adult who looks young.",
      "\u201cI remember reading the script and thinking, \u2018OK, this is going to be a big episode for me,\u201d Reid tells TODAY.com. \u201cIt was a little daunting because it\u2019s just me and long hours on set.\u201d",
      "The episode, Robbins tells TODAY.com, is the first time Natalia is seen on screen by herself.",
      "\u201cOne might not realize it watching the first four episodes, but in those first four episodes, you\u2019re never in a scene only with\u00a0Natalia. She can only be in a scene if she\u2019s in a scene with Kristine or Michael, because those episodes are from their perspective,\u201d Robbins says. \u201cSo by the time you get to (Episode) 5 and you\u2019re on the other side of that door, it\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve been in a room alone with her.\u201d",
      "As the episode continues, viewers see Natalia getting into trouble after she and the neighbor\u2019s grandson take the bus and get lost while attempting to go to the Barnetts\u2019 home.",
      "She is treated poorly by adoptive parents, who after the incident have to move her to a new apartment, which happens to be on the second floor and even smaller. The hardships continue for Natalia, who feels abandoned, yet attempts to \u201cstraighten up\u201d to earn her family\u2019s love.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden you have to say, \u2018Oh my gosh, all these things that have come to believe about her, were they true, or were they not true?'\u201d",
      "Katie Robbins",
      "'\u201cAll of a sudden you have to say, \u2018Oh my gosh, all these things that have come to believe about her, were they true, or were they not true?'\u201d Robbins says. \u201cAnd that episode was incredibly emotional to write, and it was incredibly emotional to film.\u201d",
      "Robbins says that watching Reid film her solo scenes was incredibly emotional for everyone on set.",
      "\u201cWatching (Imogen) play those scenes, people on our crew, people who have been doing this job for decades and who have seen it all, seasoned pros, were crying watching her because of the vulnerability that she brings and because of the themes that it deals with,\u201d Robbins adds.",
      "Reid tells TODAY.com that the fifth episode does \u201csuch an amazing job\u201d of showing her character\u2019s point of view.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s just been abandoned, and she's not only 8 years old, but she has a disability, and it\u2019s just so heartbreaking to see her go through all of that,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd for her, to just get worse and worse as we go on, because (she) can\u2019t look after herself, Episode 5 is something that I\u2019m genuinely so proud of.\u201d",
      "Viewers will continue to see life from Natalia\u2019s perspective when Episode 6 of \u201cGood American Family\u201d premieres Wednesday, April 16."

      "\u201cAt the moment, all of our products are currently made in the U.S., so we don\u2019t anticipate tariffs affecting us directly,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as we look at the larger context of how this is going to affect the consumer day to day, I\u2019m very grateful that in part of the conception of this brand, I wanted to create products that look more prestige, but are more accessible and affordable. I think during any time of recession, people still want to find creature comforts, items that can bring them joy.\u201d",
      "I was one of the lucky souls to be able to secure a jar of her Raspberry Spread\u00a0 \u2014 which retails for $9, or $15 with a keepsake box \u2014 which the brand says is \u201cwhere it all began.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also the spread that everyone seems to be talking about online, from Instagram to TikTok, so I was eager to try it.",
      "First thing\u2019s first: This isn\u2019t jam.",
      "Months ago, every celebrity from\u00a0Chrissy Teigen\u00a0to \u201cReal Housewives of Beverly Hills\u201d star Garcelle Beauvais gabbed about the royal\u2019s \u201cjam,\u201d but Meghan actually\u00a0sent 50 jars of strawberry\u00a0spread\u00a0labeled with brand\u2019s old name \u2014\u00a0American Riviera Orchard\u00a0\u2014 and nothing about its contents. We\u2019ve been jam-boozled by the glitterati.",
      "With all that in mind, I was assuming a thick texture when I opened the jar and almost spilled it all over myself. The confusion is widespread \u2014 and valid! \u2014 as fruit cooked with sugar goes by a bevy of names: jam, jelly, chutney, marmalade and more.",
      "This raspberry spread has pectin in it, like jam typically does, but it isn\u2019t like the jam you find on store shelves.",
      "To compare, Bonne Maman\u2019s Raspberry Preserves \u2014\u00a0also not jam \u2014 has similar ingredients, including pectin, but is much thicker. I would call this a syrup, compote or coulis. Meghan is calling it \u201cspread,\u201d though \u2014 so spread it is!",
      "Tastewise, I found it fresh and bright. The raspberry sweetness gives way to a lemony tartness I found really refreshing paired with whipped cream cheese on an English muffin. The consistency, though surprising at first, gives it a homemade feel, as does the ratio of raspberry to lemon. It tasted like a sunny day, even though it\u2019s overcast as I stare out my window.",
      "I don\u2019t think the spread would work on a closed sandwich, though: It would likely sploosh out of a peanut butter and jelly \u2014 er, spread \u2014 leaving your hands a sticky mess. On the other hand, I suspect this spread would go fabulously in a crepe \u2014 which is probably a reason the brand sells mix for that, too \u2014 or poured over pancakes.",
      "I was pleasantly surprised by how different this product and the others I\u2019ve tried are from that of competitors in the market. Last night, I tried the Herbal Peppermint Tea and it was so minty, I felt like I was drinking a pack of liquid Altoids \u2014 an unexpected feeling, but not a bad one.",
      "I\u2019m excited to try more products from Meghan\u2019s brand as it expands \u2014 but only if I can get my hands on them fast enough."

      "Noah Wyle says he's \"profoundly sad and disappointed\" about a legal action alleging the Max hit \"The Pitt\" is an unsanctioned revival of \"ER,\" 16 years after the legendary NBC drama ended its run.",
      "Wyle, a cast member of both shows and an executive producer on \"The Pitt,\" spoke to Variety about his reaction to the lawsuit filed by the estate of late author and executive producer Michael Crichton, who wrote the screenplay for what became the pilot episode of \"ER.\"",
      "\u201cThe only thing that I can legally speak to is how I feel emotionally, which is just profoundly sad and disappointed,\" Wyle said. \"This taints the legacy, and it shouldn\u2019t have. At one point, this could have been a partnership. And when it wasn\u2019t a partnership, it didn\u2019t need to turn acrimonious. But on the 30th anniversary of \u2018ER,\u2019 I\u2019ve never felt less celebratory of that achievement than I do this year.\u201d",
      "Crichton's estate, which includes his widow, Sherri Crichton, filed a lawsuit in August 2024 accusing the creators of \"The Pitt\" of breach of contract and two other counts. Wyle, former \"ER\" producer R. Scott Gemmill and executive producer John Wells were among the named defendants. Gemmill created \"The Pitt,\" and Wells is an executive producer on the show along with Wyle.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Sherri Crichton's attorney for comment and has not yet heard back.",
      "Wyle, 53, played Dr. John Carter, a young hotshot doctor, on \u201cER,\u201d and portrays Dr. Michael \u201cRobby\u201d Robinavitch, a grizzled veteran of the emergency room at a Pittsburgh hospital, in \u201cThe Pitt.\"",

      "The defendants started work on an \"ER\" reboot in 2020 with plans for it to air on HBO Max, according to the complaint. The lawsuit alleges the defendants did this \"without any notice\" to Sherri Crichton and with \"brazen disregard\" of contractual rights of Michael Crichton's estate, according to the complaint.",
      "The creators of \u201cThe Pitt\u201d argued that making the show was a \u201cconstitutionally protected act of free speech,\u201d according to a\u00a0ruling by the Superior Court of California in February.",
      "Wyle told Variety that he and \u201cThe Pitt\u201d creators purposefully set out to do a different show after the negotiations with Crichton's estate over an \u201cER\u201d revival fell apart.",
      "\u201cWe pivoted as far in the opposite direction as we could in order to tell the story we wanted to tell \u2014\u202fand not for litigious reasons, but because we didn\u2019t want to retread our own creative work,\u201d Wyle said.",

      "Wyle told Variety that an \"ER\" reboot \"got pretty close to being a reality,\" but Warner Bros. Television could not come to an agreement with Sherri Crichton, who oversees her late husband's estate.",
      "The complaint alleges that the creators of \u201cThe Pitt\u201d shared with Sherri Crichton in 2022 that they had been developing an \u201cER\u201d reboot. She refused to give consent for the planned reboot after negotiations stalled, according to the lawsuit.",

      "Brandon Sklenar has been steadily making it to the top of movie credits, but not with the name he had growing up.",
      "In a recent interview with People, the \u201c1923\u201d actor revealed that the name fans know him by isn\u2019t the one he had as a child in his New Jersey hometown. The 34-year-old was born Brandon Feakins \u2014 a name passed down from his father, Bruce Feakins. His professional name, Sklenar, comes from his mother, Francine.",
      "\u201cI took it because growing up, everyone would always mispronounce my last name,\u201d he explained.\u201dAnd it drove me absolutely crazy.\u201d",
      "Instead of a random stage moniker, the actor said he settled on something that had more personal meaning.",
      "\u201cSo I also didn\u2019t want to pick something completely arbitrary that meant nothing,\u201d he added. \u201cSo I took my mother\u2019s maiden name because it was real.\u201d",
      "Still, the actor recognizes that his self-chosen stage name comes with some pronunciation hurdles. Some are still learning that its proper pronunciation is Skluh-NAHR.",
      "\u201cBut I could deal with that because I didn\u2019t grow up with it being mispronounced,\u201d he noted. \u201cIt was like an adult thing.\u201d",

      "The actor, who stars in the upcoming film \"Drop,\" which releases April 11, 2025, is far from the first to choose a different name as an actor. For example, \u201cPoor Little Things\u201d actor Emma Stone changed her name for the marquee from Emily Stone in order to register with SAG-AFTRA. Ariana Grande only recently chose to have her real name reflected on-screen with Ariana Grande-Butera displayed in the \"Wicked\" credits. And legend Michael Caine was born Maurice Joseph Micklewhite but settled on the name we know early in his career, according to Vanity Fair."

      "Gaynor (Tracee Ellis Ross), a Rivermind salesperson and patient, speaks to Mike in the hospital. She says the surgery will remove the damaged part of Amanda\u2019s brain, make a backup clone of it on Rivermind\u2019s computer\u2019s mainframe and replace the tumor area with healthy tissue, allowing cognitive function to flow from the backup on the computer to her brain via the cloud.",
      "The procedure is completely free, but Amanda will need to sleep one to two hours longer at night and there will be monthly costs for what Rivermind calls \u201cstreaming.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s also a cost attached. \u201cFor the streaming, we run a subscription model,\u201d Gaynor explains. \u201cSo, it\u2019s $300 \u2014 it\u2019s $300 a month.\u201d",
      "Mike agrees to the procedure, not knowing that the cost would rise continually, plunging their already precarious financial situation into a dire one.",
      "Jones, in an interview, said she felt Mike had no choice.\u00a0\u201cWhat was she going to do? He loves me. It didn\u2019t feel like much of a choice. He was like, \u2018Wait, there\u2019s a way out of this?\u2019 fine. I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to keep the person I love alive. I think he made the right choice. He didn\u2019t know,\u201d she says.",
      "But the limits of Rivermind become apparent. First, the prices go up. So does the area where the streaming works. If they want to leave their county, they have to pay more.",
      "Then, Amanda\u2019s brain becomes a transmitter for commercials. While speaking to people, Amanda (unbeknownst to her) randomly spouts out an ad poorly tailored to the conversation topic. This puts her job in jeopardy.",
      "The couple finds themselves in bind after bind. They can barely afford Rivermind Common but they need Rivermind Plus so Amanda can keep her job. To make money, Mike secretly joins a dark web site called Dum Dummies \u2014 where you participate in gross, cruel and unhealthy challenges to get money.",
      "Unable to keep upgrading, Amanda\u2019s quality of life completely deteriorates. She has to sleep 12 hours a day and more to \u201cgive back to the grid.\u201d Even after that, she\u2019s never truly rested.",
      "For their anniversary, Mike saves up to gift Amanda 12 hours of Rivermind Lux, which comes with an app where she can dial up or down settings like relaxation, pleasure and even change her skills if she wants to borrow certain attributes from another Rivermind user (like tennis or parkour, for example). But soon, she\u2019s plunged back to her old, terrible existence.",
      "Things keep getting worse \u2014 they lose their income. Mike is fired after after a coworker finds him on Dum Dummies and exposes him to the whole workplace, and Mike initiates a fight.",
      "With no other options, they try to plead their case to Gaynor at Rivermind, saying they are loyal customers. But Gaynor tells them there is nothing she can do. Mike mentions there\u2019s still a little bit of their baby money they could use. Gaynor\u2019s only response to this is that pregnancy costs $90 more a month as pregnancy is a lot for one\u2019s brain to process \u2014 shutting out their long dream of having a child.",

      "Another year goes by and Amanda and Mike are physically different. Both look weaker and more tired. Amanda, constantly sleeping, has lost hair and struggles to move without Mike\u2019s help. Mike is missing a tooth (implying he pulled it out for Dum Dummies) and looks thinner.",
      "They\u2019ve lost all hope in life, which is apparent when Mike sells their crib to a young couple (who want to set it on fire for a music video, not actually use it).",
      "Fast forward to their anniversary once again. While in full health, the couple would always take a romantic getaway to the Juniper Lodge. But they can no longer afford that. Instead, Mike asks Amanda if she would sit in the backyard with him. There, he presents her with the best gift he can: a 30-minute booster pack to Rivermind Lux.",
      "Amanda asks Mike how he could afford it, revealing that she now knows about Dum Dummies and seemingly doesn\u2019t approve. Mike reassures her that it wasn\u2019t another tooth thing, instead a \u201cprivate buyer\u201d had a \u201cspecialist thing\u201d (which is also sinister).",
      "Using the Rivermind Lux booster pack, Mike slides her \u201cserenity\u201d up to the maximum setting. Amanda, although still physically sick, looks much more at peace.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s time,\u201d Amanda says. Mike begins to protest, saying they\u2019ll be \u201cOK for a little while.\u201d",
      "But Amanda calmly insists that \u201cit\u2019s time.\u201d Mike tells her \u201conly if you\u2019re sure.\u201d She is. He kisses her hand, causing her to breathe a sigh of relief.",
      "\u201cDo it when I\u2019m not here,\u201d she asks, which he nods to before collapsing onto her shoulder in a fit of sobs.",
      "The second Rivermind Lux ends, Amanda begins yet another ad (this time for antidepressants), revealing one of two things: Rivermind Plus now has ads too or, as the title suggests, they are \u201ccommon people\u201d and needed to downgrade to Rivermind Common.",
      "As she continues her ad, Mike fulfills her final wish by suffocating her with a pillow. He whispers to her that it's OK as she continues her ad underneath the pillow until she dies.",
      "Mike leaves his wife\u2019s dead body to enter a room where Dum Dummies is livestreaming. All he brings is a box cutter knife, closing the door behind him.",
      "This ending implies that a depressed Mike has decided to take his own life on livestream.",
      "What Jones and Ross make of the ending",
      "Jones says the ending is meant to show how desperate things become for Mike and Amanda, and why they felt this was their only option.",
      "\u201cThe episode intentionally covers a really long passage of time. I think that\u2019s on purpose. This is not a six month frivolous decision. Oh, this is uncomfortable. I don\u2019t want to live like this. It\u2019s years and years of strain financially, physically and emotionally on the two of them,\u201d she says.",
      "Jones approves of what Mike did on an ethical level. \"I do believe that everybody should have some say in the way they die. She clearly wanted that for him and wanted that for herself. She made that really clear,\" she says.",
      "Ultimately, she feels Amanda had \u201cno choice.\u201d Ross agrees, saying there was \u201cno way out\" for Amanda.",
      "\u201cIt got tighter and tighter and smaller and smaller. To the point that the choice that is made feels like the loving choice,\u201d she says.",
      "She feels Gaynor was similarly trapped. \u201cI think she\u2019s doing her job and she also was sadly perpetuating a cycle that she was also a part of. She\u2019s a Riverminder \u2014 and not just because she works there. Maybe this is how she has to pay off her bills. Maybe this is what she did to sign up \u2014 her husband signed her up to be a part of selling so that she could stay alive,\" she says.",
      "Part of what the episode left her with, Ross says, is that technology is the \u201cfast choice\u201d \u2014 but we don\u2019t always think about \u201cwhat the experience will be on the long end.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what this episode and so many \u2018Black Mirror\u2019 episodes beg to ask of the audience. To ask those questions before you\u2019re in the position where you don\u2019t have a chance to ponder and to dialogue.\u201d",
      "But, Jones says, the impetus is on the people who develop technology to be asking these questions.",
      "\u201cI wish there was an ethical board,\u201d Ross says.",
      "\u201cWhatever the Hippocratic oath \u2014 there should be an Einstein oath. All people in tech agree on this one thing,\u201d Jones says."

      "Beyond that? \"He's wonderful at just making you feel comfortable. And as an actor, directing an actor, there\u2019s a level of empathy there that I haven\u2019t experienced before. So I feel just so grateful that I had that opportunity.\"",
      "On getting 'headbutted' by a goat",

      "\"The others had an opportunity to work with the goats. I, sadly, only got to sort of wave to them from afar, but they're so cute,\" she says.",
      "Perhaps it was for the best because according to the \"Severance\" actor, her past experience with the animals hasn't always been great.",
      "\"I did once, in a very old movie, get headbutted by a goat. That wasn't on film, but I have worked with goats before and they can be quite diva-ish.\""

      "Kenan Thompson, the longest-standing cast member of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d is detailing the symptoms that finally led to his chronic health diagnosis.",
      "Thompson, 46, told Entertainment Weekly in an interview published April 4 that he was diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) after about a decade of experiencing acid reflux.",
      "GERD is a condition where stomach acid flows backward from the stomach through the esophagus, irritating the lining, according to the Mayo Clinic. Though acid reflux is fairly common, the Mayo Clinic notes that GERD is a result of untreated acid reflux happening over time.",
      "\u201cIt was highly uncomfortable and it definitely started to affect my work in certain ways,\u201d Thompson told the outlet.",
      "He continued, \u201cIf you\u2019re not sleeping well or not able to do your job, that can bring on sadnesses. I\u2019m not necessarily prone to depression, but I can see how those things can be triggers.\"",
      "Thompson noted his symptoms began to impede his ability to use his voice while performing on \u201cSNL.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden I was hoarse or I was raspy. That\u2019s not good when you\u2019re supposed to be speaking to the back of the house,\u201d he said about having to regularly speak to a live audience.",
      "\u201cI sing the warm-up before the show actually comes on, and that\u2019s kind of my major gauge, whether or not I can talk normally afterwards. And that\u2019s when I know if I\u2019m in my better health zone or not,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere were some cold opens where I was very raspy and hoarse and voice crackly because I had just finished singing and my throat hadn\u2019t had a chance to calm down yet, but we had to go right into the show.\u201d",
      "Thompson said he wanted to find a \u201cserious kind of solution\u201d for his issue and was eventually prescribed medication by his doctor to address it.",
      "Thompson is now a spokesperson for Phathom Pharmaceuticals and appeared on TODAY to talk about finding a medication that's finally given him relief. \"I was suffering from, you know, pretty intense like acid reflux and heartburn and stuff like that. I ended up being diagnosed with GERD,\" Thompson said on April 7.",
      "\"I was given a prescription that worked for me, and, you know, (I'm) trying to spread the message, basically, because it is a very uncomfortable situation. I just want people to get the help that they need if they need it.\"",
      "The Mayo Clinic reports that most people can manage GERD symptoms with lifestyle adjustments and medication. In some rare cases, however, surgery is required.",
      "During his interview with Entertainment Weekly, Thompson, who has been on \u201cSNL\u201d for 22 seasons, answered the question that's been on fans' minds since he broke the\u00a0record for the longest-tenured cast\u00a0member: Has he considered leaving the show?",
      "\u201cIt would be cool if I never left the show,\" Thompson said. \"That\u2019d be crazy.\u201d",
      "The comedian joined \u201cSNL\u201d in 2003 at 25 and currently holds the record for longest-standing cast member, surpassing Darrell Hammond\u2019s previously held record of 14 seasons.",
      "Along with performing as part of the \u201cSNL\u201d 50th anniversary special this year, the show has catapulted Thompson into stardom. He\u2019s been nominated six times for Emmy Awards for his work on the show. Thompson has also appeared in several films and television shows, including starring in \u201cKenan,\u201d his own sitcom on NBC.",
      "\u201cI guess the only other milestone would be just to be the forever cast member. Just never leave the show,\u201d he said. \u201cThirty (seasons) is like, okay, that\u2019s just another number kind of thing. Twenty was just such a thing that nobody had ever done. People had gotten into their teens before, but nobody had gotten all the way up to 20. And then I was close to doing it.\"",
      "He continued, \u201cOnce I started getting into 17, I was like, \u2018Well, if I can, I would love to stick around till 20.\u2019 And now here we are at 22, so I don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "\u201cSNL\u201d fans have long speculated on whether the show\u2019s creator, Lorne Michaels, has plans to soon retire. When asked, Thompson provided his own intel \u2014 or lack thereof.",
      "\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Thompson said of Michael\u2019s potential retirement. \u201cI feel like we\u2019ll both just ride until the wheels fall off.\u201d"

      "Kardashian and Odom were married for four years until she filed for divorce from the former Lakers star in 2013. Odom was later found unresponsive in a brothel in 2015 after an overdose and was hospitalized on life support. Kardashian remained by his side during his recovery.",
      "In 2016, the duo ended their marriage for good when they officially got divorced. On the show, Kardashian said that she hadn\u2019t seen Odom in nine years, but she wanted to reunite with him so that she could return some of his belongings.",
      "Their face-to-face meeting, which played out over the first two episodes of Season 6, was tense. Kardashian lost her cool when Odom called her \u201cbabe.\u201d Her sisters thought she could have been kinder during the meeting.",
      "\u201cI could tell you were shut off,\u201d Kendall Jenner told Kardashian. \u201cLike, it wasn\u2019t that you were blatantly being mean or rude. It was just like \u2014 are you thinking people are going to judge the way you handle it? Or is it that you\u2019re more guarded? I don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Kendall Jenner elaborated in a confessional, saying, \u201cI think she\u2019s still holding on to a lot, I see such a hostility, still and almost like, there\u2019s definitely a wall, definitely a coldness. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s anger. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s so many reasons as to why.\u201d",
      "Kardashian responded to her sister and told her that she didn\u2019t notice she was \u201cgetting really anxious\u201d during her reunion with Odom. She explained that some \u201ctriggers\u201d happened during the event, like him showing up late and sweating.",
      "\u201cI could tell in the moment I\u2019m so guarded,\u201d Kardashian said in a confessional. \u201cI knew this man so well, and I was a secret keeper, a lover, a best friend. I was so many things, and then you\u2019re just nothing, and then to see someone \u2026 it\u2019s almost like this flood of emotions. It\u2019s so many things to process. But in that moment, I could tell I was really uncomfortable.\u201d",
      "While talking with her sisters, Kardashian explained that she might\u2019ve acted like a \u201cb---h\u201d during her reunion with Odom because she\u2019s so used to people \u201cnitpicking\u201d her small gestures and she didn\u2019t want anyone to \u201cread into this too much because it\u2019s not like that.\u201d",

      "\u201cI think what is so frustrating about all of this is that they don\u2019t really understand. I think anyone that knows my situation or that has been in that situation would be a different version of themselves this many years later. It would be foolish not to be,\u201d she said in a confessional. \u201cYou have to protect yourself and grow from that scenario. I\u2019m a different person than I was, and that\u2019s not bad or good, it just is what it is.\u201d",

      "\u201cSo what does it say on my forehead? F--king doormat?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it probably does to these people, because I have been in so many different ways, but then that gets taken advantage of.\u201d",

The very last time I saw this person was very contentious and negative. It wasn\u2019t good. So is this my best moment in life? No.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The best way to sum up the second episode of \"Black Mirror\" Season 7, \u201cB\u00eate Noire,\" is to simply look up the definition of the episode title.",
      "Merriam-Webster defines \"b\u00eate noire\" as \"a person or thing strongly detested or avoided.\" As for who the b\u00eate noire truly is? That remains in question. It would depend on which of the main characters \u2014 Maria (Siena Kelly) and Verity (Rosy McEwen) \u2014 you ask.",
      "Here's what to know about how the episode of \"Black Mirror\" ends.",
      "What is the premise of 'B\u00eate Noire'?",
      "Maria is head of flavor at Ditta, a food company that eagle-eyed fans will have noticed was one of the ads Amanda (Rashida Jones) unwillingly spewed in Episode 1.",
      "Maria excels at her job \u2014 until Verity Greene applies for a research assistant position in her department and, much to Maria's dismay, gets it.",
      "The pair went to high school together and, according to Maria, Verity was \"the school freak.\"",
      "\u201cShe was clever \u2014 like brainbox clever \u2014 to the point where she was sort of \u2018off.\u2019 Zero social skills,\u201d Maria says. \u201cShe had this mad hair. She was always scribbling like these weird little diagrams of like computers that she wanted to build.\u201d",
      "She then explains that a classmate named Natalie started a rumor that Verity was hooking up one of the school's teachers, Mr. Kendrick. Natalie created the nickname \"milkmaid\" for Verity based on the rumor and it stuck.",
      "After Verity gets the job, Maria starts to lose her grip on reality. It seems the truth keeps warping.",
      "First, it's small things, like Verity insisting that a chicken shop chain is spelled differently than how Maria remembers. When Maria Googles the place, though, the name really has changed to align with Verity's spelling.",
      "Maria is spiraling, certain that Verity is somehow behind everything that keeps going wrong. She texts Natalie for the first time in four years but doesn't get a response.",
      "The bending of reality grows more sinister. For example, Maria types out an email to Verity listing ingredients to use in a sample recipe. When there's a mishap with the recipe and Maria's original email is checked, a key ingredient is missing, making Maria look like the bad guy.",
      "Maria's colleagues turn on her and Verity seems to ascend in popularity. Is Maria paranoid or is Verity somehow sowing chaos?",
      "A call from Natalie's husband helps her find the answer. Maria learns from Natalie's husband that Natalie committed suicide a few days ago after spiraling in paranoia.",
      "Maria loses her job after a spectacular showdown with Verity involving... almond milk. Verity chugs a colleague's almond milk then blames in on Maria. When Maria says she has a nut allergy, Verity seems to somehow erase the concept of a nut allergy from the internet and people's minds.",
      "Maria is fired but she does figure something out: Verity's pendant seems to be altering reality.",
      "What does Verity's pendant do?",
      "Maria, now more than slightly unhinged, follows Verity to her home, which turns out to be a giant mansion. Maria breaks in while Verity is showering and discovers the pendant. She clicks it, but it flashes red and makes a small sound. Hearing Verity exiting the shower, Maria ducks underneath her bed, pendant in hand.",
      "Maria tries to use the pendant again, but it makes the same sound showing it won\u2019t work \u2014 but this time Verity hears it.",
      "\u201cCome out,\u201d Verity says. \u201cI will call the police.\u201d",
      "Verity then explains to Maria that the pendant is just a remote and she has plenty of them. The remote connects to a \"quantum compiler,\" which allows Verity to change reality by moving along infinite timelines.",
      "By clicking the pendant \u2014 which uses touch ID that only works for Verity \u2014 she can say whatever wish she wants to be true. Then, she is immediately transported into whatever parallel reality where whatever she's said has always been true.",
      "\"There's infinite timelines so I just pick the one where you're the only one who knows what's going on so you feel really special,\" Verity explains, adding that she built the system herself.",
      "This revelation explains why Maria has been spiraling and how the cameras and her email wording inexplicably changed.",
      "It also gives new meaning to Verity's name, which means \"the quality or state of being true or real,\" according to Merriam-Webster.",
      "\"I don't care if you understand it,\" Verity says to a baffled Maria. \"I'm doing it to hurt you. That's the main thing.\"",
      "What is Verity\u2019s problem with Maria?",

      "Maria claims she doesn't know why Verity would want to hurt her. Verity doubts this. Verity reveals that Natalie told her it was Maria who started the rumor.",
      "Maria finally admits she did start the rumor, but that Natalie amplified it. Clearly hurt, Verity says she was \"stuck there\" with everyone calling her mad, unable to fight back.",
      "What happens in the end?",
      "Now, Verity is determined to make Maria take her own life like she did Natalie. Maria fights back and Verity matches her intensity. Verity gets hold of the pendant and uses it to have armed cops immediately arrive to arrest Maria for breaking in with a knife (which materializes into Maria\u2019s hand).",
      "A second later, cops with guns arrive, directing Maria to drop her knife. She does, but as one police officer approaches her to put the handcuffs on her, Maria grabs his gun and shoots Verity in the head, killing her.",
      "She then has a shoot-out with the police, but in the chaos is able to grab the pendant, placing Verity\u2019s dead finger on it.",
      "\u201cThe pendant works for me. The pendant works for me!\u201d Maria desperately yells. Then she starts to bend reality, saying, \u201cShe shot herself. It wasn\u2019t me. You saw the whole thing.\u201d",
      "The police immediately agree that that\u2019s the truth of what happened, lowering their weapons. The police then ask Maria to come down to the station to answer some questions, but Maria \u2014 pressing the pendant again \u2014 tells them they won\u2019t need to do that.",
      "\u201cYou work for me,\u201d she says. \u201cBoth of you.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou worship me,\u201d she adds. \u201cBecause I am \u2014 I am the Empress of the Universe.\u201d",
      "The shot then transitions into both cops on their knees, saying \u201cHail Maria,\u201d as Maria stands in front of a cheering crowd of thousands of people chanting the same thing.",
      "The final shot is her smiling at the new life and power she has all for herself.",
      "Will she let the power corrupt her as it seemed to do for Verity? You'll have to use your imagination."

      "SO\u2019OUD ATEN, Egypt \u2014 It\u2019s a familiar story: The whim of a leader upends citizens\u2019 lives\u00a0and leads them into the wilderness.",
      "In ancient Egypt, Pharaoh Akhenaten was no different. Determined that his population should stop from worshipping multiple gods, more than 3,300 years ago he told residents to seal up their homes and workshops in the city of So\u2019oud Aten with mud and clay bricks and move to a new home, a leading Egyptologist, Zawi Hawass, told NBC News last month.",
      "\u201cWhen the king makes a decision, everyone has to obey the decision,\u201d Hawass said. \u201cThis is the pharaoh.\u201d",
      "So quick was their exodus that many left behind an array of items including jewelry, pottery, children's shoes and toys, as well as a pizza peel similar to those used to make bread by their modern day descendants \u2014 a treasure trove that is now being recovered by archeologists.\u00a0NBC News was given exclusive access to the latest findings.",
      "Learn more about this story on \u201cTODAY\u201d this morning at 7 a.m. ET.",
      "But much is still a mystery in a city that was only discovered four years ago by archeologists searching for a mortuary temple where animal skeletons were arranged for religious rights. Egyptologists may never figure out why a fish was covered in gold.",
      "\u201cNobody really can explain it,\u201d Hawass said, adding that around 500 statues of the Sekhmet, the goddess of healing, have also been found at the site, which he has dubbed the \u201clost golden city,\u201d in part because it thrived during Egypt\u2019s golden age.",
      "Today it is a sleepy patch of desert, surrounded by a metal fence, and a dusty road. Archeologists work in the blazing sun at the site where an artificial lake with boat moorings was recently unearthed, likely created to deliver and dispatch goods to the Nile.",
      "Its location though is hugely significant. Situated near Luxor, an ancient city in central Egypt, it is surrounded by historical monuments, including the Colossi of Memnon, the Madinat Habu Temple and the Ramesseum. During the 18th dynasty, this was royal Egypt.",
      "Hawass, who served as Egypt\u2019s minister for antiquities, said that So\u2019oud Aten provides important information about the high standard of living for artisans and craftsmen as well as \u201cthe daily life of the people,\u201d who were so well off that archeologists \u201cfound many showers inside the houses,\u201d he said.",
      "In the past few months Hawass said a set of administrative buildings akin to a police station or town hall have also been uncovered.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a snapshot in time,\u201d said Salima Ikram, a professor of Egyptology at the American University of Cairo.",
      "Workmen just laid down their tools, she said, adding, \u201cTheir stuff is lying around. They\u2019re in the middle of making, you know, pegging out a cow hide. They\u2019re cutting out sandals, and suddenly, all of this.\u201d",
      "Another recent discovery, a sun image etched onto the wall of a room in the district of the city where spinning, leatherwork and jewelry production took place, appears to signal a shift in religious thinking over time, Hawass said.",
      "Then in his life changing ruling, Akhenaten decided that his citizens should worship Aten, who was represented by the sun, he said, adding that it was possibly the first historical example of monotheism.",
      "Others like Ikram, prefer to define him as a henotheist \u2014 someone who worships one particular god, while acknowledging the existence and potential worship of other deities.",
      "Akhenaten, Hawass said, was \u201chated\u201d by religious priests who profited from the worship of multiple gods.",
      "\u201cHe wanted to go to a place to worship Aten,\u201d Hawass said, adding that he chose a site known today as Tell-el Amarna, around 200 miles south of Egypt\u2019s capital, Cairo.",
      "He called the new city the \u201cRise of Aten,\u201d Hawass said, adding that he believed that he was inspired to build the city by his father, Amenhotep III, who ruled Egypt from 1391 till 1353 B.C.",
      "Queen Nefertiti, Akhenaten\u2019s far more famous wife, would have walked the streets alongside him, Hawass added.",
      "The move was a \u201creligious revolution,\u201d said Yasmin El Shazly, the deputy director of the American Research Center in Egypt, which , which offers financial assistance to some archeologists. \u201cWe know that during the reign of Amenhotep lll, the religion became increasingly solar. There is evidence of the Aten, but there are other deities as well. So we know that it was not monotheistic at the time.\u201d",
      "But mentioning other gods, even the major deity Amun, \u201cbecame almost taboo,\u201d she said.",
      "After Akhenaten\u2019s death the city continued to be used by pharaohs including Tutankhamun, whose nearly intact tomb was discovered in the Valley of the Kings by British archaeologist Howard Carter in 1922.",
      "What the citizens thought about leaving their original home in So\u2019oud Aten remains unclear.",
      "By blocking the doors, Hawass said it appeared that they were thinking they may come back and they wanted to \u201ckeep it safe.\u201d",
      "But at the time, he said no one could raise their objections to the pharaoh. \u201cNo one can talk to the king,\u201d he said."

      "Richard Dearlove, the ex-head of British intelligence agency MI6, said that rushing a truce \u2014 and giving too many concessions to the Kremlin \u2014 could encourage President Vladimir Putin to launch other hostile forays into Europe.",
      "The Russians badly need a ceasefire, said Dearlove, citing waning Kremlin cash reserves and the falling price of crude oil, which Moscow exports to fund its war machine.",
      "\u201cUkraine is pretty close to a tipping point,\u201d he said in a wide-ranging interview. \u201cBut the worry at the moment is that Trump will do a premature deal with the Russians\u201d and make too many concessions.",
      "The \u201chighly undesirable\u201d consequences would be to \u201cembolden the Russians, over time, to be more aggressive and assertive in Europe,\u201d said Dearlove over a coffee at one of London\u2019s historic private members clubs.",
      "His remarks come as Ukraine\u2019s military chief said Russia had launched a new offensive in the Eastern European country.",
      "While often less critical of Trump\u2019s unorthodox approach than many other foreign policy experts, Dearlove said he finds Trump\u2019s general \u201clack of grace\u201d and \u201clack of decent behavior\u201d to be \u201cvery disconcerting\u201d \u2014 specifically his Oval Office bust-up with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February.",

He now co-hosts the \u201cOne Decision\u201d podcast, covering global news, alongside former U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta.",
      "He says he \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the American president\u2019s campaign to pressure European allies to spend more on defense, decrying the imbalance of Europe enjoying a relatively generous health care and benefits system while letting the U.S. foot the bill for Western defense.",
      "\u201cWhy should American taxpayers pay for indulgent social security programs in countries like Germany, France and Italy?\u201d he said.",
      "He dismisses \u201cSignalgate\u201d \u2014 in which Trump\u2019s team discussed bombing Yemen on the messaging app Signal \u2014 as a \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201csilly mistake\u201d that showed \u201ca degree of amateurism.\u201d And he said it wouldn\u2019t have a long-term impact on Western intelligence sharing.",
      "Reached for comment on Dearlove\u2019s remarks, White House principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields said, \u201cPresident Trump is a master negotiator who has done more to bring about world peace during his tenure than any president in modern history.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe President\u2019s Peace Through Strength agenda has delivered historic achievements across the globe and restored American dominance on the world stage,\u201d Fields added. \u201cThe \u2018experts\u2019 have been wrong for decades, and doing the same thing while expecting a different result is the definition of insanity.\u201d",
      "The ex-MI6 head says his biggest short-term worry revolves around Trump\u2019s approach to Ukraine, which has involved parallel talks with both Kyiv and Moscow and has been lambasted by Trump\u2019s critics in the West as being too favorable to the latter.",
      "\u201cIf you want to get the Nobel Peace Prize, don\u2019t do a premature deal with Ukraine \u2014 wait,\u201d Dearlove said. (According to former aides, the president still covets the landmark award won by four of his predecessors, and for which Trump has been nominated at least twice before.)",
      "Dearlove believes the Russians are on the back foot and will only come under more pressure to accept terms. \u201cThe Russians themselves badly need a ceasefire, but Putin is incapable of seeking one because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a reverse gear,\u201d Dearlove said.",
      "On Iran, responding to Trump\u2019s announcement that the U.S. will hold direct talks with Tehran over its nuclear program, Dearlove says he believes the administration will \u201cdemand a very high price\u201d \u2014 namely that Iran give up its entire nuclear program, both for energy and weapons.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a bottom line for Trump and Israel that Iran must not have nuclear capability,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear that if Iran were to try to weaponize or if the intelligence suggests that they are weaponized, then there would be a joint Israeli-American attack.\u201d",
      "Trump didn\u2019t rule out military action if the talks don\u2019t succeed, saying Tehran would have a \u201cvery bad day\u201d if diplomacy failed.",
      "Dearlove agreed: \u201cIf the Iranians don\u2019t negotiate, or if they mislead, which they\u2019re quite capable of doing, they\u2019re ones heading for a crisis.\u201d",
      "Dearlove was head of MI6 when the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, and was later criticized by a public inquiry for his handling of intelligence alleging that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, a key argument steering Britain into the war alongside Washington. At the inquiry in 2017, he described claims he was too close to the British government as \u201ccomplete rubbish.\u201d And, according to a BBC interview in 2023, he is among a minority of people who believe that Iraq did have some kind of weapons program, but that its components may have been moved into neighboring Syria.",
      "Looking ahead, Dearlove believes by far the biggest issue is how the West deals with China.",
      "\u201cPax Americana\u201d \u2014 the \u201cAmerican peace\u201d that has largely held since 1945 and is a byword for Washington\u2019s postwar global dominance \u2014 has \u201cdefinitively disintegrated,\u201d he said. In its stead, there has to be \u201csome sort of understanding between the United States and China,\u201d whose President Xi Jinping \u201cwants to create a world by 2050 which is aligned with China\u2019s value system,\u201d he added.",
      "\u201cChina and the West are intimately intertwined: You can\u2019t take them apart, you can\u2019t disentangle them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, it\u2019s totally opposed to the Western value system.\u201d",
      "He characterizes Xi\u2019s Chinese Communist Party as \u201ctalking about global domination\u201d \u2014 something vehemently rejected by Beijing.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to have to be some sort of international agreement which accommodates what I would describe as the two spheres of influence,\u201d he said. Otherwise, China is \u201cgoing to end up in a confrontation with the United States at some point in the 21st century.\u201d"

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/putins-two-faced-strategy-says-approach-trump-ukraine-rcna199449",
    "published": "Sat, 05 Apr 2025 04:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has dispatched his close friend Kirill Dmitriev to Washington, while conscripting 160,000 new troops and bombing Kharkiv.",
    "story": [
      "To the casual observer, Russia seems to be marching in two opposite directions.",
      "President Vladimir Putin sent one of his close allies, Kirill Dmitriev, to Washington this week for diplomatic talks, the most senior Kremlin official to visit since Russia invaded Ukraine.",
      "At the same time, Putin ordered the mobilization of 160,000 troops, his largest in 14 years, as his drones continue their nightly bombardment of Ukrainian civilians and he plans a spring offensive \u2014 if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is to be believed.",
      "But these twin approaches perfectly illustrate Russia\u2019s strategy, according to some Western foreign policy specialists. They say that Putin is slow-walking talks with President Donald Trump so he can press his battlefield advance in Ukraine, while gambling on achieving normalized relations with a friendly White House.",
      "Putin \u201cthinks that time is on his side, and by dragging things out he\u2019ll put himself in an even better position to negotiate,\u201d said Sergey Radchenko, a Soviet-born Cold War historian and professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.",
      "Mixed messages",
      "Having once promised to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine in 24 hours, Trump has found the reality to be far thornier.",
      "His team has tried to broker a ceasefire, but so far even a partial or temporary truce has been blocked by the Russians. Putin and his envoys have said they will only accept a truce if Ukraine agrees to extreme conditions tantamount to surrender and subjugation.",
      "Many Western officials and experts say Russia knows these cannot be accepted.",
      "\u201cPutin continues to obfuscate, continues to drag his feet,\u201d British Foreign Secretary David Lammy told reporters Friday at the headquarters of NATO in Brussels. \u201cWe see you, Vladimir Putin. We know what you are doing.\u201d",
      "That frustration has been felt in the White House, which under Trump has taken a far friendlier approach toward the Kremlin than previous administrations.",
      "Trump told NBC News on Sunday he was \u201cpissed off\u201d when Putin reiterated his view that Zelenskyy should be ousted. Trump\u2019s inner circle is advising him not to hold a call with Putin until he commits to a ceasefire, two administration officials told NBC News on Thursday.",
      "Familiar envoy",
      "This growing dissatisfaction explains why Moscow dispatched Dmitriev, according to Oleg Ignatov, a senior analyst on Russia at the International Crisis Group in Brussels.",
      "\u201cDmitriev has direct access to Putin; in the Russian system, this is the most important thing a negotiator can have,\u201d Ignatov said. He also \u201chas his own connections in the United States.\u201d",
      "Dmitriev, 49, was born in Kyiv when it was part of the Soviet Union and heads the Russian sovereign wealth fund responsible for investing and growing the country's cash pile. He has a close relationship with Putin, who in February appointed him special envoy on international economic investment.",
      "Dmitriev studied at Stanford and got his MBA at Harvard before working for Goldman Sachs and McKinsey & Co.",
      "After meeting with Trump\u2019s officials, he did a round of broadcast interviews in which he talked up normalizing relations with Washington, Arctic cooperation and a minerals deal. He even said the Kremlin could be involved in Elon Musk\u2019s plan to put humans on Mars. Ukraine was mentioned in passing, but he did not mention it in his social-media summary of the trip.",
      "\u201cWithout doubt, we note a positive dynamic in our relations,\u201d he told journalists in Washington. \u201cA series of meetings will still be needed for us to resolve all our differences. But the main thing we see is a positive, constructive attitude.\u201d",
      "The significance of Dmitriev\u2019s visit may lie in the fact he is not a career diplomat.",
      "\u201cHis apparent closeness to Putin makes him more than just a messenger,\u201d said Pavel Baev, a research professor at the Peace Research Institute Oslo, a think tank. \u201cHe appears to be a person who can really engage in bargaining and compromise.\u201d",
      "Asked about Dmitriev\u2019s\u00a0trip, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that Moscow was \u201ccautiously optimistic.\u201d",
      "Pressing ahead",
      "But, to be clear, Dmitriev's main task is clearly to re-establish links with Washington \u2014 rather than signal any drawdown in Ukraine ambitions, according to experts such as Robert Hamilton, a retired U.S. Army colonel and now head of research at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.",
      "Dmitriev's mission \u201csignals that the Kremlin is interested in broadening the discussions with the U.S. and steering them away from Ukraine,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cWhat the Kremlin actually seeks is to sideline the Ukraine issue and pursue a broader reset with the U.S. that leaves Ukraine and Europe out of the process and frees Russia to continue its war.\u201d",
      "Some saw evidence of that this week in Putin\u2019s announcement that the annual spring conscription draft would take on 160,000 recruits, the largest in 14 years.",
      "\u201cA clear signal it wants peace (not!)\u201d Tymofiy Mylovanov, Ukraine\u2019s former economics minister, wrote on X.",
      "Some experts point out the draft is only slightly higher than in previous years, and by law the recruits are barred from participating in what Russia calls its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. But it is nonetheless a symptom of Russia's growing militarization, a shift that has seen the entire economy retooled toward its war effort.",
      "In the short term, there are few signs Russia is slowing its war.",
      "One drone attack on Ukraine\u2019s second city of Kharkiv late Thursday killed five people and injured more than 30 others, officials said. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy told the French newspaper La Figaro last week he believes Putin is preparing a spring offensive.",
      "Russia\u2019s \u201cceasefire intentions are, as far as I can discern, nonexistent,\u201d Baev added. \u201cDmitriev is most probably sent in order to wriggle out of a tight corner.\u201d"

Hundreds of heartbroken families had been showing up to the site of the tragedy hoping to find their missing loved ones since Tuesday, when the roof of the bustling\u00a0Jet Set nightclub\u00a0collapsed during a performance by the renowned merengue singer Rubby P\u00e9rez, who is among the dead.",
      "A funeral for P\u00e9rez was underway Thursday at the Eduardo Brito National Theater in Santo Domingo. His daughter and bandmate, Zulinka P\u00e9rez, told Noticias Telemundo the family \"is devastated.\"",

      "Dr. Pablo Jos\u00e9 Castillo, a young plastic surgeon, had just sat down to take a break from the dance floor when he started recording P\u00e9rez's concert. Then disaster struck. He continued recording. Laments, cries and screams could be heard through the blinding dust of the crumbling ceiling.",
      "\"The entire roof collapsed,\" a person says on video as Castillo and other survivors wander through the darkness. \"How do we get out of here?\" Using their cellphones to light up the room, they found an emergency exit.",

      "The Jet Set Club was once a bustling center for nightlife. The collapse turned the cultural jewel into a wreckage site, with more than 300 firefighters scouring the rubble and giant cranes removing pieces of the concrete roof.",
      "Other people who died include Nelsy Cruz, the governor of Montecristi province, former MLB players Octavio Dotel\u00a0and\u00a0Tony Cabrera,\u00a0Dominican fashion designer Mart\u00edn Polanco and employees of Grupo Popular \u2014 one of the country\u2019s largest banking companies.

      "The country\u2019s Emergency Operations Center said Wednesday night\u00a0that the mission was transitioning from a search-and-rescue phase to a recovery operation.",
      "\"Over the past few days, rescue teams have worked without interruption, removing debris, assisting the injured and recovering people alive,\" the agency said in a statement in Spanish. \"However, having exhausted all reasonable avenues for finding more survivors, the operation now enters a different, but equally sensitive and crucial, phase: the recovery of human bodies with the due respect and dignity that each victim deserves.\""

Dmitriev is the most senior Kremlin official to visit since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.",

      "Zelenskyy told reporters on Wednesday that he was ready to exchange the two captured Chinese nationals \u201conly for Ukrainian soldiers\u201d in Russian captivity.",
      "\u201cThey are more talkative than the prisoners from North Korea, as far as we can see,\u201d he said, referring to two North Korean soldiers Ukraine captured in January.",

      "NBC News has not independently verified the Ukrainian figures.\u00a0A spokesperson for the Kremlin declined to comment Wednesday when asked about the Chinese soldiers.",

      "South Korea estimates that 11,000 North Korean soldiers have already been deployed to fight alongside the Russians, but the difference between North Korea, an impoverished and secretive nation, and China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, being involved in a war against an ally of the U.S. and Europe would be geopolitically seismic.",
      "The Ukrainian air force said Thursday that Russia had launched 145 Iran-made Shahed drones over its territory overnight, with four civilians killed in the past 24 hours. Three civilians were injured in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, Ukrainian officials said, and the Sumy region was shelled nearly 300 times over the prior 24 hours.",

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 The increasingly vicious trade war between Washington and Beijing took another turn Wednesday when China imposed an additional 50% tariff on imports from the U.S., hiking its levies on American imports to 84%.",
      "The tit-for-tat escalation came hours after President Donald Trump\u2019s 104% tariffs on Chinese imports went into effect, including 50% Trump added Monday. Later Wednesday, Trump increased the overall U.S. tariff on Chinese goods to 125%, even as he paused higher targeted tariffs on other countries for 90 days while keeping a 10% baseline tariff in place for all countries.",
      "Trump\u2019s 50% tariff is a \u201cmistake upon another mistake,\u201d China\u2019s Customs Tariff Commission said in a statement earlier Wednesday, adding that the world\u2019s two biggest economies should \u201cresolve differences through equal dialogue based on mutual respect.\u201d",
      "The effect of China\u2019s 84% tariff may be somewhat limited because China imports only about $160 billion a year in U.S. goods compared with the more than $400 billion in goods it exports to the U.S.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think they can match in the economic realm, because the relationship is so unbalanced,\u201d said Rick Waters, the Singapore-based director of the Carnegie China think tank. \u201cSo what they tend to do is move into adjacent realms to exact a price.\u201d",
      "Here's a look at some of the other measures China might take.",
      "U.S. agricultural products and poultry",
      "China could greatly increase tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, or even stop importing them completely.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a very\u00a0high chance that China will stop agricultural\u00a0imports from the U.S. altogether,\u201d said Tianchen Xu, a Beijing-based economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, a financial forecasting service.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a weapon targeting Trump\u2019s supporter\u00a0base,\u201d he added.",
      "Soybeans, which are crushed to make protein-rich animal feed ingredients and vegetable oils, have been at the heart of the U.S.-China trade dispute for some time.",
      "U.S. exports of soybeans to China fell 75% after China imposed a retaliatory 25% tariff on them in 2018, during Trump\u2019s first-term trade war with Beijing.",
      "The Trump administration announced $12 billion in subsidies for farmers to offset the impact, and it has again promised to step in if the latest round of tariffs hurts the industry further.",
      "China could also put further restrictions on American poultry products, having announced an import ban on two U.S. companies last week.",
      "Hollywood movies",
      "China, which frequently trades places with North America as the world\u2019s largest box office, is a crucial market for Hollywood films. Though China has an annual quota for the number of foreign movies that can appear in its theaters, it could ban Hollywood films altogether.",
      "American movies have already been declining in popularity in recent years as U.S.-China trade tensions have escalated. There were no Hollywood films among China\u2019s 10 highest-grossing movies in 2023, in stark contrast to 2012, when seven of the top 10 highest-grossing movies were U.S.-made, according to Maoyan, a Chinese movie-ticketing and data platform.",
      "U.S. services sector and intellectual property",
      "The U.S. has a large trade deficit with China in goods, but it comes out ahead when it comes to services such as finance, consulting and law.",
      "U.S. data lists China as its fifth-largest export market for services, according to a report by China\u2019s State Council released Wednesday.",
      "China could target the U.S. services sector, for example, by excluding American companies from government procurement processes or restricting their cooperation with Chinese firms.",
      "The U.S. has long accused China of stealing its intellectual property. But Beijing also has its own growing intellectual property interests, and it could investigate U.S. companies in China in an effort to protect them.",
      "Fentanyl cooperation",
      "China and the U.S. have made progress on stemming the international flow of precursor ingredients for fentanyl, some of which originate in China and are then processed into the deadly opioid in countries such as Mexico before being smuggled into the U.S.",
      "But China could bring that cooperation to a halt in response to Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "\u201cOut of humanitarian considerations, China has provided various forms of assistance to the U.S.,\u201d Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said last month. \u201cThe U.S. should not repay goodwill with hostility.\u201d",
      "Waters said it would be \u201ccounterproductive\u201d for China to suspend cooperation on fentanyl.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just going to cement narratives in the U.S. that they\u2019re weaponizing drugs against us,\u201d he said."
