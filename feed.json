      "Netflix's animated musical film \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d has become the surprise hit of the summer",
      "NEW YORK -- In the colorful, animated, musical world of \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d everyone is a fan. The general public rocks T-shirts supporting their favorite idols. They hold light sticks and stare starry-eyed at stadium stages; they scream, they cry, they cheer, they buy the merch.",
      "It shouldn't come as much of a surprise, then, that the Sony Pictures/ Netflix film itself has inspired similar fanfare, having topped the streamer\u2019s global rankings. Fans have flooded the internet with art, covers, cosplay and choreography in response to the movie, which follows the fictional K-pop girl group HUNTR/X as they fight demons.",
      "And it's not just the film that's a summer hit. The \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack has topped the charts \u2014 debuting at No. 1 on Billboard's Soundtracks chart and No. 8 on the all-genre Billboard 200.",
      "Here's how \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d became the year's surprising success story.",
      "The \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack utilizes some of the best and brightest in the genre. That included a partnership with K-pop company The Black Label, co-founded by super producer Teddy Park, known for his work with YG, Blackpink and 2NE1 \u2014 empowered girl groups used as references for the film\u2019s protagonists, the trio HUNTR/X.",
      "It's one of the many reasons the musical film's soundtrack stands on its own. Filmmakers \u201creally did their homework,\u201d says Jeff Benjamin, a music journalist who specializes in K-pop.",
      "Indeed, they did a lot of research. One of the film\u2019s directors, Maggie Kang, said that her team prioritized \u201crepresenting the fandom and the idols in a very specific way,\u201d as to not disappoint K-pop fans.",
      "They pulled from a treasure trove of influences heard at every corner: The fictional, rival boy band Saja Boys\u2019 hit song \u201cSoda Pop,\u201d for example, references the \u201990s K-pop group H.O.T.",
      "And it has worked. \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d is the highest charting soundtrack of 2025, with eight of its songs landing on the Billboard Hot 100. It peaked at No. 2 on the all-genre Billboard 200. To put that in perspective: Lorde's \u201cVirgin\u201d and Justin Bieber's \u201cSwag\u201d did the same.",
      "In some ways, it recalls Disney's \u201cEncanto,\u201d which topped the Billboard 200 and produced a No. 1 hit, \u201cWe Don't Talk About Bruno \u201d in 2022. Similarly, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d embraces \u201cthe original soundtrack, which is a lost art form,\u201d adds Benjamin.",
      "Tamar Herman, a music journalist and author of the \u201cNotes on K-pop\u201d newsletter, says the movie succeeds because it embraces animated musical tradition and authentic K-pop music production styles in equal measure. She considers \u201cKpop Demon Hunters\u201d to be \u201ca musical with songs inspired by K-pop,\u201d not unlike a Jukebox musical, where the songs of ABBA are reimagined for \u201cMamma Mia.\u201d",
      "The novelty of the film, too, seems to be resonating. Where many animated films rely on adapting existing intellectual property, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d is original. And it comes from an original perspective. \u201cIt\u2019s not completely Korean, it\u2019s not completely Western and it\u2019s kind of right in that middle,\u201d says Kang. \u201cIt\u2019s like not pulled from one side; it\u2019s kind of flavors of both. So, I think that\u2019s what makes the movie feels a little different.\u201d",
      "And \u201cthe core story is what\u2019s drawing everybody in,\u201d says Kang.",
      "San Francisco-based cosplayer and content creator Nanci Alc\u00e1ntar, who goes by Naanny Lee online agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a K-pop group, but it also tells a story of their journey, of how they transform into powerful warriors,\u201d said Alc\u00e1ntar in Spanish. For her, it goes beyond K-pop \u2014 it\u2019s about the narrative.",
      "Kang\u2019s approach to cultural authenticity, too, may have contributed to the film\u2019s crossover appeal. Rather than explaining Korean elements like HUNTR/X\u2019s visit to a traditional medicine clinic or translating K-pop light stick culture for Western audiences, she opted for full immersion. \u201cWe just wanted everybody to just accept that they were in Korea,\u201d Kang said.",
      "The director said this method of \u201cthrowing people into the deep end of a culture\u201d breaks down barriers better than heavy-handed explanation. \u201cWe just wanted to keep everything feeling normal,\u201d she explained. \u201cIf you don\u2019t shine a light on it, it just becomes more easily accepted.\u201d",

      "Japan-based Youtuber Emily Sim, also known as Emirichu online, says the character designs and original plot drew her to the movie. Sim, with more than 3.5 million subscribers on YouTube, posted a 35-minute video about the movie. In a week-and-a-half, it garnered nearly 450,000 views.",

      "Herman compares the movie to another Sony animation: \u201cSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,\u201d which also attracted a broad audience with its creative animation. \u201cAnd it's a fun, animated musical, which we haven't had in a while,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s campy, it's engaging, it's universal.\u201d",
      "Santiago was initially skeptical of the title \u201cKPop Demon Hunters.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like with big companies they kind of like to use K-pop as a bait. They kind of like to take advantage of K-pop fans\u2019 sincerity,\u201d said Santiago. \u201cBut I felt like with this one, it was such like kind of a love letter to K-pop fans.\u201d",
      "Indeed \u2014 if the film wasn't authentic to K-pop fans' experience, or mocked them, it is unlikely to have become so popular, says Benjamin. Instead, there are Easter eggs for the dedicated K-pop listener.",
      "Herman agrees, and says that the film has in-jokes for K-pop fans, not unlike a children's movie that features some humor meant to appeal specifically to parents.",
      "\u201cFiguring out what makes K-pop tick in a way that resonates with musical fans was really important to this movie,\u201d said Herman.",
      "For Kang, that was always at the heart of the project. \u201cFandom plays a huge part in the world being saved at the end of the movie,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, we were really confident that we were doing that justice.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- A federal judge says Russian soprano Anna Netrebko can move forward with her case claiming national original discrimination by the Metropolitan Opera, which dropped her after she refused to repudiate President Vladimir Putin over Russia's campaign against Ukraine.",

      "The Met did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Met General Manager Peter Gelb had demanded that she repudiate Putin shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, but she refused and was withdrawn from three Met productions. The Met replaced her with Ukrainian soprano Liudmyla Monastyrska in at least one of those productions.",

      "Blues legend Buddy Guy will release a new album on Wednesday, his 89th birthday",
      "NEW YORK -- For Buddy Guy \u2014 a stalwart and staunch defender of the blues \u2014 there's nothing more important than keeping his chosen genre at the forefront of conversation. It comes naturally: Guy is one of America's greatest guitar players, a singular artist with a thick roster of A-list super fans \u2014 Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page and Gary Clark Jr. among them.",
      "The list also includes innovative writer and director Ryan Coogler, who tapped Guy for his critically acclaimed film \u201cSinners\u201d earlier this year, and artists like Peter Frampton and the Eagles' Joe Walsh, who feature on his new album \u201cAin't Done with the Blues.\u201d It releases Wednesday, on Guy's 89th birthday.",
      "For the eight-time Grammy Award-winning musician, those recognitions aren't priority. The longevity of the music that made his life is his primary concern. \u201cLike I promised B.B. King, Muddy Waters and all of them,\u201d he tells The Associated Press over the phone, \u201cI do the best I can to keep the blues alive.\u201d",
      "He's concerned that radio stations no longer play the blues, and that the genre might miss out on connecting with younger listeners. It's one of the reasons \u201cAin't Done with the Blues\u201d is a strong collection of classics that run the risk of being forgotten \u2014 like on the album closer \u201cTalk to Your Daughter,\u201d a rendition of the J.B. Lenoir tune.",
      "In Guy's performance, there's an undeniable universality. \u201cBlues is based on everyday life,\u201d he says. \u201cA good time or a bad time.\u201d",
      "Or, another way Guy explains it: \u201cMusic is like a bowl of real good gumbo. They got all kinds of meat in there. You got chicken in there, you got sausage in there. You got a seafood in it. ... When we play music, we put everything in there.\u201d",
      "It's resonating. In its 2025 midyear report, Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, found that U.S. on-demand audio streams of blues music has climbed this year due to the success of \u201cSinners.\u201d",

It's hard to watch a franchise drift so expensively and pointlessly in Earth's orbit.",

We left them in the last movie walking out of prison early after good behavior and trying to turn their back on bad-hood.",
      "It's not that easy since would-be employers these days want to know about gaps in their job experience \u2014 they were robbing banks, after all \u2014 workplace trust issues and salary expectations. No one wants to hire a bunch of ex-cons.",

It was all nicely set against a zombie guinea pig uprising.",
      "This time the writers have just given up on what side of the ethical divide their anti-heroes are on. \u201cAre we bad again?\u201d ask the confused piranha. Replies Mr. Wolf: \u201cI get it.

      "For two-plus decades, the Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival has been a cultural reunion, a summer sanctuary and a safe haven where some of the industry's most influential voices converge in Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts. This week marks the return of the 23rd annual nine-day celebration, which kicks off Friday with a stacked slate that includes appearances from singer-actor Jennifer Hudson and Hall of Fame basketball player Dwyane Wade, screenings like Spike Lee 's \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d and intimate conversations with figures such as the Rev. Al Sharpton.",
      "Over the years, the festival has drawn the who\u2019s who of Black Hollywood \u2014 including Ava DuVernay, Kerry Washington, Tyler Perry and Regina King. The Obamas made a surprise appearance in 2022.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a moment when so many of us converge and gather in a location that has historically received us incredibly well,\u201d said Tracee Ellis Ross, who will screen her new Roku Channel series \u201cSolo Traveling with Tracee Ellis Ross.\u201d The three-episode show follows Ross as she embarks on solo journeys to unplug, indulge and reconnect through Morocco, Mexico and Spain.",

      "\u201cIt felt like the perfect location to kind of share,\u201d she said. \u201cThe timing was perfect from when the show came out.\u201d",
      "Set on the campus of the Martha\u2019s Vineyard Performing Arts Center and the Vineyard Lounge, the festival has grown from a grassroots gathering into a premier destination where Black creatives can find inspiration, connection and support.",
      "Akil paid homage to festival founders Stephanie and Floyd Rance, crediting them for building a creative pipeline where stories rooted in Black culture live and are seen.",
      "\u201cThey know the value. They know the need,\u201d said Akil, who will screen \u201cThe Vineyard\u201d episode from the Netflix series \u201cForever\u201d at the festival. \u201cRegardless of what the institution or systems of Hollywood sees as valuable, we claim the value of our stories. We have a chance to celebrate them, complete them, tell them, view them and share them with an audience. It allows for the completion of the story, so that we can move on to many, many, many more stories that need to be told.\u201d",
      "Floyd Rance described MVAAFF as a vital part of the entertainment ecosystem, offering a platform where Black voices and stories are given the spotlight they deserve.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always good to have somewhat of a convergence for folks of like mind in the arts and entertainment to gather, coalesce, share ideas, rekindle friendships and fellowship,\u201d said Floyd, who along with Stephanie said they did not expect their festival to become such a main attraction.",
      "\u201cDespite the political climate and what\u2019s going on in entertainment, it\u2019s always a good time for birds of a feather to flock together.\u201d",
      "In addition to the panels and screenings, Stephanie Rance said this year's festival centers on the theme of joy, focusing more on celebration than struggle. She\u2019s especially excited for attendees to experience a range of conversations, from little-known moments in Black history to a panel on Ralph Lauren\u2019s Oak Bluffs collection with Morehouse and Spelman.",

      "Dead & Company, featuring original Grateful Dead members Bob Weir and Mickey Hart, will play Golden Gate Park's Polo Field starting Friday with an estimated 60,000 attendees each day. The last time the band played that part of the park was in 1991 \u2014 a free show following the death of concert promoter and longtime Deadhead Bill Graham.",

      "A Harvard prodigy (he had earned a math degree from the institution at age 18), Lehrer soon turned his very sharp mind to old traditions and current events. His songs included \"Poisoning Pigeons in the Park,\" \"The Old Dope Peddler\" (set to a tune reminiscent of \"The Old Lamplighter\"), \"Be Prepared\" (in which he mocked the Boy Scouts) and \"The Vatican Rag,\" in which Lehrer, an atheist, poked at the rites and ceremonies of the Roman Catholic Church.

Lehrer was often likened to such contemporaries as Allen Sherman and Stan Freberg for his comic riffs on culture and politics and he was cited by Randy Newman and \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic among others as an influence.",
      "He mocked the forms of music he didn't like (modern folk songs, rock 'n' roll and modern jazz), laughed at the threat of nuclear annihilation and denounced discrimination.",
      "But he attacked in such an erudite, even polite, manner that almost no one objected.",
      "\"Tom Lehrer is the most brilliant song satirist ever recorded,\" musicologist Barry Hansen once said. Hansen co-produced the 2000 boxed set of Lehrer's songs, \"The Remains of Tom Lehrer,\" and had featured Lehrer's music for decades on his syndicated \"Dr. Demento\" radio show.",
      "Lehrer's body of work was actually quite small, amounting to about three dozen songs.",
      "\"When I got a funny idea for a song, I wrote it. And if I didn't, I didn't,\" Lehrer told The Associated Press in 2000 during a rare interview. \"I wasn't like a real writer who would sit down and put a piece of paper in the typewriter. And when I quit writing, I just quit. ... It wasn't like I had writer's block.\"",
      "He'd gotten into performing accidentally when he began to compose songs in the early 1950s to amuse his friends. Soon he was performing them at coffeehouses around Cambridge, while he remained at Harvard to teach and obtain a master's degree in math.",
      "He cut his first record in 1953, \"Songs by Tom Lehrer,\" which included \"I Wanna Go Back to Dixie,\" lampooning the attitudes of the Old South, and the \"Fight Fiercely, Harvard,\" suggesting how a prissy Harvard blueblood might sing a football fight song.",
      "After a two-year stint in the Army, Lehrer began to perform concerts of his material in venues around the world. In 1959, he released another LP called \"More of Tom Lehrer\" and a live recording called \"An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer,\" nominated for a Grammy for best comedy performance (musical) in 1960.",
      "But around the same time, he largely quit touring and returned to teaching math, though he did some writing and performing on the side.",
      "Lehrer said he was never comfortable appearing in public.",
      "\"I enjoyed it up to a point,\" he told The AP in 2000. \"But to me, going out and performing the concert every night when it was all available on record would be like a novelist going out and reading his novel every night.\"",

      "\u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\u201d is topping the domestic box office charts in its first weekend in theaters",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Marvel\u2019s first family has finally found box office gold. \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps,\u201d the first film about the superheroes made under the guidance of Kevin Feige and the Walt Disney Co., earned $118 million in its first weekend in 4,125 North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "That makes it the fourth biggest opening of the year, behind \u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d and \u201cSuperman,\u201d and the biggest Marvel opening since \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d grossed $211 million out of the gate last summer. Internationally, \u201cFantastic Four\u201d made $100 million from 52 territories, adding up to a $218 million worldwide debut. The numbers were within the range the studio was expecting.",
      "The film arrived in the wake of another big superhero reboot, James Gunn's \u201cSuperman,\u201d which opened three weekends ago and has already crossed $500 million globally. That film, from the other main player in comic book films, DC Studios, took second place with $24.9 million domestically.",
      "The box office success of \u201cFirst Steps\u201d and \u201cSuperman\u201d means \u201cthe whole notion of superhero fatigue, which has been talked about a lot, can I think be put to rest. I always say it\u2019s bad movie fatigue, not superhero fatigue,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore.",
      "\u201cFirst Steps\u201d is the latest attempt at bringing the superhuman family to the big screen, following lackluster performances for other versions. The film, based on the original Marvel comics, is set during the 1960s in a retro-futuristic world led by the Fantastic Four, a family of astronauts-turned-superhuman from exposure to cosmic rays during a space mission.",
      "The family is made up of Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal), who can stretch his body to incredible lengths; Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby), who can render herself invisible; Johnny Storm (Joseph Quinn), who transforms into a fiery human torch; and Ben Grimm (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), who possesses tremendous superhuman strength with his stone-like flesh.",
      "The movie takes place four years after the family gained powers, during which Reed\u2019s inventions have transformed technology, and Sue\u2019s diplomacy has led to global peace.",
      "Both audiences and critics responded positively to the film, which currently has an 88% on Rotten Tomatoes and promising exit poll responses from opening weekend ticket buyers. An estimated 46% of audiences chose to see it on premium screens, including IMAX and other large formats.",
      "The once towering Marvel is working to rebuild audience enthusiasm for its films and characters. Its two previous offerings this year did not reach the cosmic box office heights of \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\" which made over $1.3 billion, or those of the \u201cAvengers\u201d-era. But critically, the films have been on an upswing since the poorly reviewed \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World,\u201d which ultimately grossed $415 million worldwide. \u201cThunderbolts,\" which jumpstarted the summer movie season, was better received critically but financially is capping out at just over $382 million globally.",
      "Like Deadpool and Wolverine, the Fantastic Four characters had been under the banner of 20th Century Fox for years. The studio produced two critically loathed, but decently profitable attempts in the mid-2000s with future Captain America Chris Evans as the Human Torch. In 2015, it tried again (unsuccessfully) with Michael B. Jordan and Miles Teller. They got another chance after Disney's $71 billion acquisition of Fox\u2019s entertainment assets in 2019.",
      "The \u201cFantastic Four's\u201d opening weekend results were a little less than some rival studio projections, Dergarabedian said. Nonetheless, the film is expected to carry movie theater earnings well into August.",
      "Holdovers dominated the top 10, but one other newcomer managed to make the chart. The dark romantic comedy \u201cOh, Hi!\u201d earned $1.1 million from 866 screens.",
      "\u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d landed in third place in its fourth weekend with $13 million, followed by \u201cF1\u201d with $6.2 million. The Brad Pitt racing movie also passed $500 million globally. \u201cSmurfs\u201d rounded out the top five with $5.4 million in its second weekend.",

      "George Kooymans, guitarist and co-founder of the Dutch band Golden Earring, has died at 77",
      "NEW YORK -- George Kooymans, the guitarist and co-founder of the Dutch band Golden Earring who co-wrote the hard-rock classic \u201cRadar Love\u201d and wrote and shared lead vocals on the top 10 hit \u201cTwilight Zone,\u201d has died at age 77.",
      "Kooymans' family and the surviving members of Golden Earring announced that he had died Wednesday from complications of ALS, which he had been diagnosed with in 2020. He retired from the band soon after.",
      "\u201cGeorge bore this devastating and debilitating illness with exceptional strength and dignity,\u201d the statement from Golden Earring reads in part. \u201cWe bid farewell to a great musician and composer, whose work extended beyond Golden Earring. George was a beloved husband, father, grandfather, but above all, a friend.\u201d",
      "A native of The Hague, Kooymans was in his mid-teens when he helped found what became Golden Earring in the early 1960s: The band's name was inspired by an instrumental of the time, \u201cGolden Earrings.\u201d He was also a core member of the group's best known lineup, which featured drummer Cesar Zuiderwijk, singer-guitarist Barry Hay and bassist-keyboardist Rinus Gerritsen and stayed together from 1970 until Koosyman's departure.",
      "With more than 20 top 10 singles in their native country, Golden Earring had more success at home than overseas. But they began to attract an underground following in the U.S. in the late 1960s and broke through commercially in 1973 with the worldwide hit \u201cRadar Love,\" which has been covered by U2, R.E.M. and hundreds of others and used on the soundtrack to \u201cBaby Driver,\u201d \u201cWayne's World 2\u201d and other films.",
      "\u201cRadar Love,\u201d with its stately opening riff and memorable opening line \u201cI\u2019ve been driving all night, my hands wet on the wheel,\u201d was once ranked by Rolling Stone as among the greatest road trip songs.",

      "Hulk Hogan has left an indelible mark on professional wrestling and pop culture",
      "Hulk Hogan\u2019s back had weakened, a failed early attempt at slamming all 525 pounds of Andre the Giant left the \u201cImmortal One\" unsteady as the World Wrestling Federation champion once more needed to rally to beat another of wrestling\u2019s baddest bad guys.",
      "Andre wrapped his tree-trunk arms around the champ and tried to wring the final breaths out of Hogan with a bear hug so tight that more than 90,000 fans in Detroit almost witnessed the final day of Hulkamania.",
      "But, wait!",
      "This was Hulk Hogan.",
      "Wrestling\u2019s biggest star had more late comebacks than fellow 1980s sports stars John Elway or Michael Jordan combined. Hogan had some gas left in the tank, some extra bite in those 24-inch pythons, and hammered away at Andre. One right hand, then another one, and another! Wrestling fans roared as they knew the bad news that was coming for Andre. Hogan fought back \u2014 much as he did against those 1980s baddies out of the Cold War or Iran \u2014 and finally body-slammed Andre the Giant. Hogan hit the hopes and delivered his famous leg drop on Andre\u2019s chest to get the three count.",
      "Hulk Hogan won again at WrestleMania.",
      "He always won, of course. It\u2019s what the story called for and there was no reason for WWF owner and pro wrestler puppeteer Vince McMahon to ever deviate from the plan of Hulkamania running wild.",
      "Why would he?",
      "Hogan had the hulking size, the charisma and catchphrases \u2014 \u201cWhat\u2019cha gonna do when Hulkamania runs wild on you?\u201d \u2014 that led the industry out of gyms and regional arenas and into NFL stadiums, like that 1987 night when Hogan beat Andre at the Pontiac Silverdome in WrestleMania III.",
      "\u201cThere he is,\u201d announcer Gorilla Monsoon said, as Hogan played to the crowd, \u201cthe greatest professional athlete in the world today.\u201d",
      "Whether you break out an eye roll or crank up Hogan\u2019s \u201c Real American \u201d anthem to that statement depends, of course, on one\u2019s ability to suspend disbelief. There is no denying, though, just how real Hogan\u2019s impact was on professional wrestling and pop culture in the 1980s. He stood toe-to-toe with Rocky Balboa. He fought side-by-side with Mr. T. He hosted \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and flexed on the cover of Sports Illustrated.",
      "\u201cHe did what he set out to do,\u201d WWE Hall of Famer Sgt. Slaughter said Friday by phone. \u201cHe became the most recognized, not only professional wrestler and sports entertainer in the world, he\u2019s probably top-five of anybody you\u2019d recognize when you saw him.\u201d",
      "WWE has long claimed the paid attendance of WrestleMania III was 93,173, a number some historians claim is as artificially inflated as the chemically-enhanced biceps of that era. What can\u2019t be disputed, when the two had their match in 1988, live on national television, more than 33 million fans tuned in to NBC, still far and away the record for largest viewing audience in American televised wrestling.",
      "Making money and moving merch. That was the real power of Hulkamania.",
      "Hogan, who died Thursday in Florida at age 71, left behind more than three decades of memorable matches that captured the spirit of those little Hulkamaniacs to the ones that loved to hate him in the 1990s as \u201cHollywood\u201d Hulk Hogan in the New World Order.",
      "Here are some of his best moments.",
      "Hogan wasn\u2019t some upstart when he returned to the WWF (now WWE) in late 1983. He tested the waters of Hulkamania in the old American Wrestling Association and made his famous appearance as Thunderlips in \u201cRocky III,\u201d when was beckoned back to WWE and became an instant contender to face the champion, the hated Iron Sheik. Hogan broke out of the dreaded camel clutch and pinned the Sheik to become the new champion on Jan. 23, 1984, at Madison Square Garden \u2014 the building paid tribute to Hogan on Thursday night \u2014 and set the course for Hulkamania.",

      "Back before the internet spilled behind-the-scenes secrets, and there was easy access to watch wrestling around the globe, WWE created its own version of wrestling history. If the company said Andre the Giant had never been slammed, and had never been pinned over a 15-year undefeated streak, then it was believed to be true (neither were, of course).",
      "Yet, the faux hype set the stage for the match that changed wrestling forever.",
      "\u201cAndre the Giant was a momentum-shifting moment where he passed his torch,\u201d Hogan said in a 2009 interview with the AP. \u201cHe was like the icing on the cake. Once he blessed me, it was up to me to mold that business and carry it through.\u201d",
      "By 1996, Hogan\u2019s good-guy, beats-the-odds character had grown stale as he made the shift from WWE to Ted Turner\u2019s World Championship Wrestling. Hogan even started to get booed as wrestling fans clamored for a new direction, a new star on top.",
      "They got one. \u201cHollywood\u201d Hulk Hogan.",
      "For weeks, two former WWE stars had \u201cinvaded\u201d WCW and claimed they were taking over the company. That led to a six-man tag-team match where the two outsiders, Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, promised a third man to help with their cause. No one showed to help the two until the end, when Hogan walked out in his red-and-yellow attire, and stunned the crowd when he put the leg drop on Randy Savage. Hogan was third man. He ditched his traditional colors for black-and-white, sunglasses, dark facial hair and embraced the \u201cHollywood\u201d heel persona.",
      "Much as he did a decade earlier, Hogan led WCW to new heights and the company would defeat WWE in the TV ratings for 83 straight weeks in what would be known as the \u201cMonday Night Wars.\u201d Hogan lost as much as he won without his Hulkamania powers. He still moved the needle where it mattered most and made WCW must-see TV every Monday night.",
      "With WCW out of business and bought by McMahon, Hogan kept a low profile until he made a comeback with WWE in 2002. He returned with Hall and Nash as the NWO but at this point, WWE fans wanted their old Hulkster back.",
      "Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson was WWE\u2019s baby-faced crowd favorite when he met the villainous Hogan at WrestleMania in an \u201cIcon vs. Icon\u201d match in WrestleMania in 2002. One problem, the Toronto crowd decided to back Hogan.",
      "\u201cWhen we hit the ring, 70,000 loyal people didn\u2019t want to hate Hulk Hogan,\u201d Hogan said in 2009. \u201cEverybody kind of started to panic and I just said, \u2019Brother, stick with me and I\u2019ll get you through this.\u201d\u2019",
      "After the match, the cheers for Hogan called for a last-second change of plans, with his former NWO allies running down to attack him. The Rock helped Hogan fight off the NWO and the two men posed together to riotous cheers.",
      "\u201cAs I raised his hand and said he\u2019s the greatest wrestler in the world, they had to turn me back red and yellow immediately,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of interesting, that was going to be the nail in my coffin. It turned out to be the fountain of youth for me.\u201d",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- More than 20 mostly Democratic-led states sued the Trump administration Tuesday over its efforts to cut Medicaid payments to the nation's largest abortion provider \u2014 Planned Parenthood.",
      "The move comes in response to the package of tax breaks and spending cuts Trump signed earlier this month. A portion of the new cuts are focused on services such as cancer screenings and tests, birth control and treatment for sexually transmitted infections \u2014 by ending Medicaid reimbursements for a year for major providers of family planning services.",
      "The cuts apply to groups that received more than $800,000 from Medicaid in 2023. The goal was to target Planned Parenthood, but the legislation also affected a major medical provider in Maine.",
      "California, New York, Connecticut, other states and Washington, D.C. argue in a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts that the provision's language is unclear about which groups it applies to. They also say it retaliates against Planned Parenthood for advocating for abortion access, violating the free speech clause of the First Amendment.",
      "The states are asking that the portion of the law be blocked and deemed unconstitutional.",
      "The cuts threaten health care access for many low-income Americans, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said at a news conference.",

      "Maine Family Planning, which operates 18 clinics offering a range of services across the state, and Planned Parenthood Federation of America filed separate lawsuits earlier this year challenging the cuts. Planned Parenthood said although it is not specifically named in the law, the provision was meant to affect its nearly 600 centers in 48 states. About a third of those clinics risk closure because of the legislation, which would strip care from more than 1 million patients, the group argues.",

      "West Virginia is banning seven artificial dyes from school meals before the start of class",
      "When school starts in West Virginia next month, 240,000 students in districts large and small will notice something missing from their cafeteria trays.",
      "Gone will be red Jell-O fruit cups, yogurt topped with brightly hued sprinkles and Cool Ranch Doritos \u2014 all foods made with synthetic dyes.",
      "In their place will be foods that contain colors made only from natural sources \u2014 such as vegetables, spices and seeds \u2014 after West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a sweeping new law in March banning seven artificial dyes from school meals.",
      "Other states have enacted similar laws that would strip artificial dyes from school meals, but West Virginia\u2019s action is the first to take effect, starting Aug. 1. It triggered a four-month sprint that that left state and local nutrition directors reeling.",
      "\u201cI think the initial reaction was like, \u2018Wow, what are we going to do?\u2019\" said Tony Crago, director of child nutrition for the West Virginia Department of Education. \u201cWhere do we start?\u201d",
      "Across the state, managers of school food programs scoured district grocery lists for dozens of products that contained any trace of petroleum-based synthetic dyes including Red 3, Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Blue 1, Blue 2 and Green 3.",
      "\u201cWhen it went into law, it was shocking,\u201d said Diane Miller, who leads child nutrition and food services for Kanawha County Schools in the state\u2019s central region. \u201cWe began to realize that these dyes were in much more than just your cereals.\u201d",
      "West Virginia's ban on synthetic dyes was cheered by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has successfully pressured food makers to agree to remove artificial colors from their products. The law focuses first on dyes in school foods, followed by a second action that will ban the colors plus two preservatives from all foods sold in the state starting in 2028.",
      "The move is aimed at halting potential health effects from the dyes, which have been linked to neurobehavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and attention problems, in some children. It's part of a larger focus on limiting artificial ingredients in food, Morrisey said in March.",
      "\u201cBy eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we\u2019re taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges,\u201d he said.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of the dyes, citing mixed evidence of potential harm. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said the color additives are safe when \u201cused properly,\u201d in the amounts and products approved by the agency. Most children have no problems when consuming the dyes, the agency adds, \u201cbut some evidence suggests that certain children may be sensitive to them.\u201d",
      "More recently, however, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has joined Kennedy in the push to get artificial dyes out of food, despite limited proof of health effects.",
      "\u201cWhen you get rid of petroleum-based dyes, kids aren't gonna all suddenly be healthy,\u201d Makary said on a recent podcast. \u201cWe're not going to address the fact that 30% of our nation's kids have prediabetes by simply removing petroleum-based food dyes. But these are steps in the right direction.\u201d",
      "Nutrition experts agree that removing artificial colors from foods doesn\u2019t address the main drivers of America\u2019s chronic health problems. Those stem largely from ingredients such as added sugars, sodium and saturated fat.",

      "Some suppliers had already removed artificial dyes from some school foods, swapping them for products colored with beet juice or turmeric, said Hollie Best, food service director for Wood County Schools in Parkersburg, which has 11,000 children in 27 schools. Overall, Best said she removed just five foods from her menus.",
      "General Mills said 98% of its products for schools were already made without the banned colors. The company \u201cwill be compliant\u201d with West Virginia's law immediately and plans to remove the dyes from school foods nationwide by next summer, said Mollie Wulff, a company spokesperson.",
      "In Miller\u2019s district, with 23,000 students in 67 schools, the new law affects about 10% of the foods served, she estimated. She expected some foods to contain artificial colors, like strawberry milk and Pop-Tarts. Others were surprising, such as pickles, salad dressing and certain snack chips.",
      "\u201cPeople were like, \u2018Oh my gosh, no more Doritos?'\" Miller said. The popular Cool Ranch flavor contains dyes Red 40, Blue 1 and Yellow 5.",
      "The challenge is finding substitutes that will still appeal to children, Miller said.",
      "\u201cBecause the last thing we need them to do is to choose not to participate in our school lunch program,\u201d she said, adding that schools provide many students their healthiest meals of the day.",
      "Parents of children with sensitivities or allergies to artificial dyes had already raised concerns, according to school food directors. But for others, the presence of synthetic colors in school meals hasn\u2019t been an issue. Chris DeRico, nutrition director of Barbour County Schools, with 2,000 students, said few parents seemed worried about dyes.",
      "\u201cThey'd be in the minority, I believe,\" he said. \u201cIn rural West Virginia, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really on radar screens.\u201d",
      "In Best's district, dyes were already out of the food dished up during the summer session in July. That didn't make much difference to Lilith Wilson, 9, who said her meal of a meatball sub sandwich, sweet potato fries and ice cream was \u201creally good.\u201d",
      "Asked whether she likes school lunches in general, the incoming fourth-grader echoed the sentiments of picky kids everywhere: \u201cSometimes I don't, sometimes I do. It just depends on what it is.\u201d",

      "Dr. Vinay Prasad \u201cdid not want to be a distraction\u201d and was stepping down from his role as the FDA\u2019s top vaccine regulator \u201cto spend more time with his family,\u201d a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement late Tuesday.",
      "Two people familiar with the situation told The Associated Press that Prasad was ousted following several recent controversies. The people spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal personnel matters.",
      "Prasad joined the FDA in May after years as an academic researcher at the University of California San Francisco, where he frequently criticized the FDA\u2019s approach to drug approvals and COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "His contrarian approach appeared to match FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, who repeatedly praised Prasad\u2019s work and intellect.",

      "Prasad has long been skeptical of the therapy and other muscular dystrophy drugs sold by the drugmaker, Sarepta Therapeutics. As an academic, Prasad gained prominence by attacking the FDA for being too lenient in its standards for approving cancer drugs and other new therapies.",
      "That approach is at odds with Trump\u2019s Republican supporters, who generally favor speedier approvals and unfettered access to experimental treatments. During Trump\u2019s first term he signed the \u201c Right to Try \u201d law, a largely symbolic piece of legislation that won popular support from conservatives seeking to give dying patients expanded access to unproven drugs.",

      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- Food insecurity is rising in many parts of Africa, with the number of people unable to afford a healthy diet surpassing 1 billion \u2014 some two-thirds of the continent's population \u2014 in 2024, according to a United Nations report published Monday.",
      "The prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in Africa is more than double the global average of 28%, whereas figures from Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and Oceania don\u2019t reach that mark, the report said.",
      "The annual report, produced by five U.N. agencies, analyzes trends in efforts to achieve the goal of zero hunger around the world by 2030. Those agencies include the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Program.",
      "An estimated 8.2% of the global population may have faced hunger in 2024, down from 8.5% in 2023 and 8.7% in 2022, a positive trend that \u201ccontrasts with the steady rise in hunger in most subregions of Africa\u201d and in western Asia, or parts of the Middle East and South Asia, the report said.",
      "The prevalence of undernourishment, a key measure of progress, surpassed 20% in Africa and rose to 12.7% in western Asia, it said.",
      "The report is the latest to suggest that eliminating food insecurity universally remains a serious challenge. Africa remains the most vulnerable continent.",
      "According to the current projection, 512 million people in the world may be chronically undernourished in 2030, with nearly 60% of them to be found in Africa, the report said.",
      "\u201cWe must urgently reverse this trajectory,\u201d said M\u00e1ximo Torero, chief economist with the FAO.",

      "A former Ukrainian prisoner of war has embraced life with urgency since his release in April",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Since his release from a Russian prison in April, Stanislav Tarnavskyi has been in a hurry to build the life in Ukraine he dreamed about during three years of captivity.",
      "The 25-year-old has proposed to his girlfriend, bought an apartment and adopted a golden retriever. And that was just what he accomplished one week in July.",
      "But as busy as he is rekindling old relationships and creating new ones, Tarnavskyi cannot shake the trauma he and thousands of other Ukrainian soldiers experienced as prisoners of war. The U.N. says many endured beatings, starvation and humiliation at the hands of their captors \u2014 experiences that will leave lifelong scars.",
      "Tarnavskyi, who was captured during the battle for Mariupol in April of 2022, regularly has nightmares about the prisons where he was held.",
      "\u201cI see the officers who watched over us. I dream they want to harm me, catch me,\u201d he said. When he wakes up, his heart pounds, anxiety surges \u2014 until he realizes he is in the outskirts of Kyiv, where he was forced to move because Russia occupied his hometown of Berdiansk.",
      "As the three-year war drags on, Tarnavskyi is one of more than 5,000 former POWs back in Ukraine rehabilitating with the help of regular counseling. Regardless of any physical injuries that may require attention, psychologists say it is vital to monitor former POWs for years after their release; the cost of war, they say, echoes for generations.",
      "In a photography studio high above Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, sunlight floods the white walls. After a shoot that lasted several hours Tarnavskyi said the brightness was hurting his eyes, which are still sensitive from years spent in a dark cell.",
      "But his mood couldn't be dimmed. The girlfriend who waited for his return had just consented to his surprise proposal.",
      "\u201cI love you very much, I am very glad that you waited for me,\" Tarnavskyi said, holding a thick bouquet of pink roses and a ring. \"You have always been my support, and I hope you will remain so for the rest of my life. Will you marry me?\u201d",
      "Tarnavskyi said it was the thought of Tetiana Baieva \u2014 whom he met in 2021 \u2014 that helped stop him from taking his own life three times during captivity.",
      "Still, he finds it hard to talk with Baieva about his time in prison. He doesn't want to be pitied.",
      "Soon after he returned home, he was paranoid, feeling watched \u2014 a reaction to constant surveillance in prison. \u201cIf you stepped out of line, they\u2019d (Russians) come and beat you. I still get flashbacks when I see (surveillance) cameras. If I see one, I get nervous,\u201d he said.",
      "But with each passing week, he is feeling better, progress Tarnavskyi credits to the work he is doing with a psychologist.",
      "Any small stimulus \u2014 a smell, a breeze, a color \u2014 can trigger traumatic memories for POWs, says Kseniia Voznitsyna, the director of Ukraine's Lisova Polyana mental health center for veterans on the outskirts of Kyiv.",
      "Yet contrary to stereotypes, ex-POWs aren\u2019t more aggressive. \u201cThey tend to isolate themselves, avoid large gatherings, and struggle with trust,\u201d said Voznitsyna.",
      "\u201cThey say time heals \u2014 five or 10 years, maybe \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t,\" she added. \"It just feels less intense.\u201d",

      "That logic rings true to Denys Zalizko, a 21-year-old former POW who has been back in Ukraine for less than three months but is already sure his recovery will take a long time.",

And like many former POWs, he still battles hypervigilance \u2014 listening for threats, scanning his surroundings. At night, sleep comes in fragments, and that was true even before a recent uptick in nightly drone attacks by the Russian army.",

      "\u201cI love music. Music unites,\u201d he said, touching the tattoo of a treble clef behind his ear \u2014 inked after his return. Even in captivity, he sang quietly to himself, composing songs in his mind about love, home and war. Now he dreams of turning that passion into a career as an artist.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve become stronger now,\u201d Zalizko said. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of death, not afraid of losing an arm or a leg, not afraid of dying instantly. I fear nothing anymore.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The European Medicines Agency has recommended authorizing a twice-yearly injectable drug to prevent HIV",
      "LONDON -- The European Medicines Agency has recommended authorizing a twice-yearly injectable drug aimed at preventing HIV, which scientists say could help end the virus' transmission.",
      "In a statement on Friday, the EU drug regulator said its evaluations of lenacapavir, sold as Yeytuo in Europe by Gilead Sciences, showed the drug is \u201chighly effective\u201d and \u201cconsidered to be of major public health interest.\u201d Once the regulator's guidance is accepted by the European Commission, the authorization is valid in all 27 EU member countries as well as Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.",
      "Last year, studies suggested that lenacapavir, already used to treat people with HIV, was nearly 100% effective in stopping transmission in both women and men.",
      "Winnie Byanyima, executive director of the U.N. AIDS agency, has said the drug \u201ccould change the trajectory of the HIV epidemic\u201d if it is made available to everyone who needs it.",
      "In June, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized lenacapavir to prevent HIV. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization recommended countries offer the drug as an additional option to people at risk of the virus.",
      "Condoms help guard against HIV infection if used properly. Other medication aimed at preventing HIV include daily pills that people can take and another injectable drug called cabotegravir, which is given every two months. Lenacapavir\u2019s six-month protection makes it the longest-lasting type, an option that could attract people wary of more visits to health clinics or stigma from taking daily pills.",
      "Critics have raised concerns, however, that lenacapavir may not be made widely enough available to stop global outbreaks of HIV. Drugmaker Gilead has said it will allow cheap, generic versions to be sold in 120 poor countries with high HIV rates \u2014 mostly in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean.",

    "story": [
      "Michigan has become a leader in safe drinking water after the Flint crisis, but mobile home parks remain a rough spot",
      "After the Flint water crisis, Michigan became a national leader on safe drinking water, requiring the removal of lead pipes and the reduction of harmful \u201cforever chemicals\u201d years before the federal government acted.",
      "But the state has a blind spot when it comes to the hundreds of thousands of people who live in its mobile home parks.",
      "Regulators say they have little power to enforce the rules in the state's estimated 100 or more unlicensed parks when owners fail to provide safe water. The problem is compounded by private equity firms that have been buying up parks over the past two decades and now control about 1 in every 6 parks in Michigan \u2014 among the highest rates in the country, according to the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a group that advocates against such purchases.",
      "Officials say it can be a struggle to even contact those park owners, let alone get them to comply with regulations.",
      "\u201cWith private equity moving into this space, the goal these companies seem to have is to return the absolute highest return they can to investors even if that means providing inadequate service or engaging in exploitative practices, or unsafe practices for the residents,\u201d said state Sen. John Cherry, a Democrat who sponsored legislation to strengthen enforcement in the communities.",
      "But the state doesn't attempt to track unlicensed parks. And an industry spokesperson said Michigan officials \u2014 particularly law enforcement \u2014 have the power to do more if they choose.",
      "At North Morris Estates where Theo Gantos lives outside Flint, conditions got so bad that the state refused to renew the park\u2019s license to operate.",
      "Water often flowed weakly from the tap because the wells that service the park didn\u2019t produce enough, Gantos said. Sometimes the water was discolored. It could stain laundry and destroy appliances. He installed a multistage filter system just to be able to use it.",
      "Eventually, local law enforcement investigated. In March, the owner pleaded guilty to a criminal charge for operating without a license, agreeing to pay a fine and sell the park.",
      "That might not have happened if Gantos had not been so pugnacious. He spent years battling Homes of America, an affiliate of private equity group Alden Global Capital that local prosecutors said owns North Morris. That included filing a public records request for emails on officials\u2019 handling of problems at his park, pushing regulators to enforce rules and speaking out to media over what he calls blight conditions.",
      "\u201cThese guys, they don\u2019t care,\u201d Gantos said about complying with the rules.",
      "Representatives of North Morris and Homes of America, including an attorney who appeared for the park in legal proceedings, did not respond to messages seeking comment.",
      "The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs, called LARA, has the authority to inspect and investigate complaints at licensed mobile home parks. But it\u2019s typically fallen to law enforcement to pursue criminal charges against unlicensed parks.",
      "The North Morris conviction for operating without a license is likely the first such under the state\u2019s mobile home law that has been on the books since 1987, the county prosecutor said.",

And what we\u2019ve seen so far with both the state and local units of government is they\u2019ve elected not to.\u201d",
      "Mobile home parks without a license are \u201cessentially operating unregulated,\u201d Cherry said. One of the state\u2019s few options is to shut down a park, a rarely used last resort that can mean throwing people out of their homes.",
      "Mobile home parks have long been an important affordable housing option. But that affordability is fading.",
      "A study by Lending Tree, a lending marketplace, found new mobile home sale prices rose more than 50% nationally from 2018 to 2023 \u2014 new single-family home price averages, by contrast, rose 38% over that period.",
      "Last year, LARA supported legislation that would have given the department more power to penalize unlicensed parks, force parks to provide owner contact information and limit rent increases. That failed.",
      "This year, Democratic Sen. Jeff Irwin has proposed a narrower law that would give state drinking water officials more power to make sure water in all mobile home parks is drinkable. Right now, they only have direct authority over parks that provide their own water. But it\u2019s common for parks to take city water from a pipe connecting to the nearby town.",
      "That water is usually safe when it reaches the park, but if the park\u2019s water pipes crack or fail, water protections won\u2019t apply on the private property. That keeps officials from stepping in and forcing change except in limited situations when there\u2019s a public health threat. It can leave residents unsure where to turn when the owner refuses to fix problems.",
      "\u201cWe take those issues very seriously,\u201d said Eric Oswald, director of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy\u2019s drinking water and environmental health division. He said they try to work with licensing officials to ensure water is safe, though \u201cthe problem is, I\u2019m not resourced for that.\u201d",
      "The Michigan Manufactured Housing Association opposed last year\u2019s legislation, arguing it would make mobile homes less affordable.

It passed the state Senate in late June and is now in the GOP-controlled House.",

      "Millions of people living in mobile home parks don't enjoy the same drinking water protections that Americans are accustomed to",
      "The worst water Colt Smith has seen in 14 years with Utah\u2019s Division of Drinking Water was at a mobile home park, where residents had been drinking it for years before state officials discovered the contamination.",
      "The well water carried cancer-causing arsenic as much as 10 times the federal limit. Smith had to put the rural park under a do-not-drink order that lasted nearly 10 years.",
      "\u201cThe Health Department refers it to us like ... \u2018Why aren\u2019t you guys regulating it?\u2019 We had no idea it existed,\u201d he said.",
      "More than 50 years after the Safe Drinking Water Act was passed to ensure that Americans\u2019 water is free from harmful bacteria, lead and other dangerous substances, millions of people living in mobile home parks can\u2019t always count on those basic protections.",
      "A review by The Associated Press found that nearly 70% of mobile home parks running their own water systems violated safe drinking water rules in the past five years, a higher rate than utilities that supply water for cities and towns, according to Environmental Protection Agency data. And the problems are likely even bigger because the EPA database doesn\u2019t catch all parks.",
      "Even where parks get water from an outside source \u2014 such as a city \u2014 the clean water coming in can become contaminated if it passes through problematic infrastructure before reaching residents' taps. Because the EPA doesn\u2019t generally require this water to be tested and regulated, the problems may go unseen.",
      "Utah is one of the few states to step in with their own rules, according to an AP survey of state policies.",
      "\u201cIf you look back at the history of the Safe Drinking Water Act, like in the \u201970s when they were starting, it was, \u2018Well, as long as the source \u2026 is protected, then by the time it gets to the tap, it\u2019ll be fine.\u2019 And that\u2019s just not how it works,\u201d Smith said.",
      "In one Colorado mobile home park, raw sewage backed up into a bathtub. In a Michigan park, the taps often ran dry and the water resembled tea; in Iowa, it looked like coffee \u2014 scaring residents off drinking it and ruining laundry they could hardly afford to replace. In California, boxes of bottled water crowd a family's kitchen over fears of arsenic.",
      "Almost 17 million people in the U.S. live in mobile homes. Some are comfortable Sun Belt retirees. Many others have modest incomes and see mobile homes as a rare opportunity for home ownership.",
      "To understand how water in the parks can be so troubled, it\u2019s useful to remember that residents often own their homes but rent the land they sit on. Despite the name, it's difficult and expensive to move a mobile home. That means they\u2019re \u201chalfway homeowners,\u201d said Esther Sullivan, a professor of sociology at the University of Colorado in Denver who lived in several mobile home parks as she researched a book. Residents often put up with \u201creally egregious\u201d property maintenance by landlords because all their money is tied up in their home, she said.",
      "Pamela Maxey, 51, of Kalamazoo, Michigan, said she had forgotten what it was like to have reliable, clean water until she traveled to her state Capitol last year to advocate for better mobile home park protections and stayed in a hotel. By then, she had spent eight years in a park where sewage backed up into homes and the flow of tap water was sometimes weak or discolored.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I went into the bathroom to take a shower that I realized, \u2018I don\u2019t have to jump in here and squint my eyes closed the entire time and make sure water doesn\u2019t get in my mouth because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in it,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI went to brush my teeth, and I just turned the faucet on and I brushed my teeth from the water coming from the faucet. I haven\u2019t been able to do that for over a year.\u201d",
      "Victoria Silva, a premed student in Fort Collins, Colorado, estimates the water in Harmony Village Mobile Home Park where Silva lives went out or lost pressure 20 to 30 times over roughly three years there.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize how much water they need until the water is out for five minutes when they need to flush, when they need to rinse something off their hands, when they need to make some pasta,\u201d Silva said.",
      "The park's owner says a licensed professional ensures water is maintained and tested, and outages are minimized.",
      "The U.S. has some 50,000 water utilities, most serving small towns and rural areas. Many struggle to find expert staff and funding, and they violate clean water rules more often than the handful of large utilities that serve cities. But even among the hard-pressed small utilities, mobile home parks stand out.",
      "The AP analysis found that more than half these parks failed to perform a required test for at least one contaminant, or failed to properly report the results, in the past five years. And they are far more likely to be repeat offenders of safe drinking water rules overall.",
      "But that's only part of the story. The true rates of mobile home park violations aren\u2019t knowable because the EPA doesn\u2019t track them well. The agency\u2019s tap water violation database depends on information from states that often don\u2019t properly categorize mobile home parks.",
      "When Smith first searched Utah\u2019s database in response to an AP request for data from all 50 states, he found only four small water systems identified as belonging to mobile home parks. With some keyword searches, he identified 33 more.",
      "Other parks aren\u2019t in the databases at all and may be completely unregulated.",

      "The water in these other parks had been off their radar. At some, testing found high levels of cancer-causing arsenic in the water that had been provided to residents for years.",
      "It\u2019s impossible to know how many unnoticed parks are out there. Most states aren\u2019t actively looking for them and say they find very few. In Colorado, after the state passed a new law to require water testing at all mobile home parks, officials uncovered 79 parks with their source of water unknown. That\u2019s about a tenth of the total parks in the state.",
      "Many parks are decades old with aging pipes that can cause chronic water problems, even if the water that supplies the park is clean when it enters the system.",
      "Jake Freeman, the engineering director at Central States Water Resources, a Missouri-based private utility company that specializes in taking over small water systems in 11 states, said substandard and poorly installed pipes are more common to see in mobile home parks.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, it\u2019s hard to find the piping in the mobile home parks because if there\u2019s any kind of obstruction, they just go around it,\u201d he said. \u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like spaghetti laying in the ground.\u201d",
      "After a major winter storm devastated Texas in 2021, Freeman said, the company found pipes at parks it had taken over that \u201cwere barely buried. Some of them weren\u2019t buried.\u201d",
      "When pipes break and leak, the pressure drops and contaminants can enter water lines. In addition, parks sometimes have stagnant water \u2014 where pipes dead-end or water sits unused \u2014 that increases the risk of bacterial growth.",
      "Rebecca Sadosky is public water supply chief in North Carolina, where mobile home communities make up close to 40% of all water systems. She said owners don\u2019t always realize when they buy a park that they could also be running a mini utility.",
      "\u201cI think they don\u2019t know that they\u2019re getting into the water business,\u201d she said.",
      "Utah is a rare state that enforces safe drinking water standards even within mobile home parks that get their water from another provider, according to AP\u2019s survey of states. A small number of other states like New Hampshire have taken some steps to address water safety in these parks, but in most states frustrated residents may have no one to turn to for help beyond the park owner.",
      "In Colorado, when Silva asked officials who enforces safe drinking water rules, \u201cI just couldn\u2019t get clear answers.\u201d",
      "Steve Via, director of federal regulations at the American Water Works Association utility group, argued against regulating mobile home parks that get their water from a municipality, saying that would further stretch an already taxed oversight system. And if those parks are regulated, what\u2019s to stop the rules from extending to the privately owned pipes in big apartment buildings \u2014 the line has to be drawn somewhere, he said.",
      "Via said residents of parks where an owner refuses to fix water problems have options, including going to their local health departments, suing or complaining publicly.",
      "Silva is among the advocates who fought for years to change Colorado\u2019s rules before they succeeded in passing a law in 2023 that requires water testing in every mobile home park. It gives health officials the ability to go beyond federal law to address taste, color and smell that can make people afraid to drink their water, even when it\u2019s not a health risk. The state is now a leader in protecting mobile home park tap water.",
      "Smith, the Utah environmental scientist, said stopping the contaminated water flowing into the mobile home park and connecting it to a safe supply felt like a career highlight.",
      "He said Utah's culture of making do with scarce water contributed to a willingness for stronger testing and regulations than the federal government requires.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s sort of the communal nature of like, everybody should have access to clean water,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems to transcend political ideologies; it seems to transcend religious ideologies.\u201d",

      "The U.S. was once among only a few developed countries with a rate that ensured each generation had enough children to replace itself \u2014 about 2.1 kids per woman. But it has been sliding in America for close to two decades as more women are waiting longer to have children or never taking that step at all.",
      "The new statistic is on par with fertility rates in western European countries, according to World Bank data.",
      "Alarmed by recent drops, the Trump administration has taken steps to increase falling birth rates, like issuing an executive order meant to expand access to and reduce costs of in vitro fertilization and backing the idea of \u201cbaby bonuses\u201d that might encourage more couples to have kids.",
      "But there's no reason to be alarmed, according to Leslie Root, a University of Colorado Boulder researcher focused on fertility and population policy.",

      "In the early 1960s, the U.S. total fertility rate was around 3.5, but plummeted to 1.7 by 1976 after the Baby Boom ended.

The rate in 2023 was 1.621, and inched down in 2024 to 1.599, according to the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.",

      "What happened? CDC officials said it was due to recalculations stemming from a change in the U.S. Census population estimates used to compute the birth rate.",

It led to tit-for-tat military strikes by India and Pakistan that brought the nuclear-armed rivals to the brink of their third war over the region. Dozens of people were killed on both sides until a ceasefire was reached on May 10 after U.S. mediation.",

      "BALMEDIE, Scotland -- U.S. President Donald Trump opened a new golf course bearing his name in Scotland on Tuesday, capping a five-day foreign trip designed around promoting his family's luxury properties and playing golf.",
      "\u201cLet's go. 1-2-3,\u201d Trump said before he cut a red ribbon and fireworks popped to mark the official opening of the new Trump course in the village of Balmedie on Scotland's northern coast.",
      "\u201cThis has been an unbelievable development,\u201d Trump said before the opening. He thanked his son Eric for his work on the project, saying it was \u201ctruly a labor of love for him.\u201d Son Don Jr. also was present.",
      "Immediately after the opening, Trump, Eric Trump and two professional golfers in the foursome teed off on the first hole. They planned to play 18 holes before Trump returns to Washington.",
      "The overseas jaunt let Trump escape Washington\u2019s sweaty summer humidity and the still-raging scandal over the case of Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "It was mostly built around golf \u2014 and walking the new course before it officially begins offering rounds to the public on Aug. 13, adding to a lengthy list of ways Trump has used the White House to promote his brand.",
      "Billing itself the \u201cGreatest 36 Holes in Golf,\u201d the Trump International Golf Links, Scotland, was designed by Eric Trump. The course is hosting a PGA Seniors Championship event later this week, after Trump leaves. Signs promoting the event had already been erected all over the course before he arrived on Tuesday, and, on the highway leading in, temporary metal signs guided drivers onto the correct road.",
      "Golfers hitting the course at dawn as part of that event had to put their clubs through metal detectors erected as part of the security sweeps ahead of Trump's arrival. Several dozen people, some dressed for golf, including wearing cleats, had filled the sand trap near the tee box to watch the ribbon-cutting ceremony shortly before it was scheduled to start. Another group of people were watching from the other side in tall grass growing on sand dunes flanking the first hole.",
      "Also from Scotland's north is the president's late mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, who was born on the Isle of Lewis, immigrated to New York and died in 2000 at age 88.",
      "\u201cMy mother loved Scotland,\u201d Trump said during a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday at another one of his golf courses, Turnberry, on Scotland's southern coast. \u201cIt's different when your mother was born here.\u201d",
      "Trump used his trip to meet with Starmer and reach a trade framework for tariffs between the U.S. and the European Union\u2019s 27 member countries \u2014 though scores of key details remain to be hammered out. But the trip has featured a lot of golf, and having the president visit is sure to raise the new course's profile.",

      "He lost that case and was eventually ordered to pay legal costs for bringing it \u2014 and the issue still enrages him. During the meeting with Starmer, Trump called windmills \u201cugly monsters\u201d and suggested they were part of \u201cthe most expensive form of energy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI restricted windmills in the United States because they also kill all your birds,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf you shoot a bald eagle in the United States, they put you in jail for five years. And windmills knock out hundreds of them. They don\u2019t do anything. Explain that.\u201d",

      "Somaya Moniry, 24, hadn't known that tour guides existed, as a profession or even as a concept. But while browsing the internet for help on improving her English language skills, she stumbled upon Couchsurfing, an app where travelers connect with locals and stay in their homes.",
      "After hosting a traveler, \u201cI became very passionate about it and it was very interesting for me,\u201d Moniry said. \u201cIt was very unique. I have never heard about it before, so I said: \u2018Why not (do) this?\u2019\u201d",

      "But for her, Afghanistan is far more nuanced. While there are undoubtedly problems in a place recovering from decades of war and chaos, there is also another side to the complex, stunning country. Her love for her homeland runs deep, and she is eager to share it. She hopes to gradually change people\u2019s perceptions.",
      "\u201cWhenever \u2026 I saw all of that natures, all those beauty, all those positivity, it changed my view totally,\u201d Moniry said in her enthusiastic English. \u201cAnd definitely this can be also for other people.\u201d",
      "One of those visitors is Australian Suzanne Sandral. She originally wanted to see Afghanistan in the 1960s but the pressures of having a family kept her away. Now at 82, she was part of Moniry\u2019s women-only tour group in Kabul.",

Not at all,\u201d she said during a pause in sightseeing. \u201cWherever you go in the streets, if you smile at someone and give them a little nod or say hello, you get a terrific response. So it\u2019s very different.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe always try and do something a little bit different that really makes our tours unique, as well as something that kind of gives back to the community,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cSo I felt that working with the female tour guides does both of those things really well.\u201d",
      "The groups are small \u2014 one had eight women, the other three \u2014 but the company is looking to build a network of female guides across Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cWhat we try and do with this tour, especially the women\u2019s tour, is conquer those ethical concerns,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cThe idea is to learn about the lives of Afghan women in context.\u201d",

      "Syria's uprising-turned-conflict displaced half of the country's pre-war population of 23 million over the last 14 years. Lebanon hosted an estimated 1.5 million refugees, at one point making up roughly a quarter of its six million people, with many having been smuggled across the border and unregistered with the UN.",

      "The UNHCR also says it will help returning Syrians with \"cash grants, legal assistance for civil documents, psychosocial support, livelihood opportunities, and other protection services.\u201d",

But Syria under Assad was not yet safe for their return, according to major rights organizations.",
      "Many Syrians had also previously said the war, forced conscription under Syria\u2019s former government, and unpaid residency fines in Lebanon have held them back from returning.",
      "But Syria now has a new government under President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who led the surprise offensive that ousted Assad, and the Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam's government hopes Syrians will sign up for the joint repatriation plan.",

      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- Opposition figure Bobi Wine said the political climate in Uganda has \u201cgone from bad to worse\u201d ahead of presidential polls set for early next year, citing threats to himself and other activists mobilizing against the longtime president.",
      "Wine, a singer-turned-lawmaker whose real name is Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, said the threats he faces as President Yoweri Museveni\u2019s main opponent \u201ccome in no unclear terms.\u201d",
      "Fears for Wine's safety have grown in recent months, fueled by regular attacks on X from Museveni\u2019s son and presumptive heir, army chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba. In January, Kainerugaba wrote he \u201cwould cut off\u201d Wine\u2019s head if the president allowed it, and he drew widespread criticism in May for saying he was holding Wine\u2019s missing bodyguard \u201cin my basement.\u201d The bodyguard later appeared unable to walk without support when presented in court, the apparent victim of torture.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a constant reminder that the threat is real, because this is no ordinary person,\u201d Wine said, speaking of Gen. Kainerugaba. \u201cThis is a person that is not only the son of the person in charge of the country but is also the person in charge of all the organs of violence. He heads the military, the police, the prisons, you know. He is above the law, and he has acted as such.\u201d",
      "Wine, 43, spoke to The Associated Press in an exclusive interview at the headquarters of his National Unity Platform party in the Ugandan capital of Kampala, a site briefly occupied by security forces in a raid last month.",
      "Museveni, 80, who has ruled Uganda since 1986, dismisses Wine as an agent of foreign interests and has even questioned his patriotism. But Wine, who denies the allegations, has a large following among working-class people in urban areas, and his party has the most seats of any opposition party in Parliament.",
      "In the 2021 election, Wine secured 35% of the vote, while Museveni, with 58%, posted his worst-ever result, establishing Wine as the president's most potent challenger in decades. Wine alleged his victory was stolen through widespread ballot stuffing and other malpractices. Electoral authorities disputed the allegations.",
      "Wine\u2019s party claims dozens of its followers have been jailed or disappeared since 2021. For Wine, the attacks are meant to \u201csend fear down the nerves of all those that work with me and all those that stand for what I stand for.\u201d",
      "Wine and Museveni are set to face each other again in presidential polls scheduled for January 2026.",
      "Museveni has been campaigning in recent days in Kampala as he tries to bolster his chances among people likely to support Wine, urban dwellers often without a reliable source of income and who hope a change of government will benefit them.",
      "Wine often describes himself as a \u201cghetto president,\u201d citing his early days in a poor neighborhood in Kampala. He has maintained a high profile in this East African nation since the early 2000s, when he rose to fame as a singer whose dancehall music captivated audiences. Wine\u2019s compositions later grew critical of the government, earning him a reputation as a prominent contrarian while his musical peers were sometimes seen to be supportive of the government.",

      "With Ivory Coast considered a regional powerhouse, analysts say a weakened opposition and the constitutional change that kept Ouattara in power after abolishing initial term limits could lead the country to an era of one-man rule, especially in a region where democracy is increasingly being challenged.",
      "Opposition protests against Ouattara have been blocked, and several protesters have been arrested and accused of disturbing public order.",
      "\u201cWe might be sliding back to that era of old men, old guard dictator rule in West Africa because (of) the attitude of the military and equally the civilian rulers,\u201d said Anoba. \u201cAnd the announcement of Ouattarra is a reflection of that reality.\u201d",

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng were meeting in Sweden\u2019s capital and working against an Aug. 12 deadline.

      "\u201cWe just need to de-risk with certain, strategic industries, whether it's the rare earths, semiconductors, medicines, and we talked about what we could do together to get into balance within the relationship,\u201d Bessent said.",

      "The latest round of talks opened Monday in Stockholm to try to break a logjam over tariffs that have skewed the pivotal commercial ties between the world\u2019s two largest economies.",

      "Three days of investigative hearings on the deadly midair collision over Washington in January begin Wednesday and aim to reveal new insights into what caused the crash between a passenger plane and an Army helicopter that killed 67 people.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board will question witnesses and investigators about how the actions of the Federal Aviation Administration and its air traffic controllers and the Army may have contributed to the nation's deadliest plane crash since November 2001. It's likely too early for the board to identify the cause of the crash.",
      "The American Airlines plane from Wichita, Kansas collided with a Black Hawk helicopter while coming into land at Ronald Reagan National Airport and was the first in a string of crashes and near misses this year that have alarmed officials and the travelling public, despite statistics that still show flying remains the safest form of transportation.",
      "Investigations have already shown the FAA failed to recognize a troubling history of 85 near misses around Reagan airport in the years before the collision, and that the Army's helicopters routinely flew around the nation's capitol with a key piece of locating equipment, known as ADS-B Out, turned off.",
      "Aviation attorney Bob Clifford, who is working to file one of the first lawsuits against the government next month, said he hopes NTSB will look beyond the immediate factors that caused this crash to highlight the bigger ongoing concerns in the crowded Washington airspace.",
      "\u201cIn this particular instance, there\u2019s a much broader picture. And that is the known problems that were being ignored about an unsafe environment for the commercial aircraft to be navigating with the military aviation helicopters in the area,\u201d Clifford said.",
      "Even though the final NTSB report won't be released until sometime next year, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz isn't waiting to propose changes. He introduced legislation Tuesday that would require all aircraft operators to use both forms of ADS-B, or Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast, the technology to broadcast aircraft location data to other planes and air traffic controllers. Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B Out equipment but the airlines would have to add the more comprehensive ADS-B In technology to their planes.",
      "\u201cThere cannot be a double standard in aviation safety,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWe should not tolerate special exceptions for military training flights, operating in congested air space.\u201d",
      "The legislation would revoke an exemption on ADS-B transmission requests for Department of Defense aircrafts. It also would require the FAA to evaluate helicopter routes near airports and require the Army Inspector General to review the Army\u2019s aviation safety practices.",
      "NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said her agency has been recommending that move for decades after several other crashes.",
      "\u201cIn 2008, we sent a letter to FAA stating the board believes that the equipage of aircraft with ADS-B In capability will provide \u2014 and I want to stress this \u2014 an immediate and substantial contribution to safety, especially during operations in and around airports,\u201d she said.",

      "Morocco\u2019s argan forests are thinning under the strain of climate change, overharvesting and booming demand for luxury cosmetics",
      "SMIMOU, Morocco -- Argan oil runs through your fingers like liquid gold \u2014 hydrating, luscious, and restorative. Prized worldwide as a miracle cosmetic, it\u2019s more than that in Morocco. It\u2019s a lifeline for rural women and a byproduct of a forest slowly buckling under the weight of growing demand.",
      "To make it, women crouch over stone mills and grind down kernels. One kilogram \u2014 roughly two days of work \u2014 earns them around $3, enough for a modest foothold in an economy where opportunities are scarce. It also links them to generations past.",
      "\u201cWe were born and raised here. These traditions come from nature, what our parents and grandparents have taught us and what we\u2019ve inherited,\u201d cooperative worker Fatma Mnir said.",
      "Long a staple in local markets, argan oil today is in luxury hair and skin care products lining drugstore aisles worldwide. But its runaway popularity is threatening argan forests, with overharvesting piled on top of drought straining trees once seen as resilient in the harshest of conditions.",
      "Hafida El Hantati, owner of one of the cooperatives that harvests the fruit and presses it for oil, said the stakes go beyond the trees, threatening cherished traditions.",
      "\u201cWe must take care of this tree and protect it because if we lose it, we will lose everything that defines us and what we have now,\u201d she said at the Ajddigue cooperative outside the coastal town of Essaouira.",
      "For centuries, argan trees have supported life in the arid hills between the Atlantic Ocean and the Atlas Mountains, feeding people and animals, holding soil in place and helping keep the desert from spreading.",
      "The spiny trees can survive in areas with less than an inch of annual rain and heat up to 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit). They endure drought with roots that stretch as far as 115 feet (35 meters) underground. Goats climb trees, chomp their fruit, and eventually disperse seeds as part of the forest's regeneration cycle.",
      "Moroccans stir the oil into nut butters and drizzle it over tagines. Rich in vitamin E, it's lathered onto dry hair and skin to plump, moisturize and stave off damage. Some use it to calm eczema or heal chicken pox.",
      "But the forest has thinned. Trees bear fewer fruit, their branches gnarled from thirst. In many places, cultivated land has replaced them as fields of citrus and tomatoes, many grown for export, have expanded.",
      "Communities once managed forests collectively, setting rules for grazing and harvesting. Now the system is fraying, with theft routinely reported.",
      "But a forest that covered about 5,405 square miles (14,000 square kilometers) at the turn of the century has shrunk by 40%. Scientists warn that argan trees are not invincible.",
      "\u201cBecause argan trees acted as a green curtain protecting a large part of southern Morocco against the encroaching Sahara, their slow disappearance has become considered as an ecological disaster,\u201d said Zoubida Charrouf, a chemist who researches argan at Universit\u00e9 Mohammed V in Rabat.",
      "Shifting climate is a part of the problem. Fruit and flowers sprout earlier each year as rising temperatures push the seasons out of sync.",
      "Goats that help spread seeds can be destructive, too, especially if they feed on seedlings before they mature. Overgrazing has become worse as herders and fruit collectors fleeing drier regions encroach on plots long allocated to specific families.",
      "The forests also face threats from camels bred and raised by the region's wealthy. Camels stretch their necks into trees and chomp entire branches, leaving lasting damage, Charrouf said.",
      "Today, women peel, crack and press argan for oil at hundreds of cooperatives. Much makes its way through middlemen to be sold in products by companies and subsidiaries of L\u2019Or\u00e9al, Unilever, and Est\u00e9e Lauder.",
      "But workers say they earn little while watching profits flow elsewhere. Cooperatives say much of the pressure stems from climbing prices. A 1-liter bottle sells for 600 Moroccan dirhams ($60), up from 25 dirhams ($2.50) three decades ago. Products infused with argan sell for even more abroad. Cosmetics companies call argan the most expensive vegetal oil on the market.",
      "The coronavirus pandemic upended global demand and prices and many cooperatives closed. Cooperative leaders say new competitors have flooded the market just as drought has diminished how much oil can be squeezed from each fruit.",
      "Cooperatives were set up to provide women a base pay and share profits each month. But Union of Women\u2019s Argan Cooperatives President Jamila Id Bourrous said few make more than Morocco\u2019s minimum monthly wage.",

      "The idea is to expand forest cover and show that argan, if properly managed, can be a viable source of income.

That's an increase of 8.6% over the prior fiscal year and just shy of the record 5.76 million container units Savannah handled in fiscal 2022.",

      "MASERU, Lesotho -- The deafening roar of hundreds of sewing machines has gone silent. Spools of thread in every color are covered in dust. The warehouse is dark and empty.",
      "In the tiny African nation of Lesotho, clothing manufacturer Tzicc's business has dried up in the face of tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. A few months ago, work was steady. The factory's 1,300 employees has made and exported sportswear to American stores, including JCPenney, Walmart and Costco.",
      "But when Trump announced sweeping new tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners in April, Lesotho found itself topping the list, with a rate of 50% \u2014 higher even than that of China, where the economy is 8,000 times larger. Officials here and economic experts said they were baffled.",
      "Since then, Trump backed off \u2014 temporarily. During a monthslong pause for trade talks, the U.S. has charged a baseline 10% tariff and announced new rates for dozens of countries starting Friday. Lesotho\u2019s rate will be set at Trump\u2019s whim, with aides suggesting that tariffs charged on goods from smaller African countries could top 10%.",
      "Many nations have received letters laying out a new tariff. With the pause set to expire Friday, Lesotho officials say they've not received one and they find themselves among the countries where Trump says officials simply don\u2019t have time for one-on-one negotiations. Leaders \u2014 and the 12,000 people employed by garment factories exporting to the U.S. market \u2014 are still waiting.",
      "The damage has already rippled through Lesotho\u2019s economy, where textile manufacturing comprises the largest private industry with more than 30,000 workers in 2024.",
      "For Tzicc and its customers, the threat and apparent singling out of Lesotho were enough. Management decided to rush to deliver preexisting orders before tariffs resumed. But American buyers stopped placing new orders. With no work left, virtually all the factory's employees were sent home \u2014 potentially permanently.",
      "\u201cWell, unfortunately, we finished,\u201d factory compliance manager Rahila Omar said, pointing out the irony of the strategy as she walked among rows of silenced and covered machines. \u201cThat is why now we don't have any work.\u201d",
      "Omar is one of a handful of employees left in the eerily quiet factory. A few remain in the accounting department; others empty leftover stock to a warehouse elsewhere.",
      "Officials and workers fear this may be a sign of what's to come for other factories in Lesotho, where poverty is widespread among the population of 2 million and most textile workers single-handedly support their families.",
      "In March, a month before slapping Lesotho with the 50% tariff, Trump described it as a place \u201cnobody has ever heard of,\" struggling to pronounce the nation's name in a speech criticizing U.S. foreign aid.",
      "It's true Lesotho is a \u201cvery minuscule economy,\" as its own trade minister, Mokhethi Shelile, described it.",
      "But its relationship with Washington dates back decades. The U.S. was the first country to open an embassy in the capital, Maseru, after Lesotho declared independence from the United Kingdom in 1966. The military received U.S. training, and hundreds of millions in U.S. funds were sent to Lesotho to fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic via the now defunctUSAID office and the PEPFAR program.",
      "As textiles grew to become Lesotho's main export, some 75% of its product went to the U.S. Lesotho became known as Africa's denim capital. If an American purchased jeans from a U.S. brand such as Wrangler or Levi's, they may have been \u201cMade in Lesotho,\u201d as tags still note.",
      "In 2000, the U.S. signed the African Growth and Opportunity Act, allowing Lesotho and other African nations to export goods to the U.S. duty free.",
      "Shelile said he was in the process of negotiating AGOA\u2019s September renewal when he was awakened in the middle of the night by texts from aides bearing news of the 50% U.S. tariffs.",
      "\u201cNo, this cannot be real,\u201d Shelile remembers thinking. \u201cWhat did we do to deserve this?\u201d",
      "According to the Trump administration, Lesotho charges a 99% tariff on U.S. goods. The government here said it doesn\u2019t know how the U.S. calculated that.",
      "In theory, the tariff decision was based on trade deficit: Lesotho\u2019s exports to the U.S. were around $240 million last year \u2014 mainly clothing and diamonds \u2014 and imports from the U.S. were only $2.8 million. But in practice, the math is more complicated than that. And in reality, Lesotho simply cannot afford to import more U.S. products. Nearly half the population lives below the poverty line.",

Americans broadly support increasing or maintaining existing levels of funding for popular safety net programs, including Social Security and Medicare, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Local governments are scrambling to figure out how they will comply with the new landscape, calculating whether they will need to raise their own taxes to cover costs, trim budgets elsewhere or cut back the aid provided to Americans.",
      "\u201cThe cuts are really big, they are really broad and they are deeply damaging,\u201d said Sharon Parrott, president of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a research institute in Washington.",
      "\u201cThe consequences are millions of people losing health care coverage,\u201d she said. \u201cMillions of people losing food assistance. And the net result of that is higher poverty, more hardship.\u201d",
      "At the same time, certain people who receive aid, including parents of teenagers and older Americans up to age 64, will have to prepare to work, engage in classes or do community service for 80 hours a month to meet new requirements.",
      "All told, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates 10 million more people will end up without health insurance. Some 3 million fewer people will participate in the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, known as SNAP.",
      "\u201cPeople are really concerned what this means for their fiscal health,\u201d said Mark Ritacco, chief governmental affairs officer at the National Association of Counties, which held its annual conference the week after Trump signed the bill into law.",
      "The organization had pushed senators to delay the start dates for some Medicaid changes, and it hopes that further conversations with lawmakers in Congress can prevent some of them from ever taking hold. At its conference, questions swirled.",
      "\u201cWe're talking about Medicaid and SNAP \u2014 these are people's lives and livelihoods,\u201d Ritacco said.",

      "Republicans insist the law is adhering to Trump's vow not to touch Medicaid as the changes root out waste, fraud and abuse. A memo from the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm encourages lawmakers to focus on the popularity of its new work requirements and restrictions on benefits for certain immigrants.",
      "\u201cThose safety nets are meant for a small population of people \u2014 the elderly, disabled, young pregnant women who are single,\u201d the House speaker said on \u201cThe Benny Show.\u201d",

      "When President Johnson established Medicaid alongside Medicare \u2014 the health care program for seniors \u2014 as part of the Social Security Amendments of 1965, it was meant for low-income families as well as the disabled.",
      "And it quickly took off. Almost every state signed on to participate in Medicaid by 1970, according to the KFF, an organization focused on health policy. It soon went beyond covering its core population to include pregnant women, school-age children and not just the very poor but also those with incomes just over the federal poverty limit, which is now about $15,650 annually for a single person and $26,650 for a family of three.",
      "In the 15 years since the Affordable Care Act became law under President Barack Obama, Medicaid has grown substantially as most states opted to join the federal expansion. Some 80 million adults and children are covered.",
      "While the uninsured population has tumbled, the federal costs of providing Medicaid have also grown, to more than $880 billion a year.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of effects Medicaid has on health, but the most stark thing that it does is that it saves lives,\u201d said Bruce D. Meyer, an economist and public policy professor at the University of Chicago who co-authored a pivotal study assessing the program.",
      "The law's changes will certainly save the federal government \u201ca substantial amount of money,\u201d he said, but that will come at \u201csubstantial increases in mortality. And you have to decide what you value more.\u201d",

      "Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who delivered the longest speech in House history while trying to stall the bill, said the changes will hurt households and communities nationwide.",
      "\u201cWho are these people?\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cRipping health care away from the American people. The largest cuts in Medicaid in American history.

      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The Atlanta Braves put five-time All-Star Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. on the 10-day injured list with right Achilles tendon inflammation Wednesday, though the exact severity of the injury to the slugging outfielder may not be known until additional testing is done.",
      "The Braves recalled outfielder Jarred Kelenic from Triple-A Gwinnett to take his place on the roster.",
      "Acu\u00f1a first experienced discomfort in his calf area Monday night, when he scored from first on Austin Riley's double to help the Braves to a 10-7 victory over Kansas City. Acu\u00f1a lobbied to play on Tuesday night and Braves manager Brian Snitker assented, only for Acu\u00f1a to come up limping while trying to chase down a ball in right field in an eventual 9-6 loss.",
      "\u201cIt happened when I scored from first to home on that play,\u201d Acu\u00f1a explained after the game, speaking through an interpreter. \u201cThey are going to examine me (Wednesday) so we\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d",
      "Even after he came up limping, Acu\u00f1a wanted to remain in the game. He headed out to his position in the field but saw Eli White trotting out to replace him. That Acu\u00f1a was able to jog into the dugout at least generated some optimism that the injury to the Achilles tendon was not a complete tear and he could be back this season.",
      "\u201cI was kind of out there hoping they wouldn\u2019t hit it my way and of course any time you do that, they always hit it your way,\" Acu\u00f1a said. \u201cI told them (about the pain Monday) and everyone said: \u2018Take the day if you want it. You can have the day off.' I\u2019ve missed so much time already through injuries I didn\u2019t want to miss any more time.\u201d",
      "Acu\u00f1a, the National League MVP in 2023, has dealt with injuries for much of his career. He missed time as a rookie in 2018 with a sprained left knee ligament, then tore the ACL in his right knee to end his 2021 season. Last year, he pivoted awkwardly as he was taking his lead on the bases and wound up tearing the ACL in his left knee, ending his season after 49 games.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s an injury, I\u2019m worried,\u201d Acu\u00f1a said of the latest issue, which comes amid a season in which Atlanta has been devastated by injuries \u2014 particularly to its starting rotation. \u201cIt\u2019s more pain, but it feels kind of \u2014 I feel it a lot when I try to put pressure on it.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "College coaches are racing to master retention as revenue sharing and NIL opportunities steer athletes toward the transfer portal",
      "Whether it was an ACC, SEC, Big Ten or Big 12 coach taking the podium at media days, one theme remained consistent: In an era where revenue sharing and NIL opportunities can swiftly steer athletes toward the transfer portal, programs across the country are racing to master the art of player retention.",
      "Its importance is clear to Arkansas coach Sam Pittman, who has seen all but five players from his 2023 recruiting class leave for different programs.",
      "\u201cHere\u2019s what it\u2019s not because of: the way they\u2019re treated, because of the way they\u2019re developed, because of the way they\u2019re taught,\" he said. \"That\u2019s not the reason. It could be playing time. It could be finances. Probably the majority of it is finances, but you\u2019d have to ask those guys.\u201d",
      "More than 3,000 Bowl Subdivision players reportedly entered the transfer portal this past spring, which would average out to about 22 players per team. For the Razorbacks, 10 starters will be back and one of them is senior defensive lineman Cam Ball. He has remained with Arkansas his entire career, a somewhat rare occurrence for an NFL hopeful these days.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just a loyal guy. I\u2019m loyal to the state of Arkansas; Arkansas has been loyal to me,\" Ball said.",
      "Arkansas, like many schools, is also trying to scare up more money from donors as it faces the financial ramifications of the $2.8 billion House settlement; last fall, the athletic director said the school needed some $12 million more annually to \u201cbe in the NIL game from a football perspective.\u201d Besides the money, the Razorbacks have to find talented players; Ball grew up in Atlanta, just barely within the regional footprint in which Pittman prefers to recruit.",
      "\u201cWe have to go outside our state,\" Pittman said. \u201cIn-state recruiting has changed over the last three or four years because of NIL. So you have to think about the talent \u2014 who it is versus what pay is expected. So that\u2019s been a little bit more difficult in our state.\u201d",
      "Pittman isn\u2019t the only coach who wants prospects to be familiar with what their college experience will look like before making any life-changing decisions. Florida coach Billy Napier paints a clear picture of life in Gainesville and the challenges and perks that come with it.",
      "\u201cWe present our product in a way where we\u2019re selling the degree, the alumni network, the Gator-made program, and you have to be up for the challenge of trying to get Florida back to where it\u2019s been before,\" he said. \"And I think that\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019ve been able to keep it together.\u201d",
      "Florida\u2019s 2023 recruiting class remains mostly intact, and from Napier\u2019s perspective, hungrier than ever. Compared to other SEC teams, the Gators have had more success with retention. Napier doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence.",
      "\u201cWe told them when they came in, you know, look, it\u2019s not going to be all sunshine and rainbows here. We\u2019re in this thing for the long haul,\u201d Napier said. \u201cI think a lot of this is how you pitch it in recruiting. We\u2019re going to continue to do that, and retention is more important than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d",
      "Coaches scrambling to prevent transfers and maintain consistency isn\u2019t exclusive to the SEC. The approval of the House settlement is a double-edged sword when it comes to retention, and Power Four schools and beyond are feeling the effects. Third-party NIL deals are no longer the only negotiation tactic schools need to worry about.",
      "Complex contracts are becoming common and legal risks grow for athletes and programs alike as college football increasingly resembles the pros. Some deals are being negotiated solely by athletes as young as 18.",

If you\u2019re comfortable with their offer, then sign. Then you have some guys that\u2019ll leave and go to schools to get more money and stuff. That was never really like a big pusher for me, to go out and get more money because I feel like I\u2019m in a good situation here at Louisville.\u201d",
      "Quinn's loyalty could be the most convincing negotiation tactic of them all. While programs use revenue-share dollars to sway prospective transfers, coaches have begun to reward loyalty.",

Fair doesn\u2019t always mean equal.\u201d",
      "But he also said the Mustangs are not going to add players \u201cmaking a whole lot more than those guys who have already earned it here.\u201d",
      "\"And I think that\u2019s what helps us keep a good culture, is try to start with: Let\u2019s retain first, and then whatever\u2019s left, let\u2019s go build the best team we can for those guys,\" Lashlee said.",
      "North Carolina State's Dave Doeren doubled down.",
      "\u201cA guy that\u2019s been on a team three years, that\u2019s playing well and earned it on the field should make more than a guy coming in the door. I think that\u2019s a proper way to do business,\u201d Doeren said, though he warned that might not be the case across the board. \u201cRight now, common sense is not prevailing in college football.\u201d",

      "TAMPA, Fla. -- Mike Evans streaked into the secondary, cut outside and leaped to catch a perfect post-corner toss from Baker Mayfield.",
      "Fans at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers\u2019 indoor practice facility roared.",
      "They\u2019re used to Evans making all the plays but No. 13 still manages to impress everyone watching.",
      "The six-time Pro Bowl wide receiver makes it look so effortless the way he glides after the ball. His routes are smooth and precise, his hands soft. At 6-foot-5, 231 pounds, he has a powerful frame so he can outmuscle defenders or outfinesse them when he needs to.",
      "Evans is the only player in NFL history to start his career with 11 consecutive 1,000-yard receiving seasons. Only Jerry Rice had that many at any point. Evans is aiming for 12 in a row in a year when the Buccaneers celebrate the franchise\u2019s 50th season. There are no signs the 31-year-old is slowing down and his team goals are bigger than his personal ones.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just happy that we have a really great team and we\u2019re using this training camp to put everything together to have one of the best seasons for the 50th,\u201d Evans said Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m excited to put on a great show for y\u2019all.\u201d",
      "At a position known for players with look-at-me personalities \u2014 Tyreek Hill, Michael Irvin, Terrell Owens, Chad Johnson \u2014 Evans lets his performance do most of the talking. He\u2019s quiet, humble and community-oriented. Evans is a four-time NFL Walter Payton Man of The Year nominee for the work he does along with his wife, Ashli, through their foundation, which empowers youth, encourages education and stands against domestic violence.",
      "Evans joined the Buccaneers in 2014 as the seventh overall pick and has become one of the greatest players in franchise history. Evans and Chris Godwin were a big reason why Tom Brady chose Tampa Bay in 2020 and the Buccaneers ended up winning a Super Bowl that season.",
      "From catching passes from Josh McCown and Mike Glennon as a rookie to Jameis Winston to Brady to Baker Mayfield, Evans continues to produce. He has 836 career catches for 12,684 yards and 105 touchdowns.",
      "Evans missed three games last season due to injury and didn\u2019t reach 1,000 yards until he caught a 9-yard pass on the final play of a 27-19 victory over the Saints that the Buccaneers needed to secure their fourth straight NFC South title.",
      "The reaction from Evans\u2019 teammates and the fans after that catch showed how much he\u2019s loved.",

      "A 12-year-old boy has died from a brain-eating amoeba after swimming in a South Carolina lake over the July Fourth weekend",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- A 12-year-old boy died from a brain-eating amoeba two weeks after a holiday weekend on a popular South Carolina lake.",
      "The brain-eating amoeba enters the body when water is forced up the nose, like when someone jumps or dives in the water.",
      "It causes an infection that swells the brain and destroys tissue. Fewer than 10 cases are reported each year in the U.S., but almost all are fatal.",
      "Here are some things to know about the amoeba, its latest victim and other dangers on freshwater lakes:",
      "The amoeba's scientific name is Naegleria fowleri and it is most dangerous in water that stays for a while over 77 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius), including in lakes and rivers in the U.S. and other places with hot, sometimes dry summers like Pakistan and Australia. Infections have been reported in 26 U.S. states as far north as Minnesota.",
      "The amoeba enters the brain through the olfactory nerve in the nose. Once inside, it causes an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis.",
      "Symptoms start as a fairly standard headache and nausea. By the time the pain becomes severe, it is almost always too late to save the infected person. Of the 167 cases reported in the U.S. between 1962 and 2024, only four people have survived, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of the deaths happened within five days of getting sick, according to the CDC.",
      "One infection in a body of water doesn\u2019t increase the chances of another infection in the same body of water, the agency said. The amoeba cannot move from one person to another.",
      "It was the first death from the amoeba in South Carolina since 2016, the CDC said.",
      "Jaysen Carr went swimming at Lake Murray about 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Columbia over the July Fourth weekend.",
      "He got sick several days later and died on July 18.",
      "His father and mother had never heard of the amoeba before a doctor in tears told them what tests of his spinal fluid had found.",
      "Clarence Carr said he was shocked to learn South Carolina, like most other U.S. states, has no law requiring public reporting of deaths or infections from the amoeba. The lake wasn\u2019t closed and no water testing was performed.",
      "\u201cMy son was a very smart individual. If he had one warning, he would have thought swimming in the lake was a bad idea,\u201d Carr said.",

      "There is no science-based threshold for what level of the organism in the water would be safe or unsafe, and it would be difficult to test water regularly, the South Carolina Department of Environmental Services said in a statement.",
      "Researchers are trying to figure out why the infections are so rare. Some people have been found to have had antibodies, signaling they may have survived exposure. Others may die from brain swelling and other problems without the amoeba ever being detected.",
      "\u201cMy son lost his life swimming. We assumed it was safe,\u201d Carr said.",
      "Last year, the CDC started a pilot program of giving infected patients an antibiotic approved for use in Europe that has killed the amoeba in lab studies",
      "The amoeba can show up in hot springs, rivers and, on rare occasions, in tap water. That\u2019s why doctors recommend using sterile water for cleaning nasal passages with a neti pot.",
      "The only way to be completely safe is to not swim in lakes or rivers and, if you do, keep your head above water. Pinching your nose or using nose clips when diving or swimming can keep water out of your nose.",
      "There are other dangers in swimming in lakes and rivers instead of pools, where chemicals can kill off dangerous bacteria and other organisms.",
      "A mouthful of water could contain E.coli bacteria. And while the bacteria normally live in the intestines of healthy people and animals, some strains can cause a range of conditions, including urinary tract infection, cystitis, intestinal infection and vomiting, with the worst cases leading to life-threatening blood poisoning, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "Algae can also cause illnesses. Cyanobacteria \u2014 also referred to as blue-green algae \u2014 are plant-like organisms that live in water.",
      "The algae can look like foam, scum, mats, or paint on the surface of the water and can grow underneath it.",
      "The organisms can quickly grow out of control, or \u201cbloom,\" in warm weather, helped along by excessive nutrients in fertilizers and pet waste carried along by stormwater.",
      "Some of the algae produce toxins that can cause symptoms including skin irritation, stomach cramps, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, fever, sore throat, headache, muscle and joint pain, mouth blisters, seizures, and acute liver damage, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

Yes, you read right, your passwords will be DELETED this Friday.",
      "Why? Because Microsoft is moving its signature sign-in app to a digital authentication method touted by security experts as an easier and more secure way to log in: passkeys.",

      "When big infrastructure projects spring up, one crucial law \u2014 the National Environmental Policy Act \u2014 has for decades been a key way the government has required powerful industry interests to consider the environment and the public\u2019s voice",
      "When President Donald Trump rolled out a plan to boost artificial intelligence and data centers, a key goal was wiping away barriers to rapid growth.",
      "And that meant taking aim at the National Environmental Policy Act \u2014 a 55-year-old, bedrock law aimed at protecting the environment through a process that requires agencies to consider a project's possible impacts and allows the public to be heard before a project is approved. Data centers, demanding vast amounts of energy and water, have aroused strong opposition in some communities.",
      "The AI Action Plan Trump announced last week would seek to sweep aside NEPA, as it's commonly known, to streamline environmental reviews and permitting for data centers and related infrastructure. Republicans and business interests have long criticized NEPA for what they see as unreasonable slowing of development, and Trump\u2019s plan would give \u201ccategorical exclusions\u201d to data centers for \u201cmaximum efficiency\u201d in permitting.",
      "A spokeswoman for the White House Council on Environmental Quality said the administration is \u201cfocused on driving meaningful NEPA reform to reduce the delays in federal permitting, unleashing the ability for America to strengthen its AI and manufacturing leadership.\"",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s par for the course for this administration. The attitude is to clear the way for projects that harm communities and the environment,\u201d said Erin Doran, senior staff attorney at environmental nonprofit Food & Water Watch.",
      "Here's what to know about this key environmental law, and Trump's effort to weaken it:",
      "NEPA is a foundational environmental law in the United States, \u201cessentially our Magna Carta for the environment,\u201d said Wendy Park, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, another environmental group, referring to the 13th century English legal text that formed the basis for constitutions worldwide.",
      "Signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1970, NEPA requires federal agencies proposing actions such as building roads, bridges or energy projects to study how their project will affect the environment. Private companies are also frequently subject to NEPA standards when they apply for a permit from a federal agency.",
      "In recent years, the law has become increasingly important in requiring consideration of a project's possible contributions to climate change.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a really important function because otherwise we\u2019re just operating with blinders just to get the project done, without considering whether there are alternative solutions that might accomplish the same objective, but in a more environmentally friendly way,\" Park said.",
      "But business groups say NEPA routinely blocks important projects that often take five years or more to complete.",
      "\u201cOur broken permitting system has long been a national embarrassment,'' said Marty Durbin, president of the U.S. Chamber\u2019s Global Energy Institute. He called NEPA \u201ca blunt and haphazard tool\u201d that too often is used to block investment and economic development.",
      "The White House proposal comes as Congress is working on a permitting reform plan that would overhaul NEPA, addressing long-standing concerns from both parties that development projects -- including some for clean energy -- take too long to be approved.",
      "NEPA's strength \u2014 and usefulness \u2014 can depend on how it's interpreted by different administrations.",
      "Trump, a Republican, sought to weaken NEPA in his first term by limiting when environmental reviews are required and limiting the time for evaluation and public comment. Former Democratic President Joe Biden restored more rigorous reviews.",
      "In his second term, Trump has again targeted the law.",
      "An executive order that touched on environmental statutes has many agencies scrapping the requirement for a draft environmental impact statement. And the CEQ in May withdrew Biden-era guidance that federal agencies should consider the effects of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions when conducting NEPA reviews.",

      "John Ruple, a research professor of law at the University of Utah, said sidelining NEPA could actually slow things down. Federal agencies still have to comply with other environmental laws, like the Endangered Species Act or Clean Air Act. NEPA has an often overlooked benefit of forcing coordination with those other laws, he said.",
      "A botanist by training, Mary O\u2019Brien was working with a small organization in Oregon in the 1980s to propose alternative techniques to successfully replant Douglas fir trees that had been clear-cut on federal lands. Aerially sprayed herbicides aimed at helping the conifers grow have not only been linked to health problems in humans but were also killing another species of tree, red alders, that were beneficial to the fir saplings, O\u2019Brien said.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service had maintained that the herbicides' impact on humans and red alders wasn\u2019t a problem. But under NEPA, a court required the agency to redo their analysis and they ultimately had to write a new environmental impact statement.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental concept: \u2018Don\u2019t just roar ahead.\u2019 Think about your options,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.",

      "Ruple said uncertainty from NEPA changes and competing opinions on how to comply with the law's requirements may invite even more litigation.",

      "A 16-year-old\u2019s Roblox game, Grow a Garden, has shattered records for the most concurrent players in history",
      "Whether it serves as a chill escape from the onslaught of the real world or simply a way to beat vacation doldrums, a viral Roblox game about gardening has become the surprise hit of the summer.",
      "Grow a Garden, created by a 16-year-old in a few days, has shattered records for the most concurrent players of any game in history, beating out video games that take years and millions of dollars to develop.",
      "And there\u2019s no one to shoot, fight or race. If your last attempt at cultivating vegetables was FarmVille in 2010, don't worry \u2014 your tomatoes will grow even if you never water them.",
      "Grow a Garden is as simple as its name suggests \u2014 players can fill a plot of land with plants and animals, harvest and sell, trade or steal each others' bounty. The game is low stress, with an aesthetic reminiscent of Minecraft and a soundtrack of soothing classical tunes such as Mozart's Rondo Alla Turca playing in the background. Its popularity has further cemented Roblox' place not just in the gaming world but in popular culture \u2014 for better or for worse, it's where the kids hang out.",
      "\u201cThe word I keep hearing used over and over to describe this particular game is that it\u2019s chill, which is just such a nice alternative. I get a lot of sort of that Animal Crossing vibe from it. You know, like you can check in, you can check your gardens, you can get some new seeds, you can plant them,\u201d said Becky Bozdech, editorial director at the nonprofit Common Sense Media. \u201cI have an 11-year-old son who (plays it) and he says to him the big difference is that a lot of games have a big giant objective that you have to do, but in Grow a Garden, you can just kind of hang out and do what you want.\u201d",
      "Coincidence or not, Grow a Garden soared to popularity around the same time that Take-Two Interactive announced it would delay the launch of its wildly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 until next year. In late June, the gardening game logged 21.6 million concurrent players, surpassing Fortnite\u2019s previous record of 15.2 million according to Roblox. Analysts who follow Roblox's stock say Grow a Garden is helping boost the company's revenue and will push the company's quarterly earnings numbers above Wall Street's expectations.",
      "While it's not clear if the GTA audience flocked to this simple gardening game to pass the time until then, the timing reignited the age-old debate about who gamers are and what titles are taken seriously by the video game establishment. It happened with Candy Crush, with puzzle games, with Animal Crossing. Are people who play cozy games true gamers? Or is the title reserved for the folks who shoot enemies in Call of Duty or drive around creating mayhem in GTA?",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge percentage of gamers that play Roblox and the actual industry just views it as like this esoterically immature platform of weird gameplay habits,\u201d said Janzen Madsen, the New Zealand-based CEO and founder of Splitting Point studios, which acquired the game from its teenage creator. \u201cWell, I actually think in five years this is what player expectation is gonna be. And because you guys haven\u2019t embraced it, like you\u2019re not gonna know how to make games.\u201d",
      "To start growing your garden, you'll need a Roblox account. The game will start you out with an empty plot and some money \u2014 sheckles \u2014 and a starter seed. From there, you can plant seeds, harvest and sell your crops and buy more seeds, animals or tools for your garden. While it is possible to play the game without spending real-world money, it will take longer. Once you sell enough crops, you earn money to buy more expensive seeds beyond basic carrots and blueberries.",

      "Fishing for krill near Antarctica has surged to a record high, nearing a seasonal catch limit that could close the fishery early",
      "MIAMI -- Trawling near Antarctica for krill \u2014 a crustacean central to the diet of whales and a critical buffer to global warming \u2014 has surged to a record and is fast approaching a never before reached seasonal catch limit that would trigger the unprecedented early closure of the remote fishery, The Associated Press has learned.",
      "The fishing boom follows the failure last year of the U.S., Russia, China and two dozen other governments to approve a new management plan that would have mandated spreading out the area in which krill can be caught and creating a California-sized reserve along the environmentally sensitive Antarctic Peninsula.",
      "In the first seven months of the 2024-25 season, krill fishing in Antarctica reached 518,568 tons, about 84% of the 620,000-ton limit that, once reached, will force the fishery to automatically close. In one hot spot, the catch through June 30 was nearly 60% higher than all of last year\u2019s haul, according to a report from the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or CCAMLR, the international organization that manages the world's southernmost fishery.",
      "The report, which has not been publicly released and CCAMLR said contains confidential data, was shared with The AP by someone concerned about overfishing in Antarctica on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of the krill take is from an increasingly smaller area,\u201d said Capt. Peter Hammarstedt, campaign director for conservation group Sea Shepherd Global, which this year made its third voyage to Antarctica to document the fishery. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of a hunter saying that they\u2019re only killing 1% of the U.S.\u2019 deer population but leaving out that all of the deer were shot in Rhode Island.\u201d",
      "Krill is one of the most abundant marine species in the world, with an estimated biomass of 63 million metric tons. But advances in fishing, climate change and growing demand for krill\u2019s Omega-3 rich oil \u2013 for fishmeal, pet food and human dietary supplements \u2014 have increased pressure on the krill stocks. In the 2023-24 season, a fleet of 12 industrial trawlers from mostly Norway and China caught 498,350 tons of krill \u2014 until now the largest harvest since CCAMLR began collecting catch data in 1973.",
      "AP journalists traveled to the icy waters around Antarctica in 2023 and observed how factory ships trawl in close proximity to whales whose numbers are still recovering from a century of industrial culling that nearly drove them to extinction.",
      "Underscoring the competition between humans and whales, three humpback whales were found dead or seriously injured last year in the long, cylindrical nets deployed by the vessels to vacuum up the paper-clip sized crustacean.",
      "Officials have been negotiating for years a new management plan that would balance the growing market for krill with calls for greater protection of the Antarctic Peninsula, the continent's northernmost point and an area teeming with whales and, increasingly, tourists. Currently, less than 5% of the Southern Ocean is protected \u2014 well behind CCAMLR\u2019s target and a United Nations goal to preserve 30% of the world\u2019s oceans by 2030.",
      "But a tentative deal fell apart at last year\u2019s CCAMLR meeting over a last minute proposal by the United Kingdom and Australia for an even lower catch limit than the one agreed to during talks, AP reported last year. China, objecting to the persistent Western demands, then withdrew its support for the marine reserve and refused to renew the existing management system.",
      "\u201cThe truth was it was the UK,\u201d Matts Johansen, chief executive of Norway's Aker BioMarine, the world's largest supplier of krill-based products, said at the United Nations Oceans conference in June. \u201cJust a couple days before the vote, the UK threw another suggestion and that's when the Chinese backed off.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office rejected that characterization and said the British government continues to push for a krill management strategy that better safeguards Antarctic marine species and vulnerable ecosystems.",
      "In the absence of a deal, restrictions adopted 15 years ago to spread out the catch limit expired, allowing the krill fleet to essentially fish anywhere at any time, including in smaller habitats preferred by whales and other animals such as penguins and seals.",

That\u2019s the equivalent of taking off the road 5 million cars every year.",
      "CCAMLR declined to comment on the report obtained by the AP.",
      "Ship tracking data analyzed by Global Fishing Watch at the request of the AP also showed a higher concentration of trawling. Activity in one popular fishing ground, denoted Sub-Area 48.1, appears to have more than doubled so far this season compared to the entire 2023-2024 season, according to the the U.S.-based group, which supports sustainable fishing.",
      "Javier Arata, the executive director the Association of Responsible Krill harvesting companies, whose members are responsible for 95% of the krill taken from Antarctica, said the catch limit that lapsed was always intended as an interim measure.",
      "His group supports the creation of marine protected areas in Antarctica. But it rejects waiting for a conservation deal to adopt \u201cready-to-go measures\u201d raising the quota, which he said can be much higher.",

      "Scientists in Mexico are testing innovative methods they hope can be employed to locate the overwhelming number of people missing due to cartel violence",
      "ZAPOPAN, Mexico -- First the scientists dress dead swine in clothes, then they dispose of the carcasses. Some they wrap in packing tape, others they chop up. They stuff the animals into plastic bags or wrap them in blankets. They cover them in lime or burn them. Some are buried alone, others in groups.",
      "Then they watch.",
      "The pigs are playing an unlikely role as proxies for humans in research to help find the staggering number of people who have gone missing in Mexico during decades of drug cartel violence.",
      "Families of the missing are usually left to look for their loved ones with little support from authorities. But now, government scientists are testing the newest satellite, geophysical and biological mapping techniques \u2014 along with the pigs \u2014 to offer clues that they hope could lead to the discovery of at least some of the bodies.",
      "The ranks of Mexico\u2019s missing exploded in the years following the launch of then-President Felipe Calder\u00f3n\u2019s war against drug cartels in 2006. A strategy that targeted the leaders of a handful of powerful cartels led to a splintering of organized crime and the multiplication of violence to control territory.",
      "With near complete impunity, owing to the complicity or inaction of the authorities, cartels found that making anyone they think is in their way disappear was better than leaving bodies in the street. Mexican administrations have sometimes been unwilling to recognize the problem and at other times are staggered by the scale of violence their justice system is unprepared to address.",
      "Mexico\u2019s disappeared could populate a small city. Official data in 2013 tallied 26,000 missing, but the count now surpasses 130,000 \u2014 more than any other Latin American nation. The United Nations has said there are indications that the disappearances are \u201cgeneralized or systematic.\u201d",
      "If the missing people are found \u2014 dead or alive \u2014 it is usually by their loved ones. Guided by information from witnesses, parents and siblings search for graves by walking through cartel territory, plunging a metal rod into the earth and sniffing for the scent of death.",
      "Around 6,000 clandestine graves have been found since 2007, and new discoveries are made all the time. Tens of thousands of remains have yet to be identified.",
      "Jalisco, which is home to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, has the largest number of people reported missing in Mexico: 15,500. In March, human bone fragments and hundreds of items of clothing were discovered at a cartel ranch in the state. Authorities denied it was the site of a mass grave.",
      "Jos\u00e9 Luis Silv\u00e1n, a coordinator of the mapping project and scientist at CentroGeo, a federal research institute focused on geospacial information, said Jalisco\u2019s disappeared are \u201cwhy we\u2019re here.\u201d",
      "The mapping project, launched in 2023, is a collaboration by Guadalajara University, Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University and the University of Oxford in England, alongside the Jalisco Search Commission, a state agency that organizes local searches with relatives.",

Generally used by mining companies, the camera measures light reflected by substances in the soil, including nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, and shows how they vary as the pigs decompose.

      "The experience of the families of the missing also informs the research.",
      "Some observed that graves are often found under trees whose roots grow vertically, so those digging the graves can remain in the shade. Mothers of missing loved ones invited by researchers to visit one of the pig burial sites were able to identify most of the unmarked graves by sight alone, because of the plants and soil placement, Silv\u00e1n said.",

But it is unclear whether authorities across Mexico will ever be willing to use, or able to afford, the high-tech aides.",

He said waves hitting Hawaii could be bigger or smaller and it was too early to tell how large they would be. A tsunami of that size would be akin to a 3 foot (90 centimeter) wave riding on top of surf, he said.",

      "CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- An artificial intelligence data center that would use more electricity than every home in Wyoming combined before expanding to as much as five times that size will be built soon near Cheyenne, according to the city's mayor.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a game changer. It\u2019s huge,\u201d Mayor Patrick Collins said Monday.",
      "With cool weather \u2014 good for keeping computer temperatures down \u2014 and an abundance of inexpensive electricity from a top energy-producing state, Wyoming's capital has become a hub of computing power.",
      "The city has been home to Microsoft data centers since 2012. An $800 million data center announced last year by Facebook parent company Meta Platforms is nearing completion, Collins said.",
      "The latest data center, a joint effort between regional energy infrastructure company Tallgrass and AI data center developer Crusoe, would begin at 1.8 gigawatts of electricity and be scalable to 10 gigawatts, according to a joint company statement.",
      "A gigawatt can power as many as 1 million homes. But that's more homes than Wyoming has people. The least populated state, Wyoming, has about 590,000 people.",
      "And it's a major exporter of energy. A top producer of coal, oil and gas, Wyoming ranks behind only Texas, New Mexico and Pennsylvania as a top net energy-producing state, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "Accounting for fossil fuels, Wyoming produces about 12 times more energy than it consumes. The state exports almost three-fifths of the electricity it produces, according to the EIA.",
      "But this proposed data center is so big, it would have its own dedicated energy from gas generation and renewable sources, according to Collins and company officials.",
      "Gov. Mark Gordon praised the project's value to the state's gas industry.",
      "\u201cThis is exciting news for Wyoming and for Wyoming natural gas producers,\" Gordon said in the statement.",
      "While data centers are energy-hungry, experts say companies can help reduce their effect on the climate by powering them with renewable energy rather than fossil fuels. Even so, electricity customers might see their bills increase as utilities plan for massive data projects on the grid.",
      "The data center would be built several miles (kilometers) south of Cheyenne off U.S. 85 near the Colorado state line. State and local regulators would need to sign off on the project, but Collins was optimistic construction could begin soon.",

      "People with experimental brain implants often turn to the treatment as a last resort, hoping to improve their health when everything else has failed",
      "Carol Seeger finally escaped her debilitating depression with an experimental treatment that placed electrodes in her brain and a pacemaker-like device in her chest. But when its batteries stopped working, insurance wouldn\u2019t pay to fix the problem and she sank back into a dangerous darkness.",
      "She worried for her life, asking herself: \u201cWhy am I putting myself through this?\u201d",
      "Seeger\u2019s predicament highlights a growing problem for hundreds of people with experimental neural implants, including those for depression, quadriplegia and other conditions. Although these patients take big risks to advance science, there's no guarantee that their devices will be maintained \u2014 particularly after they finish participating in clinical trials \u2014 and no mechanism requiring companies or insurers to do so.",
      "A research project led by Gabriel L\u00e1zaro-Mu\u00f1oz, a Harvard University scientist, aimed to change that by creating partnerships between players in the burgeoning implant field to overcome barriers to device access and follow-up care.",
      "But the cancellation of hundreds of National Institutes of Health grants by the Trump administration this year left the project in limbo, dimming hope for Seeger and others like her who wonder what will happen to their health and progress.",
      "Unlike medications, implanted devices often require parts, maintenance, batteries and surgeries when changes are needed. Insurance typically covers such expenses for federally approved devices considered medically necessary, but not experimental ones.",
      "A procedure to replace a battery alone can cost more than $15,000 without insurance, L\u00e1zaro-Mu\u00f1oz said.",
      "While companies stand to profit from research, \u201cthere\u2019s really nothing that helps ensure that device manufacturers have to provide any of these parts or cover any kind of maintenance,\u201d said L\u00e1zaro-Mu\u00f1oz.",
      "Some companies also move on to newer versions of devices or abandon the research altogether, which can leave patients in an uncertain place.",
      "Medtronic, the company that made the deep brain stimulation, or DBS, technology Seeger used, said in a statement that every study is different and that the company puts patient safety first when considering care after studies end.",
      "People consider various possibilities when they join a clinical trial.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration requires the informed consent process to include a description of \u201creasonably foreseeable risks and discomforts to the participant,\u201d a spokesperson said. However, the FDA doesn\u2019t require trial plans to include procedures for long-term device follow-up and maintenance, although the spokesperson stated that the agency has requested those in the past.",
      "While some informed consent forms say devices will be removed at a study\u2019s end, L\u00e1zaro-Mu\u00f1oz said removal is ethically problematic when a device is helping a patient. Plus, he said, some trial participants told him and his colleagues that they didn\u2019t remember everything discussed during the consent process, partly because they were so focused on getting better.",
      "Brandy Ellis, a 49-year-old in Boynton Beach, Florida, said she was desperate for healing when she joined a trial testing the same treatment Seeger got, which delivers an electrical current into the brain to treat severe depression. She was willing to sign whatever forms were necessary to get help after nothing else had worked.",
      "\u201cI was facing death,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it was most definitely consent at the barrel of a gun, which is true for a lot of people who are in a terminal condition.\u201d",
      "Ellis and Seeger, 64, both turned to DBS as a last resort after trying many approved medications and treatments.",

Neither would Medicare, which generally only covers DBS for FDA-approved uses.",

      "Ellis said any delay in addressing the thorny issues around experimental brain devices hurts patients.",

      "\u201cIf this turns off, I get sick again. Like, I\u2019m not cured,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a treatment that absolutely works, but only as long as I\u2019ve got a working device.\u201d",

      "Archaeologists in central Israel are excavating one of the world's oldest known burial sites, dating back 100,000 years",
      "SHOHAM, Israel -- Archaeologists believe they have found one of the oldest burial sites in the world at a cave in Israel, where the well-preserved remains of early humans dating back some 100,000 years were carefully arranged in pits.",
      "The findings at Tinshemet Cave in central Israel, published in an academic journal earlier this year, build on previous discoveries in northern Israel and add to a growing understanding of the origins of human burial.",
      "Of particular interest to archaeologists are objects found beside the remains that may have been used during ceremonies to honor the dead and could shed light on how our ancient ancestors thought about spirituality and the afterlife.",
      "\u201cThis is an amazing revolutionary innovation for our species,\" said Yossi Zaidner, one of the directors of the Tinshemet excavation and a professor of archaeology at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. \"It\u2019s actually the first time we are starting to use this behavior.\u201d",
      "Archaeologists working at Tinshemet since 2016 have discovered the remains of five early humans that date back to around 110,000 to 100,000 years ago, according to various technologies.",
      "The skeletons were discovered in pits and carefully arranged in a fetal position, which is known as a burial position, said Zaidner. Many were found with objects, such as basalt pebbles, animal remains or fragments of ochre, a reddish pigment made from iron-rich rocks.",
      "These objects, some sourced from hundreds of kilometers (miles) away, had no known practical use for daily life, so experts believe they were part of rituals meant to honor the dead.",
      "Tinshemet Cave is a dark slash in central Israel\u2019s rolling hills filled with squeaking fruit bats. Inside and around the cave is an unassuming stone mound which Zaidner calls \u201cone of the three or four most important sites for study of human evolution and behavior during the Paleolithic time.\u201d",
      "The Paleolithic era, also known as the Stone Age because of the onset of stone tools, lasted from as early as 3.3 million years ago until around 10,000 years ago. Tinshemet Cave is from the Middle Paleolithic era, roughly between 250,000 to 30,000 years ago.",
      "Some of the Tinshemet researchers' core findings were published in March in Nature Human Behavior. A key discovery were the remains of five early humans, including two full skeletons and three isolated skulls with other bones and teeth. Also of note were more than 500 differently sized fragments of red and orange ochre, a pigment created by heating iron-rich stones to a certain temperature \u2014 evidence that early humans had the means to create decorative objects.",
      "\u201cHere we see a really complex set of behaviors, not related to just food and surviving,\u201d Zaidner said.",
      "Using hand chisels and delicate, pen-sized pneumatic drills that resemble dental tools, archaeologists will need many more years to excavate the site. The field work, which started in 2016, is usually done over the summer months. This year, a dozen archaeology undergraduate and graduate students fanned out across the site, painstakingly documenting and removing each fragment of tool, object or bone.",
      "At the entrance to the cave, the skull of one of the early humans is slowly emerging from the rock sediment; it will be years before it is fully excavated.",

      "Tinshemet is exceptionally important to archaeologists because the local climate preserved the bones, tools, and ornaments in good condition, unlike many other parts of the world where these items were lost to time, said Christian Tryon, a professor at the University of Connecticut and a research associate at the Human Origins Program at the Smithsonian Institution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The skeletons and objects were so well preserved because of ash from frequent fires, likely for rituals. This large amount of ash mixed with rainfall and Israel's acidic limestone, creating optimal conditions for perseveration. One skeleton was in such good condition archaeologists could see how the fingers were interwoven, hands clasped beneath the head.",
      "Tryon said the Tinshemet findings are bolstering earlier discoveries from two similar burial sites dating back to the same period in northern Israel \u2014 Skhul Cave and Qafzeh Cave. Skhul Cave was excavated almost 100 years ago, and Qafzeh Cave mostly around 50 years ago, when archaeological practices were more haphazard.",
      "\u201cThere were so many uncertainties with those sites, but this is confirming it\u2019s a pattern we know, and they\u2019re really nailing down the dates,\u201d Tryon said.",
      "Tinshemet has helped archaeologists conclude that burial practices started to become more widespread during this time, representing a shift in how early humans treated their dead.",
      "Some archaeologists believe intentional burials started earlier. In South Africa, the Homo naledi species \u2013 an ancient cousin of Homo sapiens \u2013 may have been intentionally placing their dead in caves as early as 200,000 years ago. But many archaeologists said the findings are controversial and there is not enough evidence to support the claim of intentional burials.",
      "In ancient times, Israel was a bridge between Neanderthals from Europe and Homo sapiens from Africa. Archaeologists have identified other subgroups of early humans in the area, and believe the groups interacted and may have interbred.",
      "Experts have been studying the two full skeletons brought from Tinshemet for years, but it\u2019s still unclear if they were Neanderthals, Homo sapiens, a hybrid population or another group altogether.",
      "The mix of subgroups created opportunities for different groups of early humans to exchange knowledge or express identity, said Zaidner. It\u2019s around this time that archaeologists first see examples of early jewelry or body painting, which could be ways early humans started outwardly belonging to a certain group, drawing boundaries between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem,\u201d he said.",
      "Israel Hershkovitz, a physical anthropologist at Tel Aviv University and the co-director of the Tinshemet site, said the concept of cemeteries in prehistoric life is important because it symbolizes \u201ca kind of a territory.\u201d",
      "He said that same kind of claim over land where ancestors are buried still echoes in the region. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of claim you make to the neighbors, saying \u2019this is my territory, this part of the land belongs to my father and my forefather' and so on and so on.\u201d",

      "Tech companies selling AI to the federal government now face a new challenge: proving their chatbots aren't \"woke.\"",
      "Tech companies looking to sell their artificial intelligence technology to the federal government must now contend with a new regulatory hurdle: proving their chatbots aren't \u201cwoke.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump's sweeping new plan to counter China in achieving \u201cglobal dominance\u201d in AI promises to cut regulations and cement American values into the AI tools increasingly used at work and home.",
      "But one of Trump\u2019s three AI executive orders signed Wednesday \u2014 the one \u201cpreventing woke AI in the federal government\u201d \u2014 marks the first time the U.S. government has explicitly tried to shape the ideological behavior of AI.",
      "Several leading providers of the AI language models targeted by the order \u2014 products like Google's Gemini and Microsoft's Copilot \u2014 have so far been silent on Trump's anti-woke directive, which still faces a study period before it gets into official procurement rules.",
      "While the tech industry has largely welcomed Trump's broader AI plans, the anti-woke order forces the industry to leap into a culture war battle \u2014 or try their best to quietly avoid it.",
      "\u201cIt will have massive influence in the industry right now,\u201d especially as tech companies are already capitulating to other Trump administration directives, said civil rights advocate Alejandra Montoya-Boyer, senior director of The Leadership Conference\u2019s Center for Civil Rights and Technology.",
      "The move also pushes the tech industry to abandon years of work to combat the pervasive forms of racial and gender bias that studies and real-world examples have shown to be baked into AI systems.",
      "\u201cFirst off, there's no such thing as woke AI,\u201d Montoya-Boyer said. \u201cThere\u2019s AI technology that discriminates and then there\u2019s AI technology that actually works for all people.\u201d",
      "Molding the behaviors of AI large language models is challenging because of the way they\u2019re built and the inherent randomness of what they produce. They\u2019ve been trained on most of what\u2019s on the internet, reflecting the biases of all the people who\u2019ve posted commentary, edited a Wikipedia entry or shared images online.",
      "\u201cThis will be extremely difficult for tech companies to comply with,\u201d said former Biden administration official Jim Secreto, who was deputy chief of staff to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, an architect of many of President Joe Biden's AI industry initiatives. \u201cLarge language models reflect the data they\u2019re trained on, including all the contradictions and biases in human language.\u201d",
      "Tech workers also have a say in how they're designed, from the global workforce of annotators who check their responses to the Silicon Valley engineers who craft the instructions for how they interact with people.",
      "Trump's order targets those \u201ctop-down\u201d efforts at tech companies to incorporate what it calls the \u201cdestructive\u201d ideology of diversity, equity and inclusion into AI models, including \u201cconcepts like critical race theory, transgenderism, unconscious bias, intersectionality, and systemic racism.\u201d",
      "The directive has invited comparison to China's heavier-handed efforts to ensure that generative AI tools reflect the core values of the ruling Communist Party. Secreto said the order resembles China\u2019s playbook in \u201cusing the power of the state to stamp out what it sees as disfavored viewpoints.\"",
      "The method is different, with China relying on direct regulation by auditing AI models, approving them before they are deployed and requiring them to filter out banned content such as the bloody Tiananmen Square crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 1989.",
      "Trump's order doesn't call for any such filters, relying on tech companies to instead show that their technology is ideologically neutral by disclosing some of the internal policies that guide the chatbots.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration is taking a softer but still coercive route by using federal contracts as leverage,\u201d Secreto said. \u201cThat creates strong pressure for companies to self-censor in order to stay in the government\u2019s good graces and keep the money flowing.\u201d",
      "The order's call for \u201ctruth-seeking\u201d AI echoes the language of the president's one-time ally and adviser Elon Musk, who has made it the mission of the Grok chatbot made by his company xAI.",

      "Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Palantir didn't respond to emailed requests for comment Thursday.",
      "The ideas behind the order have bubbled up for more than a year on the podcasts and social media feeds of Trump's top AI adviser David Sacks and other influential Silicon Valley venture capitalists, many of whom endorsed Trump's presidential campaign last year. Their ire centered on Google's February 2024 release of an AI image-generating tool that produced historically inaccurate images before the tech giant took down and fixed the product.",
      "Google later explained that the errors \u2014 including generating portraits of Black, Asian and Native American men when asked to show American Founding Fathers \u2014 were the result of an overcompensation for technology that, left to its own devices, was prone to favoring lighter-skinned people because of pervasive bias in the systems.",
      "Trump allies alleged that Google engineers were hard-coding their own social agenda into the product.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s 100% intentional,\u201d said prominent venture capitalist and Trump adviser Marc Andreessen on a podcast in December. \u201cThat\u2019s how you get Black George Washington at Google. There\u2019s override in the system that basically says, literally, \u2018Everybody has to be Black.\u2019 Boom. There\u2019s squads, large sets of people, at these companies who determine these policies and write them down and encode them into these systems.\u201d",
      "Sacks credited a conservative strategist who has fought DEI initiatives at colleges and workplaces for helping to draft the order.",
      "\u201cWhen they asked me how to define \u2018woke,\u2019 I said there\u2019s only one person to call: Chris Rufo. And now it\u2019s law: the federal government will not be buying WokeAI,\u201d Sacks wrote on X.",
      "Rufo responded that he helped \u201cidentify DEI ideologies within the operating constitutions of these systems.\u201d",
      "But some who agreed that Biden went too far promoting DEI also worry that Trump\u2019s new order sets a bad precedent for future government efforts to shape AI\u2019s politics.",
      "\u201cThe whole idea of achieving ideological neutrality with AI models is really just unworkable,\u201d said Ryan Hauser of the Mercatus Center, a free-market think tank. \u201cAnd what do we get? We get these frontier labs just changing their speech to meet the political requirements of the moment.\u201d",

      "Lawmakers on Maui have passed legislation aimed at eliminating a large percentage of the Hawaiian island\u2019s vacation rentals",
      "HONOLULU -- Lawmakers on Maui passed legislation Thursday aimed at eliminating a large percentage of the Hawaiian island's vacation rentals to address a housing shortage exacerbated by the wildfire that destroyed most of Lahaina two years ago.",
      "It's the latest action by a top global tourist destination to push back against the infiltration of vacationers into residential neighborhoods and tourism overwhelming their communities. In May, Spain ordered Airbnb to block more than 65,000 holiday listings on its platform for having violated rules. Last month, thousands of protesters in European cities like Barcelona and Venice, Italy, marched against the ills of overtourism.",
      "The Maui County Council's housing committee voted 6-3 to pass the bill, which would close a loophole that has allowed owners of condos in apartment zones to rent their units for days or weeks at a time instead of a minimum of 180 days. The mandate would take effect in the West Maui district that includes Lahaina in 2028. The rest of the county would have until 2030 to comply.",
      "The council still needs to vote on the bill, but the committee's result is a strong indication of the final outcome because all nine council members sit on the housing panel. The mayor is expected to sign the bill, which he proposed.",
      "\"Bill 9 is a critical first step in restoring our commitment to prioritize housing for local residents \u2014 and securing a future where our keiki can live, grow, and thrive in the place they call home,\u201d Maui Mayor Richard Bissen said in a statement, using the Hawaiian word for children.",
      "Vacation rentals currently account for 21% of all housing in the county, which has a population of about 165,000 people.",
      "An analysis by University of Hawaii economists predicted the measure would add 6,127 units to Maui\u2019s long-term housing stock, increasing supply by 13%.",
      "Opponents questioned whether local residents could afford the condos in question, noting that many of the buildings they are in are aging and their units come with high mortgages, insurance payments, maintenance and special assessment costs.",
      "Alicia Humiston said her condo is in a hotel zone so it won't be affected. But she predicted the measure will hurt housekeepers, plumbers, electricians and other small business owners who help maintain vacation rentals.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not what\u2019s best for the the community,\u201d said Humiston, who is president of the Rentals by Owner Awareness Association.",
      "Bissen proposed the legislation last year after wildfire survivors and activists camped out on a beach popular with tourists to demand change.",

      "The University of Hawaii study said only about 600 new housing units are built in the county each year so converting the vacation rentals would be equivalent to a decade\u2019s worth of new housing development. Condo prices would drop 20-40%, the study estimated.",
      "The report also predicted one-quarter of Maui County\u2019s visitor accommodations would vanish and visitor spending would sink 15%. It estimated gross domestic product would contract by 4%.",
      "The mayor said such economic analysis failed to tell a full story, noting families are torn apart when high housing costs drive out relatives and that cultural knowledge disappears when generations leave Maui.",
      "The mayor told the council the bill was one part of a broader housing strategy that would include building new housing, investing in infrastructure and stopping illegally operated vacation rentals. He said there were limits to how much new housing could be built because of constraints on water supplies and sewer infrastructure.",
      "Tourism would continue on Maui but must do so in a way \u201cthat doesn't hollow out our neighborhoods,\u201d the mayor said.",
      "The mayor's staff told council members that visitor spending would decline with the measure but most of the drop would be on lodging. Because 94% of those who own vacation rentals in apartment zones don't live on Maui, they said much of this income already flows off-island. They predicted the county budget could withstand an estimated $61 million decline in annual tax revenue resulting from the measure.",

      "One of Craig\u2019s attorneys, Lisa Fine Moses, fiercely pushed back in court. The photos from hospital security cameras of Craig holding a syringe, she said, were blurry and the needles that were recovered by investigators didn\u2019t contain poison.",
      "After Craig was arrested on suspicion of murder, he was further accused of offering to pay others to make it appear his wife, Angela Craig, was suicidal and asking a fellow jail inmate to kill the detective investigating his wife's death.",

      "Two weeks after spending the Fourth of July on a popular South Carolina lake, 12-year-old Jaysen Carr died from a brain-eating amoeba that was living in the warm water",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Two weeks after Jaysen Carr spent the Fourth of July swimming and riding on a boat on one of South Carolina's most popular lakes, he was dead from an amoeba that lives in the warm water and entered his brain through his nose.",
      "His parents had no clue the brain-eating amoeba, whose scientific name is Naegleria fowleri, even existed in Lake Murray, just 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Columbia.",
      "They found out when a doctor, in tears, told them the diagnosis after what seemed like a fairly regular headache and nausea took a serious turn.",
      "Jaysen, 12, fought for a week before dying on July 18, making him one of about 160 people known to have died from the amoeba in the U.S. in the past 60 years.",
      "As they grieve their son, the boy's parents said they were stunned to learn South Carolina, like most other U.S. states, has no law requiring public reporting of deaths or infections from the amoeba. The lake wasn't closed and no water testing was performed. If they hadn\u2019t spoken up, they wonder if anyone would have even known what happened.",
      "\u201cI can't believe we don't have our son. The result of him being a child was losing his life. That does not sit well. And I am terrified it will happen to someone else,\" Clarence Carr told The Associated Press as his wife sat beside him, hugging a stuffed tiger that had a recording of their middle child's heartbeat.",
      "Jaysen loved sports. He played football and baseball. He loved people, too. As soon as he met you, he was your friend, his father said. He was smart enough to have skipped a grade in school and to play several instruments in his middle school band in Columbia.",
      "\u201cHe either loved you or he just didn't know you,\u201d his father said. \u201cHe was the type of person who could go to a jump park and five minutes later say, \u2018This is my friend James.\u2019\u201d",

      "The amoeba was in his brain, already causing an infection and destroying brain tissue. It entered through his nose as water was forced deep into his nasal passages, possibly from one of the times Jaysen jumped into the water. It then traveled along his olfactory nerve into his brain.",
      "The amoeba caused an infection called primary amebic meningoencephalitis. Fewer than 10 people a year get it in the U.S., and over 95% of them die. The last death from the amoeba in South Carolina was in 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

Thirteen governments returned their funds to the Treasury. But that still left 235 local governments that had never filed a report nor returned their pandemic relief funds.",
      "The GAO told The Associated Press it does not have list of the specific governments that haven't complied with the reporting requirements. The Treasury has not responded to an AP request for a list of the 13 governments that returned their funds and those that still haven't reported how they used it.",

So the AP in January 2024 submitted a Freedom of Information Act request seeking copies of the noncompliance notices and related correspondence. The Treasury still has not fulfilled that request.",

      "The Trump administration is pushing for Americans to upload personal health data to new apps run by private tech companies",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is pushing an initiative for millions of Americans to upload personal health data and medical records on new apps and systems run by private tech companies, promising that will make it easier to access health records and monitor wellness.",
      "Leaders from more than 60 companies, including major tech companies such as Google and Amazon, as well as prominent hospital systems like the Cleveland Clinic, will convene at the White House on Wednesday afternoon to discuss what the administration is calling a \u201cdigital health ecosystem.\" The new system will focus on diabetes and weight management, conversational artificial intelligence that helps patients, and digital tools such as QR codes and apps that register patients for check-ins or track medications.",
      "The initiative, spearheaded by an administration that has already freely shared highly personal data about Americans in ways that have tested legal bounds, could put patients' desires for more convenience at their doctor\u2019s office on a collision course with their expectations that their medical information be kept private.",
      "\u201cThere are enormous ethical and legal concerns,\u201d said Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University law professor who specializes in public health. \u201cPatients across America should be very worried that their medical records are going to be used in ways that harm them and their families.\u201d",
      "Officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, in charge of maintaining the system, have said patients will need to opt in for the sharing of their medical records and data, which will be kept secure.",
      "Officials say patients will benefit from a system that lets them quickly call up their own records without the hallmark difficulties, such as requiring the use of fax machines to share documents, that have prevented them from doing so in the past.",
      "\u201cWe have the tools and information available now to empower patients to improve their outcomes and their healthcare experience,\u201d Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for CMS, said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Once the system is set up, popular weight loss and fitness subscription service Noom, which has signed onto the initiative, will be able to pull medical records, including labs or tests, of its users into its AI-driven analysis of what might help users lose weight, CEO Geoff Cook told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cRight now you have a lot of siloed data,\u201d Cook said.",
      "Patients who travel across the country for treatment at the Cleveland Clinic often have a hard time obtaining all their medical records from various providers, said the hospital system's CEO, Tomislav Mihaljevic. He said the new system would eliminate that barrier, which sometimes delays treatment or prevents doctors from making an accurate diagnosis because they do not have a full view of a patient's medical history.",
      "Having seamless access to health app data, such as what patients are eating or how much they are exercising, will also help doctors manage obesity and other chronic diseases, Mihaljevic said.",

      "Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is set to headline a major Republican event in South Carolina",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is set to headline the latest iteration of an event previously billed as the largest annual gathering of Republicans in South Carolina, a state traditionally key to picking the GOP's presidential nominees, and one in which she already has deep relationships.",
      "Rep. Sheri Biggs of South Carolina\u2019s 3rd District told The Associated Press that Sanders would be the featured speaker at her Salute to Liberty, slated to take place Aug. 18 in Anderson. In an interview last week, Biggs said she felt the governor \u201crepresents what the people in the 3rd District believe in, our morals, just down-to-earth hardworking people that love the Lord and want to live in peace with their families and uphold our conservative values.\u201d",
      "Historically a catalyst for Republican White House hopefuls, the South Carolina venue provides Sanders a chance to introduce herself to a large number \u2014 typically around 2,000 \u2014 of party activists. It\u2019s also a crowd with which President Donald Trump \u2014 whom she served as press secretary during his first administration \u2014 remains popular.",
      "Sanders, whose name comes up among potential 2028 presidential contenders, has been making trips to South Carolina since her father, former Arkansas governor and current U.S. ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, sought the 2008 GOP nomination. She's recently been in other early-voting states herself, including a speech earlier this month at the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa, an annual event held by a conservative Christian group.",
      "For years, the South Carolina occasion was billed as Rep. Jeff Duncan's Faith & Freedom BBQ, a fundraiser benefiting his reelection campaign. In a conservative-rich area, it became a showcase for future White House contenders, including then-Vice President Mike Pence, Sens. Ted Cruz, Tim Scott and Marco Rubio, and former U.N. Ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.",
      "The barbecue was upended just weeks after the 2023 event, when Duncan's wife filed for divorce, saying the congressman left her, was having a sexual relationship with a lobbyist and had been unfaithful before during their 35-year marriage. Last year, Duncan opted not to seek reelection to an eighth term, following the 2023 diminishment of his reputation for conservative family values.",
      "In her first political run, Biggs \u2014 a nurse practitioner and Air National Guard officer \u2014 defeated a Trump-backed primary opponent last year. Mark Burns, a Black pastor who has been by Trump\u2019s side for nearly a decade, had unsuccessfully run for Congress twice before.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles County leaders want to prohibit law enforcement officers from concealing their identities while on duty, a response to recent immigration raids during which some federal agents refused to identify themselves or covered their faces.",
      "The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday voted 4\u20140, with one abstention, to direct county counsel to draft an ordinance that bars officers, including federal agents, from wearing masks, with limited exceptions such as for medical protection or during undercover operations. Officers would also be required to visibly display identification and agency affiliation while out in public.",
      "Since early June, immigration agents have swarmed Southern California, arresting hundreds of people and prompting protests against the federal raids and the subsequent deployment of the National Guard and Marines. About half the Guard troops and all the Marines were pulled out of LA in recent weeks.",
      "Supervisor Janice Hahn, who co-authored the motion, said the raids carried out by the Trump administration have sparked fear and residents have a right to know who is stopping, questioning or detaining them.",
      "\u201cAcross the county, people are being pulled out of their cars, beaten, and ripped from their families by men in tactical gear with balaclavas, no badges, and no names,\" Hahn said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how law enforcement in a democracy should operate.\u201d",
      "Hahn conceded that it is unclear if the county will be able to enforce the law when it comes to actions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies. \u201cUltimately, it might have to be decided by a court,\u201d she said.",
      "Legal scholar Erwin Chemerinsky said Tuesday that a court could have to decide if the ordinance is interfering with the ability of officers to carry out their duties.",
      "\u201cThey key is that it has to apply to all law enforcement. It can't just apply to federal law enforcement,\u201d said Chemerinsky, dean of the law school at the University of California, Berkeley.",
      "Administration officials have defended the practice of officers wearing masks, saying immigration agents have faced harassment as they have gone about their enforcement. Officials said agents are hiding their identities for their safety to avoid things like death threats and doxing, where someone\u2019s personal information is released without their permission on the internet.",

      "In the state legislature, a pending measure would ban local, state, and federal police from covering their faces while conducting operations in California. And a similar bill has been introduced into the U.S. Congress by Democratic senators Alex Padilla, of California, and Cory Booker, of New Jersey.",
      "Chemerinsky said the advantage of federal legislation is that it would \u201cclearly be constitutional\u201d because Congress has the power to regulate how federal law enforcement operates.",
      "County counsel has 60 days to submit the draft ordinance to the board for approval.",
      "Supervisor Hilda Solis, the measure's other co-author, said local officials must set expectations about how law enforcement should conduct themselves while in the county.",
      "\u201cThe use of masks, tactical gear, and refusal to show identification is not only alarming and confusing, but erodes public trust and raises serious safety concerns,\u201d Solis said.",

    "story": [
      "The National Transportation Safety Board will hold three days of hearings on the fatal midair collision between a passenger jet and an Army helicopter",
      "WASHINGTON -- The National Transportation Safety Board will hold three days of hearings starting Wednesday on January's midair collision between an American Airlines passenger jet and an Army helicopter over the nation's capital that killed 67 people.",
      "The goal: Pinpoint exactly what went wrong and what can be done to avoid similar midair crashes between passenger planes and military aircraft. The accident was the nation\u2019s deadliest plane crash since November 2001.",
      "The hearings in Washington will involve NTSB board members, investigators and witnesses. Panels will focus on military helicopter routes in the Washington area, collision avoidance technology and training for air traffic controllers at Ronald Reagan National Airport, among other subjects.",
      "NTSB officials have already said the FAA failed to recognize a concerning pattern after there were 85 near misses in Washington airspace in just three years. The FAA has since banned some helicopter routes to make sure helicopters and planes no longer share the same airspace, but there have still been additional near misses in recent months.",
      "Investigators have also said that the Army helicopter may have had inaccurate altitude readings, and the crew may not have heard key instructions from air traffic controllers.",
      "Meanwhile, federal officials have raised concerns over the nation's overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system. During January's mid-air crash above Washington, one controller was handing both commercial airline and helicopter traffic at the busy airport.",
      "The hearings come at a time of heightened scrutiny of the safety of air travel amid the growing list of aircraft tragedies, mishaps and near misses in 2025. They include an Air India plane crash in June that killed at least 260 people as well as two unrelatedclose calls in the U.S. this month in which passenger jets took evasive action to avoid military planes.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the crash, the investigation so far and other notable aircraft incidents this year.",
      "American Airlines Flight 5342 from Wichita, Kansas, was carrying 60 passengers and four crew members as it approached to land on a clear night at Ronald Reagan National Airport. Nearby, the Army Black Hawk, with three soldiers on board, was practicing emergency evacuation routes that would be used to ferry out key government officials in an emergency.",
      "Investigators have said the helicopter crew was wearing night-vision goggles that would have limited their peripheral vision.",
      "A few minutes before the twin-engine jet was to land, air traffic controllers asked if it could use a shorter runway. The pilots agreed, and flight-tracking sites show the plane turned to adjust its approach. The FAA has since permanently banned that particular helicopter route when planes are using that runway.",
      "Shortly before the collision, a controller got an alert saying the plane and Black Hawk were converging and asked the helicopter if it had the jet in sight. The military pilot said yes and asked for \u201cvisual separation\u201d with the jet for a second time, allowing it to fly closer than if the pilots couldn\u2019t see the plane.",
      "Controllers approved the request roughly 20 seconds before the collision.",
      "The NTSB has said there were 85 dangerous close calls between planes and helicopters near Reagan National in the three years before the crash, and collision alarms had been ordering pilots to take evasive action at least once a month since 2011.",
      "NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy told reporters in February that the Black Hawk\u2019s cockpit recorder suggested an incomplete radio transmission may have left the crew unable to hear air traffic control tell them, just before the crash, to move behind the jet. She said the crew was unable to hear the words \u201cpass behind the\u201d because its microphone key was pressed.",
      "The radio altitude of the helicopter was 278 feet (85 meters) at the time, which would put it above its 200-foot (61-meter) limit for that location.",

      "That generation of Black Hawks typically has two types of altimeters: one relying on barometric pressure and the other on radio frequency signals bounced off the ground. Helicopter pilots typically rely on barometric readings while flying, but the helicopter\u2019s black box captures its radio altitude.",
      "Almost immediately after the crash, President Donald Trump faulted the helicopter for flying too high. He also blamed federal diversity and inclusion efforts, particularly regarding air traffic controllers. When pressed by reporters, the president could not back up those claims. A few days later, he blamed an \u201cobsolete\u201d air traffic control system.",
      "January\u2019s crash prompted the Federal Aviation Administration in March to announce that helicopters would be permanently restricted from flying on the same route where the collision occurred.",
      "However, concerns over Washington\u2019s airspace have persisted. On May 1, military air traffic controllers lost contact with an Army helicopter for about 20 seconds as it neared the Pentagon on a flight that caused two commercial jets to abort their landings. After that incident, the Army paused all flights into and out of the Pentagon as it works with the FAA to address safety issues.",
      "The Army identified the Black Hawk crew as Capt. Rebecca M. Lobach, 28, of Durham, North Carolina; Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O\u2019Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland. O\u2019Hara was the crew chief, and Eaves and Lobach were pilots.",
      "Among the jet\u2019s passengers were several members of the Skating Club of Boston who were returning from a development camp for elite junior skaters that followed the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita.

    "published": "Sun, 27 Jul 2025 09:53:42 -0400",
    "summary": "The singer's love for the Great American Songbook goes far beyond standards written by Gershwin or Porter.",
    "story": [
      "For most of his 50-year career, Michael Feinstein has shown his love for the great American songs by performing them. \"There was something I connected to with the harmonic invention of the songs, the melodic ideas,\" he said. \"They express fundamental emotions in a very eloquent way that people can still relate to.\"",
      "He got his start early, as a little boy In Columbus, Ohio: \"When I was five, my father said, 'Let's get a piano.' I sat down and started playing 'Do-Re-Mi' from 'The Sound of Music' with both hands. My mother came in from the kitchen and said, 'Who taught you that?' And I said, 'Nobody!' And she sent me to my room for lying!\"",
      "He was playing by ear at five years old. Of his childhood he said, \"I always felt weird. I always felt different than everybody else. I was a lonely kid. I didn't have many friends. The first classical record I bought was the Rachmaninoff Second Piano Concerto, while my friends were all listening to Elton John and Carole King and Carly Simon.\"",
      "But his \"unpopular\" hobby soon made him a popular entertainer. For 12 years, he played in piano bars, five or six hours a night. \"It was mainly gay bars,\" he said, \"'cause those are the places where I could play show tunes without anybody complaining about it.\"",
      "He didn't go to college, but he did get an amazing education. For example, \"I learned that I had to program what I was doing as if I was programming a show, with an emotional arc. I learned what to say between the songs that I learned \u2013 patter and jokes and shtick and things that keep people engaged.\"",
      "Feinstein moved to L.A. when he was 20, where he met one of his idols: 80-year-old Ira Gershwin, George Gershwin's lyric-writing brother. Ira was so impressed by the young man's encyclopedic knowledge of Gershwin material that he gave him a job. \"I was only supposed to be there for a couple of weeks to catalog the phonograph records,\" Feinstein said. \"But I ended up spending six years as Ira's musical companion, an amanuensis, which is a nice word for stooge! It was an incredible time, the most exciting time in my life.\"",
      "In 1986, Feinstein got the invitation that changed his life: to perform in the Oak Room at New York's Algonquin Hotel. \"And from that, everything started popping,\" he said.",
      "At 29 years old, Feinstein's career was launched. Decades of glory days lay ahead \u2013 on stage, on PBS, on his 86 albums, and in his lifelong friendship with Liza Minnelli. (He's collaborating with her on her new memoir.) But he didn't just want to sing the Great American Songs; he also wanted to collect them.",
      "He's amassed a vast collection of memorabilia, recordings and scores, such as the first printing of \"Rhapsody in Blue.\"",
      "In recent years Feinstein has become increasingly dedicated to passing his love of the great songs to the next generation. He said, \"I'm carrying the weight of the responsibility to present these songs in a way that hopefully will appeal to them. Every time these songs are introduced to a younger person, it's like planting a seed, because it becomes part of them, and it goes on.\"",
      "In that spirit, Feinstein has established the Great American Songbook Foundation in Carmel, Indiana. There's a museum of songwriter artifacts \u2026 a performing arts center \u2026 and a weeklong Songbook Academy, in which 40 students from around the U.S. are selected to intensively learn about interpreting this music. \"And it's right alongside Taylor Swift or Adele or whoever else they're listening to,\" he said.",
      "For Feinstein the Great American Songbook isn't just music from before 1950: \"I think that Carole King and Billy Joel and Neil Sedaka and Elton John, they're all part of the American Songbook,\" he said. \"It's not just the 1910s and the '20s and the '30s; it is evolving.\"",
      "Michael Feinstein still performs live all over the country, including a concert of Tony Bennett classics (which you can watch on the streaming service Carnegie Hall+ on August 3) \u2013 because maybe the best way of all to keep the classics alive is to keep singing them.",

    "story": [
      "She may be Dame Kristin Scott Thomas, but you're just as likely to find her living in Paris as you might in London. \"My blood is English, but my culture is French,\" she said.",
      "There is a duality about her. She can be as heartwarming in English (\"Darkest Hour\") as she can be heartwrenching in French (\"I've Loved You So Long\"). Many of her foreign films have been showcased at the Cine Lumiere, a French art house in London. \"A little slice of Paris,\" she said.",
      "It's convenient, now that she's back in London, playing the deputy director of MI5 in the Apple TV+ series \"Slow Horses.\"",
      "A chilly, stiff upper-lip has often been a calling card for Thomas \u2013 too stiff, she admits, early on: \"I think it was Sydney Pollock \u2013 or it might have been Robert Redford, take your pick,\" she laughed. \"One of them said to me, 'You know, you have to be generous. Forget what you're trying to defend. Forget trying to hide. Be more generous.' And I'm not sure I really understood what he meant by that. He just planted a seed, and then I was able to kind of unzip a bit more.\"",
      "And she about to unzip even more, creatively digging into something intensely personal in her past. She said, \"When I was five, my father was killed, and my mother remarried. And tragically, he was killed five years later. And I know that a lot of the time when I was a younger woman, I had this feeling of something missing, this piece of my puzzle missing having grown up with only one parent.\"",
      "Both had been pilots in the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm; both were lost in remarkably similar training accidents; and both left a hole that had her climbing out into her imagination. When she was a little girl she wrote and illustrated stories: \"A mommy and a daddy and two children, just doing ordinary things, like going away on holiday and things like that\" \u2013 a family experience she never knew.",
      "The memories of her dad were incomplete, fuzzy, like sketches she played out in her head. But those images became the seeds for what grew into a screenplay, and then came to life as the first movie she's ever directed: \"My Mother's Wedding.\"",
      "It garnered an all-star cast: Scarlett Johansson, Sienna Miller and Emily Beecham play Thomas' daughters who are each struggling in different ways  with the loss of a father or stepfather, just as their mother prepares to marry again.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"My Mother's Wedding\" click on the video player below:",
      "Thomas has already done movie weddings, of course, as in \"Four Weddings and a Funeral.\" Early on, she had a sarcastic confidence about her. She didn't have the most lines in that 1994 film, but in brevity she was brilliant:",
      "That demeanor might have been a surprise to those who knew her when she was bouncing around Royal Naval bases, a bit of a wallflower as a child, even into adulthood. \"I was excruciatingly shy,\" she said. \"I don't know when it changed, to be honest.\"",
      "She's hardly shy anymore, if her character in \"Fleabag\" is any indication. Perhaps it's fitting she was discovered by another admittedly shy success story, Prince. You'd think that would make her a pretty cool mom (she has three children with her first husband), but it turns out \u2026 not so much.",
      "\"I hadn't watched it with them, but as I was leaving my teenage children alone one evening, and they were having pizza and a friend 'round, I said, 'Watch \"Under the Cherry Moon,\" it's on the telly! Come on, it'll be fun!' And when I got back, they weren't actually very polite about it.\"",
      "She has more than made up for it, later starring opposite Robert Redford (\"The Horse Whisperer\"), Harrison Ford (\"Random Hearts\"), and Tom Cruise (\"Mission: Impossible\").",
      "\"I'm so proud to be in 'Mission: Impossible,' I cannot even get over it!\" she said. \"I'm in this thing, which is this enormous monster, and you know, these kids, they have no idea about 'Gosford Park.' They have no idea about 'Four Weddings,' but they've all seen 'Mission: Impossible'! And they have no idea I speak French or do all these other kind of slightly murkier films in France, you know?\"",
      "And then, of course, there was \"The English Patient,\" which earned her an Academy Award nomination for best actress. \"It's quite moving actually, when you see yourself at sort of 30 acting your socks off,\" she said.",
      "Another place she acted her socks off is at the Royal Court Theatre, where she won an Olivier Award for her performance in \"The Seagull,\" a role she later took to Broadway. \"New York audiences, when they are enjoying themselves, I mean it's electric \u2013 you can really, really feel it,\" she said.",
      "And London audiences? \"We are much more kind of passive, perhaps. Reserved. Of course we are!\" she laughed.",
      "But even while talking at the Royal Court, she found herself thinking about her film. As intimate as the stage may be, for her, \"My Mother's Wedding\" is more so. \"I love working on stage, as you can probably tell. I really, really love it. But the joy and satisfaction and exhaustion that comes from filmmaking when you are being a director, that is not far off. Pretty good. It's just extraordinary.\"",
      "At 65, and now a grandmother, she's working as hard as ever, not taking a lot of time to smell the roses per se, but she'll surely stop for someone who has a kind word or two: \"A lady came up to me the other day and said, 'I know you hate this, but I just wanted to say...' \u00a0and I said, 'I don't hate this at all!

      "Louise Nevelson's artwork looks right at home at the Whitney Museum of American Art, mingling with the skyscrapers of Manhattan. She found inspiration in the city as early as the 1920s, yet it would take the art world decades to recognize her and her iconic sculptures.",
      "\"She was given her first respective at the Whitney in 1967,\" said Maria Nevelson, the artist's granddaughter, who runs the Louise Nevelson Foundation. \"I was seven years old. And there was a line of people all the way around the block, up to the front door. I really did get chills. It was the first time I responded to artwork in general, and to my grandmother's artwork.\"",
      "Nearly six decades later, the Whitney is holding a new Nevelson exhibition, which is open until August 10.",
      "Asked what Louise was like as a grandmother, Maria laughed: \"Oh, she was intimidating and unconventional. What comes to mind first is her atmospheric dressing. Anything could have been pulled into this assemblage and this layering of rich brocades and silks.\"",
      "That fancy wardrobe didn't stop Nevelson from getting her hands dirty: \"She'd dumpster dive, she'd get into the garbage can, she'd pull out filthy pieces of wood, and we'd have to take 'em home,\" said Maria. \"I would say the streets of New York weren't paved with gold for her; it was paved with garbage. And she loved it!\"",
      "Nevelson's attraction to wood may have grown from her family tree \u2013 her family owned lumber yards in present-day Ukraine, where she was born in 1899. Louise was a young girl who spoke no English when her father decided to move the family to Rockland, Maine.",
      "\"It was a bustling seaport town,\" said Maria. \"They got off the train and, she said, rednecks threw mud at them. And she said, 'I knew I was a Jew, I knew I was different.' She was about five, six years old then. That's her greeting to America.\"",
      "Undaunted, Nevelson learned English, and at age nine, announced she was going to be a sculptor.",
      "\"She knew always what she wanted to be and do, and she pursued it fiercely,\" said Brooke Minto, executive director and CEO of the Columbus Museum of Art, where Nevelson's work is also currently on display. \"It was a decade's long journey, and she just kept at it.\"",
      "Nevelson would choose a monochromatic palette to unify her materials. Minto said, \"She really understood that she could create an all-over, immersive experience in her sculpture by pairing them down to a single color. It's this wonderful accumulation of very simple and humble objects into something that's quite monumental and immediately historical.\"",
      "According to Maria Nevelson, Louise did her best work when she was in her 70s and 80s, \"right up to when she passed away at 88.\"",
      "In 1979, Charles Osgood, of \"Sunday Morning,\" spoke to Louise when she was 79 years old and, arguably, at the height of her career. The artist remarked, \"You see, dear, if you are doing your creative work, you don't have age or time as such, and consequently you're not caught in it. So, you go on.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve\u00a0said\u00a0Wednesday it's keeping its benchmark interest rate unchanged, citing elevated uncertainty over the nation's economic outlook.",
      "The decision to hold rates steady marks a continuation of the Fed's \"wait-and-see\" strategy this year, as it monitors the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on consumer prices. But Wednesday's policy statement also underscored that the growth remains steady despite concerns about slowing economic activity.",
      "\"Although swings in net exports continue to affect the data, recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year,\" the Federal Open Market Committee, the 12-person central bank's rate-setting panel, said in its statement. \"The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.\"",

It is the first time since 1993 that two member of the Fed's Board of Governors have voted against the chair, according to Capital Economics.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has faced pressure in recent months from President Trump to lower rates, with the president arguing that inflation remains relatively tame.",
      "In a press conference on Wednesday, Powell said most FOMC members voted in favor of maintaining the current rate because inflation remains above the Fed's 2% annual target, while also describing the economy as remaining in good shape.",
      "\"The economy is not performing as though restrictive policy were holding it back inappropriately,\" he said.",
      "Powell added, \"The economy is in good shape, but it's an unusual situation in that you have risks to both sides of the mandate,\" referring to the Fed's dual goal of keeping both prices and unemployment low.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The central bank on Wednesday said it would maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The last time the central bank cut interest rates was in December 2024, when it trimmed rates by 0.25 percentage points.",
      "Wall Street had anticipated the Fed's decision, with economists pegging the probability the central bank would hold rates steady at 96%, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "Why is the Fed holding rates steady?",

At the same time, the economy remains solid, with today's GDP report showing stronger than expected second-quarter growth of 3%, providing more ammunition to back up the Fed's argument for keeping rates steady, economists say.",
      "\"This [GDP] report is unlikely to shift the Federal Reserve's stance,\" said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, in an email prior to the Fed's decision. The central bank will \"wait for more consistent signals before considering rate cuts.\"",
      "When could the Fed cut rates?",
      "Economists currently predict a 63% likelihood the Fed will cut rates at its Sept. 17 meeting, according to FactSet. The Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's rate-setting panel, doesn't meet in August, making the September meeting the next chance for a rate cut.",
      "Although the economy has proved resilient despite concerns about the impact of U.S. tariffs, some economists expect growth to lag and inflation to accelerate over the next few months. Following the latest Fed statement, Pantheon Macroeconomics chief U.S. economist Samuel Tombs forecast that the Fed will ease its benchmark rate by a total of 0.75 percentage points by year-end, starting in September.",
      "Asked whether the Fed could cut rates at the September meeting, Powell demurred noting that the decision will be based on economic data that is released between now and the central bank's next meeting on Sept. 16-17. In the lead-up to that decision, the Fed will assess two monthly job reports from the Department of Labor and two additional months' of Consumer Price Index data.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday announced a 25% tariff rate on imports from India ahead of his administration's Aug. 1 deadline to strike trade deals with dozens of other countries. American importers such as Walmart are on the hook for paying the tariffs, although many companies stocked up on goods earlier this year to try to avoid hiking prices for inflation-weary customers.",

      "The country's GDP increased at an annual rate of 3% in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That's higher than the 2% pace forecast for the April-to-June period, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The number represents a turnaround from the first three months of 2025, when GDP fell 0.5%, the worst quarterly performance for the economy since early 2022. The new data also shows consumers increased spending since the last quarter, with growth of 1.4%, up from 0.5% from January to March. The number is still down significantly from 4% in the\u00a0final\u00a0quarter of 2024.",
      "When it comes to assessing the strength of the economy, a more revealing number tucked into the GDP report is what is known as \"final sales to private domestic purchasers,\" which excludes government spending, inventories and net exports. That number rose at only a 1.2% annual rate from April to May \u2014 the weakest since late 2022 and a sign that demand is weakening.",
      "What the numbers mean",
      "GDP data offers a broad yardstick for measuring the overall health of the economy, with periods of fast growth typically coinciding with robust consumer spending, ample job growth and healthy corporate profits. This year, however, experts say the Trump administration's tariffs on U.S. economic partners have complicated the picture.",
      "\"As was the case in Q1, volatile trade flows are skewing the GDP performance (the 3% growth primarily reflects a decrease in imports and an acceleration in consumer spending that were partially offset by a downturn in investment),\" Adam Crisafulli, head of investment research firm Vital Knowledge, said in a report.",
      "Thomas Ryan, North America economist at investor advisory firm Capital Economics, said in a note that the surge in GDP \"overstates the economy's underlying strength\" because the growth spurt in the second quarter was largely driven by a 30% decline in imports after U.S. tariffs took effect.",
      "GDP slumped in the first quarter, falling 0.5% from January to March, largely due to a surge in U.S. imports as consumers and businesses rushed to buy goods from abroad before stepped-up tariffs took effect.",
      "In calculating GDP, imports are seen as reducing growth because they reflect purchases from overseas, rather than goods and services produced in the U.S. By contrast, exports boost a country's GDP because they reflect domestic goods and services that were sold abroad.",
      "The upshot: Through the first half of 2025, the economy grew at an average rate of 1.25%. That's markedly slower than the pace of growth in 2024, when GDP for the full year rose 2.8%, noted Dean Baker, a senior economist at Center for Economic and Policy Research.",
      "Where the economy is headed",
      "Although the 3% GDP rate in Wednesday's report may be skewed by the president's trade policies, experts say the overall economy remains solid and shows no signs of crumbling.",
      "\"Beneath the topline figure, the economy is switching to a lower gear but not going in reverse,\" Bernard Yaros, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note.",
      "Yaros added that consumers are slowing \u2014 but not switching off \u2014 their spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds economic activity.",
      "Still, EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco notes that economic activity is slowing as inflationary pressures rise \u2014 a trend likely to persist throughout the summer. He predicts real GDP growth to slow to a rate of 0.9% year over year by the fourth quarter.",
      "Another indicator of the health of the economy will come Wednesday afternoon, when the Federal Reserve announces its rate decision. The central bank is again expected to hold rates steady.

That compares with a 60% increase in delinquencies during that time for households earning between $45,000 and $150,000, and a 22% increase for people earning less than $45,000, according to data from credit-scoring company VantageScore.",

      "About 38% of all new jobs created in the five years before the pandemic paid above-average wages, VantageScore's data shows.

That poses a challenge to higher-income Americans who suffer a job loss because it may be tougher to find new employment than in previous years.",

      "To be sure, the overall rate of loan delinquencies in the U.S. remains higher for low- and middle-income consumers than for high-income earners, according to VantageScore. For instance, the delinquency rate for households earning at least $150,000 now stands at about 0.34%, versus 1.75% for low-income households. But the rise in delinquencies has accelerated faster for higher-income households than for other groups, the firm's data shows.",
      "A worrying sign?",
      "A key question for the U.S. is whether the financial challenges facing high-income Americans could portend a broader economic downturn. Notably, consumption by wealthier Americans now contributes about half of all consumer spending, the main engine for economic growth. By comparison, in 1990 spending by Americans higher up the economic ladder accounted for about one-third of all spending.",
      "At the same time, low- and middle-income households are also facing stiffer financial headwinds with about six in 10 middle-income consumers saying they're financially stressed, according to a recent survey from financial services company Primerica.",
      "More than one-third of middle-income households, or those earning between $30,000 to $130,000, say they've increased their credit card usage, the survey found.",
      "Retailers and major consumer brands have also been warning that some consumers are cutting back or are more cautious in their purchases.",
      "Shoppers are \"looking for value, either in smaller packs and promotions or in larger pack sizes in the club channel and online,\" Procter & Gamble Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten said on an earnings conference call Tuesday. \"That's the behavior we've been outlined before, but it's not stopped. It continued.\"",
      "Widespread consumer frustration with high prices is thought to have boosted President Trump during the 2024 electoral campaign against Joe Biden, when Mr. Trump vowed to end\u00a0the \"inflation nightmare.\" So far, inflation has remained relatively muted in 2025, although June's 2.7% annualized rate remains higher than the Federal Reserve's goal of reaching a 2% rate.",
      "Yet more consumers are now expressing frustration with the Trump administration's economic policies, according to a new CBS News poll that found nearly 64% of Americans now disapprove of how the president is handling inflation. The survey was conducted from July 16-18 and polled 2,343 adults.",
      "As for Americans who are struggling to keep up with credit-card debt and auto loans, they aren't likely to see relief anytime soon. Although Mr. Trump has been pushing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates, economists think the central bank is very likely to stand pat when officials announce their latest policy move on Wednesday.",

    "published": "Wed, 30 Jul 2025 11:53:10 -0400",
    "summary": "A new proposed bill would protect both workers and American consumers from bad experiences with AI.",
    "story": [
      "Have you ever found yourself repeating the words \"speak to a human please\" while on the phone with customer service? If so, you're among the roughly 70% of Americans who find interacting with automated phone systems, versus human customer support representatives, frustrating.",
      "That's in part why Senator Ruben Gallego wants to ensure that consumers who find themselves on the phone with a customer service agent are in fact speaking to a human, and one who is in the U.S., if that's their preference. He's also well aware of the threat artificial intelligence poses to American workers, and is committed to protecting the roughly three million Americans who work in call centers across the country, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "A new bipartisan bill, called the \"Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025,\" introduced by Sen. Gallego and Sen. Jim Justice of West Virginia on Wednesday, proposes to ensure such jobs remain in the U.S. by limiting federal benefits for companies who ship them overseas.",
      "What does the bill require of companies?",
      "The bill would require businesses that decide to ship call centers overseas to notify the Department of Labor at least 120 days before making such a move. It would also direct the DOL to maintain a public list of employers that have relocated call center work overseas. Under the bill, employers would remain on the list for five years, absent efforts to return call center jobs to the U.S.",
      "Companies on such a list would be ineligible for new federal grants and federal guaranteed loans, under the proposed bill, while nonlisted companies would be given preference for federal contracts. Additionally, the DOL would be required to track any call center job losses related to AI.",
      "How would it protect consumers?",
      "To protect consumers, the bill would mandate that call center workers immediately disclose their physical locations to callers, and disclose whether AI is being used. Also, customers would be able to request to be transferred to a U.S.-based call center, if they so desired, under the proposed piece of legislation.",
      "\"People want to have the option of speaking to a human or AI. This isn't new \u2014who hasn't pressed zero repeatedly to try to skip the automated systems because they want to talk to a human? This is a consumer check people want to see,\" Sen. Gallego told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In addition to supporting domestic jobs, keeping call center work in the U.S. helps safeguard American consumers' data, he said.",
      "\"We are concerned about what it means for American consumers if they're not talking to a human based in the U.S., when it comes to security around their private information,\" Sen. Gallego said.",
      "On the topic of AI taking over work currently performed by humans, Gallego acknowledged that the technology will inevitably bring about some job displacement.",
      "\"There will be changes and AI will cause some unemployment,\" he said. \"We can't stop it entirely.\"",
      "The senator added that he is not completely opposed to AI taking over some customer service work, either. \"If someone has a really good experience with an AI bot, there won't be a problem as long as that person knows they're talking to AI versus to a human,\" Gallego said.",
      "The Communications Workers of America (CWA) endorsed the proposed bill.",
      "\"This much-needed legislation protects U.S. call center jobs and addresses the growing threats posed by artificial intelligence and offshoring,\" (CWA) Director of Government Affairs, Dan Mauer said in a statement. \"Historically, companies have offshored customer service jobs to avoid paying good union wages and benefits. Now companies are using AI to de-skill and speed up work and displace jobs, which undermines worker rights and degrades service quality for consumers.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Wednesday the U.S. would impose tariffs of 25% on imports from India \u2014 in addition to an unspecified \"penalty\" \u2014 for what he said were its high tariffs and trade barriers, and for its large purchases of military equipment and energy from Russia.",
      "Mr. Trump posted about the tariffs on India on social media Wednesday morning, saying, \"Remember, while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their Tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the World, and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers of any Country.\"",
      "The president criticized India for buying energy products from Russia \"at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE.\"",
      "In a separate post, the president said, \"WE HAVE A MASSIVE TRADE DEFICIT WITH INDIA!!!\"",
      "Although U.S. exports to India rose in 2024, its trade deficit also rose by 5.4%, to $45.7 billion. The director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, told reporters Wednesday morning, \"India has had a market that's been pretty much closed to American products, and we've been wide open to theirs. And I think President Trump is frustrated with the progress we've made with India, but feels that a 25% tariff will address and remedy the situation in a way that's good for the American people.\"",
      "When Mr. Trump met with\u00a0Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u00a0at the White House in February, he said the U.S. would be increasing military sales to India and that the two countries had reached an agreement on oil and gas that would make the U.S. India's leading supplier.",

    "summary": "President Trump has pressured Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. Here's what the experts think will happen at today's monetary policy meeting.",
    "story": [
      "During a\u00a0meeting last week between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the president sought to underscore what he said is a \"very simple\" request: \"Interest rates have to come down.\"",
      "That wish isn't likely to be granted when the Fed announces its next interest rate decision today. Economists put the probability of the central bank holding rates steady at 96%, according to FactSet. The Fed has maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5% since December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's second-term inauguration in January, as policy makers try to douse the flickering embers of inflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has for months\u00a0derided Powell  over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs, which experts say would boost economic growth but could cause consumer prices to flare. Upping the pressure, Trump administration officials also have said the Fed chair's handline of a\u00a0building renovation\u00a0at the Fed could be grounds for firing.",
      "Despite such criticism, Powell has maintained his stance that no immediate rate cuts are necessary given that the economy remains solid. The Fed chair, who Mr. Trump nominated to head the central bank in 2017, has also suggested he wants to keep its powder dry in case the Trump administration's steep new tariffs cause inflation to reignite.",
      "\"With the labor market holding up and the impact of tariffs on inflation starting to rear its ugly head, the Federal Reserve has plenty of ammunition to justify keeping interest rates unchanged at the July meeting,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet said in a July 24 research note.",
      "In making his case for lowering interest rates, Mr. Trump has pointed to rate cuts\u00a0earlier this year by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, while also pointing out that U.S. inflation so far in 2025 has remained relatively low.",
      "However, the Consumer Price Index \u2014 a key gauge for tracking inflation \u2014 in June rose to an annualized rate of 2.7%, well above the Fed's 2% annual target and a sign that that tariffs could be pushing some prices higher.",
      "Fed policy makers are meeting this week to discuss what to do on interest rates. Here's what to know.",
      "When is the Fed making its rate cut decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve will make its next rate cut decision at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday, July 30, followed by a 2:30 p.m. ET press conference with Powell, when he will offer his view on the the state of the economy and answer questions from financial journalists about the Fed's economic outlook.",
      "Who makes decisions on interest rates?",
      "The decision is made by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, with a voting majority deciding whether the central bank should cut, hike or maintain the benchmark rate. In other words, no single person, including Fed Chair Powell, determines the central bank's monetary policy.",
      "Lately, at least two members of the FOMC \u2014 Federal Reserve governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 have signaled their belief that it is time to cut rates.",
      "\"[I]f there were a pair of dissents in July, it would match the most since 1993,\" Sweet of Oxford Economics noted.. \"From our perspective, dissents are normal and a good thing as it highlights that the Fed isn't falling into the trap of groupthink.\"",
      "Could the Fed cut rates today?",
      "It's not impossible, but highly unlikely. Economists estimate the chances of a rate cut at just 4%, according to FactSet. CME FedWatch, a closely watched monetary policy tracker, also suggests only a very remote probability of a cut.",
      "For now, data continues to shows steady, if slowing, economic growth, with employers in June\u00a0hiring more workers than forecast and inflation remaining relatively muted.\u00a0On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said second-quarter GDP rose at an annual rate of 3%, far outpacing the forecast for 2% growth.",
      "The threat from tariffs as well as stronger-than-expected GDP data means \"the Fed is all but certain to keep rates unchanged again this week, with futures markets pricing in effectively no chance of a cut,\" Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, in an email.",
      "The Fed is likely to hold off on cutting rates to give them room to maneuver if conditions deteriorate, economists note.",
      "Interest rates are the Fed's most powerful tool for nudging growth forward when the economy slows and cooling activity when inflation jumps. A rate hike makes it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, curbing spending and putting the brakes on inflation. By contrast, cuts make it cheaper to borrow, fueling spending and corporate investment, which can spark inflation.",
      "\"Policymakers remain cautious, navigating persistent inflationary risks tied to trade policy along with cooling labor market conditions and growing political pressure from the administration to accelerate rate cuts,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in an email.",
      "How has Powell responsed to pressure from Mr. Trump?",
      "Powell has repeatedly stated that the Federal Reserve's decisions are based solely on economic data as it pursues its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and ensuring full employment.",
      "Because Mr. Trump has been pushing for lower rates, Powell is likely to face questions at his press conference Wednesday press about political pressure. Powell may also be asked about the president's remarks about\u00a0replacing him as Fed chair, he added. Powell's current term as chair ends in May 2026.",
      "\"The odds are that [Powell] sticks with his mantra that it doesn't impact monetary policy and he isn't resigning while dodging questions about a shadow Fed chair,\" Sweet said, referring to the possibility that Mr. Trump could decide to nominate Powell's successor months before he is due to step down in hopes of influencing investor expectations for monetary policy.",
      "When is the Fed more likely to lower interest rates?",
      "The Fed is more likely to lower its benchmark rate at its Sept. 16-17 meeting, according to FactSet, with economists pegging the likelihood of a cut at 63%. The FOMC doesn't meet in August, making the September meeting the next chance for a rate cut.",
      "Economists who predict a rate cut at the September meeting are forecasting a 0.25 percentage point reduction, which would take the federal funds rate down to a range of 4% to 4.25%.",
      "\"With no imminent need to act.. the Fed will likely wait until September to deliver the next 25 [basis point] rate cut,\" Daco said. \"We continue to expect two rate cuts in 2025, followed by a further 100bps of easing in 2026 as economic and labor market conditions deteriorate more visibly.\"",

      "\"It is an asymmetric and unbalanced deal,\" economists with investment bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said in a report. The EU decided neither to retaliate nor to increase its tariffs, and is even expected to reduce them. The EU agreed to a bad deal rather than risk trade war escalation.\"",
      "The average tariff on U.S. imports from the EU will surge from 1.2% in 2024 to 17.5%, according to investor advisory firm Capital Economics. That will reduce the EU's annual gross domestic product by 0.2%, the investment advisory firm forecast.",
      "EU countries annually ship more than $300 billion in goods to the U.S., accounting for more than 20% of total U.S. imports. Mexico ranks second among America's trade partners at roughly 15% of U.S. imports, while Canada accounts for 11% (see chart at bottom.)",
      "The deal, announced Sunday by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, while American goods exported to the union's 27 member countries will face no tariffs. Previously, U.S. exports to the EU faced an average tariff of roughly 1%, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.",

Perhaps most important, it is better than the alternative given that Mr. Trump had threatened to slap a 30% tariff on EU imports.",
      "More broadly, the EU deal and the Trump administration's framework agreement with Japan last week \u2014 both of which set 15% as a baseline tariff \u2014 also could help pave the way for trade agreements with Canada, Korea, Mexico and other countries, including on key sectors like autos, experts said.",

      "European auto exports would face a 15% levy, down from 25%, according to Goldman Sachs. Von der Leyen also said the U.S. would eliminate tariffs on some products, including aircraft and parts, semiconductor manufacturing gear, natural resources, some farm products, and certain chemicals and generic drugs. Likewise, the EU would abolish tariffs on those products.",
      "Neither the U.S. nor the EU has released details of the pact, and lobbying by some industries is expected to continue. For example, Unione Italiana Vini, an Italian trade group representing winemakers, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Monday that a 15% tariff on EU imports will result in a a $371 million hit for exporters.",
      "\"We are now calling on the Italian government and the EU to consider appropriate measures to safeguard a sector that has grown significantly thanks to U.S. buyers,\" the group's president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, said in a statement, while acknowledging that the\u00a0 deal \"at least resolved the uncertainty that was stalling the market.\"",
      "According to the group's analysis, a bottle of Italian wine that previously retailed for $11.50 in the U.S. will now cost nearly $15 under the new tariff agreement.",
      "The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents German automakers, also said a 15% U.S. tariff on the country's automotive products will hurt its car manufacturers, while noting that the new tariff rate amounts to a reprieve from the 25% automobile levies EU nations have faced since April.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 13:47:01 -0400",
    "summary": "Opening arguments start Thursday in a federal case that could upend President Trump's signature trade policy.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's trade policy faces a critical test this week as a federal court weighs the legality of its sweeping tariffs.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Thursday in V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, a case brought by five small business owners and 12 states who allege they have been harmed by President\u00a0Trump's import taxes. V.O.S., the lead plaintiff in the case, is a New-York based wine importer.",
      "The lawsuit challenges President Trump's claim that he has authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) to issue tariffs, a process that normally requires congressional approval.",
      "A victory by the plaintiffs could deal a blow to Mr. Trump as he seeks to negotiate trade deals with U.S. economic partners. The U.S. and the European Union on Sunday\u00a0announced a pact, easing tension over a brewing trade war. But the White House has yet to reach deals with other major trading partners, including Canada, Mexico, South Korea and China.",
      "What both sides are arguing",
      "The plaintiffs in the V.O.S. case argue that Mr. Trump exceeded his authority when he bypassed congressional approval and invoked IEEPA as the legal\u00a0basis\u00a0for imposing his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on April 2. Mr. Trump also drew on IEEPA in deploying a separate set of\u00a0tariffs\u00a0in February against Canada, Mexico and China that he said was aimed at stemming the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl.",
      "\"This case is about more than high tariffs,\" Brent Skorup, a legal fellow at the Cato Institute, a Washington, D.C., nonpartisan think tank, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's about whether a president can stretch a vague statute beyond recognition to sidestep Congress.\"",
      "IEEPA, among other things, gives the president authority to regulate transactions with foreign countries during national emergencies. However, no U.S. president has ever invoked IEEPA as a justification for imposing tariffs.",
      "\"It's limited to emergencies where there is an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' \u2014 and the trade deficit is hardly an emergency. It's been with us for basically 50 years\" said Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Liberty Justice Center, a nonpartisan public interest law representing the five businesses that have filed suit in the case.",
      "The White House has defended President Trump's use of IEEPA to impose tariffs.",
      "\"The administration is legally and fairly using tariff powers that have been granted to the executive branch by the Constitution and Congress to level the playing field for American workers and safeguard our national security,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "Why the case is important",
      "Mr. Trump has said tariffs are necessary to eliminate trade imbalances with other countries, which he said constitutes an \"unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States.\"",
      "But a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs could have broader implications for trade policy, forcing Mr. Trump to seek congressional approval in imposing tariffs, Schwab said.",
      "\"If the court holds that the President's Liberation Day and fentanyl tariffs are unlawful, then he would not have authority to set those tariff rates, but still Congress could approve these deals \u2014 just like it did the NAFTA renegotiation in the first Trump term,\" Schwab said in an email.",
      "Presidents can draw on\u00a0other statutes, such as Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, to authorize the use of tariffs.",
      "How we got here",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade in May\u00a0struck down Mr. Trump's tariffs, with a three-judge panel ruling that the levies exceeded \"any authority granted to the president by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs.\"",
      "At the time, the trade court said the 10% reciprocal tariffs are designed to deal with trade imbalances, which the judges said did not constitute an emergency under IEEPA. But a federal appeals court in May\u00a0blocked the trade court ruling\u00a0and reinstated the tariffs after the Trump administration appealed.",
      "After the trade court ruling in May, Desai\u00a0said\u00a0Mr. Trump would use \"all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "The case now heads to the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., where lawyers from both parties will present their arguments. The court could issue a decision as early as August, Schwab told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That decision likely won't be the end of the road for the case, with Schwab expecting the losing party to appeal to the Supreme Court.",

    "story": [
      "Novo Nordisk shares plunged over 20% on Tuesday after the company named a new CEO and lowered its profit expectations, citing weaker sales of its popular weight-loss drug Wegovy due to competition from copycat drugs.",
      "In a statement on Tuesday, Novo Nordisk said\u00a0it expects its sales for 2025 to grow 8%-14%, down from projections of 13%-21% in May. It also lowered its expectations for operating profit growth to 10%-16%, down from 16%-24% in May.",
      "The updated outlook \"reflects the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition,\" the company said. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1s), a class of drugs used to manage diabetes,\u00a0have upended the weight-loss industry.",
      "The Danish pharmaceutical company also announced on Tuesday the appointment of Maziar Mike Doustdar as president and CEO. Doustdar, who has worked at Novo Nordisk for over 30 years, will take the helm starting on Aug. 7.",
      "Doustdar will succeed Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, who announced his departure as CEO of Novo Nordisk in May, following a steep decline in the company's share price, which has dropped nearly 37% since the start of this year.",
      "Reached for comment, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said they did not have anything additional to share before the company's earnings call, which is scheduled for Wednesday, Aug. 6.",
      "Copycat drugs pervade market",
      "While global sales of Wegovy are growing, sales of the weight-loss drug are expected to weaken in certain markets due to increased competition from compounded versions of the drug.",
      "Compounded weight-loss drugs have the same active ingredients as Wegovy and other popular brands such as Ozempic, and are used as substitutes when the name-brand drugs aren't available. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April said there is no longer a shortage of GLP-1s and\u00a0ordered compounding pharmacies to stop selling their copycat versions of the popular weight-loss drugs.",
      "Despite efforts to stymie them, however, compounded versions of the drugs continue to penetrate the market, giving consumers a cheaper option to name-brands like Wegovy, which can cost more than\u00a0$1000 per package for those without insurance.",
      "In June, Novo Nordisk ended its partnership with Hims & Hers Health over claims that the online drug retailer was selling fake versions of Wegovy, a move Novo Nordisk\u00a0said \"put patient safety at risk.\"",
      "CBS News medical contributor Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder\u00a0told CBS News last year that there is not a lot of oversight over the compounded drug market, and that there is a wide range when it comes to the quality and risk associated with each drug.",
      "Novo Nordisk said it is pursuing multiple avenues to \"protect patients from knockoff 'semaglutide' drugs\" including litigation. Semaglutide is the active ingredient found in Wegovy and Ozempic.",
      "\"Novo Nordisk is deeply concerned that, without aggressive intervention by federal and state regulators and law enforcement, patients will continue to be exposed to the significant risks posed by knockoff 'semaglutide' drugs made with illicit or inauthentic foreign active pharmaceutical ingredients,\" the company said in its statement.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/young-people-trumps-job-handling-cbs-news-analysis/",
    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 12:51:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Most Americans under 30 approved at the start of President Trump's second term but are dissatisfied with the economy's direction.",
    "story": [
      "Since Donald Trump took office for his second term, his job ratings have markedly\u00a0declined\u00a0\u2014 and more with young people than any other age group. What has made so many young Americans change their minds so quickly?",
      "For context, President Trump's electoral performance with voters under 30 improved a lot in 2024: While he lost this group to former Vice President Kamala Harris, it was by a much smaller margin than in 2020. And men under 30 ended up splitting roughly evenly between Trump and Harris. These trends prompted some observers to marvel at how conservative Gen Z had become, especially young men, and to wonder whether it marked a durable change.",
      "About half a year on from Inauguration Day, many young people have changed their minds on Trump. It looks more like many young voters gave him the benefit of the doubt when he took office, but their evaluations of him quickly started to sink. Among Americans ages 18-29, his job approval rating has fallen from a high of 55% just after he was inaugurated to 28% now. That means that half of his former approvers now disapprove. In percentage-point terms, the size of that drop is more than double what we've seen in any other age group.",
      "Which young voters have dropped off?",
      "Among young people, it's the less partisan and politically engaged who have seen the steepest drops. For example, about half of independents under 30 approved of Mr. Trump in February, but that has dropped to about one in five now. The same is true of young people who didn't vote in the 2024 election. Party identifiers and '24 voters have fallen off, too, but not to the same extent.",
      "There are also differences by gender, with young men starting out more approving of Mr. Trump than young women were. Women's ratings of the president had already begun dipping by March, while it was not until April\u00a0\u2014 and the downturn in the U.S. stock market \u2014 that young men's ratings started to decline. Both have fallen steadily since then, but a faster drop among young men in the last few months has meant the gender gap in approval of Mr. Trump has shrunk. (See the bottom of this article for statistical details on estimating these smaller subgroups.)",
      "CBS News polling over the past few months offers several clues as to what young people are unhappy about these days.",
      "A majority now say Mr. Trump is doing different things than he promised during the 2024 campaign. That's a reversal in sentiment from early February, when seven in 10 said he's doing what he said he would. And it's young men who have been the most likely to flip on this question.",
      "On top of that, the administration is experiencing low points on several economic evaluations:",
      "The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good.\u00a0Over time, young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad.",
      "The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good.\u00a0Over time, young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad.",
      "Six in 10 also tell us that Mr. Trump's policies are making them worse off financially. That is the highest we've seen to date, and it represents a complete change from what young people expected when he was inaugurated. Back then, they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off.",

That is the highest we've seen to date, and it represents a complete change from what young people expected when he was inaugurated. Back then, they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off.",
      "And majorities feel the Trump administration is focusing too much on tariffs (72%), deportations (64%), and ending DEI programs (55%). These shares have all grown significantly over time. By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue.",

By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue.",
      "Looking back and ahead ...",
      "Instead of marking a permanent rightward shift, Mr. Trump's better-than-expected performance with young voters last year is beginning to look more like a temporary reaction. Indeed, less partisan voters tend to be more responsive to short-term forces, like the economic conditions that drove many to the ballot box in 2024. And when Trump was inaugurated, many young people hoped he would turn the economy around, with his initial ratings likely reflecting some optimism. This honeymoon period quickly faded. His 18-29 rating is now below Joe Biden's when he left office.",
      "Looking ahead to 2026, Republicans' electoral success may depend on both the president's numbers and youth turnout. If views of Mr. Trump's job handling don't improve over the next year, they could be a drag on GOP congressional candidates. And while young voters are less likely to turn out in non-presidential years, both the 2018 and 2022 midterms saw record numbers go to the polls, including voters under 30. In fact, in 2022, young voters turned out at a rate that came close to saving the Democrats' majority. In a tight contest, they could be pivotal again.",
      "Estimating small subgroups in polls",
      "To more precisely estimate trends in approval among young people, I aggregated our polls and ran a statistical model that controls for respondents' race, education level, 2024 vote, and survey date.",
      "Why take this approach? All polls have a margin of error, and the margin of error is greater for subgroups within the poll, as a function of sample size and routine weighting. So, even though young people are represented proportionate to their share of the population, estimating what percentage of them approve of the president naturally comes with a higher margin of error. It's driven by random variation in which types of young people respond to a given poll, and margins of error grow as you slice data more thinly \u2014 for instance, in disaggregating young people by gender.",
      "Since a single poll can only do so much, we can combine data across polls to boost sample sizes and gain confidence in our estimates. Aggregating surveys yields sample sizes of over 1,200 men and 1,300 women under 30 to analyze. And the model smoothens out poll-to-poll randomness within these subgroups.",
      "The modeled estimates for any given time point are consistently within range of the unmodeled survey data, typically within a few points. And importantly, they tell the same story: both young men and young women's views of Trump have worsened, and the gender gap has decreased.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 11:40:12 -0400",
    "summary": "Union Pacific is seeking to buy Norfolk Southern in a $85 billion deal that would create the first transcontinental railroad in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Union Pacific wants to buy Norfolk Southern in a $85 billion deal that would create the first transcontinental railroad in the U.S, and potentially trigger a final wave of rail mergers across the country.",
      "The proposed merger, announced Tuesday, would marry Union Pacific's vast rail network in the West with Norfolk's rails that snake across 22 Eastern states, and the District of Columbia.",
      "The nation was first linked by rail in 1869, when a golden railroad spike was driven in Utah to symbolize the connection of East and West Coasts. Yet no single entity has controlled that coast-to-coast passage.",
      "The railroads argue a merger would streamline deliveries of raw materials and goods nationwide by eliminating delays when shipments are handed off between railroads. The AP first reported the merger talks earlier this month a week before the railroads confirmed the discussions last week.",
      "Any deal would be closely scrutinized by antitrust regulators that have set a very high bar for railroad deals after previous consolidation in the industry led to massive backups and snarled traffic.",
      "Pressure on remaining railroads",
      "If the deal is approved, the two remaining major American railroads \u2014 BNSF and CSX \u2014 will face tremendous pressure to merge to create a second transcontinental railroad so they can compete. The continent's two other major railroads \u2014 Canadian National and CPKC \u2014 may also get involved. The Canadian rails span all of that nation and feed into America. CPKC rails stretch south into Mexico",
      "Some big shippers like chemical plants in the Gulf may be wary of the deal due to fears of a monopoly that could would wield immense influence over rates, but other major rail customers, like Amazon and UPS, may be in favor if it means packages will arrive more quickly and reliably. Those big companies, along with unions and communities across the country that the railroads cross, will have a chance to weigh before the U.S. Surface Transportation Board.",
      "Consumers could benefit if the transcontinental rail does reduce shipping rates and delivery times. Union Pacific said that combined, the railroads would improve delivery times.",
      "There's speculation that this deal might win approval under the pro-business Trump administration, but the STB is currently evenly split between two Republicans and two Democrats. The board is led by a Republican, and Trump will appoint a fifth member before this deal will be considered.",
      "Union Pacific is offering $20 billion cash and one share of its stock to complete the deal. Norfolk Southern shareholders would receive one UP share and $88.82 in cash for each one of their shares as part of the deal that values NS at roughly $320 per share. Norfolk Southern closed at just over $260 a share earlier this month before the first reports speculating about a deal.",
      "Union Pacific's stock fell nearly 2% to $224.98 in premarket trading, while Norfolk Southern's stock dipped more than 3% to $277.40.",
      "Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena, who has championed a merger, said lumber from the Pacific Northwest and plastics produced on the Gulf Coast and steel made in Pittsburgh will all reach their destinations more seamlessly.",
      "\"It builds upon President Abraham Lincoln's vision of a transcontinental railroad from nearly 165 years ago, and will usher in a new era of American innovation,\" Vena told investors Tuesday.",
      "From 30 to 6",
      "U.S. railroads have already undergone extensive consolidation. There were more than 30 major freight railroads in the early 1980s. Today, six major railroads handle the majority of shipments nationwide.",
      "Western rival BNSF, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, has the war chest to pursue an acquisition of CSX, to the east, if it chooses. CEO Warren Buffett is sitting on more than $348 billion cash and the consummate dealmaker may want to swing for the fences one last time before stepping down as planned at the end of the year.",
      "Buffett recently threw cold water on reports that he had enlisted Goldman Sachs to advise him on a potential rail deal in an interview with CNBC, but he rarely uses investment bankers anyway. Buffett reached an agreement to buy the parts of the BNSF railroad he didn't already own for $26.3 billion after a private meeting with its CEO more than a decade ago.",
      "Yet there's widespread debate over whether a major rail merger would be approved by the Surface Transportation Board, which has established a high bar for consolidation in the crucial rail industry.",
      "That's largely due to the aftermath of a consolidation in the U.S nearly 30 years ago that involved Union Pacific. It merged with Southern Pacific in 1996 and the tie-up led to an extended period of snarled traffic on U.S. rails. Three years later, Conrail was divvied up by Norfolk Southern and CSX, which led to more backups in the East.",
      "\"We're committed to making sure that doesn't happen in this case,\" said Norfolk CEO Mark George. He added that the railroads will spend the next two years planning for a smooth integration before this deal might get approved.",
      "Just two years ago, the STB approved the first major rail merger in more than two decades. In that deal, which was supported by big shippers, Canadian Pacific acquired Kansas City Southern for $31 billion to create the CPKC railroad.",
      "There were compelling factors in that deal, however, that combined the two smallest major freight railroads. The combined railroad, regulators reasoned, would benefit trade across North America. The deal announced Tuesday would merge the nation's largest freight railroad, with the smallest.",
      "Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern said they expect to submit their application for approval within the next six months and hope the deal would get approved by early 2027. They predict that they would be able to eliminate $1 billion in costs annually, but Vena said that every union worker at both railroads should still have a job. The railroads also predict they would be able to boost revenue by at least $1.75 billion each year by winning more business from trucking companies and other railroads.",
      "On Tuesday, Norfolk Southern reported a $768 million second-quarter profit, or $3.41 per share, as volume grew 3%. That's up from $737 million, or $3.25 per share, a year ago, but the results were affected by insurance payments from its 2023 East Palestine derailment and restructuring costs.",
      "Without the one-time factors, Norfolk Southern made $3.29 per share, which was just below the $3.31 per share that analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted.",

    "summary": "Trump says he's \"very disappointed\" with Vladimir Putin, and he's shortening the deadline for the Russian leader to agree a ceasefire with Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Monday a significant tightening of his deadline for Russia's Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine. He said as he met with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer during his visit to Scotland that the 50-day deadline he announced earlier this month would be reduced to less than two weeks, citing a lack of progress in negotiations.",
      "Mr. Trump said as he headed in for his meeting with Starmer that he was \"very disappointed\" in Russia's leader over the ongoing bombing of Ukrainian cities, and that the deadline he gave Russia a couple weeks ago to agree to a truce would be reduced.",
      "Mr. Trump said earlier this month that if Russia failed to agree to a ceasefire within the 50-day timeframe, the U.S. would impose secondary tariffs of up to 100% on goods sold by countries that continue to do business with Russia. That would have meant a deal agreed by around the end of August.",
      "But Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday, as he sat down with Starmer, that he was \"going to make a new deadline of about 10 or 12 days from today.\"",
      "\"There's no reason in waiting,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We just don't see any progress being made.\"",
      "\"I've spoken to President Putin a lot, I've gotten along with him very well,\" Mr. Trump said earlier, before sitting down with Starmer.",
      "But he lamented that the Russian leader, \"goes out and starts launching rockets into some city, like Kyiv, and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever, you have bodies lying all over the street.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he was \"very disappointed in Putin,\" adding: \"I'm going to reduce that 50 days that I gave him to a lesser number, because I think I already know the answer what's going to happen.\"",
      "Russia rejected the deadline when the White House first announced it, calling it \"unacceptable.\"",
      "\"I'm not so interested in talking anymore,\" Mr. Trump said of Putin, explaining that he and Putin will have a nice conversation, and then the following day, the Russians killed more Ukrainians.",
      "Seated alongside Starmer, Mr. Trump also addressed the situation in Gaza, saying the U.S. will be providing food to the people of Gaza and working to eliminate barriers to humanitarian aid.",
      "\"Some of those kids are, that's real starvation stuff,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"I see it. And you can't fake that. So we're going to be even more involved.\"",
      "While ostensibly a private trip, marked by multiple rounds of golf on his own luxury courses in Scotland, Mr. Trump has also done business \u2013 including nailing down a long-sought-after\u00a0U.S.-European Union trade agreement.",
      "After meeting for just over one hour with EU leader Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday, Mr. Trump emerged to say, \"We have good news. We've reached a deal.\"",
      "When considered as a combined economy, the EU bloc is the second largest in the world behind the U.S. Including goods and services, U.S.-EU trade is worth about $2 trillion per year.",
      "\"I think it's great that we made a deal today, instead of playing games,\" Mr. Trump said of the framework trade agreement. \"I think it's the biggest deal ever made.\"",
      "\"It's a big deal, it's a huge deal,\" agreed Von der Leyen. \"It will bring stability. It will bring predictability.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's meeting with Starmer is also touching on trade, though the U.S. and the U.K. already\u00a0agreed on a framework trade deal\u00a0last month. Starmer has made it clear he wants to keep pushing Mr. Trump to further ease tariffs on British steel and other imports as the details of the agreement are hashed out.",
      "Mr. Trump said his meeting with Starmer would provide a chance to celebrate the U.S.-U.K. agreement, along with the new EU deal.",
      "Most EU member nations' governments voiced support for that agreement on Monday, though some of them unenthusiastically \u2013 and the French Prime Minister even took a jab at the bloc, accusing it of \"submission\" to Mr. Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump said the tariff rate for the EU's 27 member countries would be 15% for most imports, including vehicles. The EU, meanwhile, agreed to purchase U.S. military hardware, $750 billion of American energy, and to increase its collective investment in the U.S. by $600 billion.",
      "There was good news for U.S. companies that sell products into the EU market, too, as Mr. Trump announced that all 27 EU nations \"will be opened up to trade with the United States at zero tariff.\"",
      "The agreement was made at Mr. Trump's luxury golf resort in Turnberry, on the Scottish coast, where the president spent the weekend teeing off.",
      "The deal avoids a trans-Atlantic trade war that could have unfolded on Friday, when Mr. Trump had threatened to impose a blanket 30% tariff on all goods imported from the EU, which had vowed to retaliate.",
      "That deadline remains in place for countries that have yet to make a deal with the U.S., including Mexico, Canada, and most consequentially, China. On Monday, Mr. Trump said tariffs for countries that don't reach a deal with the U.S. will be \"somewhere in the 15% to 20% range,\" which differs from the 15% to 50% range he floated last week.",
      "Trade talks between Beijing and Washington were taking place Monday in Stockholm, and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in interviews over the weekend that the Aug. 1 deadline for deals to be reached wasn't flexible.",
      "\"No extensions, no more grace periods. August 1, the tariffs are set. They'll go into place. Customs will start collecting the money, and off we go,\" Lutnick said.",

      "Inflation in the early part of 2025 remained fairly contained. That's because many companies and consumers accelerated their purchases of imported goods to avoid the risk of paying more if, or when, steep new tariffs take effect.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans are mulling a possible rule change to allow them to more swiftly confirm President Trump's nominees amid Democrats' efforts to slow the process in protest to the president's policies.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Wednesday that interest is \"growing quickly\" among Senate Republicans for a change to the rules governing the nominations process as he's bemoaned an \"unprecedented level of obstruction and delay\" by Democrats in recent days.",
      "\"There's certainly interest in looking at options that might enable us to break the logjam and expedite consideration of nominees in a way that, in the end, would benefit both parties when their party has the presidency,\" Thune said.",
      "With around 1,300 positions requiring Senate confirmation, the process is an arduous one that has become more cumbersome in recent years. The average time to confirm a president's nominee has nearly quadrupled during the last six administrations, according to the Center for Presidential Transition. And Democrats have taken their slow-walking of Mr. Trump's nominees to new extremes in recent months, putting up procedural hurdles to delay the confirmations nearly across the board.",
      "Still, the opposition by Democrats has not been universal, since any single senator can effectively stall the path to swift confirmation.",
      "In recent years, both Democrats and Republicans have made pushes to change the confirmation process, like by cutting down the time requirements for the nominations and reducing the number of votes needed to a simple majority.",
      "Senate Republicans have been tight-lipped about the possible new changes to the process, which would represent a further change to the institution that has traditionally been resistant to change. Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, told CBS News that Senate Republicans are \"actively discussing\" possible changes, calling the obstruction of Mr. Trump's nominees \"unconscionable.\" He noted that he would say the same if the dynamic was occurring under a Democrat.",
      "Sen. Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican, told CBS News that \"we are actually not looking to do reforms, but we don't have a choice.\"",
      "\"This is Chuck Schumer's fault. He's the one that's forcing this. And, and so I don't know what he expects to happen, but we will have to have some reforms if this is the way they continue to operate,\" Mullin added.",
      "Sen. Tommy Tuberville, an Alabama Republican who during the Biden administration delayed the nominations of hundreds of military officers, argued that the chamber should remain in session to get the nominations done. \"We ought to stay if we don't get as many as we want to get,\" he said.",
      "\"President Trump says he wants us here,\" Tuberville said. \"We work for him.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump called for Senate Republicans to stay in session into their August recess to get the nominations done. And some other Senate Republicans, like Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, have echoed the sentiment. Lee has argued that the GOP should either \"exhaust\" Democrats by working through August \u2014 or give Mr. Trump the ability to make recess appointments.",
      "Asked about recess appointments, which afford the president the ability to temporarily fill vacancies while the Senate is in recess, Thune suggested that Senate Republicans would be more likely to \"make a modification to our rules\" to sidestep Democrats' delay.",
      "\"At some point, we may need to look at doing things differently on nominees generally, if the Democrats continue this path of obstruction that they're on right now,\" Thune said.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump took aim at another facet of the Senate's confirmation process late Tuesday in a post on Truth Social, urging Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican who leads the Senate Judiciary Committee, to end blue slips \u2014 a practice that gives senators veto power over judicial nominations in their home state.",
      "Thune told reporters that the blue slip process is \"something that's been used for a long time by both sides, and neither side has violated its usage in the past.\"",
      "\"I don't sense any rush to change it, and I think the key is to make sure that we're making good headway on moving the list of judges that are on the President's list,\" he added.",

      "The new information comes after President Trump directed Bondi and the Justice Department to move to unseal \"any and all pertinent grand jury testimony,\" related to the federal investigations into Epstein and Maxwell in an attempt to quiet the political storm that has ensnared the Trump administration since the Justice Department and FBI said a review of the investigation related to disgraced financier found that there was no \"client list\" or evidence that he blackmailed prominent figures.",

      "\"There is undoubtedly a clearly expressed interest from the public in Jeffrey Epstein's and Ghislaine Maxwell's crimes. Beyond that, there is abundant public interest in the investigative work conducted by the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into those crimes,\" Justice Department leadership wrote in its argument that the transcripts should be released, adding that its goal in unsealing the material would \"provide information to the public while remaining sensitive to protecting the rights of victims.\"",
      "The Justice Department also said in the filing that they have submitted a fuller list under seal of witnesses whose accounts were conveyed in the grand jury proceedings and another list of which witnesses testified at trial to the judges, and have informed notice to all but one victim who is referenced in the grand jury transcripts of their attempts to unseal them.",
      "\"The Government has attempted to contact the remaining victim, but such efforts have been unsuccessful.\u00a0 In addition, the Government is in the process of providing notice to any other individuals identified in the transcripts,\" the Justice Department wrote.",
      "Last week, a federal judge in Florida denied the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury material stemming from investigations in 2005 and 2007 into Epstein in the state. That ruling only applied to transcripts of proceedings by federal grand juries that were convened in Florida, and did not apply to the transcripts in New York.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Democrats are trying to force the Justice Department to release the Jeffrey Epstein files using a little-known law that directs executive agencies to turn over information to congressional oversight committees, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Wednesday.",
      "\"Today Senate Democrats take additional action to try and uncover the truth about the Epstein files,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor, and he proceeded to describe the nearly century-old law the minority would use to try to compel the release of the \"full and complete Epstein files.\"",
      "The federal law, known as Section 2954 and referred to as the \"Rule of Five,\" allows five members on the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs to submit an information request on matters within its jurisdiction to a federal agency. Enacted in 1928, the obscure law is part of Congress' ability to wield influence over executive branch agencies, and gives minority members of the oversight committees the ability to request information without the help of the committee chairman.",
      "The move comes as controversy has swirled around the Epstein files in recent weeks, after the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review that was met with anger from many of Mr. Trump's supporters. The review found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein, a well-connected financier who was convicted of sex trafficking and died in federal custody in 2019, had blackmailed prominent figures. But the issue has divided Mr. Trump's base, with many in both parties calling for more transparency as the president has called the controversy a \"hoax.\" And Democrats have sought to capitalize on the GOP infighting.",
      "\"The situation with the Epstein files is very simple \u2014 Donald Trump promised transparency and he has broken that promise,\" Schumer said. \"As a candidate, Trump said on many occasions he would release the Epstein files if elected, and yet he has refused to do so.\"",
      "Schumer accused Republicans of choosing to \"hide\" on the Epstein files, saying, \"if there's nothing to hide, why all the evasiveness?\"",
      "The rule has rarely been used. In 2017, Democrats tried to force the release of documents relating to the leasing of the Old Post Office building in Washington, D.C., which became the site of a Trump hotel. And in 2001, Democrats under former President George W. Bush attempted to compel documents about the 2000 census. Still, with infrequent use, whether the rule could be enforced in court remains to be seen.",
      "Schumer said the request covers \"all documents, files, evidence or other materials in the possession of the Department of Justice or the FBI related to the case of United States v. Jeffrey Epstein.\" He noted the request includes records related to Epstein and his clients, while \"ensuring that the private information of any victims is protected.\" The minority leader said the Democrats expect the Justice Department to provide the information by Aug. 15.",

      "Mr. Trump posted about the tariffs on India on social media Wednesday morning, saying, \"Remember, while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their Tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the World, and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers of any Country.\"",

The director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, told reporters Wednesday morning, \"India has had a market that's been pretty much closed to American products, and we've been wide open to theirs.

      "\"Dr. Prasad did not want to be a distraction to the great work of the FDA in the Trump administration and has decided to return to California and spend more time with his family,\" HHS said. \"We thank him for his service and the many important reforms he was able to achieve in his time at FDA.\"",
      "Prasad had been serving as the FDA's director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research since May, replacing Dr. Peter Marks, who had been forced out by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Prasad was subsequently named chief medical and scientific officer, absorbing the roles of other top-ranking FDA officials who were removed or left under the Trump administration.",
      "In recent weeks, right-wing influencer Laura Loomer had launched a social media campaign against Prasad, highlighting his past support for Democrats, including Sen. Bernie Sanders. Loomer called Prasad a \"Lifelong Progressive with a Vicious Anti-Trump Record\" and writing that \"Prasad's views are a slap in the face to the conservative values of limited government, deregulation, and economic freedom that YOU voted for!\"",
      "But FDA chief Marty Markay over the weekend had defended Prasad over Loomer's comments, saying in a Politico podcast that Prasad is a \"impeccable scientist \u2026 one of the greatest scientific minds of our generation.\"",

    "story": [
      "During a\u00a0meeting last week between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the president sought to underscore what he said is a \"very simple\" request: \"Interest rates have to come down.\"",
      "That wish isn't likely to be granted when the Fed announces its next interest rate decision today. Economists put the probability of the central bank holding rates steady at 96%, according to FactSet. The Fed has maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5% since December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's second-term inauguration in January, as policy makers try to douse the flickering embers of inflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has for months\u00a0derided Powell  over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs, which experts say would boost economic growth but could cause consumer prices to flare. Upping the pressure, Trump administration officials also have said the Fed chair's handline of a\u00a0building renovation\u00a0at the Fed could be grounds for firing.",
      "Despite such criticism, Powell has maintained his stance that no immediate rate cuts are necessary given that the economy remains solid. The Fed chair, who Mr. Trump nominated to head the central bank in 2017, has also suggested he wants to keep its powder dry in case the Trump administration's steep new tariffs cause inflation to reignite.",
      "\"With the labor market holding up and the impact of tariffs on inflation starting to rear its ugly head, the Federal Reserve has plenty of ammunition to justify keeping interest rates unchanged at the July meeting,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet said in a July 24 research note.",
      "In making his case for lowering interest rates, Mr. Trump has pointed to rate cuts\u00a0earlier this year by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, while also pointing out that U.S. inflation so far in 2025 has remained relatively low.",
      "However, the Consumer Price Index \u2014 a key gauge for tracking inflation \u2014 in June rose to an annualized rate of 2.7%, well above the Fed's 2% annual target and a sign that that tariffs could be pushing some prices higher.",
      "Fed policy makers are meeting this week to discuss what to do on interest rates. Here's what to know.",
      "When is the Fed making its rate cut decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve will make its next rate cut decision at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday, July 30, followed by a 2:30 p.m. ET press conference with Powell, when he will offer his view on the the state of the economy and answer questions from financial journalists about the Fed's economic outlook.",
      "Who makes decisions on interest rates?",
      "The decision is made by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, with a voting majority deciding whether the central bank should cut, hike or maintain the benchmark rate. In other words, no single person, including Fed Chair Powell, determines the central bank's monetary policy.",
      "Lately, at least two members of the FOMC \u2014 Federal Reserve governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman \u2014 have signaled their belief that it is time to cut rates.",
      "\"[I]f there were a pair of dissents in July, it would match the most since 1993,\" Sweet of Oxford Economics noted.. \"From our perspective, dissents are normal and a good thing as it highlights that the Fed isn't falling into the trap of groupthink.\"",
      "Could the Fed cut rates today?",
      "It's not impossible, but highly unlikely. Economists estimate the chances of a rate cut at just 4%, according to FactSet. CME FedWatch, a closely watched monetary policy tracker, also suggests only a very remote probability of a cut.",
      "For now, data continues to shows steady, if slowing, economic growth, with employers in June\u00a0hiring more workers than forecast and inflation remaining relatively muted.\u00a0On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said second-quarter GDP rose at an annual rate of 3%, far outpacing the forecast for 2% growth.",
      "The threat from tariffs as well as stronger-than-expected GDP data means \"the Fed is all but certain to keep rates unchanged again this week, with futures markets pricing in effectively no chance of a cut,\" Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury, in an email.",
      "The Fed is likely to hold off on cutting rates to give them room to maneuver if conditions deteriorate, economists note.",
      "Interest rates are the Fed's most powerful tool for nudging growth forward when the economy slows and cooling activity when inflation jumps. A rate hike makes it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, curbing spending and putting the brakes on inflation. By contrast, cuts make it cheaper to borrow, fueling spending and corporate investment, which can spark inflation.",
      "\"Policymakers remain cautious, navigating persistent inflationary risks tied to trade policy along with cooling labor market conditions and growing political pressure from the administration to accelerate rate cuts,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in an email.",
      "How has Powell responsed to pressure from Mr. Trump?",
      "Powell has repeatedly stated that the Federal Reserve's decisions are based solely on economic data as it pursues its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and ensuring full employment.",
      "Because Mr. Trump has been pushing for lower rates, Powell is likely to face questions at his press conference Wednesday press about political pressure. Powell may also be asked about the president's remarks about\u00a0replacing him as Fed chair, he added. Powell's current term as chair ends in May 2026.",
      "\"The odds are that [Powell] sticks with his mantra that it doesn't impact monetary policy and he isn't resigning while dodging questions about a shadow Fed chair,\" Sweet said, referring to the possibility that Mr. Trump could decide to nominate Powell's successor months before he is due to step down in hopes of influencing investor expectations for monetary policy.",
      "When is the Fed more likely to lower interest rates?",
      "The Fed is more likely to lower its benchmark rate at its Sept. 16-17 meeting, according to FactSet, with economists pegging the likelihood of a cut at 63%. The FOMC doesn't meet in August, making the September meeting the next chance for a rate cut.",
      "Economists who predict a rate cut at the September meeting are forecasting a 0.25 percentage point reduction, which would take the federal funds rate down to a range of 4% to 4.25%.",
      "\"With no imminent need to act.. the Fed will likely wait until September to deliver the next 25 [basis point] rate cut,\" Daco said. \"We continue to expect two rate cuts in 2025, followed by a further 100bps of easing in 2026 as economic and labor market conditions deteriorate more visibly.\"",

      "The vast majority of people on the spectrum do not have those severe challenges.",
      "The statements are more than rhetoric. These attitudes, ranging from judgments about individual behaviors to criticism of the chronically poor, are shaping policies that affect millions of people. The sentiments have been a factor behind decisions to cut Medicaid, keep federal insurance programs from covering anti-obesity drugs, and impose new barriers to COVID-19 vaccines for healthy people, say public health leaders and doctors. GOP lawmakers and federal health officials, they say, hold a reproachful stance toward chronic illnesses and the estimated 129 million people in the U.S. affected by them.",
      "\"This is at the heart of so much of our national problem with health,\" said Robert Califf, who led the Food and Drug Administration during the Obama and Biden administrations. \"It's these two extreme views. It's every health decision is up to the 'rugged individual,' versus the other extreme view that it's all controlled by environment and social determinants of health. The truth is, it's on a continuum.\"",

Calley Means, who is an adviser to Kennedy and is Casey Means' brother, said on the same show that Adderall is prescribed as the standard of care when children get a little fidgety because they're in sedentary environments with limited sunlight and eat too much ultraprocessed food.",
      "As a society, he said, \"we're really committing mass child abuse in many ways, and we're normalizing that and we're not speaking out about that. And then we're giving people stimulants developed by Nazi Germany.\"",
      "Calley Means was probably referring to Pervitin, a methamphetamine-based drug administered to Adolf Hitler's forces in World War II. Adderall is a prescription drug containing amphetamine, a stimulant that's not the same as methamphetamine.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services didn't respond to messages seeking comment from Means.",
      "Some conservatives and MAHA adherents argue that people need to take more responsibility for their health. But comments that shift blame to patients and physicians risk perpetuating stigmas, fostering the spread of misinformation, and eroding trust in modern medicine, say medical groups, doctors, and patient advocacy groups.",
      "The statements assume consumers and patients have control over improving their health and preventing chronic disease when the reality is more complex, according to some public health leaders. Lower-income people, they say, often lack access to grocery stores and healthy food, may juggle too many jobs to have time to cook from scratch, and may live in dangerous areas where it's harder to get outside and exercise.",
      "Jerome Adams, surgeon general during the previous Trump administration, told KFF Health News that he worries efforts to promote health will be undone by \"the return of vaccine-preventable diseases, increasing mistrust in the health care system, and the tearing down of social supports which are critical for making healthy choices.\"",
      "Tough talk",
      "The attitudes held by top Trump health officials have affected policy decisions, some doctors and public health leaders say.",
      "Kennedy and other Trump administration health leaders have been especially outspoken, targeting issues they consider especially egregious in recent federal actions, research, or policy.",
      "For example, the Biden administration proposed a rule in November that would let Medicare cover weight loss medications such as Wegovy and Zepbound. But Kennedy and other political appointees at HHS and its agencies have criticized the drugs and the people who take them.",
      "\"I think it's very dark,\" Calley Means told Carlson, referring to the weight loss drugs. \"I think it's a stranglehold on the U.S. population, almost like solidifying this idea that there is a magic pill.\"",
      "He added: \"Where is the urgency on saying 'Hey parents, maybe we shouldn't feed our kids toxic food?'\"",
      "Kennedy, too, has criticized the medications and people who use them, saying in October on Fox News that drugmakers \"are counting on selling it to Americans because we're so stupid and so addicted to drugs.\"",
      "In April, the Trump administration announced it would not finalize the Biden-era coverage rule.",
      "\"It's impacting the kind of care and treatments patients will have,\" said Andrea Love, a biomedical scientist and founder of ImmunoLogic, a science communication organization. \"It sends the message that it's your fault. It's very much victim-blaming. It creates the idea that scientific progress is the devil, demonizes things that aren't individually harming health, while avoiding addressing systemic issues that play a much larger role in health.\"",
      "Kennedy and HHS didn't return messages seeking comment.",
      "Data shows that the medications are effective. People who took the highest dose of Zepbound in clinical trials lost an average of 48 pounds, and 1 in 3 on that dose lost more than 58 pounds, or 25% of their body weight.",
      "Kennedy and other agency leaders also oppose many COVID-era health restrictions and rules. Some physicians and public health leaders note these officials downplayed COVID risks while criticizing vaccines developed during the previous Trump administration.",
      "Kennedy has said that people who died from COVID actually fell victim to chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, or asthma.",
      "\"That's really what killed them,\" Kennedy said on \"Dr. Phil Primetime\" in April. \"These were people who were so sick they were basically hanging from a cliff, and COVID came along and stamped on their fingers and dropped them off. But they were already living lives that were burdened by sickness.\"",
      "COVID was the underlying cause of death for more than 940,000 people in the U.S. from Aug. 1, 2021, to July 31, 2022, according to a 2023 report in JAMA Network, an open-access journal on biomedical sciences published by the American Medical Association.",
      "COVID ranked first among deaths caused by infectious or respiratory diseases for youths under age 19, based on the report. Infants under a year old may be at higher risk of experiencing severe illness from COVID compared with older children, studies show, and risks are also higher for infants under 6 months and those with underlying medical conditions.",
      "\"Vaccination during pregnancy can help protect infants after birth,\" according to the CDC.",
      "But Kennedy announced in May that the federal government would no longer recommend COVID vaccines for pregnant people and children who are healthy. Medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics opposed this decision and filed a lawsuit.",
      "Kennedy also helped promote beliefs that many childless adults on Medicaid, the federal-state program for low-income people, don't work and thereby drain resources from the program.",
      "At a May hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Kennedy said the program was in jeopardy because of \"all the able-bodied people who are not working [or] looking for jobs.\"",
      "It's a view embraced by Republican lawmakers who portrayed adults enrolled in Medicaid as lazy or shirking work as they advanced a budget bill estimated to cut federal spending on the program by about $1 trillion over a decade, in part by imposing work requirements on many adult beneficiaries.",
      "\"Thirty-five-year-olds sitting at home playing video games, they're going to now have to go get a job,\" said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana.",
      "The legislation, which Mr. Trump signed into law this month, will cause about 10 million more people to be without health insurance by 2034, the Congressional Budget Office estimates.",
      "Some health leaders who criticized the legislation say the statements inaccurately maligned Medicaid enrollees, who by law cannot hold high-paying jobs and remain in the program.",
      "Nonetheless, nearly two-thirds of adults ages 19 to 64 covered by Medicaid in 2023 were working. For about 3 in 10, caregiving responsibilities, an illness or disability, or school attendance prevented them from working, according to KFF, the health policy organization that includes KFF Health News.",
      "\"It's using anti-welfare tropes for something that is basic health care, not a cash benefit,\" said Anthony Wright, executive director at Families USA, which supports the Affordable Care Act and expanded health coverage.

    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 22:26:58 -0400",
    "summary": "The EPA has decided to revoke a key scientific finding it published 16 years ago that six greenhouse gases are a threat to public health.",
    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency has decided to revoke a key scientific finding it published 16 years ago that six greenhouse gases are a threat to public health and must be regulated under the Clean Air Act.",
      "Known as the \"endangerment finding,\" it is the 2009 scientific basis for which the EPA has regulated greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles, as well as other sources of climate pollution, but Administrator Lee Zeldin announced on a conservative podcast Tuesday that the agency is revoking the finding, calling it, \"the largest deregulatory action in the history of America.\"",
      "Since it was signed by then-Administrator Lisa Jackson in 2009, the finding has been used by the EPA to regulate sources of climate change-causing pollution from cars, power plants and other sources of transportation like planes, as well as oil and gas operations.",
      "But Tuesday, the EPA issued a press release saying if the draft to revoke the finding is finalized, it would \"repeal all resulting greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles and engines, thereby reinstating consumer choice and giving Americans the ability to purchase a safe and affordable car for their family while decreasing the cost of living on all products that trucks deliver.\"",
      "During his appearance on the \"Ruthless Podcast,\" Zeldin criticized the endangerment finding, saying it put too many regulatory restrictions on transportation and stationary sources of greenhouse gas pollution.",
      "\"There are people, who in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country,\" he said.",
      "Zeldin also said regulating climate pollution costs Americans too much money. If the proposed finding is finalized, it \"is expected to save Americans $54 billion in costs annually through the repeal of all greenhouse gas standards,\" according to the EPA press release.",
      "But the EPA's own regulatory impact report says limiting emissions for cars and trucks is expected to generate more than $2.1 trillion in net benefits over the next 30 years, including $820 billion in fuel savings and $1.8 trillion in public health and climate benefits.",
      "Repealing the finding comes at a time when climate change impacts appear to be reaching new heights as 2024 was the hottest year on record, and natural disasters are growing more intense, destructive and deadly. Since 2010, there have been 246 billion-dollar disasters striking every U.S. state, causing more than $1.7 trillion in damages, and killing more than 7,700 people, according to archived data from NOAA.",
      "\"For the EPA to repeal the 2009 finding borders on criminal negligence,\" said Robert Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University, in a statement. \"The science was clear in 2009 and has become much stronger and clearer since: climate disruption is a large and growing problem; it is caused primarily from our use of fossil fuels and the resultant emissions of carbon dioxide and methane; and it is a deadly problem.\"",
      "Legality of the endangerment finding",
      "In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that greenhouse gases are a form of air pollution that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act, but it tasked the EPA with making a scientific finding about whether the gases harm public health.",
      "Two years later, the EPA published the endangerment finding, relying on extensive scientific evidence and public input to definitively state that greenhouse gases, which cause climate change, threaten health and the welfare of current and future generations.",
      "\"I think it's the most impactful thing I worked on in my career,\" said a former EPA employee who was a key author on the 2009 endangerment finding and requested anonymity because of current contractual obligations with the federal government.",
      "\"This body of scientific evidence met the endangerment test of the Clean Air Act,\" they told CBS News. \"It has stood the test of time and the science has only gotten stronger.\"",
      "The EPA's new proposal aims to question the agency's ability to set standards for car emissions, according to the press release. The full draft of the rule is not yet accessible on the EPA website or federal register to review.",
      "The release also said the EPA will \"update scientific data and challenge the assumptions\" of the 2009 finding with\u00a0a study\u00a0from the Department of Energy's 2025 Climate Work Group, which was not peer-reviewed, but says greenhouse gases \"appear to be less damaging economically than commonly believed.\"",
      "Plenty of conservative groups and attorneys general have tested the legality of the finding and were pleased with Tuesday's announcement.",
      "\"Over the last four years, conservative state attorneys general were the last line of defense in fighting back against the Biden administration's federal overreach and green new scam agenda,\" said Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita in a statement.",
      "The finding has previously been challenged in court, most recently in 2023, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit upheld the finding and the Supreme Court refused to hear the case.",
      "The EPA highlighted subsequent Supreme Court rulings since the finding was signed in 2009 and said, in its press release, those cases \"have significantly clarified the scope of EPA's authority under the CAA,\" indicating the agency may be open to testing whether today's court has an appetite to revisit and overturn the 2007 ruling that greenhouse gases should be regulated under the Clean Air Act by the EPA.",
      "\"The administration's move to jettison these standards flies in the face of the Supreme Court's landmark decision directing the EPA to follow the science,\" said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement. \"If EPA finalizes this illegal and cynical approach, we will see them in court.\"",
      "Impacts of the endangerment finding",
      "Since it was signed in 2009, the most crucial impacts of regulating greenhouse gasses have been to the U.S. transportation sector, which if it were its own country, would be the fourth largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, according to the European Commission and data from the EPA.",
      "New passenger vehicles today emit 24% less climate pollution than they did in 2011, the year before the first tailpipe regulations went into effect, according to the EPA's own estimates. The EPA tightened the tailpipe emissions standards for cars and trucks in 2024, which was expected to cut 7.2 billion tons of climate pollution by 2055 and save $13 billion in annual health benefits.",
      "But according to the EPA's press release, if the proposed draft is finalized it will, \"undo the underpinning of $1 trillion in costly regulations (and) save more than $54 billion annually,\" although no regulatory analysis has been provided to confirm those numbers.",
      "In addition to removing regulations on cars, the EPA has already jettisoned similar rules to limit emissions for power plants, has encouraged the development of fossil fuel-based energy and has promised to rollback dozens of additional environmental regulations that hamper the development of American energy and manufacturing.",
      "\"Trump's EPA is trying every trick in the book to deny and avoid their mission to protect people and the environment from the ravages of unchecked climate pollution. Instead of doing their job, this EPA is putting the safety of our loved ones at risk while ratcheting up grid instability, energy bills, and disaster costs,\" said former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, in a statement.",

    "summary": "Emil Bove was one of President Trump's defense lawyers before joining the Justice Department earlier this year.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate on Tuesday approved the nomination of Emil Bove, President Trump's former defense lawyer, to serve on a U.S. appeals court, confirming the controversial nominee to a lifetime appointment on the federal bench.",
      "The upper chamber voted 50-49 to green-light Bove's nomination to the Philadelphia-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit, which oversees cases from Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined all Democrats in voting no.",
      "\"He has a strong legal background and has served his country honorably. I believe he will be diligent, capable and a fair jurist,\" Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, said of Bove on the Senate floor ahead of the vote.",
      "Bove emerged as Mr. Trump's most controversial judicial pick so far, and former judges, prosecutors and other Justice Department employees had urged senators to reject his nomination. A Justice Department whistleblower alleged that Bove had suggested government lawyers should ignore court orders, prompting Democrats to unsuccessfully push for the Senate Judiciary Committee to delay a vote on his nomination. When the panel voted earlier this month to advance his nomination, all of the panel's Democrats walked out of the meeting in protest.",
      "Two more whistleblowers have since turned over information about Bove to either the Justice Department's internal watchdog or lawmakers, according to the organization Whistleblower Aid, which represents one of the people, and the Washington Post, which reported on evidence given to Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat who sits on the Judiciary Committee.",
      "Booker and Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, asked the Justice Department's acting inspector general on Monday whether he has launched any investigations related to Bove and said the allegations of misconduct are \"troubling.\"",
      "Bove was one of the lawyers who represented the president in his criminal cases and he joined the Justice Department as principal associate deputy attorney general when Mr. Trump returned to the White House for a second term. Bove also served briefly as acting deputy attorney general in the opening weeks of the second Trump administration until the Senate confirmed Todd Blanche, also a former defense lawyer for the president, to the No. 2 spot.",
      "But former Justice Department prosecutors accused Bove of executing mass firings at the department of employees who were \"perceived not to show sufficient loyalty\" to Mr. Trump, including officials who worked on former special counsel Jack Smith's investigations into the president, which yielded two prosecutions that have since been dropped.",
      "Bove was also at the center of a controversy involving the Justice Department's decision to drop its prosecution of New York City Mayor Eric Adams in exchange for cooperation with immigration enforcement. Several prosecutors who worked on Adams' case resigned after Bove directed them to dismiss the charges against the mayor and said the move appeared to be a quid pro quo.",
      "But Bove brushed away the accusations, telling senators in a questionnaire to the Judiciary Committee that the decision to drop the five-count indictment against Adams was within the scope of prosecutorial discretion. He also said Adams' own submissions to the court refute the allegations of an \"improper quid pro quo.\"",
      "Bove also faced allegations of unethical conduct from a fired Justice Department lawyer, who filed a whistleblower report with lawmakers last month. The attorney, Erez Reuveni, claimed Bove suggested that the administration should ignore court orders regarding the administration's efforts to remove migrants under the wartime Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Reuveni alleged that during a March meeting with senior department officials about removal flights, Bove suggested that the department would need to consider telling the courts to \"f**k you\" if a judge blocked deportations under the 1798 law.",
      "Emails and text messages that Reuveni provided to senators include exchanges with a Justice Department colleague in which they appear to be referring to Bove's alleged directive regarding judicial orders.",
      "A second Justice Department whistleblower submitted documents to the department's internal watchdog that supports Reuveni's claims, according to the organization Whistleblower Aid, which is representing the lawyer.",
      "Reuveni worked at the Justice Department for nearly 15 years and had been promoted to acting deputy director of its Office of Immigration Litigation in March. But he was fired in April after telling a federal judge that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was deported to his home country in March, should not have been removed. An immigration official with the Trump administration had acknowledged in a March court filing that Abrego Garcia's removal was an \"administrative error\" and an \"oversight.\"",
      "Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee attempted to push the panel to delay the vote to advance Bove's nomination and allow Reuveni to testify, but Grassley rejected the move.",
      "The White House and Justice Department have defended Bove and claimed that Reuveni was a \"disgruntled former employee.\" Grassley lambasted Democrats for their handling of Bove's nomination and said they have tried to obstruct nearly all of Mr. Trump's nominees.",
      "\"The vicious rhetoric, unfair accusations and abuse directed at Mr. Bove by some on this committee, it has crossed the line,\" he said.",
      "Blanche wrote in an op-ed for Fox News that Bove is \"the most capable and principled lawyer I have ever known,\" and said his \"legal acumen is extraordinary and his moral clarity is above reproach.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 20:16:00 -0400",
    "summary": "From vaccines to fluoride, here's what the newly confirmed CDC director Susan Monarez has said about some key health topics.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Senate voted Tuesday along party lines, 51 to 47, to confirm Susan Monarez as the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "President Trump nominated her for the role in March, praising her as \"an incredible mother and dedicated public servant\" who \"understands the importance of protecting our children, our communities, and our future.\"",
      "Monarez has been serving as the acting head of the CDC since January, and previously worked as the head of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health. She was viewed as somewhat surprising pick for the CDC role because unlike most recent CDC directors, she holds a Ph.D. but is not a medical doctor.",
      "The CDC\u00a0said\u00a0Monarez \"brings decades of distinguished experience in health innovation, disaster preparedness, global health, and biosecurity\" to the agency, and will help advance the \"mission to Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "At her confirmation hearing before the Senate's Health, Education, Labor and Pension (HELP) committee on July 9, Monarez garnered praise from the Republican chairman, Sen. Bill Cassidy, who is a physician, for her commitment to rebuilding public trust in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Democrats on the committee grilled her about the impact of cuts in federal funding for health programs and medical research, and expressed concern about the CDC's role under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Monarez was questioned by committee members about a range of health topics. Here are some of those highlights.",
      "Monarez on vaccines",
      "Monarez faced a number of questions about vaccine recommendations.\u00a0Kennedy\u00a0has been a longtime vaccine critic who has pushed a discredited theory linking routine childhood shots to autism, but during her hearing, Monarez refuted that view and stated that she has \"not seen a causal link between vaccines and autism.\"",
      "Amid a growing measles outbreak this year, Kennedy has\u00a0acknowledged the vaccine's efficacy\u00a0against the disease while still saying he supports individual choice. In a March interview with CBS News, Kennedy publicly encouraged people to get the measles vaccine.",
      "\"If I'm confirmed as CDC director, I look forward to supporting the secretary with science and evidence, and making sure that I am giving him the best information possible,\" Monarez said at her confirmation hearing. \"Measles is an important health threat and we have to make sure we are doing everything that we can to prevent and mitigate it.\"",
      "Monarez was also asked about the continued availability and affordability of vaccines if the CDC's vaccine advisory panel, made up of new RFK Jr. appointees, makes changes to recommendations.",
      "\"Vaccines absolutely save lives, and if I'm confirmed as CDC director, I commit to making sure we continue to prioritize vaccine availability,\" she said.",
      "Monarez on fluoride",
      "Fluoride, another topic Kennedy has spotlighted, was also a subject of discussion during Monarez's hearing. This year, two states, Utah and Florida, became the first to ban the use of fluoride in drinking water, where it's been added for decades to help prevent tooth decay.",
      "\"Fluoride is an important component to oral health, and there are various aspects of using fluoride to improve oral health \u2014 a direct application can be very valuable,\" Monarez said.",
      "Democratic Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland specifically asked Monarez whether the water in Potomac, Maryland, which has fluoridation, is safe for families.",
      "Monarez replied: \"I believe the water in Potomac, Maryland is safe.\"",
      "Monarez on RFK Jr. and the measles outbreak",
      "Measles came up repeatedly as senators questioned Monarez about how she would interact with Kennedy in her role at the CDC.",
      "\"The CDC director can't perform this critical role unless they are politically independent. Which means that you must be willing to disagree with political leaders based on scientific evidence,\" Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire said. \"So, is there anything that you disagree with Secretary Kennedy about?\"",
      "\"If I'm confirmed as CDC director, I look forward to having technical discussions with the secretary. He has said he values and prioritizes independent thinking and using science to drive decision making,\" Monarez replied. \"I am an independent thinker, and I am a scientist, and I will welcome the opportunity to share my opinions based on science and evidence with him as he makes some of these very difficult decisions.\"",
      "After Monarez sidestepped a question from Hassan about whether she disagrees with anything Kennedy has done, the senator got more specific, asking about Kennedy's claim that it's \"very difficult for measles to kill a healthy person.\" This year's measles outbreak, centered in West Texas, killed two children who doctors said did not have previous health conditions.",
      "Monarez replied that measles is an \"important public health threat\" that can be lethal.",

Attorney General Pam Bondi directed her chief of staff, Chad Mizelle, to file the complaint, a Justice Department source told CBS News.",
      "In the complaint, Mizelle cites Boasberg's attendance at a Judicial Conference of the United States on March 11, in which the judge warned that the Trump administration could \"disregard rulings of federal courts\" and trigger a \"constitutional crisis.\"",
      "Mizelle also cites Boasberg's handling of a case involving alleged members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua who were flown to a Salvadoran prison earlier this year. Boasberg ordered the planes to turn around on March 15, after the Trump administration removed the men under the Alien Enemies Act. Boasberg subsequently held hearings in the case in which he has lambasted the conduct of Justice Department attorneys and questioned whether the Trump administration is acting in good faith to guarantee due process for those it has removed from the U.S. or intends to remove.",
      "\"Throughout the proceedings, Judge Boasberg rushed the government through complex litigation, sometimes giving the Trump Administration less than 48 hours to respond and threatening criminal-contempt proceedings and the appointment of an outside prosecutor against senior Trump Administration officials for failing to comply with an order that had already been vacated,\" Mizelle wrote.",
      "Bondi wrote in a post on X that the judge's remarks \"have undermined the integrity of the judiciary, and we will not stand for that.\"",
      "The complaint was addressed to the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Sri Srinivasan.

      "Dozens were put on two planes on March 15, removed to El Salvador and placed in detention at CECOT, a maximum security prison, despite an order issued by Boasberg to stop the removals and turn around the planes.",
      "Boasberg said in his April decision that the government's actions \"demonstrate a willful disregard\" for his order barring the government from transferring certain migrants into Salvadoran custody under the Alien Enemies Act, which previously had been invoked only three times in history, while the nation was at war.",
      "He accused the government of \"increasing obstructionism\" and \"stonewalling\" over its refusal to answer basic questions that aimed to resolve whether noncitizens who were removable solely under Mr. Trump's proclamation were transferred out of U.S. custody after the judge issued his order forbidding their deportation.",
      "\"Defendants provide no convincing reason to avoid the conclusion that appears obvious from the above factual recitation: that they deliberately flouted this court's written order and, separately, its oral command that explicitly delineated what compliance entailed,\" Boasberg wrote.",

      "Last week, the GOP-led House Oversight Committee subpoenaed Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence, to sit for a deposition as fallout over the Trump administration's handling of the case continues to intensify. A deposition was scheduled for Aug. 11 at a federal prison in Tallahassee, where Maxwell is serving her sentence.",
      "However, in a letter Tuesday addressed to House Oversight chairman Rep. James Comer, Maxwell's attorney David Markus said she is willing to sit before the committee but only after certain legal appeals are finalized or his client is granted clemency or a pardon by President Trump.",
      "\"Public reports \u2014 including your own statements \u2014 indicate that the Committee intends to question Ms. Maxwell in prison and without a grant of immunity. Those are non-starters. Ms. Maxwell cannot risk further criminal exposure in a politically charged environment without formal immunity,\" Markus wrote.",
      "Markus wrote that any questions to Maxwell would have to be given to her in advance to \"ensure accuracy and fairness,\" and that conducting the deposition in prison would create \"security risks and undermines the integrity of the process.\"",
      "Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 as he faced sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide.",
      "Markus wrote that because Maxwell's ongoing appeal to the Supreme Court to overturn her conviction and other legal issues are currently pending, \"any testimony she provides now could compromise her constitutional rights, prejudice her legal claims, and potentially taint a future jury pool.\"",
      "However, Markus wrote, if President Trump were to pardon Maxwell or commute her sentence, \"she would be willing\u2014and eager\u2014to testify openly and honestly, in public, before Congress in Washington, D.C.\"",
      "If those conditions are not agreed to, Markus wrote, Maxwell \"will have no choice but to invoke her Fifth Amendment rights.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee said in a statement that the committee will respond to Markus' letter \"soon,\" but said it \"will not consider granting congressional immunity for her testimony.\"",
      "In a letter to Maxwell informing her of the subpoena, Comer wrote that the committee is seeking Maxwell's testimony \"to inform the consideration of potential legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations.\"",
      "Todd Blanche, the second highest-ranking Justice Department official, met with Maxwell in Tallahassee on July 24 and 25\u00a0 to discuss Epstein.",
      "After the questioning had ended, Markus declined to comment \"on the substance\" of the meeting, but told reporters outside the office that \"there were a lot of questions and we went all day.\"",
      "Neither President Trump nor Markus have ruled out the possibility of a pardon for Maxwell, but on Monday Mr. Trump said he is \"allowed\" to pardon Maxwell but that nobody has asked him to issue one, yet.",
      "Trump says Epstein \"stole\" employees from him \u2014 possibly including Virginia Giuffre",
      "Separately, Mr. Trump told reporters Tuesday he cut ties with Epstein in the early 2000s because the financier \"stole\" employees from his business \u2014 reiterating his comments from a day earlier.",
      "The president said the workers in question were young women who worked in the spa at Mar-A-Lago. Asked whether Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre was one of the employees, Mr. Trump said, \"I think that was one of the people.\"",
      "Giuffre has alleged in civil court\u00a0that she was a 16-year-old employee at Mar-A-Lago when Maxwell first met her and \"recruited\" her \"into Epstein's sex trafficking activities.\" Giuffre \u2014 who died by suicide earlier this year\u00a0\u2014 was among the most prominent people to accuse Epstein of sexual abuse. Mr. Trump noted Tuesday that Giuffre \"had no complaints about us.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey sparred with fellow Democrats on Tuesday over a bipartisan policing package, accusing them of being \"complicit\" in President Trump's agenda in a rare moment of intraparty disagreement that played out on the Senate floor.",
      "The heated exchange arose after Booker objected to a motion from Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat from Nevada, to swiftly pass a package of bills related to law enforcement. Booker said he wanted to make a change to the bloc of measures to ensure resources are distributed equally among law enforcement agencies in response to the Justice Department's changes to grant programs and cancellation of awards.",
      "\"We are standing at a moment where our president is eviscerating the Constitution of the United States of America, and we're willing to go along with that today,\" he said. \"No, no. Not on my watch. I stand against this. It is a violation of our Constitution for the president of the United States to ignore the will of Congress and decide which states are eligible for grants and which are not.\"",
      "Booker accused Cortez Masto and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who backs the legislative package, of lecturing him.",
      "\"What I am tired of is when the president of the United States violates the Constitution, trashes our norms and traditions and what does the Democratic Party do? Comply? Allow him? Beg for scraps? No. I demand justice,\" he said.",
      "Booker said the Democratic Party \"needs a wake-up call.\"",
      "\"It's time for Democrats to have a backbone. It's time for us to fight. It's time for us to draw lines,\" he said, as his voice started rising. \"Don't question my integrity. Don't question my motives.\"",
      "Booker said in his remarks from the Senate floor that the Justice Department has been weaponizing public safety grants to punish state and local jurisdictions that oppose Mr. Trump's second-term agenda, and it is withholding funds from law enforcement agencies across the country when they were approved by Congress with bipartisan backing.",
      "\"It is disgraceful, it is unfair, it is unjust and it is dangerously reckless toward the officers whose well-being they are jeopardizing,\" Booker said. \"Federal funds should not be used for partisan political gains.\"",
      "The New Jersey Democrat lambasted his colleagues and accused them of effectively blessing Mr. Trump's decision to rescind grant funds by approving the legislative package.",
      "\"For us as a body to move forward right now is being complicit in what Donald Trump is doing,\" Booker said. \"I say no. I say we stand. I say we fight. I say we reject this, and that in a bipartisan way, we demand an end to this kind of constitutionally unjust carving up of the resources we approve.\"",
      "Booker had put forward an amendment to the bloc of bills that he said would prevent politicization and ensure resources are spread evenly among law enforcement agencies, regardless of the state they are in.",
      "\"This to me is the problem with Democrats in America right now, is we're willing to be complicit to Donald Trump, to let this pass through when we have all the leverage right now there is, to say, 'if you're as passionate about police as we are, then pass bills out of this body that will help the police officers in Washington, that will help the police officers in Illinois, that will help the police officers in New Jersey,'\" he said. \"Don't be complicit to the president of the United States.\"",
      "In response, Cortez Masto said the measures had been approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support \u2014 including by Booker. She criticized him for not putting forth his proposed amendment when the bills were before the panel and said his suggested change doesn't apply to her legislation.",
      "\"This is ridiculous,\" she said, adding that Booker should have raised his concerns weeks ago. \"Is this the right venue to fight for what he is seeking?\"",
      "Klobuchar, in her own remarks on the Senate floor, also defended the package and suggested Booker had missed the committee meeting when they were marked up. Booker is a member of the Judiciary Committee.",
      "\"I can't help it if someone couldn't change their schedule to be there,\" she said.",
      "Klobuchar said Booker has had issues with her policing bill that predate Mr. Trump's return to the White House, adding, \"One of the things I don't understand here is that we have committees for a reason, and we have hearings for a reason. And you can't do one thing on Police Week and not show up and not object and let these bills go through, and then say another a few weeks later on the floor.\"",
      "The tense back-and-forth came as Democrats have struggled to coalesce around a strategy for pushing back against Mr. Trump's second-term agenda.

      "President Trump on Tuesday set a 10-day deadline for Russia to reach a ceasefire agreement with Ukraine, or else it risks secondary sanctions, which would mean the Kremlin would have to make a deal with Ukraine by Friday, Aug. 8.",
      "The president, who said in Scotland on Monday that he was shortening his original 50-day deadline for Russia to make peace with Ukraine, spoke to reporters about the revised deadline Tuesday aboard Air Force One\u00a0as he returned to the U.S. Mr. Trump has been in Scotland for the last five days to negotiate trade deals with European leaders and visit his two golf resorts there.",
      "\"Ten days from today. Okay?\" he said on the plane.",
      "\"And then you know, we're going to put on tariffs and stuff, and I don't know if it's going to affect Russia, because he wants to obviously probably keep the war going,\" the president added, seemingly speaking about Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"But we're going to put on tariffs and the various things that you put on. It may or may not affect them, but it could.\"",
      "The U.S. and Ukraine have been pushing for an immediate ceasefire in order to negotiate a lasting peace deal. Earlier in July, Mr. Trump said if Russia doesn't agree to a ceasefire within a 50-day window, the U.S. would impose secondary tariffs of up to 100% on goods sold by countries that do business with Russia.",
      "Mr. Trump has increasingly expressed frustration with Putin, questioning whether the Russian leader really wants to end the war with Ukraine. Mr. Trump has described thinking he'd had a good phone call with the Russian leader, only to find that the next day, more Ukrainians were being killed by Russia.",
      "\"I always hang up, [and] say, 'Well, that was a nice phone call,'\" Mr. Trump said earlier in July. \"And then missiles are launched into Kyiv or some other city, and I say, 'That's strange.' And after that happens three or four times, you say, the talk doesn't mean anything.\"",
      "It's a change from earlier this year, when Mr. Trump said he thought Putin \"wants peace.\"",

    "story": [
      "The new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union will lift tariffs on imports of goods from EU countries to their highest level in decades and hurt the trading bloc's economic growth, according to some experts.",
      "\"It is an asymmetric and unbalanced deal,\" economists with investment bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said in a report. The EU decided neither to retaliate nor to increase its tariffs, and is even expected to reduce them. The EU agreed to a bad deal rather than risk trade war escalation.\"",
      "The average tariff on U.S. imports from the EU will surge from 1.2% in 2024 to 17.5%, according to investor advisory firm Capital Economics. That will reduce the EU's annual gross domestic product by 0.2%, the investment advisory firm forecast.",
      "EU countries annually ship more than $300 billion in goods to the U.S., accounting for more than 20% of total U.S. imports. Mexico ranks second among America's trade partners at roughly 15% of U.S. imports, while Canada accounts for 11% (see chart at bottom.)",
      "The deal, announced Sunday by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, while American goods exported to the union's 27 member countries will face no tariffs. Previously, U.S. exports to the EU faced an average tariff of roughly 1%, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.",
      "The EU also pledged to buy $750 billion worth of energy from the U.S., up from about $80 billion a year, and to invest $600 billion by 2028.",
      "The trade agreement will boost Americans by increasing access to the EU's vast market and supporting the U.S. manufacturing sector, according to the Trump administration.",
      "\"This colossal deal will enable U.S. farmers, ranchers, fishermen and manufacturers to increase U.S. exports, expand business opportunities and help reduce the goods trade deficit with the European Union,\" the White House said Monday in a\u00a0fact sheet about the pact.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for additional comment.",
      "Reducing uncertainty",
      "Although the agreement sharply raises U.S. tariffs, economists said the deal will also help ease some of the uncertainty around trade relations with a key trading partner. Perhaps most important, it is better than the alternative given that Mr. Trump had threatened to slap a 30% tariff on EU imports.",
      "More broadly, the EU deal and the Trump administration's framework agreement with Japan last week \u2014 both of which set 15% as a baseline tariff \u2014 also could help pave the way for trade agreements with Canada, Korea, Mexico and other countries, including on key sectors like autos, experts said.",
      "\"[C]ompared to expectations we had a few weeks before, in particular when pharmaceuticals and semiconductors could have been subject to higher tariffs, it looks like this deal is better than feared,\" Michel Martinez, head Europe economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "European auto exports would face a 15% levy, down from 25%, according to Goldman Sachs. Von der Leyen also said the U.S. would eliminate tariffs on some products, including aircraft and parts, semiconductor manufacturing gear, natural resources, some farm products, and certain chemicals and generic drugs. Likewise, the EU would abolish tariffs on those products.",
      "Neither the U.S. nor the EU has released details of the pact, and lobbying by some industries is expected to continue. For example, Unione Italiana Vini, an Italian trade group representing winemakers, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Monday that a 15% tariff on EU imports will result in a a $371 million hit for exporters.",
      "\"We are now calling on the Italian government and the EU to consider appropriate measures to safeguard a sector that has grown significantly thanks to U.S. buyers,\" the group's president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, said in a statement, while acknowledging that the\u00a0 deal \"at least resolved the uncertainty that was stalling the market.\"",
      "According to the group's analysis, a bottle of Italian wine that previously retailed for $11.50 in the U.S. will now cost nearly $15 under the new tariff agreement.",
      "The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents German automakers, also said a 15% U.S. tariff on the country's automotive products will hurt its car manufacturers, while noting that the new tariff rate amounts to a reprieve from the 25% automobile levies EU nations have faced since April.",
      "Wayne Winegarden, an economist at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank that support free market policies, expects the U.S.-EU deal is to raise prices for consumers and lower corporate profits.",
      "\"Going forward, we are going to start to see these impacts either through lower profitability for corporations and higher costs for consumers, and most likely a combination of the two,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Despite the Trump administration's recent trade deals with the EU, Japan, U.K. and several other Asian countries, the U.S. still faces a self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline to reach agreements with Canada, Mexico, Korean other key trading partners.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/young-people-trumps-job-handling-cbs-news-analysis/",
    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 12:51:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Most Americans under 30 approved at the start of President Trump's second term but are dissatisfied with the economy's direction.",
    "story": [
      "Since Donald Trump took office for his second term, his job ratings have markedly\u00a0declined\u00a0\u2014 and more with young people than any other age group. What has made so many young Americans change their minds so quickly?",
      "For context, President Trump's electoral performance with voters under 30 improved a lot in 2024: While he lost this group to former Vice President Kamala Harris, it was by a much smaller margin than in 2020. And men under 30 ended up splitting roughly evenly between Trump and Harris. These trends prompted some observers to marvel at how conservative Gen Z had become, especially young men, and to wonder whether it marked a durable change.",
      "About half a year on from Inauguration Day, many young people have changed their minds on Trump. It looks more like many young voters gave him the benefit of the doubt when he took office, but their evaluations of him quickly started to sink. Among Americans ages 18-29, his job approval rating has fallen from a high of 55% just after he was inaugurated to 28% now. That means that half of his former approvers now disapprove. In percentage-point terms, the size of that drop is more than double what we've seen in any other age group.",
      "Which young voters have dropped off?",
      "Among young people, it's the less partisan and politically engaged who have seen the steepest drops. For example, about half of independents under 30 approved of Mr. Trump in February, but that has dropped to about one in five now. The same is true of young people who didn't vote in the 2024 election. Party identifiers and '24 voters have fallen off, too, but not to the same extent.",
      "There are also differences by gender, with young men starting out more approving of Mr. Trump than young women were. Women's ratings of the president had already begun dipping by March, while it was not until April\u00a0\u2014 and the downturn in the U.S. stock market \u2014 that young men's ratings started to decline. Both have fallen steadily since then, but a faster drop among young men in the last few months has meant the gender gap in approval of Mr. Trump has shrunk. (See the bottom of this article for statistical details on estimating these smaller subgroups.)",
      "CBS News polling over the past few months offers several clues as to what young people are unhappy about these days.",
      "A majority now say Mr. Trump is doing different things than he promised during the 2024 campaign. That's a reversal in sentiment from early February, when seven in 10 said he's doing what he said he would. And it's young men who have been the most likely to flip on this question.",
      "On top of that, the administration is experiencing low points on several economic evaluations:",
      "The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good.\u00a0Over time, young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad.",
      "The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good.\u00a0Over time, young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad.",
      "Six in 10 also tell us that Mr. Trump's policies are making them worse off financially. That is the highest we've seen to date, and it represents a complete change from what young people expected when he was inaugurated. Back then, they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off.",

That is the highest we've seen to date, and it represents a complete change from what young people expected when he was inaugurated. Back then, they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off.",
      "And majorities feel the Trump administration is focusing too much on tariffs (72%), deportations (64%), and ending DEI programs (55%). These shares have all grown significantly over time. By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue.",

By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue.",
      "Looking back and ahead ...",
      "Instead of marking a permanent rightward shift, Mr. Trump's better-than-expected performance with young voters last year is beginning to look more like a temporary reaction. Indeed, less partisan voters tend to be more responsive to short-term forces, like the economic conditions that drove many to the ballot box in 2024. And when Trump was inaugurated, many young people hoped he would turn the economy around, with his initial ratings likely reflecting some optimism. This honeymoon period quickly faded. His 18-29 rating is now below Joe Biden's when he left office.",
      "Looking ahead to 2026, Republicans' electoral success may depend on both the president's numbers and youth turnout. If views of Mr. Trump's job handling don't improve over the next year, they could be a drag on GOP congressional candidates. And while young voters are less likely to turn out in non-presidential years, both the 2018 and 2022 midterms saw record numbers go to the polls, including voters under 30. In fact, in 2022, young voters turned out at a rate that came close to saving the Democrats' majority. In a tight contest, they could be pivotal again.",
      "Estimating small subgroups in polls",
      "To more precisely estimate trends in approval among young people, I aggregated our polls and ran a statistical model that controls for respondents' race, education level, 2024 vote, and survey date.",
      "Why take this approach? All polls have a margin of error, and the margin of error is greater for subgroups within the poll, as a function of sample size and routine weighting. So, even though young people are represented proportionate to their share of the population, estimating what percentage of them approve of the president naturally comes with a higher margin of error. It's driven by random variation in which types of young people respond to a given poll, and margins of error grow as you slice data more thinly \u2014 for instance, in disaggregating young people by gender.",
      "Since a single poll can only do so much, we can combine data across polls to boost sample sizes and gain confidence in our estimates. Aggregating surveys yields sample sizes of over 1,200 men and 1,300 women under 30 to analyze. And the model smoothens out poll-to-poll randomness within these subgroups.",
      "The modeled estimates for any given time point are consistently within range of the unmodeled survey data, typically within a few points. And importantly, they tell the same story: both young men and young women's views of Trump have worsened, and the gender gap has decreased.",

      "In a letter posted on Sunday, the AMA \u2014 the largest association of physicians in the U.S. \u2014 addressed Kennedy over a report published Friday in The Wall Street Journal. The WSJ story cited sources familiar with the matter as saying Kennedy plans to dismiss the task force members because he views them as too \"woke.\"",
      "\"USPSTF plays a critical, non-partisan role in guiding physicians' efforts to prevent disease and improve the health of patients by helping to ensure access to evidence-based clinical preventive services,\" the AMA's letter said. \"As such, we urge you to retain the previously appointed members of the USPSTF and commit to the long-standing process of regular meetings to ensure their important work can continue without interruption.\"",

As a physician, I rely on their expertise and recommendations when discussing preventive care with my patients in the clinic,\" Kon said in an emailed statement, adding she's especially concerned about the potential impact to safe and effective medication to prevent HIV.",
      "\"We have to insist that our guidelines are based on science, evidence-based medicine, and shared decision-making \u2014 not politics. Our nation's health depends on it,\" she said.",
      "Dr. Thomas Lew, an assistant clinical professor of medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine and attending physician of hospital medicine at Stanford Health Care Tri-Valley, had similar concerns about preventative care.",
      "\"This will greatly damage all the work we've done in preventative care, making people sicker, and driving up costs and premiums,\" he said. \"To put it mildly, this is extremely concerning \u2014 and doing the opposite of making America healthy.\"",

      "The task force was created more than 40 years ago, but its work took on added significance after passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. The law requires health insurers and group health plans to provide preventive services that are recommended by the task force without imposing co-pays, deductibles or other cost-sharing charges on patients.",
      "In June, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the structure of the task force, but ruled that its members are \"inferior officers\" that can be \"removable at will\" by the HHS secretary. As the case played out, nonprofit organizations warned the Supreme Court that eliminating cost-sharing for services like breast cancer screenings or HIV-prevention medications would dissuade patients from seeking medical care.",
      "Last month, Kennedy fired all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practice, also known as ACIP, a separate government panel of that makes vaccine recommendations. He later named eight new advisers, including several allies he has worked with closely over the years and some members with a history as vaccine critics.",
      "Kennedy has also shared big plans to shake up medical journals in the country. The health secretary told CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook he wants to create new journals and even stop the publication of NIH-funded research in traditional journals.",
      "\"We need to replicate studies, we need to publish raw data. We need to get away from the traditional journals, which are controlled by the pharmaceutical industry, and create our own journals, which we're going to do,\" Kennedy said.",

      "President Trump opened a new golf course bearing his name in Scotland on Tuesday, capping a five-day foreign trip designed around promoting his family's luxury properties and playing golf, and agreeing on a major trade deal framework with the EU.",
      "\"Let's go. 1-2-3,\" Mr. Trump said before he cut the red ribbon.",
      "Mr. Trump and his sons, Eric and Donald Jr., were also set to play the first-ever round at the new Trump course in the village of Balmedie, on the northern coast of Scotland.",
      "\"This has been an unbelievable development,\" the president said before the ceremonial opening. He thanked his son Eric for his work on the project, saying it was \"truly a labor of love for him.\"",
      "The overseas jaunt enabled Mr. Trump to escape Washington's sweaty summer humidity and the still-raging scandal over the case of Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "It was mostly built around golf \u2014 and walking the new course before it officially begins offering rounds to the public on Aug. 13, adding to a lengthy list of ways the president has used the White House to promote his brand.",
      "Billing itself the \"Greatest 36 Holes in Golf,\" the Trump International Golf Links, Scotland, was designed by Eric Trump. The course is hosting a PGA Seniors Championship event later this week, after Mr. Trump leaves. Signs promoting the event had already been erected all over the course before he arrived on Tuesday and, on the highway leading in, temporary metal signs guided drivers onto the correct road.",
      "Golfers hitting the course at dawn as part of that event had to put their clubs through metal detectors erected as part of the security sweeps ahead of his arrival. Several dozen people, some dressed for golf, including wearing cleats, had filled the sand trap near the tee box to watch the ribbon-cutting ceremony shortly before it was scheduled to start. Another group of people was watching from the other side in tall grass growing on sand dunes flanking the first hole.",
      "Also from Scotland's north is the president's late mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, who was born on the Isle of Lewis, immigrated to New York and died in 2000 at age 88.",
      "\"My mother loved Scotland,\" Mr. Trump said during a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday at another one of his golf courses, Turnberry, on Scotland's southern coast. \"It's different when your mother was born here.\"",
      "Mr. Trump used his trip to meet with Starmer and reach a trade framework for tariffs between the U.S. and the European Union's 27 member countries\u00a0\u2014 though scores of key details remain to be hammered out. But the trip has featured a lot of golf, and having the president visit is sure to raise the new course's profile.",
      "Mr. Trump's assets are in a trust, and his sons are running the family business while he's in the White House. Any business generated at the course will ultimately enrich the president when he leaves office though.",
      "A press release says the new course features the world's largest natural bunker, dunes and greens overlooking the sea, with a \"focus on environmental sensitivity.\"",
      "Visible from various parts of the new course were towering windmills lining the coast \u2014 some with blades that showed visible dots of rust. They are part of a nearby windfarm that Mr. Trump sued to block construction of in 2013.",
      "He lost that case and was eventually ordered to pay legal costs for bringing it \u2014 and the issue still enrages him. During the meeting with Starmer, Mr. Trump called windmills \"ugly monsters\" and suggested they were part of \"the most expensive form of energy.\"",
      "\"I restricted windmills in the United States because they also kill all your birds,\" the president said. \"If you shoot a bald eagle in the United States, they put you in jail for five years. And windmills knock out hundreds of them. They don't do anything. Explain that.\"",
      "Starmer said in the U.K., \"we believe in a mix\" of energy, including oil and gas and renewables.",
      "The new golf course is the third owned by the Trump Organization in Scotland. Mr. Trump bought Turnberry in 2014 and owns another course near Aberdeen that opened in 2012.",
      "Mr. Trump golfed at Turnberry on Saturday, as protesters took to the streets, and on Sunday. He invited Starmer, who famously doesn't golf, aboard Air Force One so the prime minister could get a private tour of his Aberdeen properties before Tuesday's ceremonial opening.",
      "\"Even if you play badly, it's still good,\" Mr. Trump said of golfing on his course over the weekend. \"If you had a bad day on the golf course, it's OK. It's better than other days.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also found time to to praise Turnberry's renovated ballroom, which he said he'd paid lavishly to upgrade \u2014 even suggesting that he might install one like it at the White House.",
      "\"I could take this one, drop it right down there,\" Mr. Trump joked. \"And it would be beautiful.\"",

The department is being sued by 16 states, including Connecticut, over the cuts.",
      "Costa says if they lose the grant, all 19 staffers he hired may have to be let go. It's a problem many school districts across the country have shared with CBS News.",
      "\"People deal with trauma in their lives, and when that happens, they need someone to talk to,\" Costa said. \"They need support. And I see every day how our adults help these kids in those situations.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 27, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to French Foreign Minister Jean\u2011No\u00ebl\u202fBarrot, who joins us this morning from Paris. Welcome to \"Face The Nation.\" I want to begin on what is happening in Gaza with those horrific images that we are seeing of starvation overnight, Israel has begun air drops. We know Jordan, other states are looking to organize more aid. Are you exploring any further avenues to bring aid into Gaza?",
      "FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER JEAN-NO\u00cbL BARROT: What's happening in Gaza right now is appalling. Gaza is- is- is now in the brink of a full catastrophe, and we've been working out, over the months, to try and relief the sufferings of the Palestinian people. We actually have 52 tons of humanitarian help stuck in El-Arish in Egypt, a few kilometers away from Gaza. So we're exploring all options to seize the opportunity offered by the Israeli government by opening the skies of Gaza, but we call for immediate, unhindered, and massive access by all means of humanitarian help to those who need it most.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Has Israel responded to your calls?",
      "BARROT: We have, with the European Union, started tough discussions with the Israeli government, who have made first commitments that have not been fulfilled yet. In the next few days, the European Commission will make clear what our expectations are. We expect the Israeli government to stop the operations of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation that has caused bloodbath in humanitarian help distribution lines in Gaza. We expect them to pay the 2 billion euros they owe to the Palestinian Authority and to lift the financial blockage that is now preventing the Palestinian Authority to implement its most basic missions. We also expect the Israeli government to bring to a stop its latest settlement projects, the E1 projects with 3,400 housing units that might split the West Bank in two pieces and prevent the emergence of a political, a two state solution. But what we call for is, of course, the immediate cease-fire, the liberation of whole hostages of Hamas, that needs to be disarmed. And the entry, the massive entry, of humanitarian help in Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are headed to New York, to the United Nations, to help lead a summit to talk about a two state solution. Your president announced France will formally recognize the state of Palestine at the UN in September. More than 100 countries recognize Palestine, but France is the first western UN Security Council member to do so, and the United States opposes what you are saying. Secretary of State Rubio called it \"reckless.\" He says it serves Hamas propaganda, sets back peace, and considers it \"a slap in the face to the victims of October 7.\" In your government's view, why is he wrong?",
      "BARROT: So the reason why President Macron made this decision is that it was absolutely necessary to restart a political process, the two state solution process that was- that is today threatened, more threatened that it- it has ever been. And the conference that will take place in New York tomorrow and Tuesday is a very significant milestone, because by- by- by recognizing, or announcing the recognition of Palestine, France has been able, alongside Saudi Arabia, that has- that will be co chairing this conference with us, to collect very significant historic commitments by all stakeholders, including the Palestinian Authority president and Arab countries, in favor of the two state solution, and guarantee security guarantees for Israel. The two state solution is very simple, and I think everyone can understand what we mean by that. The only way to bring peace and stability back in this region is to have two state, the state of Israel and the state of Palestine, living side by side in peace and in security. This perspective is now threatened, and it's why the- the dynamic that we have initiated was so important, and this is why the conference that will take place in New York is such an important milestone. All these efforts are very, very complementary to the efforts that the U.S. have done in the region since the first term of President Trump. We share the short-term objective: immediate cease-fire, liberation of all hostages of Hamas that needs to be disarmed. We share the long term objective: peace and stability in the region. And what we're doing, by bringing the Palestinian Authority leader to recognize seventh of October as a terrorist attack, by calling the Hamas- the disarm- for the disarmament of Hamas and the liberation of hostages, by committing to deep reform of the Palestinian Authority, and by committing to elections within one year, by bringing the Arab countries for the first time to condemn Hamas and call for its disarmament, we are creating, or recreating, the conditions for this political solution that, again, is the only path forward, and we are paving the way. We're paving the way for the future Abraham Accords that the U.S. administration might lead. So I see our effort as very complementary to the U.S. administration's effort, rather than substitutes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Minister Barrot, the president of the United States dismissed what President Macron said, the U.S. Ambassador mocked it. Do you believe that your plans can succeed without U.S. support?",
      "BARROT: Again, our efforts are very complementary . We share the short term objective, cease-fire, liberation of all hostages of Hamas, and the long term objective, peace and stability in the region. In fact, we will welcome any further efforts led by the U.S. to implement the Abraham Accord logics. And what we're doing now with this very significant conference that will take place in New York will pave the way for such accords. But in the meantime, until the U.S. administration provides, through the Abraham Accord logics, a political horizon for this crisis, we need to act in order to facilitate the- or create an off ramp for the catastrophe ongoing in Gaza. Now the terms, we will welcome and support future Abraham Accords, but in the meantime, inaction is not an option.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you briefly about an incident that has gained a lot of attention this past week involving some young French citizens who were removed from a flight from Spain. The airline claims they were kicked off for being disruptive. The Israeli government came out though and said the French students were removed because they're Jewish. Have you determined whether this was indeed an act of antisemitism?",
      "BARROT: I have called the CEO of this company, who has- to express our- our serious preoccupation. She has confirmed that an internal investigation is ongoing. My team has been reaching out to the ambassador of Spain in- in France, and we've made the same request. We'll keep following this situation as it unravels",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So too- too early to say, despite what the Israeli government is indicating.",
      "BARROT: I cannot comment on that at this point. We've taken action as- as soon as we got, you know, as we got notice of what was happening, we offered support on location through our embassy to this group. We then reached out to the- the airline company, to the Spanish authorities, and we're now following the results of these investigations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: France has been very active diplomatically on a number of fronts. It was just five weeks ago when the United States and Israel bombed Iran. Since that time, France has talked to the Iranian government, along with other European powers, about what remains of Iran's nuclear program. How concerned are you that after these bombings, Iran may now covertly attempt to make a weapon, and the world won't know?",
      "BARROT: This is still a risk that we are facing, and alongside Germany and the UK, we have been very clear, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon, and we've been, over the past few months, reaching out to the Iranian authority in close coordination with U.S. authorities in order to express what our expectations are. Ten years ago, we reached a deal on the nuclear program that allowed for a significant rollback of Iranian nuclear capacity. Of course, things has changed. Still then, and since then, Iran has violated all commitments it had taken at the time of signing this agreement. We now want a more comprehensive agreement that would encompass both the nuclear dimension of Iranian destabilization activities, but also it's the ballistic component, as well as the regional destabilization activities that Iran has been conducting, unless we- unless a new and robust and durable and verifiable agreement is reached by the end of the summer, France, Germany and the UK will have no other choice but to reapply the global embargoes that were lifted 10 years ago when the nuclear agreement with Iran was signed, embargoes on weapons, on nuclear equipment, and on banking.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So France is ready to snap back sanctions on Iran as soon as August. Are you asking Iran to speak directly to the United States in order to avoid that fate?",
      "BARROT: We've been speaking with Special Envoy Witkoff, Secretary Rubio, on a weekly basis on this topic that is highly important for the U.S., as for Europeans. We- we have supported U.S.-led efforts to enter into discussions with Iran. We have pressed Iran, after the 12 day war, to go back to a discussion with the U.S., and we'll keep pressing them to do so, because indeed, if there is no solid agreement that can be found by the end of August, we will have no other option but to snap back, meaning to reapply those global embargoes, and we are ready to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Minister Barrot, thank you very much for your time this morning."

    "published": "Sun, 27 Jul 2025 14:02:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen said rescissions\u2014the bills to cut funding Congress already approved\u2014are \"just a Washington name for double cross.\"",
    "story": [
      "Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought said his office is considering more options to claw back funding approved by Congress and isn't ruling out sending more bills to lawmakers with further cuts before September.",
      "Vought\u00a0said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that \"we are looking to do [a] rescissions package\" to take back some funding from the Education Department and would be \"looking at a lot of different options.\" A rescissions bill is the president's request to rescind funding already appropriated by Congress. Last week, President Trump signed a bill clawing back foreign aid, NPR and PBS funding, becoming the first president in decades to receive approval for such a measure.",
      "\"We're thrilled that we had the first rescissions package in decades, and we've got the process moving again,\" Vought said of the $10 billion clawback. Asked to confirm there'd be no rescissions package before September, as Congress attempts to fund the government and head off a shutdown, Vought responded, \"Not here to say that. We're looking at all of our options, we will look at it and assess where the Hill is, what are the particular funding opportunities that we have?\"",
      "Asked about National Institutes of Health funding for research into heart disease and cancer that has yet to be released, Vought replied, \"We're going through the same process with the NIH that we did with the education.\" He alleged NIH had wasted funds, claiming \"$2 million for injecting dogs with cocaine that the NIH spent money on, $75,000 for Harvard to study blowing lizards off of trees with leaf blowers.\" He vowed to go \"line by line to make sure the NIH is funded properly\" and said funding would be released \"when we are done with that review.\"",
      "Vought's use of rescissions measures to amend government spending is seen by Democrats and some Republicans as a backdoor method of infringing on Congress' constitutional power of the purse.",
      "\"Rescissions is just a Washington name for double cross,\" Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, also on \"Face the Nation,\" said after Vought's interview on the program. \"They support one thing one day \u2014 the president even signs off \u2014 and then they come back and say they change their mind.\"",
      "But the OMB director argued, \"We have the ability and the executive tools to fund less than what Congress appropriated\" under the Impoundment Control Act, which enables the president to delay spending funds appropriated by Congress, and he didn't rule out a legal battle over the executive branch's authority to revise lawmakers' spending downward, if it \"could find waste\" by an agency.",
      "Vought has also caused GOP Senate Majority Leader John Thune some headaches with a comment he made Thursday suggesting the appropriations process must be \"less bipartisan.\" But this put Thune in a bind as he oversees negotiations to avoid a government shutdown in October, since Republicans hold a slim majority of 53 - 47 in the Senate, and most legislation must reach a 60-vote threshold.",
      "\"It's going to take 60 to fund the government,\" Thune said in response to Vought's remark, and he added, \"we plan to move [appropriations] bills that will have cooperation from the Democrats.\"",
      "Van Hollen said it was ironic that Vought is \"calling for these deep cuts to education, NIH, when he has asked for an increase for his OMB budget.\" And referring to reduction-in-force \u2014 or RIF \u2014 staff cuts the administration wants across the government, Van Hollen added, \"He asked for a 13% increase for his OMB budget. He's asked for more people to join the OMB staff while he's talking about RIF-ing people at other departments.\"",
      "The Maryland senator said that Democratic senators, as they negotiate funding government operations, are \"asking for four Republican senators just to publicly declare that when they say they're gonna fund the Veterans Affairs Department, that they actually mean it.\""

      "Boxal said the tsunami generated by this earthquake was \"not huge. It's not one that's going to cause mass devastation. But it will cause coastal flooding and it will cause damage and it does put lives at risk if people don't move to high ground.\"",
      "Two magnitude 9.1 earthquakes - the Tohoku earthquake in 2011 in Japan and the 2004 Sumatra earthquake in Indonesia - caused massive tsunamis that killed thousands of people.",
      "Earthquake scientist Grace Sethanant said there was a reason those temblors caused much more devastating tsunamis than Wednesday's quake.",
      "While a magnitude 9.1 quake \"might seem not so far off from the magnitude 8.8 \u2026 in terms of energy, it's three times stronger,\" Sethanant said.",
      "\"Imagine the 8.8 is, as I drop a rock in the lake, and you see the ripples. That's the energy,\" Sethanant said. \"Imagine you have that rock like three times bigger. So, in terms of the earthquake movement magnitude, the energy of the 2011 and 2004 earthquakes in Sumatra and in Japan, it's actually three to four times bigger. ... And that's why the tsunamis in those events were much more devastating.\"",
      "National Tsunami Warning Center  Tsunami Warning Coordinator Dave Snider said tsunamis should be thought of more as \"ocean floods\" than waves.",
      "\"The most important thing to understand about a tsunami is this is not a surf wave, it's not a wind wave,\" Snider said. \"A tsunami is the entire ocean column that is being lifted above that high tide level there because of that extreme movement of the Earth's crust with the earthquake there, so this is a significant planetary event that we've just witnessed.\"",

    "summary": "The Crew 11 flight include three fliers headed for space after reassignments in the wake of problems with Boeing's Starliner capsule.",
    "story": [
      "NASA is ready to send a fresh crew to the International Space Station Thursday aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, including three fliers who were assigned to the flight after NASA ran into problems with Boeing's troubled Starliner capsule last year.",
      "Liftoff from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center is set for 12:09 p.m. EDT, roughly the moment Earth's rotation carries the Falcon 9 rocket into alignment with the space station's orbit \u2014 a requirement for rendezvous missions. If all goes well, the Crew Dragon will dock with the lab complex early Saturday.",
      "Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman originally expected to fly to the space station last fall, but she and Crew 9 crewmate Stephanie Wilson were bumped from the flight to free up two seats to bring Starliner astronauts Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams back to Earth after an extended stay in space.",
      "Wilmore and Williams flew to the orbital lab complex last June in the first piloted flight of a Starliner. But their stay in space was extended because of Starliner propulsion system problems. NASA managers eventually opted to bring them down earlier this year aboard the Crew 9 Dragon, using the seats given up by Cardman and Wilson.",
      "\"If I think about it only as an individual, and how it affected me, yes, of course, it was an unexpected change,\" Cardman said. \"But space flight is not about me or about any individual. It's about what we can do together. None of us can do this by ourselves.",
      "\"Now I have the opportunity to train with this wonderful, amazing crew. Life is a journey. It takes many turns, and I'm just grateful to be here.\"",
      "Cardman's co-pilot for the Crew 11 mission is NASA's Michael Fincke, a 58-year-old three-flight veteran who trained to fly aboard Boeing's Starliner as did Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui. In the wake of the problems encountered last year during the Starliner test flight, and the expected long delay before it's launched again, both ended up assigned to Crew 11.",
      "The fourth crew member is Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, a space rookie. Like his crewmates, he also expected to fly aboard another spacecraft, in his case, a Russian Soyuz.",
      "But he ended up assigned to Crew 11 as part of a joint U.S.-Russian seat-swap program intended to ensure at least one representative of each country is always on board the ISS even if one crew ferry ship has to depart in an emergency, taking all of its crew members with it. Platonov is the seventh cosmonaut to fly aboard a Crew Dragon under theagreement.",
      "Fincke said the crew is more than ready for launch.",
      "\"Space has been calling my name ever since I returned from my last mission in 2011,\" he posted on the social media platform X. \"Our crew is ready. Let's do this! Go Falcon, Go Dragon, Go Crew-11!\"",
      "Their ride to the station \u2014 the Crew Dragon Endeavour \u2014 is making its sixth flight, a new record for NASA and SpaceX.",
      "Steven Stich, manager of NASA's commercial crew program, said SpaceX is working to certify Crew Dragons for up to 15 flights. The SpaceX ferry ships currently are certified for five flights, but Stich said a detailed analysis of Endeavour's flight history, performance and test results allowed NASA to clear the ship for a sixth flight.",
      "\"Our focus here is to really get to this particular launch, to make sure that we have everything cleared for six flights, and then down the road, we may have a little bit more work to do depending on the specific vehicle and how many flights it is.",
      "\"The overall goal was 15 flights, and we've gotten there on many components. Now we're just down to a handful that really are there (confirmed good) for only six flights.\"",
      "Catching up with the space station",
      "It will take the Crew Dragon 39 hours to catch up with the station early Saturday.",
      "After passing about 1,200 feet directly below the outpost, Endeavour will loop up, cross in front of the lab and then on up to a point directly above the forward Harmony module's space-facing port. From there, it will move straight down for docking around 3 a.m.",
      "The crew will be welcomed aboard by Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nichole Ayers, Japanese station commander Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov, who were launched to the station on March 14. Also on hand will be Soyuz MS-27/73S cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky along with NASA's Jonny Kim, launched from Kazakhstan on April 8.",
      "Also on board: clothing and personal items for Cardman that were launched last year before her expected Crew 9 flight. Included in those personal items were birthday cards, including one from her father, a physicist, who passed away last August just before NASA bumped Cardman from Crew 9.",
      "She will celebrate her next birthday, turning 38, in October.",
      "\"My parents knew that I would be on the space station for my birthday last year, we thought, so they sent a few items in advance so that I could feel at home while I was up there. And now I'll have the chance to see them,\" Cardman told CBS News.",
      "\"My whole history, the people who have brought me to where I am today, I think it's going to feel really special to feel that connection to my dad, to my parents on my birthday in space.\"",
      "Cardman and her crewmates are replacing the Crew 10 fliers, who plan to undock Aug. 6, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the southern California coast to close out a 145-day mission. Highlights included a spacewalk by McClain and Ayers and a non-stop schedule of research and station maintenance.",
      "\"I'm kind of looking forward to doing nothing for a couple of days,\" McClain joked when asked what she looked forward to the most about returning to Earth. Onishi said he was looking forward to seeing his family again, \"and also taking a hot shower on the ground!\"",
      "Added Ayers, who said she'll miss the opportunity to photograph Earth from the vantage point of space: \"In addition to what Anne and Tak said, I'm actually looking forward to a big, juicy burger on the beach.\"",
      "Planning for\u00a0months in orbit",
      "It's not yet known how long Crew 11 will be on board the space station.",
      "Up to this point, long-duration crews, U.S. and Russian, have typically spent around six months in orbit. But starting with the Soyuz MS-27/73S mission, the Russians have switched to eight-month stays. NASA may follow suit starting with the Crew 12 mission next year.",
      "The Trump administration's proposed budget for fiscal 2026 would reduce NASA funding by nearly 25 percent while directing the agency to scale back work aboard the ISS in favor of more aggressive planning for eventual crewed missions to Mars.",
      "NASA managers are now considering lengthening crew stays and possibly reducing Dragon crews from four to three and perhaps just two, one American and one Russian. A reduced crew would need fewer resupply missions, saving additional money. But it would sharply reduce the amount of research that could be carried out.",
      "No final decisions have been made.",
      "\"When we launch ... we have a six-month mission duration that we baseline,\" said Stich. \"We can extend the mission in real time as needed as we better understand the reconciliation bill and the appropriations process and what that means relative to the overall station manifest.\"",
      "For her part, Cardman said she would welcome an additional two months in orbit.",
      "\"I can't wait to be in space, and two extra months would be a gift,\" she said. \"Yes, we're baselined for six months right now, with the ability to extend that pending further analysis. For me, it would be an absolute privilege to stay for even longer.\"",

    "story": [
      "SpaceX launched twin satellites for NASA Wednesday that will study how the electrically-charged solar wind interacts with Earth's magnetic field, creating constantly changing and occasionally dangerous \"space weather\" affecting satellites, electrical grids and other critical systems.",
      "The identical TRACERS satellites will operate in the magnetosphere, \"the region around our Earth that is dominated by the planet's magnetic field, and it protects us from the stellar radiation and really from everything else that's going on in space,\" said Joseph Westlake, director of NASA's solar physics division.",
      "\"What we will learn from TRACERS is critical for the understanding and eventually the predicting of how energy from our sun impacts the Earth and our space and ground-based assets, whether it be GPS or communication signals, power grids, space assets and our astronauts working up in space.",
      "\"It's going to help us keep our way of life safe here on Earth.\"",
      "Hitching a ride to space along with TRACERS atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket were five other small satellites, including one that will use a new \"polylingual\" terminal to communicate with multiple other satellites and space probes using different protocols.",
      "Another will collect data about how much solar energy Earth absorbs and reemits into space, known as the \"radiation budget,\" and another that will focus on how high-energy \"killer electrons\" are knocked out of the Van Allen radiation belts to rain down into the atmosphere.",
      "Two other small satellites were aboard, including an experimental \"cubesat\" that will test high-speed 5G communications technology in space and another built by an Australian company carrying five small satellites to test space-based air-traffic management technology that could provide aircraft tracking and communications anywhere in the world.",
      "The mission got underway at 2:13 p.m. EDT when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket roared to life at launch complex 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base on the California coast. The launching one day late because of a regional power outage Tuesday that interrupted air traffic communications over the Pacific Ocean near Vandenberg.",
      "The second time around, the countdown ticked smoothly to zero and after boosting the upper stage and payloads out of the lower atmosphere, the first stage peeled away, reversed course and flew back to a landing near the launch pad.",
      "A few seconds later, the upper stage engine shut down to put the vehicle in its planned preliminary orbit. The two satellites making up the primary TRACERS payload were deployed about an hour-and-a-half after launch.",
      "Two of the other smallsats were to be released earlier in a slightly different orbit, with the remainder following TRACERS a few minutes later.",
      "TRACERS is an acronym for Tandem Reconnection and Cusp Electrodynamics Reconnaissance Satellites. The twin spacecraft, built by Boeing, will fly in tandem in the same orbit, 10 seconds to two minutes apart, helping researchers precisely measure rapid changes indicating how the solar wind \"couples\" with Earth's magnetic field.",
      "\"So the Sun is a burning, fiery ball of plasma and as it burns, it blows off an exhaust that we call the solar wind, it's a plasma, and that's always streaming from the sun towards the Earth,\" said David Miles, principal investigator at the University of Iowa.",
      "\"And sometimes, the magnetic field of the Earth basically stands it off in the same way that if you have a rock in a stream, the water kind of flows around it. But other times, those two systems couple (and) you dump mass, energy and momentum into the Earth system.\"",
      "That coupling drives spectacular auroral displays, \"but it also drives some of the negative things that we want to... understand and mitigate, like unplanned electrical currents in our electrical grids that can potentially cause accelerated aging in electrical pipelines, disruption of GPS, things like that.\"",
      "\"So what we're looking at trying to understand is how the coupling between those systems changes in space and in time,\" Miles said.",
      "The goals of the other satellites launched Wednesday range from basic science to technology development. The Polylingual Experimental Terminal, or PExT, will test equipment capable of sending and receiving data from multiple government and commercial satellites across multiple communications protocols.",
      "The goal is to streamline communications to and from a wide variety of satellites and space probes to improve efficiency and lower costs.",
      "Another satellite, known as Athena-EPIC, will continue ongoing measurements of Earth's radiation budget, the balance between solar energy coming into Earth's environment compared to the energy radiated back out into space.",
      "Using spare parts from earlier missions, Athena-EPIC will test innovative LEGO-like satellite components intended to lower costs while reducing the size of satellites.",
      "The Relativistic Atmospheric Loss, or REAL, satellite, another small cubesat, will study how electrons in the Van Allen radiation belts get knocked out of place to pose threats to satellites and other systems. Robyn Millan of Dartmouth College is the principal investigator.",
      "\"The radiation belts are a region surrounding the Earth that are filled with high-energy charged particles that are traveling at near the speed of light,\" she said. \"These are sometimes called killer electrons because these particles are a hazard for our satellites in space. They also rain down on our atmosphere where they can contribute to ozone destruction.\"",
      "The REAL cubesat weighs less than 10 pounds and measures just a foot long. Despite its small size, \"it carries a powerful particle sensor that will for the first time make very rapid measurements of these electrons as they enter our atmosphere, and this is really critical for understanding what's scattering them.\"",
      "What makes REAL unique, she said, was the sensor's small size, allowing it to be carried by a cubesat, which \"could enable future missions, especially those requiring constellations of satellites.\"",

    "summary": "A dating advice app that lets women anonymously review their dates and compare notes has surged in popularity.",
    "story": [
      "The most downloaded free app on Apple's App Store currently isn't ChatGPT, Threads or Google. It's Tea, a dating advice app that lets women review men they've gone out with, as well as warn other single women about dates they claim went awry.",
      "Tea Dating Advice, an app for helping women vet their dates, is also a top app on the Google Play Store, where it's been downloaded more than 100,000 times.",
      "The app's maker says it offers a measure of security for users that traditional dating apps\u00a0don't. Tea doesn't match singles with potential dates; rather, it's a place for women to share information about men they've dated. Tea lets users run background checks on potential matches, check to see if they have criminal records or appear on sex offender databases, and more, all through the app.",
      "The app also ensures that users who sign up are women by requesting that they submit a selfie for verification. That's aimed at protecting users against so-called catfishing schemes, in which people create fake online personas, often as part of a scheme to defraud others.",
      "Tea declined to comment for this article.",
      "Safety in numbers",
      "To be sure, most of the features that Tea offers already exist. Social media forums, such as the Facebook group called \"Are we dating the same guy?,\" also let women compare notes about their dates in a community forum. The main difference: scale. Tea has more than 1.6 million users, according to its website.",
      "\"What this app seems to be doing is centralizing all that into one very large community,\" Doug Zytko, an associate professor at the University of Michigan-Flint who researches human-computer interactions for safety, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Zytko, who has extensively studied dating app designs, said that safety \"has not been prioritized\" for most such tools in the market, which he said helps explain why Tea has struck a chord with women.",
      "\"The dating app safety features that exist are largely reactive in nature. They're not about keeping people safe, but are punitive actions one can take after something has occurred,\" he added.",
      "Zytko also acknowledged the concerns of some men, voiced on forums like Reddit, that Tea users could share false information about them.",
      "\"If inaccurate information about a man is being shared, that damages his dating prospects and social reputation,\" Zytko said. \"That's scary, but it's not a reason to discount the app.\"",
      "Another potential risk is one common to all social media platform, and digital information more broadly. Tea confirmed to CBS News that its app was hacked Friday morning, with bad actors accessing a data storage system containing information, including selfies, that members had uploaded prior to February 2024.",
      "Additionally, hackers accessed almost 60,000 images from posts, plus comments and direct messages, the company said.",
      "\"Tea has engaged third-party cybersecurity experts and are working around the clock to secure its systems,\" the company said in a statement, noting that it is investigating the incident. \"At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that additional user data was affected.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 17:50:10 -0400",
    "summary": "A growing number of employers in tech and other fields are recruiting workers with expertise in AI, labor data shows.",
    "story": [
      "AI gets a lot of attention for eliminating human jobs, but more and more it is also creating them.",
      "The number of job postings that mention artificial intelligence has climbed in recent years as employers seek workers versed in AI, a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from the Brookings Institution shows, In the last year alone, AI-themed job postings increased by over 100%, the Washington, D.C.-based think tank found.",
      "AI-related job postings have grown at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years \u2014 that outstrips the 11% rate of postings in the general economy, said Brookings, which based its findings on data from labor market analytics firm Lightcast.",
      "Demand for AI expertise is growing as more companies start to integrate AI into their workflows. The share of companies using AI in the manufacturing sector has more than doubled from 4% in early 2023 to roughly 9% as of mid-2025, according to Brookings, citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS).",
      "Yet while AI job growth has accelerated in recent years, it makes up only a small fraction of the labor market overall. Investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates the peak pace of adoption will hit in the early 2030s.",
      "\"AI is definitely visible in the micro labor market data, but it doesn't look like it's driving the overall labor market dynamic,\" said Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs.",
      "What kind of AI jobs?",
      "The burgeoning AI job market involves a mix of skill sets ranging from advanced AI-specific roles, such as AI engineers, to more general AI-related positions such as software developers, according to Elena Magrini, global head of research at Lightcast.",
      "In 2025, more than 80,000 job postings mentioned generative AI skills, up from 3,780 in 2010, \u00a0according to Brookings.",
      "Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the accelerating adoption of AI by businesses is spurring demand for consultants who can help companies integrate AI. Job listings relating to so-called responsible AI\u00a0jobs, which focus on the ethical use of AI tools in business and society, are also on the rise, according to Indeed.",
      "\"In other words, the definition of what it means to be an 'AI job' is changing every day as businesses find new and creative ways to incorporate the technology responsibly,\" Stahle said.",
      "AI positions may prove an especially appealing sector of the U.S. labor market given that they tend to be associated with higher salaries. Job postings that mention AI skills pay an average of $18,000, or 28%, more per year than for similar roles that don't require AI skills, according to a separate report from Lightcast.",
      "Where are AI jobs to be found?",
      "Unsurprisingly, AI job growth tends to be concentrated in tech hubs like Silicon Valley, which accounts for 13% of all AI-related job postings. Seattle accounts for 7% according to data from Lightcast.",
      "But AI jobs are starting to surface in other parts of the country including the Sunbelt and along the East Coast between Boston and Washington, D.C. said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro. Universities have also been a catalyst for AI job growth, he noted.",
      "Magrini noted that AI skills are increasingly required in other non-tech fields like marketing, human resources and finance. Over half of job postings requesting AI skills in 2024 were outside IT and computer science, according to Lightcast data.",
      "While uptake is uneven across geographic areas, Muro said he expects AI adoption by employers to increase more rapidly in the coming years as they figure out its benefits and limitations.",
      "\"There does seem to be good consensus that this is very important for productivity and that it does really energize regional leaders and business people,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Automated license plate reader technology is used by law enforcement agencies in communities across the U.S. \u2014 but the systems sometimes get things wrong.",
    "story": [
      "In 2018, Brian Hofer and his younger brother were driving to visit their parents for Thanksgiving. It should have been a routine trip.",
      "But that evening they found themselves held at gunpoint by a group of law enforcement officers.",
      "The incident was the result of technology gone wrong. Hofer's vehicle had been flagged as stolen by an Automated License Plate Reader \u2014 ALPR \u2014 system. When he drove by, the reader alerted authorities.",
      "\"Your life definitely is different after you have guns pointed at you,\" he said.",
      "This incident is one of over a dozen cases verified by CBS News during a six-month investigation into incidents of wrongful stops and even several instances of ALPR technology being abused.",
      "The consequences of ALPR errors can range from the inconvenient \u2014 such as mistaken toll booth charges \u2014 to the potentially dangerous, such as Hofer's armed detainment. In some instances the technology was improperly used by authorities, such as in Kansas, where law enforcement officers used license plate reader systems to stalk former partners in two separate incidents.",
      "The rise of ALPR systems",
      "In use since at least the\u00a0late 1990s, automated license plate reader systems have advanced quickly in recent years. They now marry high-speed, high-resolution cameras with artificial intelligence to scan every license plate passing through a designated field of vision. The data is then compared against license plate numbers in databases.",
      "Thousands of agencies use these systems daily to scan plates in real time and identify potential matches. Departments use ALPRs as a crime-fighting tool to gather evidence for investigations and reduce crime as well as for traffic compliance.",
      "According to a survey from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, every police department overseeing more than 1 million citizens reported using the technology, as did 90% of sheriff's offices with 500 or more sworn deputies.",
      "Law enforcement officials told CBS News that the technology has allowed them to do their job more efficiently and has helped solve crimes ranging from stolen vehicles to missing persons cases.",
      "Pat Yoes, the national president of The National Fraternal Order of Police, an organization of hundreds of thousands of sworn law enforcement officers, said in an emailed statement to CBS News that ALPRs are \"extraordinarily important in cases where there is an immediate threat to life or safety, as in an abduction or an armed threat driving to a target,\" adding that the information can be valuable in generating leads and closing cases.",
      "He said transparency is key. \"The community should be made aware of the new technology, how it's used in the field, how it contributes to public safety, and how it addresses any privacy concerns,\" he said in the statement. \"Technology like ALPRs is a valuable tool for many law enforcement agencies to make their communities safer.\"",
      "The rise of ALPR systems comes as law enforcement agencies across the country face staffing and recruiting challenges. A 2024 survey by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, a professional association, found that U.S. agencies are operating at a nearly 10% staffing deficit. ALPR technology is one way to help fill this gap in manpower.",
      "Why license plate readers make errors \u2014 what we found",
      "License plate reader errors may occur for a variety of reasons. In some cases, letters or numbers are interpreted incorrectly by the Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, software. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, common issues including glare or misaligned cameras could impact accuracy. CBS News found that mistakes are often due to a mix of machine and human or administrative errors.",
      "In Espa\u00f1ola, New Mexico, a 12-year-old was handcuffed after an ALPR camera misread the last number of a license plate on a vehicle driven by her older sister as a \"7\" instead of the \"2\" it actually ended with, according to a lawsuit filed against the city. A month later, in a separate incident, a 17-year-old honors student was held at gunpoint in Espa\u00f1ola on his way home from school after officers mistook his vehicle for one associated with an individual who was being sought in connection with a string of armed robberies.",
      "In Aurora, Colorado, in 2020, a mother and her family, including her 6-year-old daughter, were pulled over at gunpoint and forced to lie face down on hot pavement. Again, ALPR technology was central to the stop. Police mistakenly flagged their Colorado license plate as matching that of a completely different vehicle from a different state \u2014 a stolen motorcycle registered in Montana. The incident, captured on video and widely condemned, led to a $1.9 million settlement from the city in 2024.",
      "Privacy and accuracy concerns",
      "The ACLU warns ALPR cameras could infringe on civil rights and violate the Constitution's Fourth Amendment by encouraging unreasonable searches. Despite widespread use, there is no federal legislative framework for ALPR use.",
      "Hofer, who has been involved in privacy advocacy for over a decade, is now the executive director of Secure Justice, an organization that aims to reduce government and corporate overreach. He says manual verification is necessary to see whether ALPR \"hits,\" or matches, are accurate. Even so, he said, such checks are insufficient because data errors could cause a plate to \"match\" an incorrect entry in a database.",
      "\"There are billions of scans a day in America. If there's even just a 10% error rate, that means there are so many opportunities for abuse to happen,\" Hofer said.",
      "Some concerned citizens are taking action. Last year, residents of Norfolk, Virginia, filed a federal lawsuit against the city, and in Illinois, two residents have sued the Illinois State Police over ALPR systems, arguing that their use violates Fourth Amendment rights. The latter case was dismissed without prejudice in April.",

The twin spacecraft, built by Boeing, will fly in tandem in the same orbit, 10 seconds to two minutes apart, helping researchers precisely measure rapid changes indicating how the solar wind \"couples\" with Earth's magnetic field.",
      "\"So the Sun is a burning, fiery ball of plasma and as it burns, it blows off an exhaust that we call the solar wind, it's a plasma, and that's always streaming from the sun towards the Earth,\" said David Miles, principal investigator at the University of Iowa.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans are mulling a possible rule change to allow them to more swiftly confirm President Trump's nominees amid Democrats' efforts to slow the process in protest to the president's policies.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Wednesday that interest is \"growing quickly\" among Senate Republicans for a change to the rules governing the nominations process as he's bemoaned an \"unprecedented level of obstruction and delay\" by Democrats in recent days.",
      "\"There's certainly interest in looking at options that might enable us to break the logjam and expedite consideration of nominees in a way that, in the end, would benefit both parties when their party has the presidency,\" Thune said.",
      "With around 1,300 positions requiring Senate confirmation, the process is an arduous one that has become more cumbersome in recent years. The average time to confirm a president's nominee has nearly quadrupled during the last six administrations, according to the Center for Presidential Transition. And Democrats have taken their slow-walking of Mr. Trump's nominees to new extremes in recent months, putting up procedural hurdles to delay the confirmations nearly across the board.",
      "Still, the opposition by Democrats has not been universal, since any single senator can effectively stall the path to swift confirmation.",
      "In recent years, both Democrats and Republicans have made pushes to change the confirmation process, like by cutting down the time requirements for the nominations and reducing the number of votes needed to a simple majority.",
      "Senate Republicans have been tight-lipped about the possible new changes to the process, which would represent a further change to the institution that has traditionally been resistant to change. Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, told CBS News that Senate Republicans are \"actively discussing\" possible changes, calling the obstruction of Mr. Trump's nominees \"unconscionable.\" He noted that he would say the same if the dynamic was occurring under a Democrat.",
      "Sen. Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican, told CBS News that \"we are actually not looking to do reforms, but we don't have a choice.\"",
      "\"This is Chuck Schumer's fault. He's the one that's forcing this. And, and so I don't know what he expects to happen, but we will have to have some reforms if this is the way they continue to operate,\" Mullin added.",
      "Sen. Tommy Tuberville, an Alabama Republican who during the Biden administration delayed the nominations of hundreds of military officers, argued that the chamber should remain in session to get the nominations done. \"We ought to stay if we don't get as many as we want to get,\" he said.",
      "\"President Trump says he wants us here,\" Tuberville said. \"We work for him.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump called for Senate Republicans to stay in session into their August recess to get the nominations done. And some other Senate Republicans, like Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, have echoed the sentiment. Lee has argued that the GOP should either \"exhaust\" Democrats by working through August \u2014 or give Mr. Trump the ability to make recess appointments.",
      "Asked about recess appointments, which afford the president the ability to temporarily fill vacancies while the Senate is in recess, Thune suggested that Senate Republicans would be more likely to \"make a modification to our rules\" to sidestep Democrats' delay.",
      "\"At some point, we may need to look at doing things differently on nominees generally, if the Democrats continue this path of obstruction that they're on right now,\" Thune said.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump took aim at another facet of the Senate's confirmation process late Tuesday in a post on Truth Social, urging Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican who leads the Senate Judiciary Committee, to end blue slips \u2014 a practice that gives senators veto power over judicial nominations in their home state.",
      "Thune told reporters that the blue slip process is \"something that's been used for a long time by both sides, and neither side has violated its usage in the past.\"",
      "\"I don't sense any rush to change it, and I think the key is to make sure that we're making good headway on moving the list of judges that are on the President's list,\" he added.",

    "summary": "The Fed is maintaining its benchmark interest rate in the range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it's been parked since December.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve\u00a0said\u00a0Wednesday it's keeping its benchmark interest rate unchanged, citing elevated uncertainty over the nation's economic outlook.",
      "The decision to hold rates steady marks a continuation of the Fed's \"wait-and-see\" strategy this year, as it monitors the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on consumer prices. But Wednesday's policy statement also underscored that the growth remains steady despite concerns about slowing economic activity.",
      "\"Although swings in net exports continue to affect the data, recent indicators suggest that growth of economic activity moderated in the first half of the year,\" the Federal Open Market Committee, the 12-person central bank's rate-setting panel, said in its statement. \"The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.\"",
      "Two voting FOMC members, Fed Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, voted in favor of lowering the central bank's short-term rate \u2014 a rare show of dissent at the Fed, where monetary policy is generally set by consensus. It is the first time since 1993 that two member of the Fed's Board of Governors have voted against the chair, according to Capital Economics.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has faced pressure in recent months from President Trump to lower rates, with the president arguing that inflation remains relatively tame.",
      "In a press conference on Wednesday, Powell said most FOMC members voted in favor of maintaining the current rate because inflation remains above the Fed's 2% annual target, while also describing the economy as remaining in good shape.",
      "\"The economy is not performing as though restrictive policy were holding it back inappropriately,\" he said.",
      "Powell added, \"The economy is in good shape, but it's an unusual situation in that you have risks to both sides of the mandate,\" referring to the Fed's dual goal of keeping both prices and unemployment low.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The central bank on Wednesday said it would maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The last time the central bank cut interest rates was in December 2024, when it trimmed rates by 0.25 percentage points.",
      "Wall Street had anticipated the Fed's decision, with economists pegging the probability the central bank would hold rates steady at 96%, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "Why is the Fed holding rates steady?",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has signaled the Fed remains cautious about ushering in lower rates given the potential impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, which he has said he believes could hit economic growth and reignite inflation.",
      "Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, thinks the dissents by Bowman and Waller represent a minority opinion on the FOMC, with most of the rate-setting panel's voting members preferring to hold rates steady amid amid concern about inflation.",
      "U.S. inflation still remains above the Fed's goal of driving it down to a 2% annual rate, with the Consumer Price Index inching higher in June to reach 2.7% on an annualized basis. At the same time, the economy remains solid, with today's GDP report showing stronger than expected second-quarter growth of 3%, providing more ammunition to back up the Fed's argument for keeping rates steady, economists say.",
      "\"This [GDP] report is unlikely to shift the Federal Reserve's stance,\" said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, in an email prior to the Fed's decision. The central bank will \"wait for more consistent signals before considering rate cuts.\"",
      "When could the Fed cut rates?",
      "Economists currently predict a 63% likelihood the Fed will cut rates at its Sept. 17 meeting, according to FactSet. The Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's rate-setting panel, doesn't meet in August, making the September meeting the next chance for a rate cut.",
      "Although the economy has proved resilient despite concerns about the impact of U.S. tariffs, some economists expect growth to lag and inflation to accelerate over the next few months. Following the latest Fed statement, Pantheon Macroeconomics chief U.S. economist Samuel Tombs forecast that the Fed will ease its benchmark rate by a total of 0.75 percentage points by year-end, starting in September.",
      "Asked whether the Fed could cut rates at the September meeting, Powell demurred noting that the decision will be based on economic data that is released between now and the central bank's next meeting on Sept. 16-17. In the lead-up to that decision, the Fed will assess two monthly job reports from the Department of Labor and two additional months' of Consumer Price Index data.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday announced a 25% tariff rate on imports from India ahead of his administration's Aug. 1 deadline to strike trade deals with dozens of other countries. American importers such as Walmart are on the hook for paying the tariffs, although many companies stocked up on goods earlier this year to try to avoid hiking prices for inflation-weary customers.",
      "\"We know from surveys that companies have every intention of putting [the tariff costs] through to consumers,\" Powell said. \"A reasonable base case is these are one-time price effects.\"",
      "He added, \"We will make sure this doesn't move from being a one-time price increase to serious inflation.\"",
      "Powell's remarks emphasizing the solid U.S. economy as well as the risks from tariffs signaled to some economists that a September rate cut might not be in the cards.",
      "\" For [a September rate cut] to happen, the rest of the FOMC will need to become either less concerned about the inflation outlook or more concerned about the economic and labor market outlook,\" said Capital Economics deputy chief North American economist Stephen Brown in a report.",

    "story": [
      "On July 31, 1977, Robert Violante and Stacy Moskowitz were on their first date sitting in his parked car in a Brooklyn \"lovers lane\" when they were suddenly shot in their heads by \"The Son of Sam\" serial killer who terrorized New Yorkers for more than a year before his arrest 40 years ago today.",
      "\"The doctors said I was not going to make it, and that Stacy would,\" Violante told CBS News. A .44 caliber slug destroyed Violante's left eye and damaged his right eye as it tore across his skull. But it was Moskowitz, a 19-year-old college co-ed, who succumbed to her wounds, and it was Violante, 20, who faced a life forever shattered by a maniac's bullets.",
      "Incredibly, just four days earlier, Violante landed a modeling job at the Wilhelmina Modeling Agency after taking an hour subway into \"the city\" - Manhattan. Once the agents saw the 6-feet-1 Violante, with his John Travolta looks, they immediately signed him up starting the following Monday. In many ways, he was a real-life \"Tony Manero,\" the character Travolta played in that year's iconic movie \"Saturday Night Fever.\"",
      "The next night, he met Stacy Moscowitz while out celebrating his good fortune at a \"Gong Show\" event at a popular \"Beefsteak Charlies.\" The eatery was \"wall to wall people,\" he recalled, and in the crush Violante found himself face-to-face with Stacy.",
      "\"She was a beautiful, beautiful girl,\" Violante said. \"And what a pleasant, pleasant girl. A very bubbly, full of life young lady.\" They hit it off, talked for hours, and agreed to see each other that Saturday night, July 31, even though they, like all New Yorkers, were worried about the \"Son of Sam.\"",
      "The serial killer had killed five, and wounded six others. But he had never struck in Brooklyn. His female victims had shoulder length dark hair. \"Stacy's a blonde,\" Violante reassured his mother as he headed out on their maiden date.",
      "They went to the movie, \"New York New York,\" and then drove to Shore Parkway stopping near the water, where they strolled and played on a set of swings. \"We were like two little kids,\" Violante recalled.",
      "A figure lurking in the shadow, however, with his arms crossed, spooked Stacy. She asked to leave, and they got into Violante's car, but he said, \"Let's stay five minutes.\"",
      "He would forever wish he immediately drove away. Within two minutes, the car glass suddenly exploded. Everything went dark, and he thought he was dead.",
      "\"I was shot in the head, totally blind and full of blood,\" Violante recalled. \"Oh, my God! Oh, my God! He killed us.\"",
      "Then he heard Stacy moaning and realized he was alive.",
      "Although gravely wounded and unable to see, Violante managed to open the car door, and wrap his hand around a nearby light pole. Screaming, \"We've been shot, we've been shot,\" he pressed his other hand on the car horn, honking it until the battery died, and he collapsed in the street.",
      "Days later, his father - \"my best pal\" - broke the news he had lost his sight. Weeks later, he told Violante that Stacy had died just 18 hours after the shooting.",
      "\"I cried like a baby,\" Violante recalled.",
      "Violante never asked \"why me, because that would mean why not someone else.\" He became a portrait in courage, summoning an inner strength he never knew he had, and seemingly willing his damaged eye to improve enough to avoid the need of a seeing-eye dog. \"I swore I would never have one,\" he said. Ultimately, after long stretches of rehabilitation, he obtained a rigorous mailer's position with the U.S. postal service, for which David Berkowitz, the \"Son of Sam,\" ironically also worked.",
      "Violante handled mail for 35 years until his recent retirement. He never married, and always wondered what might have evolved with Stacy had their young relationship been given time to blossom.",
      "Nearly a year earlier and a borough away, Carl Denaro, then a 20-year-old who had just enlisted in the Air Force, had his life shattered by another .44 caliber slug in Flushing, Queens.",
      "Denaro, who was more hippie than \"Tony Manero,\" met Rosemary Keenan, 18, at a local bar on October 23, 1976. They took a short drive to a nearby park, where gunfire suddenly shattered the windows of his Volkswagen Beetle. The bullets missed Keenan, and Denaro \"yelled at her to start the car, (and) let's get out of here,\" he told CBS News.",
      "They returned to the bar, where Denaro said, \"I said, I don't feel too good.\" He rested his head on a table, and a large pool of blood spilled out from beneath his shoulder-length hair and shirt.",
      "At the time, no one had heard of the \"Son of Sam\" because he had yet to leave a note for police to figure out there was a pattern to the madness. In fact, police initially were suspicious of Denaro, and it took months before the NYPD realized they had a serial killer on the loose, and Denaro was one of his victims.",
      "Doctors told Denaro that he was lucky.\u00a0 They put a plate in his head and he eventually returned to playing softball with friends. His military career derailed, and he went on to work for Merrill Lynch and in telecommunications financing before retiring.\u00a0 He recalled, however, that he lived for years with gawkers pointing out he was shot by the \"Son of Sam.\"",
      "Both Denaro and Violante rejoiced when David Berknowitz, a postal worker from Yonkers, was charged as the \"Son and Sam\" on August 10, 1977.\u00a0 Neither is certain Berkowitz acted alone. And Violante admits he wanted Berkowitz to receive the death penalty. But they both are thrilled he is off the streets forever.",
      "\"Thank God,\" Violante recalled shouting when he heard the news 40 years ago in his hospital room. \"At least now he won't be able to harm anyone else.\"",

    "story": [
      "When four teenage girls were murdered in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop in 1991, a heartbroken city was left searching for answers. No one imagined that more than 30 years later, the case would remain unsolved.",
      "But now, thanks to new advances in DNA technology, there is renewed hope that a piece of evidence collected from the scene on the night of the crime will be key to solving the case once and for all. \"48 Hours\" correspondent Erin Moriarty reports in an encore of\u00a0\"The Yogurt Shop Murders,\" airing Saturday, Aug. 2 at 9/8c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "On December 6, 1991, 17-year-old Eliza Thomas, 13-year-old Amy Ayers, and two sisters, 17-year-old Jennifer Harbison and 15-year-old Sarah Harbison, were found gagged, tied up with their own clothing, and shot in the head in an I Can't Believe It's Yogurt! shop in Austin. Whoever was responsible had also set the shop on fire, compromising much of the evidence.",
      "Eliza and Jennifer had been working at the yogurt shop that night. They were getting ready to close when Jennifer's sister, Sarah, and their friend, Amy, met them there to head home. Investigators believe at least two men entered the shop and committed the brutal crime.",
      "Gunshot wounds revealed two different types of guns were used \u2014 but there was scant other evidence at the scene, and debris from the fire complicated the early investigation. The Austin Police Department soon developed a task force dedicated solely to solving the crime. Government agencies, including the FBI, were called in to assist, but the case ultimately went cold until 1999, when four men, Robert Springsteen, Michael Scott, Maurice Pierce and Forrest Welborn, were arrested and charged with the murders.",
      "The men were only teenagers at the time of the crime. They were first questioned just days after the murders when one of them, Maurice Pierce, was arrested at a mall not far from the yogurt shop with a .22 caliber gun \u2014 one of the same types of weapons believed to have been used in the killings.",
      "All four were released back then for lack of evidence, but in 1999, when a new team of investigators were tasked with taking a fresh look at the old case, they obtained confessions from two of the four men, Robert Springsteen and Michael Scott. Those confessions would later be called into question after the two recanted, saying they were coerced.",
      "Charges were ultimately dropped against Maurice Pierce and Forrest Welborn due to lack of evidence, and Robert Springsteen and Michael Scott were the only two to go on trial. The sole evidence against them were their own words. They were both convicted, but a few years later, their convictions were overturned on constitutional grounds. The Sixth Amendment gives defendants the right to confront accusers and in Scott and Springsteen's trials, their confessions were used against one another, but they weren't allowed to question each other in court.",
      "Rosemary Lehmberg, the Travis County, Texas, district attorney at the time, was intent on retrying Springsteen and Scott. But before doing so, her office decided to take advantage of what was then a fairly new type of DNA testing called Y-STR testing. It was a way of searching for and extracting male DNA only. Y-STR testing was ordered on vaginal swabs taken from the victims at the time of the murders. By this point, investigators had come to believe that at least one of the victims had been sexually assaulted. As a result of the Y-STR testing, a partial male DNA profile was obtained from one of the girls, but to the surprise of the district attorney's office, the DNA sample did not match any of the four men who were arrested.",
      "CeCe Moore, a DNA expert and genetic genealogist whom we interviewed for this week's \"48 Hours,\" told correspondent Erin Moriarty that Y-STR DNA is a tool sometimes used in criminal cases. Moore explained it \"can eliminate almost everyone. \u2026 Everyone but the suspect.\"",
      "\"If their Y-STR does not match, they did not contribute that DNA?\" Moriarty asked Moore.",
      "\"Because of\u2026 where that DNA was found, yes, in this case, it's very important,\" Moore said.",
      "Still, prosecutors were determined to retry Springsteen and Scott. But before doing so, they wanted to figure out who that mystery DNA belonged to.",
      "District Attorney Lehmberg says more than 100 men \u2014 such as crime scene investigators and personnel from the medical examiner's office who might have come in contact with the body and possibly been a source of contamination \u2014 were tested. It was all to no avail. In 2009, with no matches, the charges against Springsteen and Scott were dropped. After nearly 10 years behind bars, they were released, but not exonerated, leaving open the possibility they could be retried at a later time.",
      "For years, officials kept trying to track down the source of the mystery DNA. Then, in 2017, an Austin police investigator searched a public online DNA database used for population studies to see if he could get a hit. Unbelievably, he did. It seemed to be the most promising lead in years, but there was a problem. The seemingly matching sample in the public database had been submitted anonymously by the FBI and had no name attached to it. When officials in Austin contacted the FBI in an effort to get a name, the FBI would not provide it, citing privacy laws.",
      "Frustrated, city officials reached out to U.S. Congressman Michael McCaul, who is from Austin, for help. McCaul pressed the FBI, and \"48 Hours\" has learned that in early 2020, the FBI agreed to work with the Austin Police Department to see if further testing could be done on that Y-STR DNA from the crime scene.",
      "\"48 Hours\" has learned that initially, the sample from the crime scene was not very detailed and had only 16 markers, but more advanced testing in 2020 came up with an additional nine markers, bringing the total marker count to 25. However, this more advanced testing revealed that the sample from the crime scene no longer proved to be a match to the sample in the public DNA database. In a letter to Congressman McCaul obtained by \"48 Hours,\" the FBI explained the new results \"conclusively exclude the male donor of the FBI's sample \u2026 as such, the FBI Y-STR profile is not an investigative lead.\"",
      "\"And that was the greatest disappointment because we really thought we had it,\" Congressman McCaul told Moriarty.",
      "Still, McCaul says that he and Austin officials will not rest until they determine who that DNA from the crime scene belongs to.",
      "\"We're waiting for\u2026 the DNA science to improve to then resubmit what we have left in the crime lab for further testing,\" McCaul said.",
      "According to McCaul, some of the actual Y-STR DNA from the sample found on the victim in the yogurt shop case still exists.",
      "\"It's very limited and \u2026 that's why we're waiting for the science to improve on this, because there's very little left,\" he said.",
      "With DNA research advancing so quickly, McCaul hopes that one day that sample of DNA obtained over 30 years ago will finally solve the case.",
      "\"It's everything,\" he says."

      "The gunman purchased the rifle used in the shooting from a supervisor at the casino where he worked, an NYPD spokesperson said. The supervisor has cooperated with investigators and said he purchased the gun legally, the spokesperson said. It wasn't immediately clear if the sale to Tamura was legal, but the other individual has not been arrested or charged as of Wednesday.",

      "\"The killer used an AR-15\u2013style assault rifle. The same weapon of war used in mass shootings across America,\" Hochul said in a statement, noting that although New York's gun laws are some of the strictest in the nation, regulations banning assault weapons and preventing potentially dangerous individuals from acquiring firearms \"only go so far when an AR-15 can be obtained in a state with weak gun laws and brought into New York to commit mass murder.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order suspending what's known as a de minimis exemption allowing low-value parcels that are shipped to the United States to avoid tariffs.",
      "The White House said it's closing what it called a \"catastrophic loophole\" that shippers use to \"evade tariffs and funnel deadly synthetic opioids or below-market products\" into the U.S. The order goes into effect Aug. 29.",
      "The exemption had applied to parcels valued at $800 or less, and allowed overseas retailers to ship inexpensive goods to consumers in the U.S. tax-free.",
      "\"President Trump is putting an end to the proliferation of shippers worldwide that, among other things, deceptively exploit the de minimis privilege in an effort to evade duties, inspection, and U.S. law,\" the White House said in a fact sheet outlining the new policy.",
      "Mr. Trump in May ended the de minimis loophole for imports from China and Hong Kong, which had allowed retailers like Shein and Temu to ship ultra low-cost apparel and other goods to U.S.-based consumers at bargain-basement prices. Shipments from China and Hong Kong account for most de minimis shipments to the U.S. according to the White House.",
      "The de minimis provision, which was added to the Tariff Act of 1930 several years after that law's passage, was intended to facilitate trade by eliminating the administrative burden of collecting modest import duties on low-cost goods.",
      "The number of low-value parcels entering the U.S. has surged over the past decade. Between 2015 and 2025, that figure jumped from 134 million shipments per year to nearly 1.4 billion. Customs and Border Patrol processes more than 4 million de minimis shipments to the U.S. daily, according to the White House.",
      "Retailers such as Shein and Temu were forced to scramble when the loophole for imports from China and Hong Kong was suspended earlier this year.

    "summary": "The National Transportation Safety Board released new surveillance video during investigative hearings on January's deadly midair collision over Washington, D.C.",
    "story": [
      "Three days of investigative hearings on the deadly midair collision over Washington in January began Wednesday, aiming to reveal new insights into what caused the crash between a passenger plane and an Army helicopter. The American Airlines flight from Wichita, Kansas, collided with a\u00a0Black Hawk helicopter\u00a0while coming in for a landing at Ronald Reagan National Airport on Jan. 29, killing all\u00a067 people\u00a0aboard both aircraft.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board opened the hearings in Washington, with plans to question witnesses and investigators about how the actions of the Federal Aviation Administration and its air traffic controllers and the Army may have contributed to the nation's deadliest plane crash since November 2001. It's likely too early for the board to identify the cause of the crash.",
      "\"This hearing is a critical part of our ongoing investigation,\" NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said in her opening remarks. Addressing family members of some of the crash victims attending the hearing, she said, \"Please know that we are working diligently to make sure we know what occurred, how it occurred, and to prevent it from ever happening again.\"",
      "The NTSB's lead investigator began by presenting an 11-minute animation that recreated events leading up to the collision. At the end, it included newly released surveillance video with a clear view of the Black Hawk helicopter approaching the path of American Airlines flight 5342, followed by the midair impact. Before the video was played, families attending the hearing were allowed to leave the room.",
      "The plane's cockpit voice recorder showed that approximately 20 seconds before the collision, the pilots received an audible warning from the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) noting \"traffic,\" but not giving them a resolution advisory to take action. Just one to two seconds before the collision, there's a sound of a click and one of the pilots exclaims, \"Oh,\" followed by an expletive. From another document released in the investigation, it appears the pilots pulled back fully on the yoke to try to avoid the collision.",
      "Tim Lilley, whose son Sam was the plane's first officer, told CBS News he hopes the hearing will help him learn more about those final moments.",
      "\"I know that my son saw that helicopter one second before impact, and they tried very hard to avoid it,\" Lilley said. \"Sam was a good pilot, and he would have been trying to fly that aircraft all the way, all the way to the bottom.\"",
      "The cockpit voice recorder transcript also shows that as the pilots approached for landing, they had a visual on runway 1 when air traffic controllers asked them to take runway 33 instead. The pilots discussed it between themselves, with one saying, \"I really don't want to but I guess\u2026,\" then said, \"it's fine,\" adding, \"tell 'em we're fine we'll do three-three, we'll do it.\"",
      "The collision, which sent wreckage plummeting into the Potomac River, was the first in a string of crashes and near\u00a0misses this year that have alarmed officials and the traveling public, despite statistics that still show flying remains the safest form of transportation.",
      "Investigations have already shown the FAA failed to recognize a troubling history of 85 near misses around Reagan airport in the years before the collision, and that the Army's helicopters routinely flew around the nation's capitol with a key piece of locating equipment, known as ADS-B Out, turned off.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News in February that top officials at the FAA pushed last summer to close one of three runways at Reagan airport following two close calls between airliners still on the ground.",
      "Aviation attorney Bob Clifford, who is working to file one of the first lawsuits against the government next month, said he hopes NTSB will look beyond the immediate factors that caused this crash to highlight the bigger ongoing concerns in the crowded Washington airspace.",
      "\"In this particular instance, there's a much broader picture. And that is the known problems that were being ignored about an unsafe environment for the commercial aircraft to be navigating with the military aviation helicopters in the area,\" Clifford said.",
      "Legislation to require upgraded technology",
      "Even though the final NTSB report won't be released until sometime next year, Sen. Ted Cruz isn't waiting to propose changes. He introduced legislation Tuesday that would require all aircraft operators to use both forms of ADS-B, or Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast, the technology to broadcast aircraft location data to other planes and air traffic controllers. Most aircraft today are equipped with ADS-B Out equipment but the airlines would have to add the more comprehensive ADS-B In technology to their planes.",
      "\"There cannot be a double standard in aviation safety,\" Cruz said. \"We should not tolerate special exceptions for military training flights, operating in congested air space.\"",
      "The legislation would revoke an exemption on ADS-B transmission requests for Department of Defense aircrafts. It also would require the FAA to evaluate helicopter routes near airports and require the Army Inspector General to review the Army's aviation safety practices.",
      "Homendy said her agency has been recommending that move for decades after several other crashes.",
      "\"In 2008, we sent a letter to FAA stating the board believes that the equipage of aircraft with ADS-B In capability will provide \u2014 and I want to stress this \u2014 an immediate and substantial contribution to safety, especially during operations in and around airports,\" she said.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that while he'd like to discuss \"a few tweaks,\" the legislation is \"the right approach.\" He also suggested that the previous administration \"was asleep at the wheel\" amid dozens of near-misses in the airspace around Washington's airspace.",
      "\"In the past, people became complacent \u2014 leaders became complacent,\" Duffy said.",
      "A \"fact-finding proceeding\"",
      "Homendy said the hearings over the next few days will be a \"fact-finding proceeding.\" In addition, the NTSB is also posting thousands of pages of evidence from the crash investigation online.",
      "FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford said that he expects \"we're going to have some very uncomfortable conversations over the next two and a half days\" but that \"they need to be had in the clear light of day \u2014 and simply put the best interest of the traveling public ahead of any of our personal interests, perhaps.\"",
      "The hearings in Washington involve NTSB board members, investigators and witnesses for organizations involved in the crash. Panels will focus on military helicopter routes in the Washington area, collision avoidance technology and training for air traffic controllers at Ronald Reagan National Airport, among other subjects.",
      "Federal officials have also raised concerns over the nation's outdated and understaffed air traffic control system. During January's midair crash above Washington, one controller was handing both commercial airline and helicopter traffic at the busy airport.",
      "Duffy has announced a multibillion-dollar plan to overhaul the system controllers use that relies on old technology like floppy disks.",

      "The grand juries that indicted Epstein and Maxwell did not hear direct testimony from any alleged victims, Attorney General Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told a judge in the Southern District of New York in their attempts to unseal the testimony.\u00a0 They said the testimony is just that of two witnesses, an FBI agent and a New York Police Department detective.",
      "It is not unusual for law enforcement to be the only witnesses testifying in front of a grand jury.",
      "The new information comes after President Trump directed Bondi and the Justice Department to move to unseal \"any and all pertinent grand jury testimony,\" related to the federal investigations into Epstein and Maxwell in an attempt to quiet the political storm that has ensnared the Trump administration since the Justice Department and FBI said a review of the investigation related to disgraced financier found that there was no \"client list\" or evidence that he blackmailed prominent figures.",
      "Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 as he faced sex trafficking charges, with investigators ruling his death a suicide. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for helping him recruit, groom and abuse underage girls.",
      "This latest filing again urged the New York court to release the records, and tried to convince the judges overseeing the case that the release of more information would not harm Epstein and Maxwell's victims.",
      "\"There is undoubtedly a clearly expressed interest from the public in Jeffrey Epstein's and Ghislaine Maxwell's crimes. Beyond that, there is abundant public interest in the investigative work conducted by the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into those crimes,\" Justice Department leadership wrote in its argument that the transcripts should be released, adding that its goal in unsealing the material would \"provide information to the public while remaining sensitive to protecting the rights of victims.\"",
      "The Justice Department also said in the filing that they have submitted a fuller list under seal of witnesses whose accounts were conveyed in the grand jury proceedings and another list of which witnesses testified at trial to the judges, and have informed notice to all but one victim who is referenced in the grand jury transcripts of their attempts to unseal them.",
      "\"The Government has attempted to contact the remaining victim, but such efforts have been unsuccessful.\u00a0 In addition, the Government is in the process of providing notice to any other individuals identified in the transcripts,\" the Justice Department wrote.",
      "Last week, a federal judge in Florida denied the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury material stemming from investigations in 2005 and 2007 into Epstein in the state. That ruling only applied to transcripts of proceedings by federal grand juries that were convened in Florida, and did not apply to the transcripts in New York.",

      "Experts had warned earlier that the effects of the earthquake may continue through Wednesday.",
      "\"A tsunami is not just one wave,\" said Dan Snider, the tsunami warning coordinator with the National Tsunami Warning Center in Alaska. \"It's a series of powerful waves over a long period of time. Tsunamis cross the ocean at hundreds of miles an hour \u2014 as fast as a jet airplane \u2014 in deep water. But when they get close to the shore, they slow down and start to pile up. And that's where that inundation problem becomes a little bit more possible there.\"",

      "The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, which lifted the Hawaii warning, had forecast that the estimated arrival time of the first tsunami waves there would be 7:17 p.m. Tuesday local time (1:17 a.m. Wednesday ET). Officials urged people to move inland and shelters were opened in many parts of Hawaii. Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said that Black Hawk helicopters had been activated and high-water vehicles were on standby in case authorities needed to conduct rescue operations.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Treasury Department on Wednesday sanctioned a Brazilian Supreme Court justice who is overseeing the case against former President Jair Bolsonaro, claiming the judge is responsible for human rights violations and politicized prosecutions.",
      "The sanctions announced by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent target Alexandre de Moraes, who has served on the Brazilian Supreme Federal Court since 2017. The Trump administration accused de Moraes of abusing his authority to target political opponents, including Bolsonaro, an ally of Mr. Trump's.",
      "The justice also ordered a shutdown of X, the social media platform owned by Elon Musk, in Brazil last year. Access to the site was restored last October.",
      "\"Alexandre de Moraes has taken it upon himself to be judge and jury in an unlawful witch hunt against U.S. and Brazilian citizens and companies,\" Bessent said in a statement. \"De Moraes is responsible for an oppressive campaign of censorship, arbitrary detentions that violate human rights, and politicized prosecutions \u2014 including against former President Jair Bolsonaro. Today's action makes clear that Treasury will continue to hold accountable those who threaten U.S. interests and the freedoms of our citizens.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. is sanctioning de Moraes for \"serious\" human rights abuses, including detaining people without bringing charges and for infringing on freedom of expression.",
      "Rubio said de Moraes also \"abused his authority by engaging in a targeted and politically motivated effort designed to silence political critics through the issuance of secret orders compelling online platforms, including U.S. social media companies, to ban the accounts of individuals for posting protected speech.\"",
      "\"The United States will use all appropriate and effective diplomatic, political, and legal instruments to protect the speech of Americans from foreign malign actors who would seek to undermine it,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Bolsonaro is on trial for allegedly orchestrating a scheme to remain in office after Brazil's 2022 election. He was indicted in November, and prosecutors accused Brazil's former leader and seven others of seeking to \"violently overthrow the democratic order.\" Bolsonaro lost the 2022 race to his left-wing opponent President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. He has denied the allegations and called the prosecution a \"witch hunt.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has publicly defended Bolsonaro and called the treatment of him an \"international disgrace.\" In a July 9 letter to Lula posted to social media, the president said the trial involving Bolsonaro is a \"witch hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!\"",
      "Mr. Trump also slapped 50% tariffs on Brazilian products imported into the U.S. on Wednesday. In an executive order imposing the levies, the president said the actions of Brazil's government are \"repugnant to the moral and political values of democratic and free societies and conflict with the policy of the United States to promote democratic governments throughout the world, the principle of free expression and free and fair elections, the rule of law, and respect for human rights.\"",
      "The directive mentioned de Moraes by name and said his actions \"chill and limit expression in the United States, violate human rights, and undermine the interest that the United States has in protecting its citizens and companies at home and abroad.\"",

    "story": [
      "A wave of tarantula sightings might occur in the next few months across portions of the U.S. as mating season begins.",
      "The secretive spiders are rarely seen \u2013 except during mating season. The hairy arachnids that are the size of a baseball will be spotted in the following states: California, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico and Texas, according to\u00a0CBS Chicago.",
      "September and October are prime months to see tens of thousands of adult male tarantulas searching for a female ready to lay eggs in her nest, according to Pinnacles National Park in California. The largest spiders in North America, tarantulas are typically two to three inches long and are covered with thousands of fine hairs ranging in color from tan to dark brown.",
      "The spiders are usually out from late evening to early dawn to find a mate.",
      "How do tarantulas mate, and how do they reproduce?",
      "A male tarantula begins his search for a mate when he reaches 8 or 10 years old. Tarantulas are solitary except during mating season, when the male follows the scent of a female tarantula to the receptive female's burrow.",
      "The female lines her burrow with silk webbing, waiting to be courted. The male taps one of his legs against the ground to alert the female until she emerges from her burrow. The male and female then participate in a mating dance -- in which the male fends off the female, who wishes to devour him.",
      "The death of the male can provide the female with nutrition. If he escapes the female's death dance, he dies within the year, the National Park Service said.",
      "How long do tarantulas live, and how did their name come about?",
      "They usually reach maturity around 10 years of age. Males die within a year of mating and may be eaten by the female before they mate. Females can live over 20 years, making them one of the spiders with the longest life spans. They can produce eggs for 25 years or more.",
      "The term \"tarantula\" originally referred to a southern European wolf spider called Lycosa tarentula, which was named after the town of Taranto, Italy. At one time, it was believed that the bite of this spider caused tarantism \u2014 which led to uncontrollable dancing and weeping, according to Pinnacles. The dance \u2014 known as Tarentella \u2014 turned into a popular Italian folk dance, and even inspired classical compositions.",
      "What do tarantulas eat, and what prompts them to bite?",
      "Tarantulas eat a variety of insects, in addition to snakes and small rodents. Tarantulas are sometimes eaten by lizards, snakes, birds and tarantula hawks, according to Pinnacles.",
      "Their bites can cause a painful reaction, with some comparing it to a bee sting. But tarantulas are usually gentle and rarely use their fangs \u2014 except to catch prey. Or if they are provoked.",
      "If alarmed, a tarantula will raise its front legs and abdomen to look aggressive, and they may also release stinging hairs from their abdomen, which irritate the skin.",
      "They can also jump up to two feet, according to CBS Chicago.",
      "What should you do if you spot a tarantula?",
      "If you spot a tarantula, take time to observe its behavior and body, according to the National Park Service.",
      "\"Contrary to appearance and reputation, the tarantula is a timid creature and will not bite human beings unless seriously provoked,\" the NPS says.",

I'm not a billionaire, unlike others on this committee. And what I think is, the American people are sending us a clear message.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Rick Scott, who was not born wealthy but is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to his public filings, said he agrees lawmakers shouldn't be trading stocks. But he defended the ability for members of Congress to be rich, and called attacks on the wealthy \"disgusting.\"",
      "\"He made a reference to billionaires, okay?\" Scott said of Hawley. \"I don't know when in this country it became a negative to make money. But somehow, if you've made money, you're supposedly \u2014 I think Senator Hawley suggests \u2014 you shouldn't be serving, because you might trade stocks.\"",
      "\"Anybody want to be poor? I don't.\" Scott continued. \"Right? So this idea that we're going to attack people because they make money is wrong. Is absolutely wrong. We should cherish all of our different backgrounds. ... So, I think it's disgusting what is going on here.\"",
      "Some Republicans on the Senate Homeland Security Committee insisted that blind trusts are sufficiently restrictive. But Hawley said blind trusts are \"often workarounds,\" and members can still influence decisions.",
      "The measure, called the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments (PELOSI) Act, would prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from trading or holding individual stocks, giving them 180 days to sell their stocks. Members would also have to supply their House or Senate ethics committee with written certification of compliance each year, and the Government Accountability Office would conduct a compliance audit every two years.",
      "Hawley also said the legislation would ban the next president and vice president from holding or trading individual stocks while in office, meaning the legislation wouldn't affect President Trump. A reporter asked the president if he supports Hawley's bill.",
      "\"Well, I like it conceptually,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I don't know about it. But I like it conceptually.\"",
      "Hawley introduced similar legislation in 2023, but it didn't make it out of committee.",
      "The proposed measure is more restrictive than the\u00a0STOCK Act, which requires lawmakers and senior government officials including the president and vice president to disclose their stock trades and bans them from trading on information they learn in the course of their public service.",

    "story": [
      "Fans of legendary Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne paid their respects to the heavy metal icon on Wednesday as his funeral procession made its way through Birmingham, England.",
      "Osbourne, who died last week at the age of 76, grew up in the central England city where Black Sabbath was formed in 1968.",
      "The procession made its way down Birmingham's Broad Street in the center of the city to a canal bridge named in honor of Black Sabbath. The bridge features a bench with life-size cutouts of the band's four founding members \u2014 Osbourne, Terry \"Geezer\" Butler, Tony Iommi and Bill Ward.",
      "An emotional Sharon Osbourne, who was married to the musician for 43 years, stopped at the site and laid flowers at the growing memorial around the bench as fans watched from behind barriers. She was accompanied by the couple's three children, Aimee, Kelly and Jack. The latter two starred with their parents in the reality show \"The Osbournes,\" which aired in the early 2000s.",
      "The Lord Mayor of Birmingham Zafar Iqbal also visited the site on Wednesday. In a statement Tuesday, Iqbal\u00a0said, \"Ozzy was more than a music legend \u2014 he was a son of Birmingham.\"",
      "Crowds of fans turned out ahead of the procession to pay tribute to the singer known as the Prince of Darkness and reflect on the role he and his family played in their lives.",
      "Graham Croucher, a 58-year-old train driver from Northampton, told the Reuters news agency that Osbourne played the soundtrack to his life.",
      "\"He dared to be different because he was different,\" Croucher said. \"And I think we're celebrating that as well because he was different. And I think we can all see so much of ourselves in Ozzy, but he could do it. He could get away with it.\"",
      "Amanda Summers, a 37-year-old singer from Bolton, said she was feeling emotional but glad to be with other people who adored Osbourne and wanted to show support for the family.",
      "\"Been a Black Sabbath fan for a long time, watched 'The Osbournes' on the TV, so we've grown up with these being in our homes, so they're like our family, you know?\" she told Reuters.",
      "Darren Verdi-Ashton, a 56-year-old businessman from Birmingham, said Osbourne's death was still a big shock.",
      "\"I don't know what will happen when he arrives, but I think I probably will lose it,\" he told Reuters.",
      "Since Osbourne's death, fans have been flocking to the Black Sabbath Bridge and bench, leaving flowers, pictures and notes.",
      "\"Final Stop On The Crazy Train?\" a handwritten message said on an Aston Villa soccer team shirt that was tied to the bridge last week, referring to the single \"Crazy Train\" from Osbourne's debut solo album in 1980. The message added: \"But Metal Lives Forever.\"",
      "After Osbourne's death, \"Crazy Train\" was streamed and played on the radio so much that the song made it onto the Billboard Hot 100 chart for the first time, ranking at No. 46 on its most recent edition.",
      "Mark Savage, a music reporter at CBS News' partner BBC News, noted that some fans have left bottles of Jack Daniel's at the memorial, reflecting Osbourne's embodiment of the rock 'n' roll lifestyle. Savage reported toy bats have also been placed at the memorial, recalling memories of Osbourne famously biting the head off of a real bat during a performance in the 1980s \u2014 he had said he thought it was a toy.",
      "Fans who couldn't make it to Birmingham to honor Osbourne were invited to watch a livestream of the bench and bridge.",
      "Iqbal said it was important for the city to have a \"fitting, dignified tribute\" to the legendary rocker before the private family funeral.",
      "\"We know how much this moment will mean to his fans,\" he said. \"We're proud to host it here with his loving family in the place where it all began.\"",
      "Savage reported the private service will take place on Thursday in Buckinghamshire, northwest of London.",
      "Osbourne retired from touring in 2023, three years after revealing that he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, a degenerative movement disorder.",
      "His death came less than three weeks after he appeared onstage for the final time, reuniting with his Black Sabbath bandmates in a Birmingham concert that featured performances from rock legends influenced by the band.",
      "\"You have no idea how I feel,\" Osbourne told the crowd of over 40,000 fans that night, according to BBC News. \"Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 30 Jul 2025 12:29:12 -0400",
    "summary": "The country's GDP increased at an annual rate of 3%, a sharp turnaround from earlier this year when it fell 0.5%.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy surged between April and June after shrinking in the first three months of the year, driven by a large shift in imports tied to President Trump's trade policies.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The country's GDP increased at an annual rate of 3% in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That's higher than the 2% pace forecast for the April-to-June period, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The number represents a turnaround from the first three months of 2025, when GDP fell 0.5%, the worst quarterly performance for the economy since early 2022. The new data also shows consumers increased spending since the last quarter, with growth of 1.4%, up from 0.5% from January to March. The number is still down significantly from 4% in the\u00a0final\u00a0quarter of 2024.",
      "When it comes to assessing the strength of the economy, a more revealing number tucked into the GDP report is what is known as \"final sales to private domestic purchasers,\" which excludes government spending, inventories and net exports. That number rose at only a 1.2% annual rate from April to May \u2014 the weakest since late 2022 and a sign that demand is weakening.",
      "What the numbers mean",
      "GDP data offers a broad yardstick for measuring the overall health of the economy, with periods of fast growth typically coinciding with robust consumer spending, ample job growth and healthy corporate profits. This year, however, experts say the Trump administration's tariffs on U.S. economic partners have complicated the picture.",
      "\"As was the case in Q1, volatile trade flows are skewing the GDP performance (the 3% growth primarily reflects a decrease in imports and an acceleration in consumer spending that were partially offset by a downturn in investment),\" Adam Crisafulli, head of investment research firm Vital Knowledge, said in a report.",
      "Thomas Ryan, North America economist at investor advisory firm Capital Economics, said in a note that the surge in GDP \"overstates the economy's underlying strength\" because the growth spurt in the second quarter was largely driven by a 30% decline in imports after U.S. tariffs took effect.",
      "GDP slumped in the first quarter, falling 0.5% from January to March, largely due to a surge in U.S. imports as consumers and businesses rushed to buy goods from abroad before stepped-up tariffs took effect.",
      "In calculating GDP, imports are seen as reducing growth because they reflect purchases from overseas, rather than goods and services produced in the U.S. By contrast, exports boost a country's GDP because they reflect domestic goods and services that were sold abroad.",
      "The upshot: Through the first half of 2025, the economy grew at an average rate of 1.25%. That's markedly slower than the pace of growth in 2024, when GDP for the full year rose 2.8%, noted Dean Baker, a senior economist at Center for Economic and Policy Research.",
      "Where the economy is headed",
      "Although the 3% GDP rate in Wednesday's report may be skewed by the president's trade policies, experts say the overall economy remains solid and shows no signs of crumbling.",
      "\"Beneath the topline figure, the economy is switching to a lower gear but not going in reverse,\" Bernard Yaros, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note.",
      "Yaros added that consumers are slowing \u2014 but not switching off \u2014 their spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds economic activity.",
      "Still, EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco notes that economic activity is slowing as inflationary pressures rise \u2014 a trend likely to persist throughout the summer. He predicts real GDP growth to slow to a rate of 0.9% year over year by the fourth quarter.",
      "Another indicator of the health of the economy will come Wednesday afternoon, when the Federal Reserve announces its rate decision. The central bank is again expected to hold rates steady. The Labor Department is also scheduled to release its monthly jobs report on Friday, offering a snapshot of how the labor market is faring.",

    "story": [
      "More high-income Americans around the U.S. are falling behind on their credit cards and auto loans, a sign that even people earning more than six figures are more likely to struggle financially amid shifts in the economy.",
      "Delinquencies across all loan products for households earning more than $150,000 have more than doubled since 2023. That compares with a 60% increase in delinquencies during that time for households earning between $45,000 and $150,000, and a 22% increase for people earning less than $45,000, according to data from credit-scoring company VantageScore.",
      "High-income households had weathered the post-pandemic years better than lower-earning Americans because they had more of a cushion to absorb soaring inflation and other shocks, according to VantageScore chief economist Rikard Bandebo.",
      "But these Americans are now feeling the impact of several economic changes, including a weaker job market for white-collar workers and higher housing costs, he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"For white-collar workers, it's probably tougher than it has been,\" Bandebo said. \"This trend has been consistent and seems to be continuing \u2014 it's not abetting.\"",
      "About 38% of all new jobs created in the five years before the pandemic paid above-average wages, VantageScore's data shows. But this year that share has fallen to 7%, signaling that companies are creating fewer white-collar positions. That poses a challenge to higher-income Americans who suffer a job loss because it may be tougher to find new employment than in previous years.",
      "\"This group is being hit from a number of different aspects, which is making it harder for them to make ends meet,\" Bandebo said.",
      "To be sure, the overall rate of loan delinquencies in the U.S. remains higher for low- and middle-income consumers than for high-income earners, according to VantageScore. For instance, the delinquency rate for households earning at least $150,000 now stands at about 0.34%, versus 1.75% for low-income households. But the rise in delinquencies has accelerated faster for higher-income households than for other groups, the firm's data shows.",
      "A worrying sign?",
      "A key question for the U.S. is whether the financial challenges facing high-income Americans could portend a broader economic downturn. Notably, consumption by wealthier Americans now contributes about half of all consumer spending, the main engine for economic growth. By comparison, in 1990 spending by Americans higher up the economic ladder accounted for about one-third of all spending.",
      "At the same time, low- and middle-income households are also facing stiffer financial headwinds with about six in 10 middle-income consumers saying they're financially stressed, according to a recent survey from financial services company Primerica.",
      "More than one-third of middle-income households, or those earning between $30,000 to $130,000, say they've increased their credit card usage, the survey found.",
      "Retailers and major consumer brands have also been warning that some consumers are cutting back or are more cautious in their purchases.",
      "Shoppers are \"looking for value, either in smaller packs and promotions or in larger pack sizes in the club channel and online,\" Procter & Gamble Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten said on an earnings conference call Tuesday. \"That's the behavior we've been outlined before, but it's not stopped. It continued.\"",
      "Widespread consumer frustration with high prices is thought to have boosted President Trump during the 2024 electoral campaign against Joe Biden, when Mr. Trump vowed to end\u00a0the \"inflation nightmare.\" So far, inflation has remained relatively muted in 2025, although June's 2.7% annualized rate remains higher than the Federal Reserve's goal of reaching a 2% rate.",
      "Yet more consumers are now expressing frustration with the Trump administration's economic policies, according to a new CBS News poll that found nearly 64% of Americans now disapprove of how the president is handling inflation. The survey was conducted from July 16-18 and polled 2,343 adults.",
      "As for Americans who are struggling to keep up with credit-card debt and auto loans, they aren't likely to see relief anytime soon. Although Mr. Trump has been pushing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates, economists think the central bank is very likely to stand pat when officials announce their latest policy move on Wednesday.",

      "Washington \u2014 Senate Democrats are trying to force the Justice Department to release the Jeffrey Epstein files using a little-known law that directs executive agencies to turn over information to congressional oversight committees, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Wednesday.",
      "\"Today Senate Democrats take additional action to try and uncover the truth about the Epstein files,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor, and he proceeded to describe the nearly century-old law the minority would use to try to compel the release of the \"full and complete Epstein files.\"",
      "The federal law, known as Section 2954 and referred to as the \"Rule of Five,\" allows five members on the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs to submit an information request on matters within its jurisdiction to a federal agency. Enacted in 1928, the obscure law is part of Congress' ability to wield influence over executive branch agencies, and gives minority members of the oversight committees the ability to request information without the help of the committee chairman.",
      "The move comes as controversy has swirled around the Epstein files in recent weeks, after the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review that was met with anger from many of Mr. Trump's supporters. The review found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein, a well-connected financier who was convicted of sex trafficking and died in federal custody in 2019, had blackmailed prominent figures. But the issue has divided Mr. Trump's base, with many in both parties calling for more transparency as the president has called the controversy a \"hoax.\" And Democrats have sought to capitalize on the GOP infighting.",
      "\"The situation with the Epstein files is very simple \u2014 Donald Trump promised transparency and he has broken that promise,\" Schumer said. \"As a candidate, Trump said on many occasions he would release the Epstein files if elected, and yet he has refused to do so.\"",
      "Schumer accused Republicans of choosing to \"hide\" on the Epstein files, saying, \"if there's nothing to hide, why all the evasiveness?\"",
      "The rule has rarely been used. In 2017, Democrats tried to force the release of documents relating to the leasing of the Old Post Office building in Washington, D.C., which became the site of a Trump hotel. And in 2001, Democrats under former President George W. Bush attempted to compel documents about the 2000 census. Still, with infrequent use, whether the rule could be enforced in court remains to be seen.",
      "Schumer said the request covers \"all documents, files, evidence or other materials in the possession of the Department of Justice or the FBI related to the case of United States v. Jeffrey Epstein.\" He noted the request includes records related to Epstein and his clients, while \"ensuring that the private information of any victims is protected.\" The minority leader said the Democrats expect the Justice Department to provide the information by Aug. 15.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey sparred with fellow Democrats on Tuesday over a bipartisan policing package, accusing them of being \"complicit\" in President Trump's agenda in a rare moment of intraparty disagreement that played out on the Senate floor.",
      "The heated exchange arose after Booker objected to a motion from Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat from Nevada, to swiftly pass a package of bills related to law enforcement. Booker said he wanted to make a change to the bloc of measures to ensure resources are distributed equally among law enforcement agencies in response to the Justice Department's changes to grant programs and cancellation of awards.",
      "\"We are standing at a moment where our president is eviscerating the Constitution of the United States of America, and we're willing to go along with that today,\" he said. \"No, no. Not on my watch. I stand against this. It is a violation of our Constitution for the president of the United States to ignore the will of Congress and decide which states are eligible for grants and which are not.\"",
      "Booker accused Cortez Masto and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who backs the legislative package, of lecturing him.",
      "\"What I am tired of is when the president of the United States violates the Constitution, trashes our norms and traditions and what does the Democratic Party do? Comply? Allow him? Beg for scraps? No. I demand justice,\" he said.",
      "Booker said the Democratic Party \"needs a wake-up call.\"",
      "\"It's time for Democrats to have a backbone. It's time for us to fight. It's time for us to draw lines,\" he said, as his voice started rising. \"Don't question my integrity. Don't question my motives.\"",
      "Booker said in his remarks from the Senate floor that the Justice Department has been weaponizing public safety grants to punish state and local jurisdictions that oppose Mr. Trump's second-term agenda, and it is withholding funds from law enforcement agencies across the country when they were approved by Congress with bipartisan backing.",
      "\"It is disgraceful, it is unfair, it is unjust and it is dangerously reckless toward the officers whose well-being they are jeopardizing,\" Booker said. \"Federal funds should not be used for partisan political gains.\"",
      "The New Jersey Democrat lambasted his colleagues and accused them of effectively blessing Mr. Trump's decision to rescind grant funds by approving the legislative package.",
      "\"For us as a body to move forward right now is being complicit in what Donald Trump is doing,\" Booker said. \"I say no. I say we stand. I say we fight. I say we reject this, and that in a bipartisan way, we demand an end to this kind of constitutionally unjust carving up of the resources we approve.\"",
      "Booker had put forward an amendment to the bloc of bills that he said would prevent politicization and ensure resources are spread evenly among law enforcement agencies, regardless of the state they are in.",
      "\"This to me is the problem with Democrats in America right now, is we're willing to be complicit to Donald Trump, to let this pass through when we have all the leverage right now there is, to say, 'if you're as passionate about police as we are, then pass bills out of this body that will help the police officers in Washington, that will help the police officers in Illinois, that will help the police officers in New Jersey,'\" he said. \"Don't be complicit to the president of the United States.\"",
      "In response, Cortez Masto said the measures had been approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support \u2014 including by Booker. She criticized him for not putting forth his proposed amendment when the bills were before the panel and said his suggested change doesn't apply to her legislation.",
      "\"This is ridiculous,\" she said, adding that Booker should have raised his concerns weeks ago. \"Is this the right venue to fight for what he is seeking?\"",
      "Klobuchar, in her own remarks on the Senate floor, also defended the package and suggested Booker had missed the committee meeting when they were marked up. Booker is a member of the Judiciary Committee.",
      "\"I can't help it if someone couldn't change their schedule to be there,\" she said.",
      "Klobuchar said Booker has had issues with her policing bill that predate Mr. Trump's return to the White House, adding, \"One of the things I don't understand here is that we have committees for a reason, and we have hearings for a reason. And you can't do one thing on Police Week and not show up and not object and let these bills go through, and then say another a few weeks later on the floor.\"",
      "The tense back-and-forth came as Democrats have struggled to coalesce around a strategy for pushing back against Mr. Trump's second-term agenda.

    "story": [
      "YouTube announced on Tuesday it is planning to roll out a new age-estimation technology that will identify users under the age of 18. The new feature is intended to protect young teens from harmful content, the company says.",
      "Powered by artificial intelligence, the tool will be able to assess a person's age based on the types of videos they've watched, the categories of the videos, and how long the person has had their account \u2014 regardless of the birthday associated with it, James Beser, director of product management at YouTube,\u00a0said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on the platform's blog.",
      "If the technology identifies a person as under 18, it will take extra steps to regulate their content by disabling personalized advertising and limiting repetitive views of certain kinds of content, among other things. If YouTube incorrectly determines someone's age, the user can upload a form of identification to fix the error.",
      "\"We will only allow users who have been inferred or verified as over 18 to view age-restricted content that may be inappropriate for younger users,\" YouTube said in the blog post.",
      "Google, which is the parent company of YouTube, did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "According to a recent Pew\u00a0survey, YouTube is the most popular social media app among teens. Ninety percent of teens ages 13 to 17 said they used YouTube last year, compared with 63% who said they used TikTok.",
      "YouTube CEO Neal Mohan initially announced the age-detection technology in February. The new tool builds on other safety features like supervised accounts which allow parents to monitor their children's YouTube activity more closely.",
      "YouTube has also leveraged AI to identify and remove content it considers harmful, although since President Trump took office in January for his second term, the social media platform has shifted its policy to emphasize \"freedom of expression\" over safety, The New York Times reported.",
      "YouTube says it will be testing the age-detection tool in the coming weeks among a small set of U.S. users, before rolling out the technology to a wider audience. The tool is already being used in other markets with success, the company states on its blog, but does not specify where.",

    "story": [
      "One of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded struck Russia's Far East early Wednesday, sending tsunami waves into Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast and Japan. Several people were injured, none gravely, and no major damage has been reported so far.",
      "The 8.8 magnitude temblor struck off the coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula, an isolated strip along the Pacific Ocean, overnight. Residents of the peninsula fled inland as 16-foot waves caused flooding.",
      "Immediately after the earthquake, Hawaii issued a tsunami warning and evacuation orders, but by Wednesday morning, the warning was downgraded to an advisory and evacuation orders were lifted on the Big Island and Oahu. Japan's Meteorological Agency also lowered its alerts to advisories.",
      "States on the U.S. West Coast were placed under a tsunami advisory that remained in effect until Wednesday morning. Many of the warnings in California had been lifted by Wednesday afternoon, with just an area near the California-Oregon border and Ripped Point, in the southern part of the state, under an advisory.",
      "U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said the worst was over.",

      "Experts had warned earlier that the effects of the earthquake may continue through Wednesday.",
      "\"A tsunami is not just one wave,\" said Dan Snider, the tsunami warning coordinator with the National Tsunami Warning Center in Alaska. \"It's a series of powerful waves over a long period of time. Tsunamis cross the ocean at hundreds of miles an hour \u2014 as fast as a jet airplane \u2014 in deep water. But when they get close to the shore, they slow down and start to pile up. And that's where that inundation problem becomes a little bit more possible there.\"",
      "\"In this case, because of the Earth basically sending out these huge ripples of water across the ocean, they're going to be moving back and forth for quite a while,\" which is why some communities may feel effects longer, he said.",

      "The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, which lifted the Hawaii warning, had forecast that the estimated arrival time of the first tsunami waves there would be 7:17 p.m. Tuesday local time (1:17 a.m. Wednesday ET). Officials urged people to move inland and shelters were opened in many parts of Hawaii. Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said that Black Hawk helicopters had been activated and high-water vehicles were on standby in case authorities needed to conduct rescue operations.",
      "So far no damage has been recorded, but it will take two to three hours of observation before authorities will be able to determine whether the event has passed, Green said.",
      "Green said data from Midway Atoll, a small island between Japan and Hawaii, measured waves that were about 6 feet from peak to trough. He warned that waves hitting Hawaii could be bigger or smaller.",
      "Cars jammed streets and highways in Honolulu, even in areas away from the shore, as people tried to evacuate. Jimmy Markowski, who was visiting Honolulu's Waikiki Beach, said that the roads on the island were packed.",

      "\"This is not a major tsunami, but dangerous currents and strong waves may pose a risk to those near the water,\" the department said.",
      "A tsunami warning was posted for a portion of the California coast near the border with Oregon. It was later lowered to an advisory. California Gov. Gavin Newsom posted a\u00a0statement on X\u00a0saying the state's Office of Emergency Services was coordinating with local officials in Northern California, from Cape Mendocino to the Oregon border.",

      "The National Weather Service said on X that tsunami waves arrived in Monterey around 12:48 a.m. PT. Other cities along the California coast reported small to moderate-sized tsunami waves. A video shared by the National Weather Service Bay Area showed boats bobbing up and down in a harbor as they were rocked by small tsunami waves.",
      "The National Weather Service in Eureka, California,\u00a0said around 4 a.m. local time that Crescent City had seen tsunami waves of about 3.5 feet, with activity building as the region approached a minor high tide. High tide could lead to more flooding. Crescent City has seen dozens of tsunamis since the 1930s, including a 1964 event that killed 11 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings.",

Multiple aftershocks as strong as 6.9 magnitude followed and experts predict aftershocks of up to 7.5 for at least a month, according to the Russian News agency TASS.",
      "The temblor appeared to be the strongest anywhere in the world since the 9.0 magnitude earthquake off northeastern Japan in March 2011 that caused a massive tsunami that set off meltdowns at a nuclear power plant. Only a few stronger earthquakes have ever been measured around the world.",
      "Earlier this month, five powerful quakes \u2014 the largest with a magnitude of 7.4 \u2014 struck in the sea near Kamchatka. The largest was at a depth of 12.4 miles and was 89 miles east of the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.",

Officials said the doctors will receive decorations.",
      "Tsunami heights of about 9 to 13 feet were recorded in Kamchatka. Severokurilsk Mayor Alexander Ovsyannikov said the port in the city was flooded by tsunami waves, washing fishing boats into the sea. He said no major damage was recorded. Authorities on the Kamchatka peninsula lifted the tsunami warning for the area, some 11 hours after the quake hit. Russian authorities said several people were injured, without giving a figure. The risk of aftershocks and waves remains, officials said.",
      "On Wednesday, lava began to flow from Klyuchevskaya Sopka, the largest active volcano in the northern hemisphere. The 15,584-foot volcano, located in the east of Kamchatka, last erupted in 2023.

      "Earthquake sparks international response",
      "The quake had a preliminary magnitude of 8.0, Japanese and U.S. seismologists said. The U.S. Geological Survey later updated its strength to 8.8 magnitude and a depth of 13 miles.",
      "People went to evacuation centers in affected areas of Japan, with memories fresh of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami that caused reactor meltdowns at a nuclear power plant. The tsunami alert disrupted transportation, with ferries, trains and airports in the affected area suspending or delaying some operations.",

      "Japan's Fire and Disaster Management Agency said nearly 2 million residents are now under evacuation advisories in more than 220 municipalities along the Pacific coast as of midday Wednesday. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said waves could remain high for at least one day, and he urged evacuees to take precautions and stay well hydrated in the summer heat. He told evacuees they might not be able to return home by the end of the day on Wednesday.",
      "No abnormalities in operations at Japan's nuclear plants were reported on Wednesday.

      "Some tiny and low-lying Pacific island chains are among the world's most imperiled by tsunamis and rising seas due to\u00a0climate change. People were urged to stay away from coastlines until any wave surges passed late Wednesday in Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Federated States of Micronesia and Solomon Islands. Philippine authorities advised people to stay away from the beach and coastal areas.",
      "\"It may not be the largest of waves, but these can continue for hours and expose people swimming in the waters to danger,\" Teresito Bacolcol of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology told The Associated Press.",
      "Elsewhere, a tsunami of under a foot was forecast to hit parts of Vancouver Island, British Columbia.

      "There are four levels of tsunami alerts: warning, advisory, watch and information statement, according to the\u00a0National Weather Service.",
      "A tsunami warning is the most severe. It means residents should take action due to a coming tsunami that may cause widespread flooding.",
      "A tsunami advisory means there's the potential for \"strong currents or waves dangerous to those in or very near the water,\" according to the NWS.",
      "A tsunami watch advises those to be prepared because a distant earthquake has occurred and a tsunami is possible.",
      "The lowest level of alert is a tsunami information statement from the NWS, which advises people to \"relax\" since an earthquake has occurred, but there is no threat or it was very far away.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Treasury Department on Wednesday sanctioned a Brazilian Supreme Court justice who is overseeing the case against former President Jair Bolsonaro, claiming the judge is responsible for human rights violations and politicized prosecutions.",
      "The sanctions announced by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent target Alexandre de Moraes, who has served on the Brazilian Supreme Federal Court since 2017. The Trump administration accused de Moraes of abusing his authority to target political opponents, including Bolsonaro, an ally of Mr. Trump's.",
      "The justice also ordered a shutdown of X, the social media platform owned by Elon Musk, in Brazil last year. Access to the site was restored last October.",
      "\"Alexandre de Moraes has taken it upon himself to be judge and jury in an unlawful witch hunt against U.S. and Brazilian citizens and companies,\" Bessent said in a statement. \"De Moraes is responsible for an oppressive campaign of censorship, arbitrary detentions that violate human rights, and politicized prosecutions \u2014 including against former President Jair Bolsonaro. Today's action makes clear that Treasury will continue to hold accountable those who threaten U.S. interests and the freedoms of our citizens.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. is sanctioning de Moraes for \"serious\" human rights abuses, including detaining people without bringing charges and for infringing on freedom of expression.",
      "Rubio said de Moraes also \"abused his authority by engaging in a targeted and politically motivated effort designed to silence political critics through the issuance of secret orders compelling online platforms, including U.S. social media companies, to ban the accounts of individuals for posting protected speech.\"",
      "\"The United States will use all appropriate and effective diplomatic, political, and legal instruments to protect the speech of Americans from foreign malign actors who would seek to undermine it,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Bolsonaro is on trial for allegedly orchestrating a scheme to remain in office after Brazil's 2022 election. He was indicted in November, and prosecutors accused Brazil's former leader and seven others of seeking to \"violently overthrow the democratic order.\" Bolsonaro lost the 2022 race to his left-wing opponent President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. He has denied the allegations and called the prosecution a \"witch hunt.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has publicly defended Bolsonaro and called the treatment of him an \"international disgrace.\" In a July 9 letter to Lula posted to social media, the president said the trial involving Bolsonaro is a \"witch hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!\"",
      "Mr. Trump also slapped 50% tariffs on Brazilian products imported into the U.S. on Wednesday. In an executive order imposing the levies, the president said the actions of Brazil's government are \"repugnant to the moral and political values of democratic and free societies and conflict with the policy of the United States to promote democratic governments throughout the world, the principle of free expression and free and fair elections, the rule of law, and respect for human rights.\"",
      "The directive mentioned de Moraes by name and said his actions \"chill and limit expression in the United States, violate human rights, and undermine the interest that the United States has in protecting its citizens and companies at home and abroad.\"",

      "The deep-sea trenches, also called Hadal trenches, are \"some of the Earth's least explored and understood environments,\" the researchers wrote. In these extreme environments, the crushing pressure, scant food and lack of sunlight can make it hard to survive. Scientists know that tiny microbes prosper there, but less is known about evidence of larger marine life.",
      "Researchers traveling along the Kuril\u2013Kamchatka and Aleutian trenches in the northwest Pacific Ocean used a manned submersible to find tubeworms and mollusks flourishing at over 31,000 feet deep. The deepest part of the ocean goes down to about 36,000 feet.",
      "Scientists had surveyed this area before and had hints that larger creatures might live at such depths. The new discovery confirms those suspicions and shows just how extensive the communities are, said Julie Huber, a deep sea microbiologist with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.",
      "\"Look how many there are, look how deep they are,\" said Huber, who was not involved with the research. \"They don't all look the same and they're in a place that we haven't had good access to before.\"",
      "In the absence of light to make their own food, many trench-dwellers big and small survive on key elements like carbon that trickle down from higher in the ocean.",
      "Scientists think microbes in this new network may instead be capitalizing on carbon that's accumulated in the trench over time, processing it to create chemicals that seep through cracks in the ocean floor. The tubeworms and mollusks may survive by eating those tiny creatures or living with them and snacking on the products of their labor, scientists said.",

    "story": [
      "Laura Dahlmeier, a two-time German biathlon Olympic gold medalist, has died after a climbing accident in Pakistan, her management team and local government officials confirmed.",
      "The 31-year-old, who also won seven world championships in biathlon, was climbing Laila Peak in the Karakoram mountain range on Monday when she was struck by falling rocks at about 18,700 feet. Her rope partner, Marina Eva, quickly issued a distress call, launching a massive rescue mission, her management team said. Eva, uninjured, was able to descend to base camp with help from rescuers on Tuesday.",
      "The rescue operation was hampered by low visibility and bad weather.",
      "Rescuers were able to confirm Dahlmeier's death on Wednesday but not retrieve the body because of unfavorable weather, said Faizullah Faraq, a spokesman for the regional Gilgit-Baltistan government.",
      "\"Based on findings from the helicopter flyover and the rope partner's account of the severity of the injuries, it must be assumed that Laura Dahlmeier died instantly,\" her management team said in a statement to German media. A similar statement was shared on Dahlmeier's Instagram account.",
      "A separate post on Instagram honored Dahlmeier as a \"wonderful person\" who \"enriched the lives of many, including our own, with her warm and straightforward manner.\"",
      "\"She showed us that it's worth standing up for your dreams and goals and always staying true to yourself,\" the post continued. \"We are deeply grateful, dear Laura, that we were allowed to share our lives with you. Our shared moments and memories give us the strength and courage to continue on our path.\"",
      "Any final decision on retrieving the body would follow the wishes of Dahlmeier's family, Faraq said. A statement on Dalhmeier's Instagram page said it had been her wish that nobody risk their life to recover her body after an accident. It said Dahlmeier's family thanked the rescue team and climbers, who did their best to make her rescue possible.",
      "German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier offered his condolences to Dahlmeier's parents, writing that she \"was an exceptional sportswoman.\" He recalled that he presented her with the highest honor on German sport, the Silver Laurel Leaf, shortly after she won her first Olympic gold medal in 2018.",
      "\"Laura Dahlmeier was an ambassador for our country in the world, a role model for peaceful, cheerful and fair coexistence across borders,\" he said.",
      "Dahlmeier made her professional debut at the IBU World Cup during the 2012-13 season at age 19. She was chosen to represent team Germany at Sochi 2014, where she placed 13th in the individual, according to Olympics.com.",
      "She went on to win two Olympic gold medals at the PyeongChang Games in 2018, becoming the first female biathlete in history to win sprint and pursuit events at the same Olympic Games. She also picked up a bronze in the individual at those Games.",
      "Dahlmeier won seven gold, three silver and five bronze medals at the Biathlon World Championships, along with 20 World Cup races and the overall World Cup in the 2016-17 season, according to her website.",
      "Dahlmeier retired from competitive biathlon in May 2019 at age 25. She grew up in Garmisch-Partenkirchen in the German Alps and turned to mountaineering challenges after ending her biathlon career. She had been a state-certified mountain and ski guide since 2023 and volunteered for the Garmisch-Partenkirchen mountain rescue team.",
      "Hundreds of climbers try to scale mountains in northern Pakistan every year and accidents are common because of avalanches and sudden weather changes, according to The Associated Press.",
      "The region has also been battered by above-normal seasonal rains, triggering flash floods and landslides. Since last week, at least 20 Pakistani tourists have been missing after floodwaters swept them away near the northern district of Chilas.",

      "The funeral, Jimenez said in a statement, was that of a Barrio 18 member who was killed Monday. While the wake was taking place, \"rival gang members from Mara Salvatrucha stormed the funeral home and fired at the family and friends\" of the deceased, he added.",

    "story": [
      "One of the three men suspected of an arson attack on a Melbourne synagogue last year was arrested, police said Wednesday.",
      "A 21-year-old Melbourne man, who was not identified, was arrested at a house on suspicion he had set the fire at the Adass Israel Synagogue in December, Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Wendy Steendam said.",
      "The predawn attack on Dec. 6, 2024, destroyed the synagogue and left a worshipper with minor burns.",
      "The arrest is a major breakthrough for investigators in the Victorian Joint Counter-Terrorism Team that is treating the attack as\u00a0politically motivated.",
      "The team involves Victoria state and federal police, as well as Australia's main domestic spy agency. More than 220 law enforcement officers have devoted more than 50,000 hours to the investigation.",
      "\"Today's arrest is a demonstration of our ongoing efforts to hold those involved to account,\" Steendam said in a statement announcing the arrest. \"We now have charged two people as part of this investigation and I expect there will be more to come.\"",
      "Two weeks ago, a 20-year-old man was charged with stealing the car used in the synagogue attack. But that suspect has not been accused of being one of the masked men who used brooms to spread a liquid accelerant across the floor of the synagogue before igniting it.",
      "An arson conviction carries a potential maximum of 15 years in prison, while the other two offenses are each punishable by 10 years imprisonment. The suspect has yet to be charged.",
      "\"I want to reassure Victorians, particularly those in the Jewish community, that we remain relentless in our pursuit in finding all those responsible for this crime and holding them to account,\" Steendam told reporters.",
      "Police suspect offshore criminals had worked with associates in Victoria to orchestrate the attack, Australian Federal Police Deputy Commissioner Krissy Barrett said.",
      "\"The motivation is still being assessed,\" Barrett told reporters.",
      "\"We are \u2026 working closely with our\u00a0Five Eyes\u00a0partners and international partners to ensure our collective powers and capabilities are drawn upon to help bring those responsible to justice,\" she added. Five Eyes is an intelligence-sharing partnership that includes Australia, the United States, Britain, Canada and New Zealand.",
      "Barrett declined to say who the offshore suspects were or identify the countries they were operating in.",
      "\"This crime was despicable as it was dangerous, and it is important to acknowledge that this was not just an arson on a synagogue,\" she added in a statement. \"The effect of this crime has rippled through a community that continues to be targeted by criminals. We will not stand for this.\"",
      "A wave of antisemitic attacks has roiled Australia since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas assault on Israel triggered the war in Gaza. The synagogue attack is the only incident that has been classified as an act of terrorism, a designation that increases the resources available to the investigation.",
      "Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke welcomed the arrest in connection with what he described as a \"hate crime.\"",
      "Burke noted that his government had promised 30 million Australian dollars ($20 million) to rebuild the synagogue.",
      "\"This arrest cannot undo the pain and fear that it (arson) caused, but it does send the strongest message that this kind of hate and violence has no place in Australia,\" Burke told Parliament.",
      "\"This attack was not simply an attack on Jewish Australians; an attack on a synagogue is an attack on Australia and is treated as such,\" he added.",
      "Daniel Aghion, president of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the main advocate for the nation's Jewish community, hoped more arrests would be made and that the masterminds of the crime would be quickly brought to justice.",
      "\"Only then will a deterrent be established against this sort of chilling behavior,\" Aghion said.",
      "Earlier this month, an arsonist set fire to the door of another synagogue in Melbourne, dousing the double front doors of the downtown East Melbourne Hebrew Congregation and setting it alight. Around 20 worshippers sharing a meal to mark the Shabbat Jewish day of rest evacuated through a rear door, police said. No one was injured.",

    "story": [
      "An 8.8-magnitude earthquake, one of the strongest ever recorded, struck Russia's Far East early Wednesday, prompting tsunami warnings in coastal towns in multiple countries.",
      "The earthquake was \"on what we call the Pacific Ring of Fire. This is a region around the entire Pacific Rim renowned for significant earthquakes,\" Simon Boxall, lecturer in oceanography at the University of Southampton, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The Earth is made up of these sort of geology plates, these geophysical plates, and the Earth where these plates rub, where they sort of join, we get stresses building up, and then every so often we get a sudden release of pressure and part of the seabed flips up,\" Boxall said. \"And so it's that flip that causes the tsunami. And not all flips, not all earthquakes will generate these.\"",
      "Boxal said the tsunami generated by this earthquake was \"not huge. It's not one that's going to cause mass devastation. But it will cause coastal flooding and it will cause damage and it does put lives at risk if people don't move to high ground.\"",
      "Two magnitude 9.1 earthquakes - the Tohoku earthquake in 2011 in Japan and the 2004 Sumatra earthquake in Indonesia - caused massive tsunamis that killed thousands of people.",
      "Earthquake scientist Grace Sethanant said there was a reason those temblors caused much more devastating tsunamis than Wednesday's quake.",
      "While a magnitude 9.1 quake \"might seem not so far off from the magnitude 8.8 \u2026 in terms of energy, it's three times stronger,\" Sethanant said.",
      "\"Imagine the 8.8 is, as I drop a rock in the lake, and you see the ripples. That's the energy,\" Sethanant said. \"Imagine you have that rock like three times bigger. So, in terms of the earthquake movement magnitude, the energy of the 2011 and 2004 earthquakes in Sumatra and in Japan, it's actually three to four times bigger. ... And that's why the tsunamis in those events were much more devastating.\"",
      "National Tsunami Warning Center  Tsunami Warning Coordinator Dave Snider said tsunamis should be thought of more as \"ocean floods\" than waves.",
      "\"The most important thing to understand about a tsunami is this is not a surf wave, it's not a wind wave,\" Snider said. \"A tsunami is the entire ocean column that is being lifted above that high tide level there because of that extreme movement of the Earth's crust with the earthquake there, so this is a significant planetary event that we've just witnessed.\"",

A tsunami of that size would be akin to a three foot Wave riding on top of surf, he said.",

Tsunami waves efficiently wrap around islands. All shores are at risk no matter which direction they face.\"",
      "In response to the tsunami warnings, President Trump wrote in a social media post Tuesday night to \"STAY STRONG AND STAY SAFE!\"",

Cabinets toppled inside homes, mirrors were broken, cars swayed in the street and balconies on buildings shook noticeably.",
      "TASS reported power outages and mobile phone service failures in the capital of the Kamchatka region. The news agency also quoted a local Russian official as saying residents on Sakhalin Island were being evacuated and emergency services were working at full capacity.",
      "The earthquake appeared to be the strongest anywhere in the world since the March 2011 earthquake off northeast Japan that measured 9.0 magnitude and caused a massive tsunami that set off meltdowns at a Fukushima nuclear power plant. Only a few stronger earthquakes have ever been measured around the world.",
      "New Zealand authorities issued warnings of \"strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges\" along coastlines throughout the country.

    "summary": "The leading international authority on food crises predicted \"widespread death\" in Gaza without immediate action.",
    "story": [
      "The \"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip,\" the leading international authority on food crises said in a new alert Tuesday, predicting \"widespread death\" without immediate action.",
      "The alert, still short of a formal famine declaration, follows an outcry over images of emaciated children in Gaza and reports of dozens of hunger-related deaths after nearly 22 months of war.",
      "The international pressure led Israel over the weekend to announce measures, including daily humanitarian pauses in fighting in parts of Gaza and airdrops. The United Nations and Palestinians on the ground say little has changed, and desperate crowds continue to overwhelm and unload delivery trucks before they can reach their destinations.",
      "The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said Gaza has teetered on the brink of famine for two years, but recent developments have \"dramatically worsened\" the situation, including \"increasingly stringent blockades\" by Israel.",
      "\"Mounting evidence shows that widespread starvation, malnutrition, and disease are driving a rise in hunger-related deaths. Latest data indicates that Famine thresholds have been reached for food consumption in most of the Gaza Strip and for acute malnutrition in Gaza City,\" the IPC said. \"Immediate action must be taken to end the hostilities and allow for unimpeded, large-scale, life-saving humanitarian response. This is the only path to stopping further deaths and catastrophic human suffering.\"",
      "A formal famine declaration, which is rare, requires the kind of data that the lack of access to Gaza and mobility within it have largely denied. The IPC has only declared famine a few times \u2014 in Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and parts of Sudan's western Darfur region last year.",
      "\"Deadly turning point\" reached",
      "But independent experts say they don't need a formal declaration to know what they're seeing in Gaza.",
      "\"Just as a family physician can often diagnose a patient she's familiar with based on visible symptoms without having to send samples to the lab and wait for results, so too we can interpret Gaza's symptoms. This is famine,\" Alex de Waal, author of \"Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine\" and executive director of the World Peace Foundation, told The Associated Press.",
      "An area is classified as in famine when all three of the following conditions are confirmed:",
      "At least 20% of households have an extreme lack of food, or are essentially starving. At least 30% of children six months to 5 years old suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, meaning they're too thin for their height. And at least two people or four children under 5 per 10,000 are dying daily due to starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease.",
      "The report is based on available information through July 25 and says the crisis has reached \"an alarming and deadly turning point.\" It says data indicates that famine thresholds have been reached for food consumption in most of Gaza \u2014 at its lowest level since the war began \u2014 and for acute malnutrition in Gaza City. The report says nearly 17 out of every 100 children under the age of 5 in Gaza City are acutely malnourished.",
      "Mounting evidence shows \"widespread starvation,\" the IPC says. Essential health and other services have collapsed. One in three people in Gaza is going without food for days at a time, according to the World Food Program. Hospitals report a rapid increase in hunger-related deaths in children under 5. Gaza's population of over 2 million has been squeezed into increasingly tiny areas of the devastated territory.",
      "The IPC's latest analysis in May warned that Gaza will likely fall into famine if Israel doesn't lift its blockade and stop its military campaign. Its new alert calls for immediate and large-scale action and warns: \"Failure to act now will result in widespread death in much of the strip.\"",
      "Israel has restricted aid to varying degrees throughout the war. In March, it cut off the entry of all goods, including fuel, food and medicine, to pressure Hamas to free hostages.",
      "Israel eased those restrictions in May but also pushed ahead with a new U.S.-backed aid delivery system that has been wracked by chaos and violence. The traditional, U.N.-led aid providers say deliveries have been hampered by Israeli military restrictions and incidents of looting, while criminals and hungry crowds swarm entering convoys.",
      "While Israel says there's no limit on how many aid trucks can enter Gaza, U.N. agencies and aid groups say even the latest humanitarian measures are not enough to counter the worsening starvation. In a statement Monday, Doctors Without Borders called the new airdrops ineffective and dangerous, saying they deliver less aid than trucks.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said no one is starving in Gaza and that Israel has supplied enough aid throughout the war, \"otherwise, there would be no Gazans.\" Israel's military on Monday criticized what it calls \"false claims of deliberate starvation in Gaza.\"",

      "\"Let me be clear \u2014 the Netanyahu government's rejection of a two-state solution is wrong. It's wrong morally and it's wrong strategically. It harms the interest of the Israeli people, closing off the only path to a just and lasting peace, and that is why we are determined to protect the viability of a two-state solution,\" Lammy said.",
      "In a statement on X, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the U.K.'s decision, writing that \"Starmer rewards Hamas's monstrous terrorism & punishes its victims.\"",
      "\"A jihadist state on Israel's border TODAY will threaten Britain TOMORROW. Appeasement towards jihadist terrorists always fails. It will fail you too. It will not happen,\" Netanyahu said.",
      "Israel's Foreign Ministry also condemned the decision by the U.K. and called it a \"reward for Hamas\" that \"harms efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and a framework for the release of hostages.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Tuesday, President Trump said he did not discuss the decision with Starmer during their bilateral meeting in Scotland a day before the announcement.",
      "Seated alongside Starmer on Monday, Mr. Trump addressed the situation in Gaza, saying the U.S. will be providing food to the people of Gaza and working to eliminate barriers to humanitarian aid.",
      "\"Some of those kids are, that's real starvation stuff,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"I see it. And you can't fake that. So we're going to be even more involved.",
      "He added: \"I told Israel maybe they have to do it a different way.\"",
      "A Downing Street spokeswoman said in a statement that Starmer spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the phone regarding the announcement on Tuesday.",
      "\"He [Starmer] said that the situation in Gaza was intolerable and that the need for humanitarian access is now more pressing than ever before. He urged the Prime Minister to take immediate action to lift all restrictions on aid access and get those suffering in Gaza the food they need,\" the spokeswoman said.",
      "The spokeswoman for Starmer's office said the prime minister had also spoken over the phone with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, as well as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, and King Abdullah II of Jordan about the U.K.'s plan to recognize Palestinian statehood.",
      "Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would recognize Palestine as a state and would formalize that decision at the U.N. General Assembly in September.",
      "\"Consistent with its historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, I have decided that France will recognize the State of Palestine,\" Macron said at the time. \"The urgent priority today is to end the war in Gaza and to bring relief to the civilian population.\"",
      "Netanyahu said Israel \"strongly\" condemned that decision and said that it \"rewards terror and risks creating another Iranian proxy, just as Gaza became.\"",
      "\"A Palestinian state in these conditions would be a launch pad to annihilate Israel \u2014 not to live in peace beside it. Let's be clear: the Palestinians do not seek a state alongside Israel; they seek a state instead of Israel,\" the Israeli leader said in a post on X.",
      "That announcement came as pressure has mounted on Israel to allow more aid into Gaza as images of starving Palestinian children have garnered widespread global attention over the past week. The international pressure led Israel over the weekend to announce measures, including daily humanitarian pauses in fighting in parts of Gaza and airdrops.",
      "France's top diplomat, Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, hailed the U.K. prime minister's announcement Tuesday in a social media post.",
      "\"Together, through this pivotal decision and our combined efforts, we break the endless cycle of violence and reopen the prospect of peace in the region,\" Barrot said.",
      "The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs lists 149 countries that currently recognise the state of Palestine. That number would rise to 151 should France and the U.K. formalize recognition of Palestine as a state in September.",

      "The president, who said in Scotland on Monday that he was shortening his original 50-day deadline for Russia to make peace with Ukraine, spoke to reporters about the revised deadline Tuesday aboard Air Force One\u00a0as he returned to the U.S. Mr. Trump has been in Scotland for the last five days to negotiate trade deals with European leaders and visit his two golf resorts there.",
      "\"Ten days from today. Okay?\" he said on the plane.",
      "\"And then you know, we're going to put on tariffs and stuff, and I don't know if it's going to affect Russia, because he wants to obviously probably keep the war going,\" the president added, seemingly speaking about Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"But we're going to put on tariffs and the various things that you put on. It may or may not affect them, but it could.\"",
      "The U.S. and Ukraine have been pushing for an immediate ceasefire in order to negotiate a lasting peace deal. Earlier in July, Mr. Trump said if Russia doesn't agree to a ceasefire within a 50-day window, the U.S. would impose secondary tariffs of up to 100% on goods sold by countries that do business with Russia.",
      "Mr. Trump has increasingly expressed frustration with Putin, questioning whether the Russian leader really wants to end the war with Ukraine. Mr. Trump has described thinking he'd had a good phone call with the Russian leader, only to find that the next day, more Ukrainians were being killed by Russia.",

    "summary": "Economists says the new U.S.-EU trade pact averts a trade war and eases uncertainty, but locks high tariffs into place.",
    "story": [
      "The new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union will lift tariffs on imports of goods from EU countries to their highest level in decades and hurt the trading bloc's economic growth, according to some experts.",
      "\"It is an asymmetric and unbalanced deal,\" economists with investment bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said in a report. The EU decided neither to retaliate nor to increase its tariffs, and is even expected to reduce them. The EU agreed to a bad deal rather than risk trade war escalation.\"",
      "The average tariff on U.S. imports from the EU will surge from 1.2% in 2024 to 17.5%, according to investor advisory firm Capital Economics. That will reduce the EU's annual gross domestic product by 0.2%, the investment advisory firm forecast.",
      "EU countries annually ship more than $300 billion in goods to the U.S., accounting for more than 20% of total U.S. imports. Mexico ranks second among America's trade partners at roughly 15% of U.S. imports, while Canada accounts for 11% (see chart at bottom.)",
      "The deal, announced Sunday by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, while American goods exported to the union's 27 member countries will face no tariffs. Previously, U.S. exports to the EU faced an average tariff of roughly 1%, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.",
      "The EU also pledged to buy $750 billion worth of energy from the U.S., up from about $80 billion a year, and to invest $600 billion by 2028.",
      "The trade agreement will boost Americans by increasing access to the EU's vast market and supporting the U.S. manufacturing sector, according to the Trump administration.",
      "\"This colossal deal will enable U.S. farmers, ranchers, fishermen and manufacturers to increase U.S. exports, expand business opportunities and help reduce the goods trade deficit with the European Union,\" the White House said Monday in a\u00a0fact sheet about the pact.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for additional comment.",
      "Reducing uncertainty",
      "Although the agreement sharply raises U.S. tariffs, economists said the deal will also help ease some of the uncertainty around trade relations with a key trading partner. Perhaps most important, it is better than the alternative given that Mr. Trump had threatened to slap a 30% tariff on EU imports.",
      "More broadly, the EU deal and the Trump administration's framework agreement with Japan last week \u2014 both of which set 15% as a baseline tariff \u2014 also could help pave the way for trade agreements with Canada, Korea, Mexico and other countries, including on key sectors like autos, experts said.",
      "\"[C]ompared to expectations we had a few weeks before, in particular when pharmaceuticals and semiconductors could have been subject to higher tariffs, it looks like this deal is better than feared,\" Michel Martinez, head Europe economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "European auto exports would face a 15% levy, down from 25%, according to Goldman Sachs. Von der Leyen also said the U.S. would eliminate tariffs on some products, including aircraft and parts, semiconductor manufacturing gear, natural resources, some farm products, and certain chemicals and generic drugs. Likewise, the EU would abolish tariffs on those products.",
      "Neither the U.S. nor the EU has released details of the pact, and lobbying by some industries is expected to continue. For example, Unione Italiana Vini, an Italian trade group representing winemakers, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Monday that a 15% tariff on EU imports will result in a a $371 million hit for exporters.",
      "\"We are now calling on the Italian government and the EU to consider appropriate measures to safeguard a sector that has grown significantly thanks to U.S. buyers,\" the group's president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, said in a statement, while acknowledging that the\u00a0 deal \"at least resolved the uncertainty that was stalling the market.\"",
      "According to the group's analysis, a bottle of Italian wine that previously retailed for $11.50 in the U.S. will now cost nearly $15 under the new tariff agreement.",
      "The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents German automakers, also said a 15% U.S. tariff on the country's automotive products will hurt its car manufacturers, while noting that the new tariff rate amounts to a reprieve from the 25% automobile levies EU nations have faced since April.",
      "Wayne Winegarden, an economist at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank that support free market policies, expects the U.S.-EU deal is to raise prices for consumers and lower corporate profits.",
      "\"Going forward, we are going to start to see these impacts either through lower profitability for corporations and higher costs for consumers, and most likely a combination of the two,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Despite the Trump administration's recent trade deals with the EU, Japan, U.K. and several other Asian countries, the U.S. still faces a self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline to reach agreements with Canada, Mexico, Korean other key trading partners.",

      "The coins and a lump of unworked gold were originally discovered during excavations of an ancient settlement in Manching, and authorities have said they are considered the biggest trove of Celtic gold found in the 20th century.",
      "The heist took place in just nine minutes, investigators said. At 1:17 a.m., cables were cut at a telecoms hub nearby, leaving the region without communications networks. The museum's door was pried open at 1:26 a.m. The thieves left the building at 1:35 a.m., officials said, leaving them just a few minutes to smash open a display case and take the treasure. No alarms were triggered during the incident. The museum did not have an overnight guard.",
      "Most of the stolen treasure is still missing, but investigators found lumps of gold on one of the suspects when he was arrested that appear to have resulted from part of the treasure being melted down. Rupert Gebhard, the head of the Bavarian State Archaeological Collection in Munich, said in 2022 that seeing the coins melted down would be \"the worst option.\"",
      "The four defendants were accused of a total of 20 break-ins or attempted robberies in Germany and neighboring Austria, starting in 2014. Other cases involved safes or cash machines being broken into.",
      "The defendants didn't address the charges during the roughly six-month trial, but their lawyers called for their acquittal.",

But the trip has featured a lot of golf, and having the president visit is sure to raise the new course's profile.",

      "A press release says the new course features the world's largest natural bunker, dunes and greens overlooking the sea, with a \"focus on environmental sensitivity.\"",

      "He lost that case and was eventually ordered to pay legal costs for bringing it \u2014 and the issue still enrages him. During the meeting with Starmer, Mr. Trump called windmills \"ugly monsters\" and suggested they were part of \"the most expensive form of energy.\"",
      "\"I restricted windmills in the United States because they also kill all your birds,\" the president said. \"If you shoot a bald eagle in the United States, they put you in jail for five years. And windmills knock out hundreds of them. They don't do anything. Explain that.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Los Angeles wildfires and severe spring thunderstorms are just a few of the natural disasters that have contributed to more than $131 billion in global losses for the first half of 2025, according to a new report from the insurance company Munich Re.",
      "Overall losses so far in 2025 were slightly lower than the same time period in 2024, but still above long-term averages.",
      "By this time last year, overall losses were slightly higher at $155 billion, adjusted for inflation. The first half of 2024 included an earthquake in Japan on New Year's Day, coupled with severe thunderstorms in the United States that spawned more than 1,250 tornadoes.",
      "Of the $131 billion in overall losses for 2025, $80 billion was insured, which is the second-highest amount for the first half of any year since recordkeeping began in 1980. The first half of 2011 is the only year where insured losses have been higher, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami in Japan.",
      "The L.A. wildfires have been the costliest natural disaster this year and are estimated to have caused $53 billion in overall losses, with $40 billion insured.",
      "Climate change played a role in the wildfires by increasing the fire weather index conditions, making them more intense and destructive, according to scientists.",
      "\"We need to face it that the losses have been on the rise and make it clear that climate change plays an ever increasing role,\" said Tobias Grimm, chief climate scientist at Munich Re.",
      "As more people move into high-risk climate areas and weather events grow more extreme due to climate change, the damages will likely keep climbing, Grimm said.",
      "Another major global disaster in 2025 was the March 7.7-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar that killed an estimated 4,500 people and caused $12 billion in losses, very little of which was insured.",
      "Weather disasters like wildfires and storms have caused 88% of overall losses and 98% of insured losses, according to Munich Re. Earthquakes accounted for 12% of overall losses and 2% of insured losses in 2025 so far.",
      "In seven out of the last eight years, the industry has seen more than $100 billion in insured losses, Grimm said.",
      "\"Usually the second half of the year is more costly,\" he said, due to the bulk of the hurricane season starting in August and concluding in November.",
      "With hurricanes and wildfires being the costliest disasters on-record, the need to adapt and mitigate these climate impacts is necessary to address rising insurance costs, according to Grimm and other company experts.",
      "\"The best way to avoid losses is to implement effective preventive measures, such as more robust construction for buildings and infrastructure to better withstand natural disasters,\" Thomas Blunck, a member of the Board of Management of Munich Re, said in a statement. \"Such precautions can help to maintain reasonable insurance premiums, even in high-risk areas. And most importantly: to reduce future exposure, new building development should not be allowed in high-risk areas.\"",

    "story": [
      "A life-line for Gaza's roughly 2 million displaced inhabitants was back in operation on Monday, with convoys of trucks on the move. They were carrying urgently needed food aid after a sudden reversal of policy by Israel.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government announced over the weekend that it would enable more food and medicine to enter the war-torn Palestinian territory after images of hungry people and malnourished children drew international condemnation.",
      "Israel has also permitted humanitarian air drops. On Sunday, Israel, Jordan and the UAE all parachuted pallets of aid into the ruins of Gaza.",
      "The drops look dramatic, but they're expensive, inefficient and potentially dangerous. People have been hurt and even killed by the heavy pallets during past air drops over the territory.",
      "To meet the need, the bulk of the aid will have to come into Gaza by truck. Each truck can carry between 4 and 10 times as much as a parachute.",
      "After 22 months of war, including months when Israel blocked all aid coming into Gaza, people are so hungry that they're looting the convoys.",
      "Video from over the weekend showed men clambering to pull bags of flour off trucks before they could reach aid depots.",
      "International charities have a new name for it \u2014 \"self-distribution\" \u2014   and it's a graphic depiction of the level of desperation in the Palestinian enclave.",
      "On Sunday, 120 trucks worth of aid moved into Gaza. At least as much was expected to arrive on Monday \u2014 but it's not nearly enough. Before the war started, more 500 trucks per day was the norm.",
      "Maryam Yahya is one of the roughly 2 million Gazans trying to survive in a tent.",
      "\"We haven't seen a thing,\" she said. \"No aid ... from land, air or anywhere else.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the war rages on. Israel's military has said it will pause the fighting in heavily populated areas from 10 a.m. until 8 p.m. local time, for an unspecified number of days. But there have been more reports of people being shot trying to access food.",
      "In a statement on Monday, the U.N. agency tasked with helping Palestinians, UNRWA, welcomed Israel's declaration of humanitarian pauses and the easing of restrictions on aid entering Gaza, but it stressed that much more was needed.",
      "UNRWA warned that, according to its data, \"1 in every 5 children is malnourished in Gaza City. More children have reportedly died of hunger; bringing the death toll \u2026 to over 100.\"",
      "\"We hope that UNRWA will finally be allowed to bring in thousands of trucks loaded with food, medicine and hygiene supplies. They are currently in Jordan and Egypt waiting for the green light,\" the agency said. \"Opening all the crossings and flooding Gaza with assistance is the only way to avert further deepening of starvation among the people of Gaza. What's needed is at least 500/600 trucks of basics every day.\"",
      "The Israeli military has also said it will secure safe routes for aid trucks to deliver and distribute their loads through Gaza. It's something that the U.N.'s aid agencies have been pushing for and, if it works, it will allow much needed food to finally reach the people who so badly need it.",

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of an interview with French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 27, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to French Foreign Minister Jean\u2011No\u00ebl\u202fBarrot, who joins us this morning from Paris. Welcome to \"Face The Nation.\" I want to begin on what is happening in Gaza with those horrific images that we are seeing of starvation overnight, Israel has begun air drops. We know Jordan, other states are looking to organize more aid. Are you exploring any further avenues to bring aid into Gaza?",
      "FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER JEAN-NO\u00cbL BARROT: What's happening in Gaza right now is appalling. Gaza is- is- is now in the brink of a full catastrophe, and we've been working out, over the months, to try and relief the sufferings of the Palestinian people. We actually have 52 tons of humanitarian help stuck in El-Arish in Egypt, a few kilometers away from Gaza. So we're exploring all options to seize the opportunity offered by the Israeli government by opening the skies of Gaza, but we call for immediate, unhindered, and massive access by all means of humanitarian help to those who need it most.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Has Israel responded to your calls?",
      "BARROT: We have, with the European Union, started tough discussions with the Israeli government, who have made first commitments that have not been fulfilled yet. In the next few days, the European Commission will make clear what our expectations are. We expect the Israeli government to stop the operations of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation that has caused bloodbath in humanitarian help distribution lines in Gaza. We expect them to pay the 2 billion euros they owe to the Palestinian Authority and to lift the financial blockage that is now preventing the Palestinian Authority to implement its most basic missions. We also expect the Israeli government to bring to a stop its latest settlement projects, the E1 projects with 3,400 housing units that might split the West Bank in two pieces and prevent the emergence of a political, a two state solution. But what we call for is, of course, the immediate cease-fire, the liberation of whole hostages of Hamas, that needs to be disarmed. And the entry, the massive entry, of humanitarian help in Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are headed to New York, to the United Nations, to help lead a summit to talk about a two state solution. Your president announced France will formally recognize the state of Palestine at the UN in September. More than 100 countries recognize Palestine, but France is the first western UN Security Council member to do so, and the United States opposes what you are saying. Secretary of State Rubio called it \"reckless.\" He says it serves Hamas propaganda, sets back peace, and considers it \"a slap in the face to the victims of October 7.\" In your government's view, why is he wrong?",
      "BARROT: So the reason why President Macron made this decision is that it was absolutely necessary to restart a political process, the two state solution process that was- that is today threatened, more threatened that it- it has ever been. And the conference that will take place in New York tomorrow and Tuesday is a very significant milestone, because by- by- by recognizing, or announcing the recognition of Palestine, France has been able, alongside Saudi Arabia, that has- that will be co chairing this conference with us, to collect very significant historic commitments by all stakeholders, including the Palestinian Authority president and Arab countries, in favor of the two state solution, and guarantee security guarantees for Israel. The two state solution is very simple, and I think everyone can understand what we mean by that. The only way to bring peace and stability back in this region is to have two state, the state of Israel and the state of Palestine, living side by side in peace and in security. This perspective is now threatened, and it's why the- the dynamic that we have initiated was so important, and this is why the conference that will take place in New York is such an important milestone. All these efforts are very, very complementary to the efforts that the U.S. have done in the region since the first term of President Trump. We share the short-term objective: immediate cease-fire, liberation of all hostages of Hamas that needs to be disarmed. We share the long term objective: peace and stability in the region. And what we're doing, by bringing the Palestinian Authority leader to recognize seventh of October as a terrorist attack, by calling the Hamas- the disarm- for the disarmament of Hamas and the liberation of hostages, by committing to deep reform of the Palestinian Authority, and by committing to elections within one year, by bringing the Arab countries for the first time to condemn Hamas and call for its disarmament, we are creating, or recreating, the conditions for this political solution that, again, is the only path forward, and we are paving the way. We're paving the way for the future Abraham Accords that the U.S. administration might lead. So I see our effort as very complementary to the U.S. administration's effort, rather than substitutes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Minister Barrot, the president of the United States dismissed what President Macron said, the U.S. Ambassador mocked it. Do you believe that your plans can succeed without U.S. support?",
      "BARROT: Again, our efforts are very complementary . We share the short term objective, cease-fire, liberation of all hostages of Hamas, and the long term objective, peace and stability in the region. In fact, we will welcome any further efforts led by the U.S. to implement the Abraham Accord logics. And what we're doing now with this very significant conference that will take place in New York will pave the way for such accords. But in the meantime, until the U.S. administration provides, through the Abraham Accord logics, a political horizon for this crisis, we need to act in order to facilitate the- or create an off ramp for the catastrophe ongoing in Gaza. Now the terms, we will welcome and support future Abraham Accords, but in the meantime, inaction is not an option.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you briefly about an incident that has gained a lot of attention this past week involving some young French citizens who were removed from a flight from Spain. The airline claims they were kicked off for being disruptive. The Israeli government came out though and said the French students were removed because they're Jewish. Have you determined whether this was indeed an act of antisemitism?",
      "BARROT: I have called the CEO of this company, who has- to express our- our serious preoccupation. She has confirmed that an internal investigation is ongoing. My team has been reaching out to the ambassador of Spain in- in France, and we've made the same request. We'll keep following this situation as it unravels",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So too- too early to say, despite what the Israeli government is indicating.",
      "BARROT: I cannot comment on that at this point. We've taken action as- as soon as we got, you know, as we got notice of what was happening, we offered support on location through our embassy to this group. We then reached out to the- the airline company, to the Spanish authorities, and we're now following the results of these investigations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: France has been very active diplomatically on a number of fronts. It was just five weeks ago when the United States and Israel bombed Iran. Since that time, France has talked to the Iranian government, along with other European powers, about what remains of Iran's nuclear program. How concerned are you that after these bombings, Iran may now covertly attempt to make a weapon, and the world won't know?",
      "BARROT: This is still a risk that we are facing, and alongside Germany and the UK, we have been very clear, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon, and we've been, over the past few months, reaching out to the Iranian authority in close coordination with U.S. authorities in order to express what our expectations are. Ten years ago, we reached a deal on the nuclear program that allowed for a significant rollback of Iranian nuclear capacity. Of course, things has changed. Still then, and since then, Iran has violated all commitments it had taken at the time of signing this agreement. We now want a more comprehensive agreement that would encompass both the nuclear dimension of Iranian destabilization activities, but also it's the ballistic component, as well as the regional destabilization activities that Iran has been conducting, unless we- unless a new and robust and durable and verifiable agreement is reached by the end of the summer, France, Germany and the UK will have no other choice but to reapply the global embargoes that were lifted 10 years ago when the nuclear agreement with Iran was signed, embargoes on weapons, on nuclear equipment, and on banking.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So France is ready to snap back sanctions on Iran as soon as August. Are you asking Iran to speak directly to the United States in order to avoid that fate?",
      "BARROT: We've been speaking with Special Envoy Witkoff, Secretary Rubio, on a weekly basis on this topic that is highly important for the U.S., as for Europeans. We- we have supported U.S.-led efforts to enter into discussions with Iran. We have pressed Iran, after the 12 day war, to go back to a discussion with the U.S., and we'll keep pressing them to do so, because indeed, if there is no solid agreement that can be found by the end of August, we will have no other option but to snap back, meaning to reapply those global embargoes, and we are ready to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Minister Barrot, thank you very much for your time this morning."

Kennedy, Jr. speaks alongside Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary (L) about the sending of warning letters to companies for illegally marketing products containing 7-hydroxymitragynine, also known as 7-OH, as part of their actions combatting opioids, during a press conference at HHS headquarters in Washington, D.C., on July 29, 2025.\u00a0 (SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)",

      "According to the FDA, 7-OH is beginning to be recognized for its potential to be abused because of its ability to bind to opioid receptors. Additionally, the substance is widely available and may be appealing to children and teens as it is sold in fruit-flavored gummies and even ice cream cones. The FDA is also warning that 7-OH products \"may not be clearly or accurately labeled as to their 7-OH content and are sometimes disguised or marketed as kratom.\"",
      "\"I am in favor of this move because of the relationship of the 7-OH to the opioid receptors. This is essentially an opioid. It is semisynthetic and derived from the kratom plant whose leaves make a stimulant. There are no approved 7-OH drugs or diet supplements,\" FOX News Senior Medical Analyst Dr. Marc Siegel told Fox News Digital. \"Bravo to the FDA for this move \u2014 it should be listed as a controlled substance.\"",

      "A long-awaited stock trading ban passed through the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee on Wednesday, with committee Democrats joining with the bill's sponsor, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., to send the bill to the floor of the Senate.",
      "Hawley originally introduced the \"PELOSI Act\" earlier this year, but what ultimately passed through the dizzying committee markup process on Wednesday was the Honest Act. Both pieces of legislation ban all members of Congress and their spouses from trading stocks while in office, in addition to closing various loopholes around direct trades. The critical difference between the two bills is that the Honest Act also bans the president and vice president from making trades while in office. That provision wouldn't go into effect until after President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance leave office, however.",
      "Media reports Wednesday morning claimed that the White House had pushed back on that provision once they caught wind of it, but Hawley told Fox News Digital in an interview that he never heard any such messaging from the administration and \"certainly not from Trump.\" Hawley was the sole Republican on the committee to vote in favor of the bill, despite a former co-sponsor of the PELOSI Act, Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, sitting on the committee as well.",
      "Trump reacted to the Hawley bill's progress during a Wednesday press conference. He reiterated his support for a congressional stock trading ban, but declined to endorse the legislation outright. He did not comment directly on the ban's inclusion of the top executive offices.",

      "\"I like it conceptually,\" Trump said of the bill. \"I don't know about it, but I like it conceptually and, you know, Nancy Pelosi became rich by having inside information. She made a fortune with her husband. And I think that's disgraceful. So in that sense, I'd like it, but I'd have to really see. I'd have, you know \u2014 I study these things very carefully, and this just happened. So I'll take a look at it. But conceptually, I like it.\"",
      "A source familiar with Wednesday's negotiations told Fox News Digital that Hawley negotiated with Democrats while keeping Republicans in the dark, citing multiple pieces of legislation that crossed lawmakers' desks Monday morning that each had different versions of the ban. Hawley faced staunch criticism from his Republican colleagues during the markup process.",
      "\"I have no idea what we're voting for,\" Moreno said. \"I have not read the mountains of paper that are sitting in front of me.\"",

      "\"I don't mind anyone being rich. I mind people getting rich while they\u2019re here and trading stocks,\" Hawley responded.",
      "Following the hearing, reporters asked Hawley about the criticism from his Republican colleagues more broadly.",
      "\"They don't want to ban stock trading. I just think that's a mistake,\" he responded.",
      "Current GOP versions of the stock trading ban moving through the House of Representatives do not include the president and vice president.",
      "Sen. Rick Scott was among the Republicans who criticized Hawley's stock trading ban on Wednesday. (Reuters)",
      "Hawley's ban would prohibit lawmakers, the president, vice president and their spouses from holding, purchasing or selling stocks for the duration of their time in office. Officeholders would be allowed to invest in diversified mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, or U.S. Treasury bonds while in office.",

      "News of the sanctions comes after President Trump threatened a 50% tariff on products from Brazil unless the country stopped what Trump has described as an \"unjust\" and politically motivated case against Bolsonaro that is charging the former Brazilian president with organizing an attempted coup. A notice announcing the sanctions from the Treasury Department alleged De Moraes has been using his position to authorize \"arbitrary\" pre-trial detentions, suppress freedom of speech and target political opponents.",

      "Any corporations or financial institutions that engage in certain transactions or activities deemed to violate the sanctions against De Morae also risk exposure to sanctions themselves, the Treasury Department also indicated.",
      "The Trump administration's sanctions against De Moraes stem from the president's first-term Executive Order 13818, which declared a national emergency with respect to human rights abuses and corruption around the world.

      "In the wake of a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer being shot allegedly by two criminal illegal immigrants earlier this month, experts are calling attention to how sanctuary policies sheltering lawbreakers are directly responsible for rising crime and violence in Democratic-run jurisdictions.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office, however, pushed back against the notion that sanctuary policies are to blame, with a spokesperson calling it \"fake news\" and an attempt by the Trump administration to justify \"their cruel and militaristic actions.\"",
      "This comes after two illegal immigrants \u2013 Miguel Francisco Mora Nunez and Cristian Aybar Berroa \u2013 were arrested in connection with an off-duty CBP officer being shot in the face in a New York City park. According to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), both illegals have long criminal histories and had ICE detainers against them that had been ignored by New York City officials.",
      "Last week, the Trump Justice Department announced it is suing New York City over its longstanding sanctuary policies, which DHS said enabled the shooting. The lawsuit, filed in a New York federal court, names New York City Mayor Eric Adams and several other city officials as defendants. The lawsuit claims the city has enacted policies with the intent of impeding the federal government's ability to enforce immigration laws.",

      "Joe Borelli, a former New York City Council member, told Fox News Digital that sanctuary policies have made many of America\u2019s major cities \"demonstrably\" less safe.",
      "\"We have had about a decade of this \u2018sanctuary city\u2019 experiment in Democratic-run cities, and after all this time, we can now definitively say it\u2019s been a net loss. And that\u2019s being polite,\" said Borelli.",
      "\"In truth, it has drained the coffers of American cities and states and has demonstrably made our neighborhoods less safe, especially those that are home to our legal immigrant communities,\" he added.",
      "Andrew Arthur, a former immigration judge and policy expert at the Center for Immigration Studies, told Fox News Digital that the continued criminality of individuals like the two suspects in New York is \"a direct result of the sanctuary policies.\"",
      "He said the suspects in the New York shooting had a \"slew of prior arrests, any one of which could have resulted in their arrest by ICE and deportation from the United States.\"",
      "\"But they didn't because they occurred largely in sanctuary jurisdictions where ICE didn't have cooperation from the local authorities,\" he explained.",

Both men had prior criminal records and ICE detainers that were not honored by local officials. (Department of Homeland Security)",
      "\"The contention that is made is that those policies are necessary in order to protect the immigrant communities, but the only things that sanctuary policies actually protect are criminals,\" he said. \"States and localities like California, Los Angeles, Denver, Boston, Massachusetts, New York and New York City that do have sanctuary jurisdictions make it much more likely that criminal aliens will be released onto the street to re-offend.\"",
      "Lora Ries, a border security and immigration expert at the Heritage Foundation, predicted that if the sanctuary policies continue, \"there's going to be more preventable crime and more victims who shouldn't be victims.\"",
      "\"It has not just been a national security threat, but a personal safety threat,\" she said, adding, \"and we have already too many examples of preventable crimes because perpetrators shouldn't have been here. They either snuck across the border the first time, the second time, the third time, committed crimes previously and either weren't prosecuted or weren't detained or and or weren't turned over to ICE.\"",
      "Ries pointed out that, despite Democratic claims that Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown is unpopular, it is sanctuary policies \u2013 that allow criminal illegals to evade ICE - that the public is opposed to.",
      "Since 2015, a majority of Americans have generally favored the deportation of illegal immigrants. The latest Fox News survey, released on Monday, found roughly 8 in 10\u00a0Democrats, 6 in 10 independents, and 4 in 10 Republicans agree that at least illegal immigrants charged with crimes should be deported, while others should be offered a path to stay.",

      "Why lithium-ion batteries need a second life",
      "From your phone to electric vehicles and even power grids, lithium-ion batteries are everywhere. They offer unmatched energy density and can scale to meet large infrastructure demands. However, there's a catch. Even with optimal use, these batteries wear out after a few thousand charge cycles. When they die, they leave behind components such as nickel, cobalt, and manganese, materials that are expensive and environmentally damaging to mine. Without a solid plan for recycling, the clean energy revolution could create a very dirty problem.",
      "The problem with traditional battery recycling",
      "Standard recycling methods aren't quite up to the task. They're energy-intensive, generate significant emissions, and often fail to recover materials in usable form. This means many recycled batteries can't be turned into new, high-performing ones. As a result, manufacturers continue to mine for raw materials, causing further environmental harm. That's why scientists have been searching for a better way to close the loop.",

      "Image of a lithium battery\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you rely on a smartphone, drive an EV, or use a laptop daily, this research affects you. The push toward clean energy is not just about wind turbines and solar panels. It's about making the entire system, including batteries, more sustainable. Right now, most of us toss old devices without thinking about where the battery ends up. But that battery contains valuable metals, metals that are expensive to mine and harmful to extract.",
      "This new method from WPI means future batteries in your devices could be made from sustainably recycled materials, without sacrificing performance. That helps keep costs down, reduces toxic waste, and shrinks your personal carbon footprint. These high-performance recycled batteries could soon power electric vehicles, solar-powered homes, and even the devices in your pocket, bringing sustainability directly into your life. Plus, as governments and companies invest in battery-powered everything, innovations like this help ensure there are enough materials to go around, without ripping more resources out of the ground.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This innovation could become a cornerstone of the circular battery economy, where old batteries fuel new technology without harming the planet. WPI's approach doesn't just tackle waste. It redefines how we think about energy storage in a world that urgently needs sustainable solutions.",

    "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/tech/clever-ev-hack-could-reinvent-diesel-trucking",
    "published": "Tue, 29 Jul 2025 13:00:36 -0400",
    "summary": "Long-haul trucks are now being upgraded with a surprising twist, thanks to California-based startup Revoy. Their electric boost doesn&apos;t replace diesel but works alongside it to cut emissions and fuel costs without major disruption.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "If you think electric trucking means buying a brand-new semi, think again. Long-haul trucks are now being upgraded with a surprising twist, thanks to California-based startup Revoy. Their electric boost doesn't replace diesel but works alongside it to cut emissions and fuel costs without major disruption.",
      "In 2025, transportation was the top source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. And for the first time, heavy-duty trucks edged out passenger vehicles in how much pollution they produce. That makes freight the low-hanging fruit in the fight to reduce emissions. But electrifying it? That's where things get tricky.",
      "Electric semis are pricey. They're also heavy, have limited range, and take too long to charge. Trucking companies, many of them small operators, run on razor-thin margins and can't afford long downtimes. Public fast-charging for trucks barely exists. And without more demand, investors aren't building new stations. That's the bottleneck.",
      "Revoy's solution flips the equation. Instead of replacing the truck, they simply electrify the space between the cab and trailer.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM/NEWSLETTER.",
      "A big rig using a high-tech electric dolly with its own motor and a battery pack. (Revoy)",
      "How an electric dolly converts diesel trucks instantly",
      "Imagine your standard diesel rig pulling onto the highway. Nothing looks unusual until you notice something new sandwiched between the truck and trailer. Revoy's innovation is a high-tech electric dolly with its own motor and a massive battery pack.",
      "The dolly carries a 575-kilowatt-hour battery, putting it in the same class as fully electric semis. But here's the clever part: it doesn't just trail along. It pushes the truck forward using its own powered axle, giving the diesel engine a break and saving fuel. All of this happens without modifying the truck or trailer.",
      "It connects to the truck's fifth-wheel hitch using a smart kingpin. It also plugs into the existing air and electrical lines between the cab and trailer. No hardwiring. No overhaul. Revoy designed it for fast installation, just minutes, no tools required.",
      "Illustration of how the Revoy dolly connects to the truck's fifth-wheel hitch. (Revoy)",
      "Electric truck conversion adds smart driving features",
      "This isn't just about range. Revoy's dolly also turns any diesel rig into a smarter, safer machine. Using embedded sensors and cameras, the dolly monitors blind spots and feeds real-time data to a driver's smartphone app. It enhances lane stability, helps correct steering in crosswinds, and delivers regenerative braking that recharges the battery. It also enables automated reversing, especially useful for tight yards and docks.",
      "The best part? Drivers don't need to learn anything new. There's no extra dashboard. The truck drives as it always has, just with extra power, extra control, and extra safety.",
      "EV battery swapping makes truck charging fast and easy",
      "Charging has always been a weak point in electric freight. Even the fastest chargers take 30 minutes or more to top off a truck battery. Revoy dodges that altogether. Instead of plugging in, truckers pull into a Revoy swap station and exchange their depleted dolly for a freshly charged one. The process takes about five minutes, which is faster than refueling a diesel tank.",
      "The first swap stations are already live in Texas and Arkansas, with more coming soon. As the network grows, so does the vision of truly hybrid diesel-electric freight. And if the route doesn't include a Revoy station? No problem. The truck simply runs on diesel alone and drops off the dolly at the last location passed.",
      "Illustration of a Revoy swap station. (Revoy)",
      "Electric conversion for trucks without upfront costs",
      "Worried about capital expense? Revoy's business model removes the barrier entirely. Truckers and fleet operators don't purchase the dolly; they lease it per mile. That means zero capital investment and no maintenance headaches.",
      "The system is designed to pay for itself. Revoy estimates savings of over $5,000 per truck annually, mostly through reduced fuel consumption. In some cases, fleets have reported 3 to 5 times better fuel efficiency.",
      "And weight isn't an issue for most operators. While the dolly adds mass, most truckloads fill trailers by volume, not weight. Revoy says over 60% of loads qualify, making this a practical fit for the majority of long-haul routes.",
      "Can this electric truck add-on work worldwide?",
      "Revoy built its dolly system for U.S.-style single-trailer rigs, but the idea could scale globally. Countries like Australia, with vast, sun-drenched highways, could easily support dolly-swap stations powered by solar energy. Imagine swapping a charged dolly in the Outback instead of waiting an hour for a charger.",
      "Canada and other countries with twin-trailer B-Doubles would require a modified version, but the core concept remains powerful: electrify trucks without replacing them. The technology is modular. The logistics are scalable. The potential is massive.",
      "A big rig on the road using a high-tech electric dolly. (Revoy)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Electric trucks\u00a0are still years away from becoming mainstream. But this electric add-on is already solving the biggest problems today. It's fast. It's smart. It works with the trucks that are already on the road. Instead of overhauling the entire trucking industry, this system works with what exists right now. You don't need a brand-new truck. You just need a smarter way to power it.",

      "The alerts use machine learning models that constantly update and improve. These AI tools analyze billions of data points to detect new scam patterns, even ones they haven't seen before. If a payment seems suspicious, the system will interrupt the transaction with a tailored alert. And the higher the risk, the stronger the warning.",

      "What this means for you",
      "Now, imagine delegating your most tedious tasks, such as replying to emails, booking dinners, or researching vacations, to an assistant who truly acts on your behalf.

      "You retain full control while avoiding the need to micromanage every click or keystroke. Whether your schedule fills quickly or you simply dislike digital grunt work, ChatGPT agent is built to manage these demands efficiently.",
      "Looking ahead, OpenAI intends for the agent to work even more independently, completing your to-do list as you focus on what matters most. The key question remains: how much will you be willing to hand off?",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "With ChatGPT agent, we're moving from AI chatbots that merely react to those that are proactive and decision-makers. As AI agents become increasingly autonomous, their capabilities will continue to expand. However, the biggest challenge for OpenAI will be striking the right balance between convenience, safety, and privacy.",

      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why dogs see TV differently than we do",
      "In the past, older TVs didn't do much for dogs. Their lower refresh rates caused flickering that was hard for canine eyes to process. Dogs see flicker more sensitively than humans do. So while you were watching your favorite sitcom, your dog was probably just seeing a strobe light. Today's high-definition, high-frame-rate TVs are a different story. The improved visuals and sound mean dogs can now recognize what's happening onscreen and respond to it.",
      "What the study found about how dogs respond to different kinds of tv content",
      "Researchers developed something called the Dog Television Viewing Scale (DTVS). It's a 16-question tool that helps measure how dogs respond to different kinds of TV content, like barking, tail-wagging, or even following something off-screen. They surveyed over 650 dog owners. More than 450 respondents reported that their dogs actually watch TV. From there, three main behavior patterns emerged:",
      "Dogs responded most strongly to other animals, especially dogs and wildlife.",
      "Some dogs physically tracked an object as it moved off the screen. This suggests they think the image might exist beyond the TV, like in real life.",
      "Dogs also reacted to people and inanimate objects, such as cars or doorbells.",
      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Personality plays a big role in how dogs react to TV",
      "The researchers found that personality, not breed or age, influenced how dogs reacted. Excitable dogs were more likely to exhibit \"follow\" behavior, actively watching and expecting movement off-screen. Fearful or reactive dogs were more sensitive to non-animal stimuli, like human voices or doorbells. Interestingly, dogs' sex, breed, or even whether they were neutered didn't seem to affect their TV habits. Exposure to TV also wasn't a strong factor, meaning dogs aren't necessarily \"trained\" to watch.",
      "What this means for dog owners",
      "If you leave the TV on for your dog while you're out, you're not alone, and it might even help them feel more at ease. But not all dogs benefit the same way. The content matters. Animal-heavy programming could excite or soothe a curious pup. But shows with loud sounds or human conflict could stress out a fearful dog. Some streaming services, like DOGTV, are now designing content tailored for dogs. This research gives that idea more scientific credibility.",
      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Can TV help shelter dogs?",
      "The findings suggest a new tool for improving dog welfare, especially in shelters. Tailored TV programming could help reduce stress and provide mental enrichment for dogs waiting to be adopted. Still, more research is needed. Most of the data came from owners whose dogs already engage with TV. Behavior reports were based on what owners observed, rather than direct measurement.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "TV might not just be background noise for your dog. For some, it could be entertainment. For others, it might even be stress relief or stimulation. And thanks to modern screen tech, they're seeing it clearer than ever before. So next time you catch your dog watching with you, take a moment. They may really be following the action.",

      "In Greek mythology, the Sirens were creatures whose irresistible song lured sailors to their doom. Odysseus, the hero of\u00a0\"The Odyssey,\" wanted to hear that famous song. But he knew it was dangerous. So, he had his men tie him to the mast and block their ears with beeswax. Then, they sailed toward the Island of the Sirens. Why? Because Odysseus understood that once he heard their song, he wouldn't be able to resist. And that song always leads to trouble.",

      "How scammers trick your parents even when they know better",
      "What does this have to do with protecting your parents from scammers? None of us is invulnerable, not even a hero like Odysseus. The trick is knowing what you can't resist and, one way or another, avoiding it. You can teach your parents all there is to know about modern-day fraud and the dangers of sharing personal information, but there's still this Siren song out there that will have them throwing all that knowledge out the window in a heartbeat.",
      "What this Siren song is varies from person to person and day to day. It might be a near-perfect clone of a grandchild's voice, calling in a panic and asking for an urgent transfer to bail them out of trouble, if not jail. Alternatively, a financial adviser could be deftly playing on your parents' anxieties around money since retiring. Another common scam involves a suspiciously foreign-sounding Microsoft customer-support worker calling to inform your parents that the computer they don't have or never use has been infected with a virus.",
      "Emotional triggers are the scammer's best tool",
      "The point is that all of us, no matter how well-informed, careful, or clever, can be exploited by a fast-talking scammer. All it takes is the right hook at exactly the wrong moment, and we're along for the ride. All the more so as we get older and technology advances rapidly, leaving us behind. Scammers rely on emotional reactions as much as, if not more than, ignorance. Letting your parents know about the dangers of engaging with strangers (even if they claim to be from Visa or\u00a0the IRS) is crucial, but it's not enough. Scammers exploit fear, greed, and the desire to please others or simply be a good citizen. They're experts at raising the emotional toll of interrupting, interrogating, or ignoring them. In short, getting drawn into discussions with scammers is playing with fire.",
      "(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsso)",
      "The best solution: Cut off scammers at the source",
      "So, what's the solution? Stop the scammers from making contact in the first place. They're getting your parents' contact information and much more personal data besides, from somewhere. Stop them from getting their hands on it, and they won't have the chance to manipulate your parents into doing something they'll regret.",
      "People-search sites are a great source of information for scammers. Fast, easy, and inexpensive, they fuel smaller operations and individual scammers. People-search sites are a kind of data broker; the other major kind, sometimes called private-database data brokers, are even worse. These data brokers sell personal data in bulk to other businesses.",
      "They've been caught selling the personal data of vulnerable adults before, offering data packs that focused on people who needed in-home care or were suffering from cognitive impairment or decline, for example. This is worse than posting your parents' details publicly. This is packaging up those details and marketing them directly to scammers.",
      "An elderly parent and his daughter \u00a0looking at a laptop screen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsso)",
      "Use a data removal service to protect your parents",
      "The good news is that a\u00a0data removal service can scrub both people-search sites and the databases of those other, more shadowy data brokers clean of your parents' information. Names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, property values, health information, shopping habits, political preferences, and more. You can take all this down in one fell swoop with a personal data removal service.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you and your parents.",

When one battery starts to run low, the robot turns its torso, uses built-in tools on its arms and removes the drained battery. It then picks up a fresh one, plugs it in and gets back to work immediately. The entire process takes about three minutes. This system is similar to battery-swapping tech used in electric vehicles.

      "The airline emphasizes that the system doesn't use personal data like your habits or booking history. Rather, it relies on aggregated market trends and analyst oversight to determine fares.",
      "By the end of this year, Delta aims to set 20% of ticket prices dynamically using AI, a sevenfold increase from just a year ago. This high-tech approach could result in better deals or higher costs, not because of who you are, but because of market demand at the time you book. Let's take a look at how it works, why Delta's betting on it and what it means for your wallet.",

      "Passengers traveling through an airport\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is AI-powered ticket pricing?",
      "Traditional ticket pricing relies on fare \"buckets,\" where customers are grouped into categories based on when and how they book their tickets. Delta's AI-powered system replaces static pricing with a dynamic model that evaluates real-time market data, like demand surges or route-specific trends, to recommend pricing tiers.",
      "Delta President Glen Hauenstein describes this as a reengineering of pricing, calling AI a\u00a0\"super analyst\" that works 24/7, seeking the optimal price for every traveler, every time. The airline has partnered with Fetcherr, which provides the underlying technology and also supports other global airlines.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Why Delta wants smarter, not personalized pricing",
      "Let's be honest. Airlines aren't adopting new, high-tech pricing systems to make less money. Delta says early results from AI-driven pricing show\u00a0\"amazingly favorable\" revenues.",
      "However, the airline states it is not personalizing prices based on individual behavior. Instead, the AI analyzes large-scale patterns, like route demand, seasonal shifts, and timing trends, before analysts set final prices.",
      "Delta's strategy is simple \u2014 a price that's available on that flight, at that time, to you, the individual.",
      "Passengers traveling through an airport (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does this affect travelers?",
      "If you've ever wondered why airfare fluctuates every time you check, get ready for even more volatility. Delta's system could theoretically offer you a different price than someone else for the exact same seat, calculated in real time by AI.",
      "Pros: You might get special offers or early discounts if the AI needs to fill seats.",
      "Cons: It becomes much harder to know if you're getting a \"fair\" deal because the price shown is purely based on what AI thinks you'll pay, not what everyone else pays.",
      "Some privacy advocates worry this could disadvantage customers who lack the means or time to search for the best deals, potentially charging the highest prices to those unable to shop around.",
      "We reached out to Delta for a comment, and a spokesperson provided CyberGuy with this statement:",
      "\"There is no fare product Delta has ever used, is testing or plans to use that targets customers with individualized offers based on personal information or otherwise. A variety of market forces drive the dynamic pricing model that\u2019s been used in the global industry for decades, with new tech simply streamlining this process. Delta always complies with regulations around pricing and disclosures.\"",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Industry impact and growing criticism over AI ticket pricing",
      "Delta's transparency regarding this shift has drawn national attention. Other airlines are already testing their own AI fare systems, and experts expect the industry to follow suit. Yet, privacy advocates and some lawmakers are voicing strong concerns. Critics argue that letting AI determine pricing behind the scenes is, in the words of Consumer Watchdog, like airlines\u00a0\"hacking our brains\" to find the maximum price we'll accept.",
      "The legal risks are still emerging. While price variation based on demand or timing is not new, using AI for ultra-personalized pricing raises uncomfortable questions about discrimination and fairness, especially since prior research suggests that poorer customers often receive the worst deals.",
      "Passengers sitting on a plane\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "Delta says it does not tailor prices based on your digital footprint. You won't be charged more because you searched twice or booked from a certain device. Instead, prices respond to broader factors like how many seats are left, the time of day, and demand on that route.",
      "That said, airfares will likely feel even more unpredictable. Shopping around is now a must. Quick decisions might save you money, but waiting could result in a price increase.",
      "A VPN may still help you hide your location, but Delta states that its pricing does not vary by personal data like IP or browser history. Still, comparing prices across platforms and booking early remain smart moves.",
      "Privacy matters more than ever, not because Delta is watching you, but because digital tools are transforming how industries think about pricing. In short, you still have power as a consumer. Be smart, be flexible, and always compare before making a purchase.",

      "If your electricity bill seems shockingly high, you're not imagining it. A big part of the spike is being driven by rising artificial intelligence electricity demand.",
      "PJM Interconnection, the largest power grid operator in the United States, says electricity usage is climbing sharply this summer. Some areas may see bills increase by as much as 20%. One of the main drivers behind this trend is the growing power consumption from data centers that support AI systems like ChatGPT and other generative tools.",

It manages a vast and complex network of power distribution. This summer, the grid is showing signs of strain.",
      "In just the past year, data centers running AI have started using much more electricity. These centers can consume up to 30 times more power than traditional data centers. Most of them are connected to the same grid that serves homes and businesses, which means the cost of that power growth is shared by everyone.",

      "Between 2024 and 2025, electricity demand from AI and data centers in the PJM region contributed to a $9 billion increase in power costs. PJM expects peak usage this summer to reach over 154,000 megawatts, with the potential to exceed all-time records during heat waves or emergencies.",
      "AI data center needing high energy demands\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why electricity prices are rising across the U.S.",
      "While demand is rising quickly, the power supply is not keeping up with the pace. Many fossil fuel plants are shutting down due to state regulations, aging infrastructure or market conditions. More than 9,000 megawatts of coal capacity will retire or convert to gas in 2025 alone.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Clean energy options like wind and solar are often the cheapest ways to add new power, but developers are struggling with permitting delays, rising costs and a loss of federal incentives. For example, the 30% federal solar tax credit for homeowners will end after 2025. That change is already slowing down new installations.",

      "How AI is increasing your electric bill",
      "Even if you never use AI tools yourself, you are still likely paying for their growth. The cost of expanding the data center's power supply is spread across all grid users, including regular households.",
      "PJM customers have been warned to expect electric bills to increase by $25 or more per month. Commercial users may see prices climb nearly 30%.",
      "To help prevent rolling blackouts, PJM is rolling out demand response programs that pay large businesses to temporarily reduce their electricity use during periods of extreme demand. Still, if electricity usage exceeds 166,000 megawatts, some regions may not have enough reserve power to maintain reliability.",

      "Tips to avoid falling for Microsoft phishing scams",
      "1. Think before you click: Always check the sender\u2019s email and hover over links before clicking. If the message looks suspicious, do not click the link. Instead, go directly to your Microsoft account using a trusted browser.",
      "2. Only approve 2FA requests you initiate: Even if a scammer gets your password, 2FA can stop them from getting into your account. Just ensure that you only approve login requests that you\u2019ve personally initiated. If you get a random prompt on your phone or authentication app, do not approve it.",
      "3. Report phishing emails: Use Outlook\u2019s built-in tools to report suspicious messages as phishing. You can also forward them to Microsoft at reportphishing@microsoft.com.",
      "4. Use strong antivirus software: Consider using strong antivirus software with built-in phishing and link protection to catch threats before they reach you. Stay vigilant when it comes to emails, phone calls, or messages from unknown sources asking for personal information. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or providing sensitive details unless you can verify the legitimacy of the request. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "For the best antivirus protection in 2025, visit\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech.",
      "5. Never share sensitive info: Microsoft will never ask for your password, 2FA code, or payment details via email. If you\u2019re unsure, log in directly from a browser to check.",
      "6. Consider personal data removal services: After phishing attempts, your data may end up circulating among data brokers, increasing your risk of future scams and identity theft. Data removal services can help reduce the visibility of your personal information by submitting removal requests to dozens of people-search and broker sites. This limits how easily scammers and spammers can find and target you.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Fake Microsoft alerts are carefully crafted to appear genuine, which is why it\u2019s crucial to remain cautious. Always verify messages through official channels, avoid clicking suspicious links, and report anything that doesn\u2019t seem right. A few extra seconds of caution can help protect your account and your personal data.",

This setup delivers precise environmental awareness for everything from highway cruising to close-range maneuvers.",

Tesla's Full Self-Driving and GM's Super Cruise both offer hands-free driving on highways, though they differ in how they monitor driver attention and what roads they support.

With hands-off driving now available on select highways, those stressful commutes can feel a little easier. Sitting in stop-and-go traffic doesn't have to be such a chore anymore. Long road trips? Suddenly, they're much more comfortable. Many automakers, not just Lucid, are pushing out updates directly to your car, so you can access new tools without ever stepping into a service center.",
      "Safety is at the forefront with these new systems. As you drive, a network of sensors and smart software helps keep your lane changes smooth, your following distances steady and your ride free from abrupt surprises. These advances can give you peace of mind, but it's essential to remember that these systems don't drive for you. You still need to stay alert and keep your hands ready.",
      "With more cars using similar technology each year, the roads themselves are changing. There's hope that fewer accidents caused by distraction or delayed reactions will benefit not just tech-savvy drivers, but everyone out there. While these models, like the Lucid Air, showcase what's possible, the real transformation comes as driver-assistance features become the new normal in cars everywhere.",

Antivirus software and firewalls cannot fix all of these problems. A VPN offers a powerful layer of protection by encrypting your traffic, hiding your activity, and making your connection truly private.

      "In a Tuesday filing in Manhattan federal court, officials disclosed the Epstein grand jury heard testimony from an FBI agent when it met in June and July 2019. The same FBI agent, along with a New York Police Department detective, also testified in front of the Maxwell grand jury in June and July 2020, and again in March 2021, according to court documents.",

      "\"First, push as much as it can for separating Gazans from Hamas through designated humanitarian zones,\" he said. \"That will also lead to control over humanitarian aid, so that it doesn\u2019t reach Hamas. And second, since it is estimated that hostage locations are known \u2013 we must conduct local negotiations with those holding the hostages. Offer money and their lives in exchange for the hostages.\"",

For several reasons,\" he reportedly said. \"One, Hamas benefits from dragging things out. It continues to hold the key to its survival, and in the meantime, who knows what could happen? European pressure, a false starvation campaign, Trump might flip on Israel, internal pressure on the government. All of these, and each on its own, are good for them.\"",

      "\"I\u2019m not sure that Qatar, the mediator, even has the ability to decide anything. And it\u2019s not even certain they have communication with Hamas\u2019s internal leadership for consultations and decision-making,\" Amrusi said. \"It\u2019s important to ask: is there anyone in Hamas' Gaza who can make decisions? Who has control over those holding the hostages? Do they even know where they are, and what condition they\u2019re in? After all, some of the hostages aren\u2019t even in their hands.\"",
      "\"I\u2019ve always said Hamas will release the hostages when we force them to release them,\" he continued, \"but we don\u2019t know how to do that. Military pressure isn\u2019t being applied to its full extent, and our soldiers\u2019 hands are pretty tied.

      "Inspired by President Donald Trump\u2019s leadership style, Kamiya\u2019s rise has largely been attributed to his social media savvy. He snagged his earliest followers through his opposition to \"blanket mask mandates, mass PCR testing, and vaccine requirements\" during the COVID-19 pandemic, Japan Forward reported.",
      "Kamiya has also adopted a spin-off of Trump\u2019s MAGA motto, proclaiming \"Japanese first\" as his party promises to strengthen Japan\u2019s culture, birth rates and food sufficiency, while finding solutions for its reliance on immigration.",
      "Though the Western media has characterized Kamiya as far-right, fringe or xenophobic, Lance Gatling, a principal at Nexial Research, Tokyo, told Fox News Digital that while Kamiya\u2019s goals of \"protecting Japan, growing Japan, and educating Japan\" are \"fairly populist,\" they do not represent \"a radical move towards the right wing.\"",
      "In fact, Gatling said many in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has dominated Japanese politics for decades, \"are more right-wing than Sanseit\u014d.\" Gatling described members of Kamiya\u2019s party as \"pretty reasonable.\"",

      "Some critics have expressed particular concern over what they call Kamiya\u2019s anti-immigration stance. Immigration, however, has become a chief issue for the island nation. When former President Joe Biden called Japan \"xenophobic\" for failing to increase immigration in May 2024, Kamiya responded on social media. \"It\u2019s not that we\u2019re xenophobic, we are being cautious after seeing your failures,\" Kamiya said. \"You are meddling too much in our internal affairs.\"",
      "Gatling says categorizing the Japanese as xenophobic \"just doesn\u2019t ring true.\" He explained that the country has \"one of the most astonishing cultures in history,\" formed by adopting Western culture and enriching it to create \"a completely unique culture that has tremendous appeal around the world.\"",

      "Another possible friction point in the future might be Sanseit\u014d\u2019s desire to turn the nation\u2019s farmers into public sector employees, Gatling admitted. \"The agriculture bloc is one of the most powerful in the LDP,\" he explained. \"I\u2019m not sure how many of the farmers want to be public sector employees.\"",
      "While he says that it is too early to determine the future of Sanseit\u014d in Japanese politics, Gatling said Kamiya has stated he is not \"interested in building a coalition government.\" Gatling believes the party\u2019s future will hinge on preparations for subsequent elections and demonstrating that \"they have reasonable policies.\"",
      "Chang said Sanseit\u014d\u2019s win was a loss for the LDP, which he says has \"been adrift\" since Abe\u2019s 2020 resignation and subsequent 2022 assassination. Current Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba \"is weak and unpopular,\" and the LDP now finds itself \"in the minority in both houses of the Diet for the first time since the party was formed in 1955,\" Chang said. \"Ishiba is naturally catching the blame.\"",

He's going to continue to push Putin to return to the bargaining table and negotiate in good faith, not come to the bargaining table, make promises that the Russians don't plan on keeping,\" Fred Fleitz, who served as a deputy assistant to Trump and chief of staff of the National Security Council during the president\u2019s first term, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"That's something Trump's not going to tolerate,\" Fleitz added. \"We will see this is just the first six months of the Trump presidency. This may take a couple of years to solve.\"",
      "But Trump campaigned on ending the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, which has proven to be more complicated than he suggested from the campaign trail. And not everyone in the Republican Party has backed his approach when it comes to Europe, including a staunch Trump supporter, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.",
      "\"We do not want to give or sell weapons to Ukraine or be involved in any foreign wars or continue the never-ending flow of foreign aid,\" Greene said on X. \"We want to solve our own problems plaguing our own people.\"",

      "\"He looked at the intelligence and realized it was getting too close, and he decided to adjust his policy, which was first diplomacy,\" Fleitz said.",
      "\"But Trump also specified something very important. He said to his supporters, 'I came up with a concept of the America-first approach to U.S. national security, and I decide what's in it,\" Fleitz added. \"He has ownership of this approach, and he will adjust if necessary.\"",

      "\"Putin will continue his unprovoked war so long as he believes it\u2019s sustainable and offers a pathway to achieving his goals,\" Hardie argued. \"By shoring up Ukraine\u2019s defense of its skies and enabling Ukraine to inflict growing costs on Russia\u2019s war machine, as well as pressuring the Russian economy and exhausting Russia\u2019s offensive potential on the ground, we may be able to change that calculus.\"",

      "Russian authorities have called the latest quake a \u201cremarkable event.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhen I first saw it was 8.8, I must admit, I thought, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going back to maybe Japan,\u2019\u201d he said, referring to the 2011 earthquake that triggered a huge tsunami, killing more than 20,000 people and causing a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.",
      "Now referred to as the \u201cGreat Tohoku Earthquake,\u201d it had a magnitude of 9.1, the fourth most powerful ever recorded. The waves from that tsunami reached as high as 130 feet, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, hitting the coast at a height of about 50 feet.",
      "\u201cAt the present time, it seems quite anomalous. 8.8 magnitude generating a 4-meter tsunami seems very unusual but \u2026 the information on the tsunami impact is still quite limited,\u201d Tappin said, adding that he would have expected a tsunami of at least 10 meters, or about 33 feet.",
      "He said the relatively insignificant damage reported so far could be due to the remoteness of the epicenter and the effectiveness of the warning systems.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me that the warning system kicked in, and warnings were given in Japan initially, Hawaii and off the West Coast of the U.S. So it just demonstrates the importance of having these warning systems,\u201d Tappin said. \u201cIn this instance, perhaps the tsunami wasn\u2019t large, but it saves people\u2019s lives.\u201d",
      "The fifth-strongest earthquake ever recorded, a 9.0 tremor, also hit the Kamchatka region in 1952. Its epicenter was less than 19 miles from this one. In that disaster, the waves reached up to 50 feet and killed at least 1,790 people, with some historians putting the death toll as high as 8,000, according to the Russian Military Historical Society.",
      "The region has experienced nearly 700 earthquakes with magnitudes over 5.0 since 1990, according to the USGS.",
      "The most powerful earthquake ever recorded was the magnitude-9.5 \u201cValdivia\u201d or \u201cGreat Chilean\u201d earthquake, which hit central Chile in 1960, killing more than 1,600 people and leaving 2 million homeless.",
      "One of the world\u2019s most deadly earthquakes was the third most powerful ever recorded, which struck off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, on Boxing Day in 2004. The 9.1-magnitude quake triggered massive tsunamis reaching up to 100 feet and killed an estimated 280,000 people."

      "A Texas man has been charged with murder in the killing of an Afghan father who spent years fighting alongside U.S. Green Berets in Afghanistan.",
      "The suspect, Katia Trevon Bougere, 31, was charged with shooting Abdul Rahman Waziri, also 31, in a dispute over parking in Houston. But Bougere hasn\u2019t been arrested. Instead, he received a summons to appear in court next week, as if it were a traffic violation.",
      "It\u2019s the latest bizarre turn in a case that has sparked protests in Houston and prompted Green Berets to write letters to public officials demanding justice for their fallen former comrade.",
      "\u201cThis indictment is just the beginning of the justice the Waziri family deserves,\u201d said their attorney, Omar Khawaja.",
      "\u201cA husband and father was senselessly killed, and while we are grateful the grand jury returned a murder charge, it is outrageous that the man accused of taking his life is being allowed to appear by summons \u2014 not arrested, not handcuffed, not treated like the violent offender he is alleged to be.\u201d",
      "Asked why prosecutors didn\u2019t issue an arrest warrant, a spokeswoman for the Harris County district attorney\u2019s office responded with a brief statement.",
      "\u201cAfter a grand jury indicted the defendant, the clerk\u2019s office issued a summons and he\u2019s required to appear in court,\u201d the statement read.",
      "Efforts to reach Bougere were not successful, and it was not immediately clear if he had hired an attorney.",
      "For five years, Waziri served in an elite unit tasked with helping to protect Green Berets in Afghanistan. He made it to the U.S. in 2021 and settled in Houston with his wife and two young daughters, only to be gunned down outside his apartment complex, Houston police said.",
      "The gunman spoke to police officers at the scene but was let go without being charged, police said. Three months passed with no updates from law enforcement officials. But on Monday, a Houston grand jury returned an indictment charging Bougere with felony murder, according to a copy obtained by NBC News.",
      "The charging documents include a \u201crequest for summons\u201d that calls on Bougere to appear in court at 9 a.m. next Tuesday, Aug. 5.",
      "\u201cFailure to appear will result in a warrant being issued for your arrest,\u201d it states.",
      "David Kwok, an associate professor of law at the University of Houston Law Center, said state law allows for prosecutors to request a summons rather than an arrest warrant even for people accused of murder and other violent crimes. But it was unclear to him why the Harris County district attorney\u2019s office would make such a decision in this case.",
      "\u201cIt certainly provokes a lot of questions,\u201d he said.",
      "Eddie Cortes, a veteran defense attorney in Houston who has no connection to this case, said it is an unusual course of action but it typically comes down to whether the defendant has hired a lawyer who is known to prosecutors.",
      "\"They're not going to do this with somebody who is just Joe Blow off the street,\" said Cortes. \"But they will if the guy has counsel, and he's a well-respected longtime defense attorney here in town.\"",
      "Bougere hails from the Los Angeles area, according to online records, and he competed in the high jump at Lynwood High School.",
      "In 2020, he filed paperwork in Texas to launch a company called Black Kartier Militia LLC, according to state records. No other information was immediately available.",
      "The fatal shooting took place on the evening of April 27. Just before 9:10 p.m., Waziri drove into the parking lot of his apartment complex and hopped out of his Toyota Camry, according to surveillance footage provided to NBC News by the family\u2019s attorney.",
      "A man pulled up in a car behind his vehicle, leading to a confrontation that ended with Waziri lying on the ground, with multiple gunshot wounds.",
      "The surveillance footage did not capture the shooting or the moments beforehand, but the other man was seen calmly walking away afterward.",
      "Waziri was unarmed at the time, according to Khawaja, his family\u2019s lawyer.",
      "Houston police said in a statement that responding officers were approached at the scene by a man who identified himself as the shooter and said he and Waziri were \u201carguing over parking.\u201d Officers interviewed the man and took possession of his gun but then let him go.",
      "The spokeswoman for the district attorney\u2019s office told NBC News in May that prosecutors were waiting for additional information from investigators before deciding whether to bring charges.",
      "Abdullah Khan, Waziri\u2019s brother, said that he was \u201cvery happy\u201d with the grand jury\u2019s decision, but that he doesn\u2019t understand why it took so long for the suspect to be charged.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really strange to me,\u201d Khan said. \u201cWhy did they not do this already with the evidence they had?\u201d"

      "The panel reached its verdict on the second day of deliberations. They found Craig guilty of several other counts, including solicitation to commit murder.",

      "He was acquitted of just one charge \u2014 manslaughter.",
      "In closing arguments Tuesday in Arapahoe County District Court in Centennial, prosecutor Michael Mauro said Craig, a father of six, killed his wife after having cheated on her for most of their 23 years together and developed a fatal plot to escape their marriage.",

      "Authorities highlighted Craig\u2019s online search history \u2014 he sought information about whether arsenic was detectable in an autopsy \u2014 and his online purchases. Weeks before his wife\u2019s death, James Craig ordered potassium cyanide from Amazon and had it delivered to his dental practice, according to an affidavit in support of an arrest warrant.",

      "\u201cIf he wants to get divorced, she\u2019s serving it up to him on a silver platter,\u201d he said.",

      "Angela Craig's protein shakes, Mauro said, became his murder weapon.",

Trump said earlier this week in Scotland that Israel \"has a lot of responsibility for flow of aid,\" emphasizing that its government could greatly expand access to food.",

      "\u201cPalestinians in Gaza are enduring a humanitarian catastrophe of epic proportions,\" U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said in a statement Tuesday in response to the news about a famine unfolding. \"This is not a warning. It is a reality unfolding before our eyes. The trickle of aid must become an ocean. Food, water, medicine, and fuel must flow in waves and without obstruction.\u201d",
      "Trump has been more outspoken this week about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, telling reporters Monday during his trip to Scotland that the U.S. was \"going to get a lot of money to the area so they can get some food.\"",
      "\"We can save a lot of people,\" Trump said. \"I mean, some of those kids are \u2014 that\u2019s real starvation stuff, I see it, and you can\u2019t fake that.\u201d",
      "Trump had mentioned the idea of the U.S. setting up \"food centers\" in Gaza, which he said would be done \"in conjunction with some very good people\" where \"people can walk in\" and there would be \"no boundaries.\"",
      "On Sunday, Israel announced a \"tactical pause\" in military operations in Gaza and since then, more than 320 trucks of aid have been collected and distributed by the United Nations and international organizations and at least 260 trucks were in Gaza, awaiting collection and distribution, according to the Israel Defense Forces, citing its COGAT unit that coordinates logisticis. Also, 48 aid packages have been airdropped in coordination with the United Arab Emirates and Jordan.",

While running for governor wouldn't technically preclude her from entering the presidential fray, the limits a statewide campaign would have imposed on Harris were a consideration.",
      "\u201cThis does keep the door open for 2028,\" one of the people close to her said.\u2028The person said Harris came to the decision after months of conversations.",

She then replaced Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee in 2024 after he dropped out of the race.",
      "A third person close to Harris who spoke with her Wednesday said Harris looked forward to talking to Californians and people across the country about this moment, but as a private citizen. They insisted that Harris had a path to victory if she had run for governor.",
      "\u201cStay tuned because she\u2019s going to have other announcements and they\u2019re not about 2028,\" that person said.",
      "\u201cShe still wants to be part of the national conversation and talk about Donald Trump and being in debates and forums in California is not going to allow her to do that,\" the person added.",
      "Harris' decision keeps the race to be California's next governor wide open. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who came up through San Francisco politics alongside Harris, is unable run for re-election due to term limits.",
      "A number of Democrats have jumped into the race to succeed Newsom, including Lt. Gov Eleni Kounalakis; former Health and Human Services Secretary and state Attorney General Xavier Becerra; former Rep. Katie Porter; former state Senate President Toni Atkins, and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, among others.",

      "The government filed an unopposed motion on Tuesday to dismiss a case against Wiederhorn as well as William Amon, Rebecca Hershinger and Fat Brands, Inc., which alleged a scheme to conceal $47 million paid to Wiederhorn. The government also filed a separate motion to dismiss a case against Wiederhorn in which he was charged with possessing a firearm and ammunition despite his previous felony convictions.",

    "story": [
      "Texas Republicans on Wednesday released a proposed new congressional map that would give the GOP a path to picking up five seats in next year\u2019s midterm elections.",
      "The proposal, which follows President Donald Trump's public pressing for a new map in the state, shifts district lines in ways that target current Democratic members of Congress in districts in and around Austin, Dallas and Houston, as well as two already endangered Democrats representing South Texas districts that Trump carried in 2024.",
      "If enacted, the proposal could have a major effect on the battle for control of the House of Representatives in 2026. Republicans hold a slim, 3-seat advantage in the House right now, but this map could add extra padding as they seek to keep the House for the final two years of Trump's presidency. In Texas, they already control 25 of the 38 congressional districts.",
      "In a sign of how carefully the new lines are drawn to maximize the GOP's standing, Trump in 2024 would have carried 30 out of 38 seats on this new map, none by a single-digit margin. Democratic voters are packed into 8 pro-Harris districts, only one of which had a 2024 presidential margin under 20 percentage points",
      "The proposed map was filed by state Rep. Todd Hunter, who represents a coastal area in southeastern Texas and is a member of the state House Select Committee on Congressional Redistricting created last week as part of the special legislative session called by Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott."

      "Severe flu seasons in recent years have brought to light a little-known danger of influenza infections in kids: a rare brain disease called acute necrotizing encephalopathy, or ANE.",
      "It\u2019s a fast-moving condition usually triggered by the flu, causing  sudden brain swelling. It\u2019s thought that the virus prompts the immune system to go haywire.",
      "Affected children can go from having mild flu symptoms to seizures, coma or even death within days. Most are kids without any other health problems.",
      "Historically, the inflammatory disease is diagnosed in just a handful of children each year. But this past January and February, pediatric neurologists began to see an unusual uptick in ANE cases \u2014 and started comparing notes.",
      "Dr. Molly Wilson-Murphy, a pediatric neurologist at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, said, \u201cWe were reaching out to colleagues across the country and saying, \u2018Hey, are you seeing this?\u2019 and very briskly getting responses back from a number of folks saying, \u2018Yes, us, too.\u2019\u201d",
      "The collaboration led to the first large, multicenter look at ANE cases in the U.S. Wilson-Murphy is one of more than 60 physicians who published their data Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.",
      "The doctors identified 41 cases over the past two flu seasons. Most children were around age 5.",
      "Brain inflammation was swift and severe in many cases. Eleven children (27%) died within three days, usually because of a buildup of pressure in their brain tissue.",
      "Children who were able to survive for at least three months often had long-lasting complications, such as trouble walking, eating and ongoing seizures.",
      "Because ANE is so rare, there\u2019s no specific treatment protocol. Most of the 41 children in the new study received steroids, antiviral medications, intravenous immunoglobulin or a plasma exchange, which is like dialysis.",
      "Reasons for the increase in ANE cases are not known. But the report comes after the U.S. has experienced one of the deadliest flu seasons for kids on record: 266 pediatric flu deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At least three of those children died in June and July of this year, far outside of the typical flu season.",
      "Until now, there\u2019s been no official tally of ANE cases. The CDC began to track them in February after hearing anecdotal reports from the study authors.",
      "The CDC\u2019s Dr. Timothy Uyeki wrote an editorial accompanying the new study.",
      "\u201cFrom the public health perspective, implementation of multiyear national surveillance\u201d is necessary, Uyeki wrote, to understand how often ANE occurs and whether some children have specific risk factors.",
      "Why flu shots are important for kids",
      "Study authors emphasized the importance of annual flu shots for kids. Just six of the 41 children with ANE had been vaccinated.",
      "It\u2019s especially critical for kids who\u2019ve already had ANE because they\u2019re at risk for getting it again with a subsequent influenza infection, Wilson-Murphy of Boston Children\u2019s Hospital said.",
      "Fewer kids are getting flu shots in general.",
      "During the 2023-2024 season, just over half of kids, 55%, got the vaccine \u2014 the lowest rate in more than a decade.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s possible that\u2019s playing a small role in this bump in cases,\u201d said study co-author Dr. Keith Van Haren, a pediatric neurologist at Stanford Medicine in Palo Alto, California. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t account for all of it, though.\u201d",
      "And among the 266 children who died of flu this past year, 90% hadn\u2019t been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC.",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends all children 6 months or older get an annual flu shot, ideally by the end of October.",
      "Young children who\u2019ve never had the shot may need two doses, about a month apart.",
      "ANE warning signs",
      "In early stages, ANE resembles typical flu symptoms. Children tend to have high fevers \u2014 103 degrees on average \u2014 as well as a sore throat, cough and vomiting or diarrhea.",
      "Within about two days after symptoms begin, doctors say there is a marked difference in kids\u2019 mental status. They may have seizures and become unusually weak and tired.",
      "The behavior is different from the typical lethargy associated with flu, Wilson-Murphy said. Affected children don\u2019t perk up, even after ibuprofen or acetaminophen. They\u2019re not making sense and can\u2019t interact meaningfully.",
      "\u201cYou get that \u2018mom gut\u2019 feeling that something isn\u2019t right,\u201d she said. \u201cParents should listen to their intuition and get their kids checked out as soon as they feel like something is off, neurologically.\u201d"

      "More than a decade before the Black Sabbath frontman\u2019s family confirmed his death at the age of 76 on July 22, Osbourne had been asked his thoughts on funeral plans.",
      "In a Dear Ozzy column for The Times in 2011, one person asked if it was \u201ctoo morbid to plan your own funeral? Or is it a thoughtful gift for your surviving relatives?\u201d",
      "Osbourne's reply indicated that he would very much like it to be a joyful moment.",
      "\u201cI honestly don\u2019t care what they play at my funeral; they can put on a medley of Justin Bieber, Susan Boyle and We Are the Diddymen if it makes \u2019em happy,\u201d Osbourne replied, before noting, \u201cbut I do want to make sure it\u2019s a celebration, not a mope-fest.\u201d",

      "Answering the person, he continued, \u201cSo to answer your question, yes, a bit of planning is the right thing to do for the family you leave behind.\u201d",
      "He noted that \u201cit\u2019s worth remembering that a lot of people see nothing but misery their whole lives. So by any measure, most of us in this country \u2014 especially rock stars like me \u2014 are very lucky.\u201d",
      "The Prince of Darkness, as he was nicknamed, concluded, \u201cThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t want my funeral to be sad. I want it to be a time to say \u2018thanks.\u2019\u201d",

    "summary": "Why is Sydney Sweeney's new ad campaign with American Eagle sparking controversy? Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Sydney Sweeney's recent partnership with American Eagle Outfitters has generated substantial online criticism.",
      "The ad campaign, which focuses on the company\u2019s new line of denim products, is centered around the tagline \u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans\" \u2014 and people have a lot to say about the slogan's messaging.",
      "Chatter surrounding the collaboration has added the brand to a growing list of companies experiencing \u201cmeme stock\u201d booms, CNBC reported, or a stock that gains popularity through social media. After the initiative debuted, shares of the company\u2019s stock jumped more than 4%.",
      "So, why are people talking about the ad? Here is everything you need to know.",
      "What do the Sydney Sweeney ads for American Eagle depict?",
      "In American Eagle\u2019s fall campaign, Sydney Sweeney shows off the company\u2019s latest collection of denim.",
      "Videos from the promotion focus on the \u201cEuphoria\u201d and \u201cAnyone But You\u201d star's denim-clad body as she lounges with a puppy, fixes a car and buttons up a pair of over-sized jeans.",
      "\u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans,\u201d the campaign\u2019s slogan booms at the end of each clip as a play on the words \u201cgenes\u201d and \u201cjeans.\u201d",
      "The ads play up the homophone \"good jeans\" and \"good genes.\"",
      "\u201cGenes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My genes are blue,\u201d Sweeney says in one ad as the camera pans her body while she buttons a pair of jeans.",
      "Another print ad spells out, \u201cSydney Sweeney has great genes,\u201d but crosses out the \u201cgenes\u201d and writes in \u201cjeans.\u201d",
      "The collection features over 200 fits of jeans and over 50 new styles. In the campaign announcement, President and Executive Creative Director at American Eagle explains Sweeney\u2019s role in the ad.",
      "\u201cWith Sydney Sweeney front and center, she brings the allure, and we add the flawless wardrobe for the winning combo of ease, attitude and a little mischief,\u201d the announcement reads.",
      "Why is the ad campaign causing controversy?",
      "The campaign has stirred up mixed opinions on the internet, raising questions about its intent and implications.",
      "For some, the campaign\u2019s central messaging about genes uphold outdated and harmful standards of beauty, and even promote eugenic ideals.",
      "Eugenics is an evolutionary theory aimed to select \u201cdesired heritable characteristics in order to improve future generations,\u201d according to Encyclopedia Britannica. The movement has a long history, but in the U.S., it historically used \"genetic superiority\" as justification for white supremacy.",
      "The ad\u2019s messaging surrounding \u201cgood genes\u201d feels like a wink to eugenic ideals.",
      "\u201cThem choosing \u2018Sydney Sweeney has great genes\u2019 was not an accident,\u201d one user said in a TikTok video that received over one million views. \u201cIt\u2019s a dog whistle towards the rise of people who are wanting to see more people who look like them everywhere.\u201d",
      "A representative for Sweeney declined to comment to NBC News. American Eagle did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Cheryl Overton, Chief Experience Officer at integrated marketing communications firm Cheryl Overton Communications, says context is important. The promotion \u201cdoesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum,\u201d she says. Instead, it occurs in \u201ca country actively grappling with social standards rooted in whiteness.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe subtext isn\u2019t imagined; it\u2019s rooted in centuries-old narrative about one archetype of beauty that is seen as genetically superior or \u2018aspirational,\u201d Overton tells TODAY.com.",
      "While the ad never references race, Hillary Herskowitz, CEO and Founder of H2 Marketing Group, tells TODAY.com there is \u201cno denying\u201d that the phrase \u201ccarries historical baggage.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you pair that kind of wordplay with a blond, blue-eyed actress, it can unintentionally reinforce narrow, Eurocentric beauty standards,\u201d she adds.",
      "Whether this implication is purposeful is up for debate.",
      "Overton says the messaging could be the result of a \u201cblind spot of a team lacking cultural fluency\u201d or a \u201cbrand looking actively to cull consumers who value diversity from its base.\u201d",
      "Herskowitz sees the ad as being designed to provoke a reaction.",
      "\u201cIntentional,\u201d Herskowitz says. \u201cThat line \u2014 \u2018good jeans\u2019 \u2014 is too perfectly constructed not to be. It was designed to be cheeky, playful and buzzworthy. The creative team knew exactly what they were doing.\"",
      "Adrienne Alexander, owner of the PR firm IPY Agency, points out the extensive process campaigns like this go through, and says multiple teams likely signed off on the language.",
      "\u201cCampaigns like this go through many hands, including creative, legal, PR, and brand strategy, so it\u2019s unlikely that no one flagged the potential issue. More likely, the team underestimated the reaction or saw it as a playful pun rather than a loaded phrase. Either way, the responsibility remains the same: if you spark a conversation, be prepared to own it and respond accordingly,\u201d she says.",
      "The ad has also garnered criticism for sexualizing Sweeney. Some say the ad\u2019s close-up shots of the actor seem to objectify her and cater to the male gaze.",
      "\u201cAre we selling jeans to women or selling women in jeans to men?\u201d one user commented on American Eagle\u2019s Instagram.",
      "The limited edition Sydney Jean, produced with Sweeney, has a butterfly motif on the back pocket representing domestic violence awareness, per a press release from the company, and the entirety of the purchase price will be donated to the Crisis Text Line.",
      "Marketing professor Melissa Murphy calls the juxtaposition of the sexual nature of the ads, plus the domestic violence tie-in, \"mismatched\" tonally.",
      "Some viewers have also pointed out that the ad feels reminiscent of a controversial Calvin Klein campaign from 1980 featuring a teenage Brooke Shields.",
      "\u201cYou want to know what comes in between me and my Calvins? Nothing,\u201d the then 15-year-old model said in the ad as the camera panned her entire body.",
      "The moment caused an uproar for holding sexual implications and taking advantage of the young star. Shields later spoke out about the moment, saying she was unaware of the ad\u2019s meaning.",
      "Like the Calvin Klein ad, which Klein once said put the company on the map, American Eagle has seen increased chatter following the campaign\u2019s debut.",
      "According to Herskowitz, controversy can \u201cdrive brand momentum.\u201d But was the controversy intentional?",
      "Murphy, doubts it, and so calls the ad campaign, and its lack of diversity, a \u201cmiss.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey should have done (the ad) with multiple people \u2014 that would definitely resonate better,\u201d she says. \u201cIf there isn\u2019t more, and this is just it, then that\u2019s not a good sign.\u201d"

I\u2019ve come a lot further in the last four years than perhaps I could have bargained for,\u201d Cody said in a 2024 post-race interview. \u201cStarting from zero and trying to see how far I could get in half or a third of the time that everybody else has been training, just to do right by that kid in me that gave it up to go and pursue something else, which I had an incredible journey.\u201d",

      "Jamie Lee Curtis' words of wisdom have stood the test of time for Lindsay Lohan.",
      "The two Hollywood stars, who first worked together as the iconic mother-daughter duo in the 2003 film \"Freaky Friday,\" attended the TODAY Show Radio Town Hall on SiriusXM July 28 to talk about their upcoming sequel, \"Freakier Friday.\"",
      "During the event, moderator Hoda Kotb asked Lohan what her first impression of Curtis was while filming the original movie.",
      "Lohan recalled a piece of advice the \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" star gave her during the first day on set.",
      "\"One thing Jamie said to me that sticks with me whenever I go to set \u2014 the first thing I think about and will always keep with me \u2014 is that she said, 'Remember, when you go to your set, however you show up that day is the way that everyone else is going to feel on that set. So always bring a positive energy, positive mindset, positive attitude to the people that you work with,'\" she said.",
      "Lohan, who was a teenager when she starred and appeared in \"Freaky Friday,\" said the advice proved to be \"so important\" as she went on to star in films like \"Mean Girls\" and \"Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen.\"",

      "Before one of its planes crashed just after takeoff last month, killing at least 260 people, Air India had been a symbol of the country\u2019s global rise.",
      "Only two years earlier, chief executive Campbell Wilson had inaugurated a brand-new Airbus A350, Air India\u2019s first, calling it \u201ca declaration of Indian aviation\u2019s resurgence on the world stage.\u201d",
      "The aircraft\u2019s delivery made headlines across the country, where the public cheered Air India\u2019s transformation from a neglected state-owned flagship carrier into a modern airline that its new owners, the Tata Group, hoped would become the world\u2019s biggest.",
      "Under the Indian conglomerate, which founded the airline in 1932  and bought it back in 2022 after it spent decades under government operation, Air India was making big moves, announcing a record order in 2023 of 470 aircraft valued at more than $70 billion.",
      "A year later, the airline said it had begun a $400 million retrofit of its legacy fleet, accelerating the upgrade by leasing jets from other airlines, including Delta.",
      "That momentum came to a grinding halt last month when a London-bound Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed seconds after takeoff in the northwestern Indian city of Ahmedabad, killing all but one of the 242 people aboard plus 19 others on the ground in one of India\u2019s worst aviation disasters.",
      "Air India has since been under immense pressure to answer for the crash, but bereaved families were left with more questions after investigators released a preliminary report this month that said the plane\u2019s fuel switches had been wrongly cut off, leading to speculation that one of the pilots might have done it accidentally or even intentionally.",
      "Indian investigators and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, which is involved in the crash investigation as the aircraft is U.S.-made, said such conclusions were irresponsible.",

      "But Indian commentators were already irate.",
      "\u201cWhy do this rumor mill mongering about possible problems with the pilot?\u201d Arnab Goswami, a firebrand anchor, said on his conservative Republic Media Network. \u201cSo that across the world the impression goes that Indian pilots cannot fly?\u201d",
      "Capt. C.S. Randhawa, a former pilot for Air India and the Indian air force, said the suggestion that one of the pilots may have crashed the plane deliberately has \u201cdemoralized the pilots in the country.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll pilots are up in arms, and it\u2019s not a good thing. The pilots have to fly with that mental attitude,\u201d Randhawa, who is currently the president of the Federation of Indian Pilots, told NBC News.",
      "The head of the Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday that the crash did not appear to have been caused by a mechanical issue with the Boeing fuel control unit. The final report is due next year.",
      "On top of the lack of clarity, some British families hoping to bury their loved ones said they had received the remains of the wrong people, according to the Daily Mail, which cited a lawyer representing them. The Indian foreign ministry said Wednesday that all remains were being handled with \u201cutmost professionalism\u201d and that it was working closely with the British side to address concerns.",
      "Air India was also warned last week by India\u2019s aviation regulator that it could face enforcement action over more than two dozen safety violations from this year and last year, Reuters reported, citing government notices. They include pilots not being given mandatory rest and poor compliance with simulator training requirements.",
      "The airline, which voluntarily disclosed the problems last month, said Friday that it would respond to the regulator and that it \u201cremains fully committed to ensuring the safety of its passengers and staff.\u201d",
      "Air India was already under enormous pressure to clean up its reputation after falling into disrepair during its nearly 70 years of government ownership. Its reform nevertheless aligned perfectly with Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s nationalist narrative of turning India into a global superpower.",
      "\u201cGiven its legacy, the brand remains synonymous with India,\u201d said Shelley Vishwajeet, a New Delhi-based aviation journalist and  author of \u201cThe IndiGo Story,\u201d a book about the Indian airline. He added that the cultural transformation within Air India \u201chas been a challenge\u201d for its new owners.",

      "Vistara, which was partly owned by Singapore Airlines, was particularly beloved by Indians, known for its modern planes and best-in-class customer experience. When it merged with Air India, travelers and crew hoped that Air India would be the true Vistara successor.",
      "But Air India has struggled to deliver change as fast as some had hoped.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re struggling with maintenance issues, disrepair issues, and all these things are taking time,\u201d Randhawa said."

      "Publishing their findings in the peer-reviewed scientific journal \u201cBiology Letters,\u201d the team hypothesized that it was killed and eaten or consumed through scavenging by a medium sized caiman, a crocodile-like reptile.",
      "\u201cThis is a fascinating story of the interaction of two very iconic animals in the past,\u201d Andr\u00e9s Link, the study\u2019s lead author, told NBC News in an email Wednesday. \u201cWe actually found not only the first record of a terror bird in northern south America, but the tooth marks of a large caiman that has probably fed on it,\u201d he added.",
      "Terror bird fossils, which are rare, have mostly been identified in the southern part of the continent.",
      "While tooth marks are \u201cnot uncommon\u201d in the fossil record, it\u2019s \u201cexciting\u201d to find evidence that indicates an apex predator being hunted or scavenged by another, said Link, an associate professor of  biological sciences at the Los Andes University in Colombia.",
      "Writing in \u201cBiology Letters,\u201d the team said the teeth marks showed no signs of healing, suggesting that the attack was fatal.",
      "Based on the finding, they added that terror birds might have faced higher risk of being killed and eaten than previously expected.",
      "To identify the attacker, Link and his team scanned the fossil and analyzed the size, shape and spacing of the tooth marks. After comparing those marks with teeth of crocodyliforms from the region, they concluded that the trace maker was likely a juvenile caiman about 15 feet long.",
      "It remains \u201cvery difficult\u201d to know if the caiman ate the terror bird after killing it or whether it scavenged the carcass, Link said. If the bird was alive, it was likely attacked while drinking at a river, researchers wrote, and conversely, if it was dead, the caiman found and fed on its body near water.",
      "\u201cThis story will not be told completely as we have no further evidence to choose between these two hypotheses.\u201d Link said.",
      "The discovery challenges the assumption of \u201ca linear relation between predators feeding on herbivores feeding in plants,\u201d he added. \u201cThe food web is really much more complex.\u201d",
      "The lower part of the bird\u2019s left leg bone used in the study was unearthed in the renowned La Venta fossil beds of Colombia two decades ago by Cesar Perdomo, a local paleontologist."

    "story": [
      "The earthquake that struck Russia\u2019s eastern Kamchatka region and triggered tsunami warnings across the Pacific is among the most powerful temblors to have been recorded in modern history.",
      "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) may revise the magnitude of the earthquake, but if it remains at 8.8, this quake would be tied with the sixth strongest ever, which struck central Chile in 2010, killing more than 500 people and destroying over 370,000 homes.",
      "Russian authorities have called the latest quake a \u201cremarkable event.\u201d",
      "It struck at a depth of an estimated 13 miles, about 74 miles off the coast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, the regional capital on the Kamchatka Peninsula, with a population of 180,000.",
      "Despite its strength, early reports indicate that there have been no deaths or significant damage from the event and that recorded tsunami waves reached a maximum of 9.8 to 13.1 feet in Russia, 4.9 feet in Japan and 5.7 feet in Hawaii.",
      "David Tappin, a principal researcher at the British Geological Survey, said he\u2019s surprised by this.",
      "\u201cWhen I first saw it was 8.8, I must admit, I thought, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going back to maybe Japan,\u2019\u201d he said, referring to the 2011 earthquake that triggered a huge tsunami, killing more than 20,000 people and causing a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.",
      "Now referred to as the \u201cGreat Tohoku Earthquake,\u201d it had a magnitude of 9.1, the fourth most powerful ever recorded. The waves from that tsunami reached as high as 130 feet, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, hitting the coast at a height of about 50 feet.",
      "\u201cAt the present time, it seems quite anomalous. 8.8 magnitude generating a 4-meter tsunami seems very unusual but \u2026 the information on the tsunami impact is still quite limited,\u201d Tappin said, adding that he would have expected a tsunami of at least 10 meters, or about 33 feet.",
      "He said the relatively insignificant damage reported so far could be due to the remoteness of the epicenter and the effectiveness of the warning systems.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me that the warning system kicked in, and warnings were given in Japan initially, Hawaii and off the West Coast of the U.S. So it just demonstrates the importance of having these warning systems,\u201d Tappin said. \u201cIn this instance, perhaps the tsunami wasn\u2019t large, but it saves people\u2019s lives.\u201d",
      "The fifth-strongest earthquake ever recorded, a 9.0 tremor, also hit the Kamchatka region in 1952. Its epicenter was less than 19 miles from this one. In that disaster, the waves reached up to 50 feet and killed at least 1,790 people, with some historians putting the death toll as high as 8,000, according to the Russian Military Historical Society.",
      "The region has experienced nearly 700 earthquakes with magnitudes over 5.0 since 1990, according to the USGS.",
      "The most powerful earthquake ever recorded was the magnitude-9.5 \u201cValdivia\u201d or \u201cGreat Chilean\u201d earthquake, which hit central Chile in 1960, killing more than 1,600 people and leaving 2 million homeless.",
      "One of the world\u2019s most deadly earthquakes was the third most powerful ever recorded, which struck off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, on Boxing Day in 2004. The 9.1-magnitude quake triggered massive tsunamis reaching up to 100 feet and killed an estimated 280,000 people."

      "\u201cBecause there is still the possibility that larger tsunamis may arrive in second or third waves, the tsunami warnings remain in effect,\u201d he said.",
      "In Russia, the first tsunami wave hit the coastal area of Severo-Kurilsk, the main settlement on Russia\u2019s Kuril Islands. Local governor Valery Limarenko said residents were staying on high ground until the threat of a repeat wave was gone.",
      "Russia\u2019s Tass news agency reported from the biggest city near the epicenter, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, that many people ran out into the street without shoes or outerwear.

      "At least 60% of liver cancers could be preventable, according to an analysis published Monday in The Lancet.",
      "Liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the world, with around 870,000 cases in 2022. That\u2019s projected to increase to 1.52 million cases in 2050, the new report found, if no changes are made.",
      "The leading cause of liver cancer is viral infections, including the hepatitis B and C viruses. Hepatitis B infections \u2014 which are preventable with a vaccine \u2014 accounted for 39% of liver cancers in 2022. That\u2019s expected to fall slightly, to 36.9%, by 2025. Hepatitis C accounted for 29.1% of liver cancers in 2022 and is also projected to fall, to 25.9%, by 2050.",
      "The proportions of alcohol- and obesity-related liver cancers, however, are projected to rise in the next 25 years. Alcohol accounted for 18.8% of liver cancers in 2022, and that is expected to increase to 21.1% in 2050. The share of liver cancers caused by obesity-related disease is projected to increase from 8% to 10.8% by 2050 due to increasing rates of obesity, diabetes and high cholesterol and other metabolic risk factors.",
      "Dr. Hashem El-Serag, one of the report\u2019s co-authors and chair of the department of medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said the public usually thinks of alcohol as the biggest risk factor for liver cancer.",
      "\u201cI think for most people, if you say cirrhosis, they immediately think of a relative, of someone who was a heavy drinker,\u201d El-Serag said. \u201cI think the vast majority do not make the tie between MASLD, or fatty liver, and cirrhosis and liver cancer.\u201d",
      "MASLD, or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, affects about 25% of adults in the U.S. It\u2019s caused by a buildup of fat in the liver. About 5% of U.S. adults have a more severe form, called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which can lead to scarring, or cirrhosis, of the liver, significantly increasing the risk of cancer.",
      "Excess alcohol consumption can also lead to cirrhosis.",
      "Liver cancer is still relatively rare in the United States, representing 2.1% of all new cancer diagnoses in 2025. The report estimated that by 2040, U.S. rates of MASLD could more than double, affecting more than 55% of adults.",
      "Detecting liver cancer risk factors",
      "Earlier detection and effective treatment plans for MASLD can reduce the risk of obesity-related liver cancer, El-Serag said. The most common treatment is weight loss. GLP-1 weight loss drugs, which include Ozempic and Wegovy, are promising, he said. (A clinical trial published in April found that Wegovy treated MASH in about two-thirds of patients.)",
      "However, people aren\u2019t screened for MASLD like they are for viral hepatitis, El-Serag said.",
      "Dr. Arun Jesudian, a hepatologist and the director of liver quality and inpatient liver services at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian, said patients are tested for MASLD and/or MASH if they have elevated liver enzymes in their blood.",
      "Raising awareness about MASLD among both patients and doctors can lead to more effective testing and diagnosis, Jesudian said.",
      "\u201cI think then we need to make sure that providers who are interacting with these patients are looking at the liver disease component of metabolic syndrome,\u201d he said, referring to patients with a cluster of conditions including high blood sugar, high blood pressure and excess weight. \u201cSo checking liver enzymes, that they know how to assess for fibrosis, even based on these blood test scores.\u201d",
      "MASLD and MASH can often be asymptomatic, making self-detection more challenging.",
      "\u201cRight now, it\u2019s haphazard. Some people get tested. Others get suspected. Third, who knows?\u201d El-Serag said.",
      "Dr. Neehar Parikh, a hepatologist at the University of Michigan who specializes in liver cancer, said he is seeing more patients with MASLD as a driving factor for liver cancer.",
      "Patients with MASLD can develop liver cancer without developing cirrhosis, making it even more challenging to detect those cases, Parikh said. Up to 40% of those with liver cancers linked to MASLD don\u2019t develop cirrhosis, according to the report.",
      "Figuring out who those patients are is the \u201cmillion-dollar question,\u201d he said. \u201cThose patients that develop MASLD that develop liver cancer, you know, how do you screen that population? We don\u2019t really know what to do.\u201d",
      "Still, Parikh said these types of cases are rare.",
      "Ultimately, Jesudian said, \u201ctreating these liver diseases early is the best way to prevent liver cancer, because liver cancer almost always occurs in the setting of chronic liver disease.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 President Donald Trump said Monday that there was \u201creal starvation\u201d in Gaza, breaking with Israel as the U.S. ally faces intense pressure to lift restrictions on aid with hunger spreading in the besieged enclave.",
      "His comments came amid mounting global outrage over rising deaths from malnutrition under Israel\u2019s military offensive on the territory.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces began limited pauses in fighting in three populated areas of Gaza on Sunday for 10 hours a day. But aid groups have warned the trickle of aid entering the enclave is not enough to stave off famine.",
      "'Those children look very hungry'",
      "Speaking in Scotland, Trump said that the U.S. would set up food centers in Gaza as \u201cwe have to get the kids fed.\u201d He disagreed with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s assessment that there is \u201cno starvation in Gaza.\u201d",
      "Trump said that he had seen images of Palestinians on TV and that \u201cthose children look very hungry.\u201d He later added that the scenes were \u201creal starvation\u201d and that \u201cyou can\u2019t fake that.\u201d",
      "His views were echoed by Vice President JD Vance, who said in response to a question from NBC News on a trip to Canton, Ohio, that the Trump administration was \u201cvery worried about the humanitarian problem in Gaza\u201d and wanted to make sure starving children got food.",
      "The partial easing of restrictions in Gaza under the new round of \u201ctactical pauses\u201d has done little to quell fears about the spiraling hunger crisis.",
      "\u201cThis is progress, but vast amounts of aid are needed to stave off famine and a catastrophic health crisis,\u201d United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher warned in a statement.",
      "Sunday's aid deliveries were a \"drop in the ocean\" and the days ahead will be \"make or break\" in addressing the hunger crisis, Fletcher told British broadcaster BBC News on Monday.",
      "His warnings were echoed by others as the Palestinian health ministry in the enclave said Monday that 14 deaths over the past 24 hours were attributed to \u201cfamine and malnutrition,\u201d with two children among those killed.",
      "That brought the total number of deaths due to malnutrition up to 147, including 88 children, since the war began, the health ministry said, with most of those recorded in recent months, according to statements from the United Nations. NBC News was not able to independently confirm the figures.",
      "Trump, speaking either side of a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at his golf resort in Turnberry, Scotland, said that the U.S. would be working with its European partners to address the crisis in Gaza. He offered few other details about the plan.",
      "Humanitarian groups and doctors have warned for weeks of mounting malnutrition in Gaza, with Israel allowing only a \u201cbasic\u201d amount of food in since May when it lifted its blockade barring the entry of aid into the enclave.",
      "Just under 30 aid packages carrying food were airdropped over Gaza on Sunday, COGAT, the Israeli military's liaison with the Palestinians, said in a statement.",
      "Video captured by NBC News' crew on the ground showed scores of Palestinians running toward a handful of parachutes dotting the sky in northern Gaza, which COGAT said was airdropped in collaboration with the United Arab Emirates and Jordan.",
      "Abdul Rahman Al-Kahlout, 18, said he waited for hours under the blazing sun in hope of reaching the supplies before they ran out.",
      "\"We died in the sun for four hours,\" Al-Kahlout said. He described shots being fired and soldiers surrounding Palestinians as they waited for the aid several times. He said he feared he was \"going to die for flour.\"",
      "More than 1,000 people, including children, have been killed by Israeli forces while waiting for and trying to reach aid since a new distribution system was implemented in late May, led by the controversial U.S. and Israel-backed group the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "Health officials in Gaza said Israeli attacks killed at least 41 Palestinians from late Saturday into Sunday, including 26 people who were seeking aid, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Facing growing pressure from the global community, Israel has sought to justify both its restrictions and the introduction of a new distribution system by arguing that Hamas has been diverting aid from civilians in the enclave throughout the war.",
      "But an internal U.S. government analysis has found no evidence of systematic theft of aid supplies by Hamas, according to a report presented to State Department officials and later seen by NBC News. The IDF dismissed the report as \"biased.\"",
      "The World Food Program said Sunday that it had enough food in and on its way to the region to feed the entire population of Gaza \"for almost three months,\" if enabled to do so, as it warned that a \"third of the population\" is still \"not eating for days.\""

      "HONG KONG \u2014 The head of China\u2019s famous Shaolin Temple has been defrocked as authorities investigate allegations of financial offenses and sexual misconduct.",
      "Shi Yongxin, the temple\u2019s abbot since 1999, has had his ordination certificate revoked, China\u2019s state-backed Buddhist Association said in a statement Monday, citing allegations that he embezzled and misappropriated project funds and temple assets.",
      "Shi, 59, also broke his vow of celibacy, having \u201cimproper relationships\u201d with women over a long period of time and fathering at least one child out of wedlock, the temple said in a separate statement Sunday.",
      "Shi\u2019s actions are \u201cparticularly egregious, severely damaging the reputation of the Buddhist community and tarnishing the image of monastics,\u201d the association said, adding that it \u201cfirmly supports\u201d the investigation by multiple agencies.",
      "Calls to the Shaolin Temple went unanswered Monday.",
      "Dubbed the \u201cCEO monk,\u201d Shi globally commercialized the Shaolin Temple, based in China\u2019s central province of Henan, a 1,500-year-old monastery recognized as the cradle of kung fu. As of Monday, four companies are still registered under Shi\u2019s name, according to Qichacha, a Chinese corporate database operator.",
      "Led by Shi, the temple has raised its international profile over the years through tourism, performances and training. It has also established multiple overseas cultural centers, including in the United States, Australia and Europe.",
      "Though Shi has faced similar accusations in the past, religious authorities rejected them at the time.",
      "In 2011, Shi downplayed online rumors that he had mistresses and children. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to vindicate. When things like this happen, just let it go,\u201d he told the state-run newspaper People\u2019s Daily.",
      "In 2015, several of Shi\u2019s students accused him of extortion and bribery, drawing heightened attention from China\u2019s top religious affairs body. A two-year investigation cleared Shi of wrongdoing.",
      "The latest investigation was widely satirized on Chinese social media, where commenters noted the irony of the allegations given that Shi\u2019s religion requires him to live frugally.",
      "\u201cAll the wishes I made for wealth and success at the Buddhist temples have come true for the monks,\u201d a user wrote on the Chinese social media platform Weibo."

    "story": [
      "Three Venezuelan men told NBC News they experienced physical and psychological torture, including one man\u2019s allegation that he was sexually assaulted, after the Trump administration sent them to a notorious prison in El Salvador.",
      "The men were held for four months in the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, a Salvadoran megaprison known for its harsh conditions and reported abuse. The allegations included beatings that left bruises and cuts, psychological abuse and the denial of necessities such as food or bathroom access.",
      "The Trump administration sent about 250 Venezuelan men to CECOT in March and has accused them of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang. Many of the men and some of their families and attorneys have denied the claim. The men were released and flown to Venezuela on July 18 as part of a prisoner swap with the United States.",
      "Andry Hernandez Romero, a 32-year-old gay asylum-seeker from Venezuela, told NBC News that one day during his imprisonment he was taken to solitary confinement, where prison staff \u201cmade me kneel, perform oral sex on one person, while the others groped me and touched my private parts\u201d and \u201cstroked me with their batons.\u201d",
      "He said he could not identify the guards because their faces were covered and the room did not have a lightbulb, with only a small amount of light coming in through a hole in the ceiling.",
      "Hernandez said the incident left him devastated.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want to eat. I didn\u2019t want to do absolutely anything,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cThe only thing I did was stay laying down, look at the toilet, remember my family, asking myself a million questions.\u201d",
      "Another detainee who spoke to NBC News, Jerce Reyes, said Hernandez told him after they were released that he was sexually abused by CECOT staff. Hernandez also said on Venezuelan state media that he was sexually abused while in CECOT.",
      "\u201cHe told us that when we arrived in Venezuela, that he suffered abuse at the hands of guards there in El Salvador,\u201d said Reyes, referring to Hernandez\u2019s account of sexual abuse.",
      "Hernandez said he was unaware of any formal system at CECOT through which he could report the alleged abuse and that if detainees tried to complain to superiors at the prison, they would often be subjected to beatings by guards.",
      "The Salvadoran government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Hernandez\u2019s sexual assault allegations and claims from other Venezuelan men that they were physically and psychologically abused in the prison. The government has previously said it observes safety and order standards, and the director of CECOT told CNN that \u201cthe whole operation is based on strict respect for human rights.\u201d In a statement, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security referred NBC News to the Salvadoran government for comment because the Venezuelan men were \u201cnot U.S. citizens or under U.S. jurisdiction.\u201d",
      "When asked whether the U.S. government would continue to send people to CECOT, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement, \u201cwhether it is CECOT, Alligator Alcatraz, Guantanamo Bay or another detention facility, these dangerous criminals will not be allowed to terrorize U.S. citizens.\u201d",
      "The statement said that President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem \u201care using every tool available to get criminal illegal aliens off our streets and out of our country. Our message is clear: Criminals are not welcome in the United States.\u201d",
      "\u2018You will not be leaving here\u2019",
      "Hernandez and others said they were repeatedly beaten by prison officials.",
      "\u201cOur daily bread there as Venezuelans were beatings, threats. For whatever circumstance,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cIf you answer an official, they hit you. ... If you talk, they hit you.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery time they went to hit a large group outside, they would put us in the required position so we couldn\u2019t see. And to hear the moans, to hear how they were hitting the people was also very heavy.\u201d",
      "Another detainee, Andry Blanco Bonilla, 40, said he and the other Venezuelans faced verbal, psychological and physical abuse from the day they entered CECOT.",
      "\u201cThere were so many moments of anguish and terror,\u201d he said in Spanish. \u201cI feared for my life.\u201d",
      "Blanco Bonilla said that when they first arrived at CECOT, the men were shackled so tightly at the ankles that walking \u201cwould give us cuts and bruises.\u201d He said the guards denied them food and access to bathrooms or showers as punishment.",
      "Blanco Bonilla, who had gone to the U.S. to seek asylum, said he would never forget the words of a prison official who told the detainees, \u201cWelcome to CECOT. Welcome to hell.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou will not be leaving here. Your days are over,\u201d the official said, according to Blanco Bonilla.",
      "The detainees would suffer beatings as the guards saw fit, he said.",
      "\u201cThey tried to avoid hitting our faces. They kicked us in the back or ribs,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they made us get on our knees, they would step on our toes with their boots. They hit us with batons, they hit us on the head.\u201d",
      "After a beating, Blanco Bonilla said he would be brought by guards to a prison doctor, who would say to him, \u201cYou hit yourself. How did you hit yourself?\u201d",
      "When he tried to tell the doctor that he was beaten by prison staff, a guard would hit him with a baton in the back, Blanco Bonilla said. The doctor would then ask him again, \u201cHow did you hit yourself?\u201d",
      "\u201cI realized that if I didn\u2019t tell them what they wanted, they would keep hitting me,\u201d he said, adding that the doctor would then make a false report about the incident.",
      "\u2018We are only migrants\u2019",
      "Reyes, 36, said one of hardest moments for him was when a prison official \u201cencouraged us to commit suicide\u201d and told him \u201cthis is how your whole nightmare ends.\u201d",
      "\u201cI did think about committing suicide at some point. But I thought about my two daughters, I thought about my family,\u201d he said about his two children, ages 3 and 6.",
      "Reyes said there were days when \u201cwe woke up and all said to ourselves, \u2018We aren\u2019t getting out of here.\u2019\u201d He said he witnessed and experienced physical aggression from CECOT guards.",
      "Reyes said he was thankful that he and other men were able to share copies of the Bible inside and motivate each other.",
      "The detainees who spoke to NBC News said they had no contact with the outside world or access to U.S. officials during the four months they were held in CECOT.",
      "Reyes did recall seeing Noem walk by when she toured CECOT in March, shortly after he and the others were sent there. She went past several cells that Salvadoran officials assured her held hardened criminals and gang members.",
      "Reyes says he wasn\u2019t told Noem was coming but remembers that day as the only day the detainees had gotten something cold to drink.",
      "He said he and others pressed their faces to the bars and saw her. \u201cWe began screaming, \u2018Freedom, freedom, freedom. We are not criminals. We are only migrants,\u2019\u201d Reyes said.",
      "The men were sent to CECOT after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act in March, declaring the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua an invading force. Immigration officials have since used that act to deport hundreds of people without immigration hearings, alleging that they were gang members.",
      "The men who spoke to NBC News, as well as the families of former detainees and their attorneys, have strongly denied any ties to gangs and said they were unfairly targeted because of tattoos that may be popular in Venezuela and are unrelated to Tren de Aragua. They have also said some migrants were denied due process and a chance to defend themselves from the accusations against them. Experts have said tattoos are not closely connected with affiliation to Tren de Aragua. An official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement previously said the administration did not solely rely on tattoos to identify the men sent to CECOT as gang members.",
      "A New York Times investigation, which relied on interviews with prosecutors and law enforcement officials as well as court documents and media reports in multiple countries, found that most of the men sent to CECOT did not have criminal records in the United States or in the region. It found at least 32 of the more than 200 men faced serious criminal accusations or convictions in the United States or abroad. Very few of them appeared to have any documented evidence connecting them to Tren de Aragua.",
      "The men said their strong faith in God, love for their families and a belief that one day they would get justice helped them keep going during their most desperate moments.",
      "\u201cReuniting again with my parents and children was a moment of such happiness,\u201d Blanco Bonilla said.",
      "While the men resume life back in Venezuela, the question of whether they would ever return to the U.S. remains. During a status hearing Thursday tied to the government\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act, the Department of Justice said it would bring any of the men back for immigration or habeas proceedings if a \u201clawful order\u201d were issued.",
      "\u201cVenezuela has made assurances they\u2019ll allow us to do that,\u201d DOJ attorney Tiberius Davis told the court.",
      "Now that they are back home with their families, the men have said they are demanding justice from Trump and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele.",
      "On Thursday, former detainee Neiyerver Adri\u00e1n Leon Rengel filed a complaint, reviewed by NBC News, against the Department of Homeland Security under the Federal Tort Claims Act, claiming he was removed from the United States unlawfully and without due process. The complaint was filed on behalf Rengel by the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and the Democracy Defenders Fund, which describes itself as a nonpartisan group that defends democratic institutions and opposes autocrats.",
      "LULAC told NBC News that it also planned to file a lawsuit and expected more lawsuits to come after that.",
      "Rengel alleged that he suffered physical, verbal and psychological abuse in CECOT and that the U.S. government could have and should have secured his release, according to the complaint.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the complaint.",
      "\u201cWe were mistreated, our rights were violated, crimes against humanity were committed,\u201d Blanco Bonilla said.",
      "Hernandez said he and others are still working through the psychological effects of their time in CECOT. \u201cAll 252 [of the men] are doing poorly, mentally.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven though we are free, even though we are now with our families, happy and content,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is still a big mental block, a block that particularly I have not been able to find a way to deal with.\u201d",
      "But despite their ongoing struggles, Hernandez said the shared experience has created a lasting sense of community among the men.",
      "\u201cWe entered [CECOT] as 252 strangers, 252 Venezuelans, but 252 brothers came out,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cWe all supported each other; we were all there in the constant fight.\u201d",

      "Tadej Poga\u010dar blasted his way to a fourth Tour de France victory on Sunday, besting rival Jonas Vingegaard by 4:24 across the famed Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es finish line.",
      "Billed as a clash between two titans, this year\u2019s race was filled with ghosts of Poga\u010dar\u2019s past, including the Hautacam, Mont Ventoux and the Col de la Loze climbs, where he had lost significant time in previous Tours to Vingegaard.",
      "This year, Poga\u010dar, of UAE Team Emirates XRG, conquered them all.",
      "\u201cJust speechless to win the Tour de France. This one feels especially amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cJust super proud that I can wear this yellow jersey.\u201d",
      "Vingegaard, of Denmark, suffered significant time losses early in the race beginning with his botched performance during the Stage 5 time trial. He crossed the finish 1:20 behind Poga\u010dar, who continued to build a steady time gap that eventually became too large for Vingegaard to overcome.",
      "Despite launching attack after attack and maintaining an upbeat attitude during interviews, Vingegaard, of Visma\u2013Lease a Bike, proved to be a mere mortal compared to Poga\u010dar\u2019s superhuman prowess.",
      "\u201cBattling against Jonas was a tough experience, but I must say to him, respect and big, big congratulations to him for his fight and incredible race,\u201d Poga\u010dar said.",
      "As of Sunday, two-time Tour winner Vingegaard has finished runner-up to Poga\u010dar three times. He will next take on the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a, Spain\u2019s grand tour, in August.",
      "His teammate, Belgian rider Wout van Aert, won Sunday\u2019s rainy stage, which featured three climbs around Montmartre instead of the traditional ceremonial ride into Paris. Van Aert stunned onlookers in the last kilometer around the hill, known for its artistic history and the Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur Basilica, as he dropped Poga\u010dar in a final attack on the steepest section.",
      "\u201cWe came to this tour with ambition to also win the yellow jersey, but the strongest rider in the race and biggest rider on the road won,\u201d said van Aert. \u201cI\u2019m proud of how we raced as a team, how we kept trying every day.\u201d",
      "German climber Florian Lipowitz, of Red Bull\u2013BORA\u2013hansgrohe, finished third in the general classification, coming in 11:09 behind Poga\u010dar and taking home the white jersey for best young rider. His podium finish is all the more impressive considering this was his Tour debut. He was meant to be riding in a supportive role for teammate and Tour veteran Primo\u017e Rogli\u010d from Slovenia.",
      "But in the end, Lipowitz, who is 11 years younger than 35-year-old Rogli\u010d, emerged as the stronger rider. And Rogli\u010d, who has crashed out of several grand tours in recent years, appeared happy to just finish the race.",
      "Indeed, this year\u2019s Tour was filled with unforgettable performances by the next generation of emerging talent.",
      "Few people could have predicted the rise of Irish climber Ben Healy, who wore the yellow jersey for two days early in the race after launching strong attacks based purely on instinct. His team, EF Education-EasyPost, came into the race without its team leader, Richard Carapaz, but Healy quickly stepped into the role. He took the Stage 6 win and was awarded with the Tour\u2019s \u201cSuper Combative\u201d prize for what his team described as \u201cexploits\u201d on the road.",
      "\u201cIt is one thing to achieve what you set out to achieve; it is another to do it with a smile,\u201d team sports director Charly Wegelius said in a statement.",
      "Italian sprinter Jonathan Milan, of Lidl\u2013Trek, dominated in the green jersey for much of his Tour debut. The contest for points classification appeared to open in Stage 3 when the reigning champion, Jasper Philipsen, of Alpecin\u2013Deceuninck, was thrown over his handlebars during an intermediate sprint. The Belgian fastman was forced to abandon with a fractured collarbone and at least one broken rib.",
      "Milan and teammate Quinn Simmons, from Durango, Colorado, soon began a relentless campaign to best the remaining sprinters and succeeded. Simmons, donning his iconic handlebar mustache and American flag road champion\u2019s jersey, was seen at the front of the peloton nearly every day for three weeks. He proved to be the perfect lead-out man for Milan, who wouldn\u2019t let rain or crashes slow him down.",
      "In the end, Milan edged out Poga\u010dar in the final points classification and Simmons proposed to his girlfriend \u2014 she said yes! \u2014 after crossing the finish line."
