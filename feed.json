      "Speaking to the press on Tuesday, Soyinka said he believed it had little to do with him and was instead a product of the United States' immigration policies. He said he was told to reapply if he wished to enter again.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about me, I\u2019m not really interested in going back to the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cBut a principle is involved. Human beings deserve to be treated decently wherever they are.\u201d",
      "Soyinka, who has taught in the U.S. and previously held a green card, joked on Tuesday that his green card \u201chad an accident\u201d eight years ago and \u201cfell between a pair of scissors.\u201d In 2017, he destroyed his green card in protest of President Trump's first inauguration.",
      "The letter he received informing him of his visa revocation cites \u201cadditional information became available after the visa was issued,\u201d as the reason for its revocation, but does not describe what that information was.",

      "More than 100 investigators are racing to solve a daring heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris",
      "PARIS -- More than 100 investigators are racing to piece together how thieves pulled off the brazen heist at the Louvre Museum in Paris, working to recover the stolen gems and bring those responsible to justice.",
      "The daytime theft of centuries-old jewels from the world's most-visited museum thought to be of significant cultural and monetary value has captured the world's attention for its audacity and movie plot-like details.",
      "But thus far little has been revealed about how the investigation is unfolding, a source of frustration for those accustomed to the 24-hour flow of information in American true crime or British tabloids.",
      "Suspects, like the jewels themselves, have remained out of sight, the case file cloaked in mystery and French authorities characteristically discreet.",
      "Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said on Sunday that more details would come once the suspects\u2019 custody period ends, likely around midweek, depending on the charges. But here's what we know so far about the case:",
      "Authorities said it took mere minutes for thieves to ride a lift up the side of the museum, smash display cases and steal eight objects worth an estimated 88 million euros ($102 million) on Oct. 19. The haul included a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a set linked to 19th-century queens Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Hortense.",
      "Beccuau has not publicly announced what charges the suspects could face, though French media have reported that the charges include criminal conspiracy and organized theft, which can carry hefty fines and yearslong prison sentences.",
      "Beccuau said investigators made several arrests Saturday evening but didn\u2019t name them or say how many. One suspect, she added, was stopped at a Paris airport while trying to leave the country.",
      "In France, where privacy laws are strict, images of criminal suspects are not made public as they often are elsewhere. Suspects aren\u2019t paraded before cameras upon arrest or shown in mugshots.",
      "The presumption of innocence is inscribed in France's constitution and deeply valued throughout society. The French often express shock at the spectacle of criminal trials in the United States, including in 2011 when media outlets photographed Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then a candidate in France's presidential election, on a \u201cperp walk\u201d to a New York prison after he was indicted on charges he sexually assaulted a hotel maid. The charges were eventually dismissed.",
      "Information about investigations is meant to be secret under French law, a policy known as \u2033secret d\u2019instruction\" and only the prosecutor can speak publicly about developments.",
      "Police and investigators are not supposed to divulge information about arrests or suspects without the prosecutor's approval, though in previous high-profile cases, police union officials have leaked partial details. Beccuau on Saturday rued the leak of information about the ongoing investigation.",
      "A police official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing case, told The Associated Press that two men in their 30s, both known to police, were taken into custody. He said one suspect was arrested as he attempted to board a plane bound for Algeria.",

      "Interpol, the world\u2019s largest international police network, does not issue arrest warrants. But if authorities worry a suspect may flee, Interpol can circulate the information using a color-coded notice system.",
      "The French investigators can also work with European authorities if required. They can turn to the European Union\u2019s judicial cooperation agency, Eurojust, or its law enforcement agency, Europol. Eurojust works through judicial cooperation between prosecutors and magistrates, while Europol works with police agencies.",
      "Both can help facilitate investigations and arrests throughout the 27-member bloc. Requests for help must come from the national authorities, and neither organization can initiate an investigation.",
      "Beccuau said more details would be released once the suspects' time in custody expires. How long that lasts depends on what they\u2019re accused of. If, as French media have reported, they\u2019re being investigated for criminal conspiracy, they can be held for up to 96 hours before charges are filed.",

      "Offscreen, Lockhart insisted, she was nothing like the women she portrayed.",
      "\u201cI must quote Dan Rather,\u201d she said in a 1994 interview. \u201cI can control my reputation, but not my image, because my image is how you see me.",
      "\u201cI love rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and going to the concerts. I have driven Army tanks and flown in hot air balloons. And I go plane-gliding \u2014 the ones with no motors. I do a lot of things that don\u2019t go with my image.\u201d",
      "Early in her career, Lockhart appeared in numerous films. Among them: \u201cAll This and Heaven Too,\u201d \u201cAdam Had Four Sons,\u201d \u201cSergeant York,\u201d \u201cMiss Annie Rooney,\u201d \u201cForever and a Day\u201d and \u201cMeet Me in St. Louis.\u201d",
      "She also made \u201cSon of Lassie,\u201d the 1945 sequel to \u201cLassie, Come Home,\u201d playing the grown-up version of the role created by Elizabeth Taylor.",
      "When her movie career as an adult faltered, Lockhart shifted to television, appearing in live drama from New York and game and talk shows. She was the third actress to play the female lead in \u201cLassie\u201d on TV, following Jan Clayton and Cloris Leachman. (Provost had replaced the show\u2019s original child star, Tommy Rettig, in 1957.)",
      "Lockhart spoke frankly about her canine co-star. In the first place, she said in 1989, Lassie was a laddie, because male collies \u201care bigger, the ruff is bigger, they\u2019re more imposing looking.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cI worked with four Lassies. There was only one main Lassie at a time. Then there was a dog that did the running, a dog that did the fighting, and a dog that was a stand-in, because only humans can work 14 hours a day without needing a nap.",
      "\u201cLassie was not especially friendly with anybody. Lassie was wholly concentrated on the trainers.\u201d",
      "After six years in the rural setting of \u201cLassie,\u201d Lockhart moved to outer space, embarking on the role of Maureen Robinson, the wise, reassuring mother of a family that departs on a five-year flight to a faraway planet in \u201cLost in Space.\u201d",

      "She also used her own media pass to attend presidential news conferences, narrated beauty pageants and holiday parades, appeared in B pictures and toured in the plays \u201cSteel Magnolias,\u201d \u201cBedroom Farce\u201d and \u201cOnce More with Feeling.\u201d",

      "She was married and divorced twice: to John Maloney, a physician, father of her daughters Anne Kathleen and June Elizabeth; and architect John C. Lindsay.",

      "Savvopoulos had died of a heart attack after battling cancer since 2020.",
      "Thousands came to pay their respects to a well-beloved, if sometimes controversial, artist as he lay in state at a chapel of the Athens Metropolitan Cathedral Saturday morning. Hundreds made the nearly 2-kilometer (1.2-mile) walk behind the hearse to the cemetery.",
      "The presence of a Greek navy band playing mournful music was indicative of the change in Savvopoulos\u2019s status, from someone lionized by anarchist-leaning leftists in the 1960s and 1970s and dismissed by the establishment as a long-haired freak, to a figure embraced by the same establishment and cultural mainstream.",

Always a political animal, he didn't shy away from criticizing the left and its illusions, especially on his 1989 album \u201cThe Haircut,\u201d whose sleeve showed him beardless with long locks. A few of his songs drew the enmity of some of his longtime admirers. The beard grew back but his politics remained moderate.",
      "Conservative Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the first of many who eulogized Savvopoulos during the funeral service, used the lyrics of the 1972 song \u201cMessenger Angel\" to portray the artist as a speaker of uncomfortable truths that many did not want to hear. \u201cIf he had no pleasant news to tell/better tell us none,\u201d he quoted the song's ending.",
      "Others who joined in eulogizing Savvopoulos were former President Katerina Sakellaropoulou, fellow musicians, artists and literary figures, some from his hometown of Thessaloniki, and one of his two grandsons.",

She\u2019s been praised by artists like Chaka Khan, Regina King and Quincy Jones and has amassed a large following of her Gen-Z peers on TikTok, introducing a new generation to jazz.",
      "Last year, Joy released \u201cPortrait,\u201d her third and most personal studio album allowing listeners into the tension between excitement and feeling overwhelmed that often follows a whirlwind of accolades and success. Her first original song \u201cPeace of Mind\u201d fully captures this moment.",
      "\u201cI wrote it in a time where I was really questioning whether I could continue or not because I was so exhausted,\u201d said Joy. \u201cI reminded myself through that Sun Ra composition that I have experienced something wonderful, and it doesn\u2019t have to be the end all be all.

And this album, \u201cPortrait,\u201d was the first time I felt like I took the reins of creative direction and band mates and songs.

      "JOY: A couple years ago I did the Hollywood Bowl and it was a birthday celebration for Quincy Jones \u2014 Patty Austin, I got the chance to sing alongside of her. And backstage, you know, she was funny and sharp and quick, but she was just very supportive and very honest. And that meant a lot to me from somebody who has been in the industry for as long as she has and collaborated with Quincy Jones and George Benson and James Ingram and all these people to be so encouraging on this new journey as I kind of embark on it.\u201d",
      "JOY: I guess I never thought about it that way. There are so many wonderful artists that I draw inspiration from \u2014 Billy Strayhorn, Duke Ellington through the course of their lives contributed to the changing to the evolution of the music that we call jazz. I know that there\u2019s always gonna be a certain sense of nostalgia and a certain artist or song that people can connect to or relate to easily because jazz is not mainstream, at least to me, I don\u2019t think unless it is really, really, really, really watered down, I don\u2019t think it will be.",
      "But it\u2019s an opportunity for me to once again be authentic and show people like, \u201cHave you ever heard of this Abby Lincoln song?\u201d Or maybe this Thelonious Monk song doesn\u2019t have lyrics, but I can put lyrics to them and share a different, you know, a different compositional style. And a different voice in jazz. And so I guess that\u2019s my way of reclaiming it and educating in a way and just introducing people to the sound that they may not recognize at first, but good music is good music.",
      "JOY: I feel very honored and sometimes undeserving because of how new my relationship to their music was initially. I hadn\u2019t really listened to their music or their voices at all growing up and getting introduced to them in college, it just felt like another world had opened up and I felt like I wanna sing, I wanna be able to move people the way that they move me with their voices.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Author Jodi Picoult has the dubious honor of being banned in two mediums this fall \u2014 her books and now a musical based on her novel \u201cBetween the Lines.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m the first author who has now had censorship occur in two different types of media,\u201d Picoult says. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not out here to be salacious. I am writing the world as it is, and I am honestly just trying to write about difficult issues that people have a hard time talking about because that is what fiction and the arts do.\u201d",
      "The superintendent of Mississinewa High School in Gas City, Indiana, canceled a production last week of \u201cBetween the Lines,\u201d saying concerns were raised over \u201csexual innuendo\u201d and alcohol references in the musical. Jeremy Fewell, the superintendent, did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s devastating for us to know that these kids who put in hundreds of hours of hard work had that torn away from them because of the objections of a single parent,\u201d says Picoult.",
      "\u201cWhat I know, perhaps better than most people, as someone whose books have been banned, is when one parent starts deciding what is appropriate and what is inappropriate for the children of other parents, we have a big problem.\u201d",
      "Picoult noted that the same Indiana high school has previously produced \u201cGrease,\u201d where the sexual innuendo and alcohol abuse is much greater, including a pregnancy scare, sex-mad teens and the line \u201cDid she put up a fight?\u201d",
      "\u201cBetween the Lines\u201d centers on Delilah, an outsider in a new high school, who finds solace in a book and realizes she has the power to write her own story and narrate her own life. \u201cIt is a very benign message. And it\u2019s actually a really important one for adolescents today,\u201d says Picoult.",
      "The original work, which features a nonbinary character, had already been edited with licensed changes to make it more palatable for a conservative audience, including removing any reference to the nonbinary character's gender orientation.",
      "The production was scheduled for Halloween weekend at the Gas City Performing Arts Center. The show has music and lyrics by Elyssa Samsel and Kate Anderson, and a story by Timothy Allen McDonald, based on the 2012 novel by Picoult and her daughter, Samantha van Leer. It played off-Broadway in 2022.",

      "Picoult, the bestselling author of \u201cMy Sister\u2019s Keeper\u201d and \u201cSmall Great Things,\u201d has also written about the moments leading up to a school shooting in \u201cNineteen Minutes,\u201d which was banned 16 times in the 2024-2025 school year, according to PEN America, making her the nation's fourth most-banned author.",
      "\u201cI had 20 books banned in one school district in Florida alone because of a single parent\u2019s objection and she admitted she had not read any of the books,\u201d said Picoult, a PEN America trustee. \u201cShe said that they were banned for \u2018mature content and sexuality.\u2019 There were books of mine that did not even have a single kiss in them.\u201d",
      "The uptick in book banning has spread to stages as well. The Dramatists Legal Defense Fund has documented recently challenged plays and musicals from states including Pennsylvania, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Ohio and New Jersey after parents or teachers complained that the works\u2019 social themes weren\u2019t appropriate for minors.",

      "Last year, the Educational Theatre Association asked more than 1,800 theatre educators in public and private schools across the U.S. about censorship. More than 75% of respondents reported pressure to reconsider their play and musical choices during the 2023-24 school year.",
      "\u201cWe are not protecting kids,\u201d said Picoult. \u201cWe are robbing them of materials that we use to deal with an increasingly complex world.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Misty Copeland took one last spin on her pointe shoes Wednesday, showered with golden glitter and bouquets as she retired from American Ballet Theatre after a trailblazing career in which she became an ambassador for diversity in an overwhelmingly white art form.",
      "Copeland, who a decade ago became the first Black female principal dancer in the company\u2019s 75-year history, was feted at its star-studded fall gala at Manhattan's Lincoln Center. Oprah Winfrey and Debbie Allen were among those who gave speeches of praise.",
      "Winfrey spoke of the power of young people of color seeing Copeland lead iconic ballets like \u201cSwan Lake.\u201d",
      "\u201cMisty didn\u2019t just perform ballet,\" Winfrey said of the ballerina who has achieved a unique crossover fame. \"She changed it. She redefined who belongs, who gets to be seen, and who gets to lead.\u201d",
      "In a way, the gala was both a return and a departure for Copeland, 43. She was dancing with the company for the first time in five years. During that time, Copeland has been raising a son, Jackson, with her husband. The 3-year-old came onstage to hug his mother during curtain calls, wearing a tuxedo.",
      "Copeland has also been continuing her career as an author \u2014 the second volume of her \u201cBunheads\u201d series appeared in September \u2014 and working to increase diversity in the dance world with her namesake foundation, including \u201cBe Bold,\u201d an afterschool program designed for young children of color.",
      "But she decided to dust off the pointe shoes so she could have one last spin on the ABT stage \u2014 including as Juliet, one of the most passionate roles in ballet and her personal favorite. Copeland's Romeo in the balcony pas de deux was Calvin Royal III, who in 2020 became ABT's first Black male principal dancer in two decades.",
      "The duo later reappeared for another duet, this time a modern one, in \u201cWrecka Stow,\u201d by Kyle Abraham. For Copeland's final performance of the night, she performed Twyla Tharp's \u201cSinatra Suite\u201d with another of her favorite partners, Herman Cornejo.",
      "The night, which also celebrated ABT's 85th anniversary and was curated in large part by Copeland herself, included speeches and film clips about her career. And her fellow dancers performed excerpts of ballets in her honor. At the end, a beaming Copeland was given a quintessential ballet farewell, as colleagues, teachers, friends and family came out to greet her, one by one, with hugs and bouquets while glittery confetti poured from the rafters.",
      "Though Copeland has not closed the door on dancing altogether, it\u2019s clear an era is ending.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been 25 years at ABT, and I think it\u2019s time,\u201d she told The Associated Press in an interview in June, when she announced her retirement. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to move to the next stage.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve become the person that I am today, and have all the opportunities I have today, because of ballet, (and) because of American Ballet Theatre. I feel like this is me saying \u2018thank you\u2019 to the company. So it\u2019s a farewell. (But) it won\u2019t be the end of me dancing. \u2026 Never say never.\u201d",

      "The compensation was negotiated with Germany\u2019s finance ministry and is the largest budget for frail and vulnerable Holocaust survivor home care in the organization\u2019s history.",

      "ZANZIBAR, Tanzania -- The women wade with baskets near the beaches, their colorful dresses a magnet for tourist cameras. Sunscreen worn by the holidaymakers may even contain the product the women are collecting: Zanzibar\u2019s seaweed.",
      "An eco-friendly local industry that employs thousands of women, the seaweed farming looks like a picture postcard \u2014 even if the reality of the work is grimmer than what meets the eye.",
      "\u201cI experience pain in my back, waist and chest due to the labor in the sea. There are also risks of being stung or bitten,\u201d said one farmer, Mwanaisha Makame Simai. \u201cSometimes strong waves sweep you away. I have personally witnessed three cases of people drowning.\u201d",
      "Seaweed has been farmed off Zanzibar, part of Tanzania's Indian Ocean coast, for decades but there is a new boom underway as global demand increases.",
      "Seaweed is primarily exported to the global food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries, which extract their thickening and stabilizing agents.",
      "In Zanzibar, private investment and donor dollars have been increasing. Seaweed is the third largest contributor to the local economy after tourism and spices.",
      "\u201cTen years ago, people thought you were crazy for working in seaweed,\u201d said Klara Schade, director at Mwani Zanzibar, which describes itself as a boutique seaweed farm and factory in the village of Paje. \u201cNow it\u2019s become a buzzword.\u201d",
      "Mwani even runs seaweed tours in Paje to introduce the work.",
      "For the government of the semi-autonomous archipelago, seaweed is at the heart of its \u201cblue economy\u201d initiative to drive growth from sustainable marine and coastal resources.",
      "Cargill, one of the world\u2019s largest commodity trading firms, invested an unspecified amount in Zanzibari seaweed in 2020 in a partnership with The Nature Conservancy, with a view to improving yields and farmers' incomes.",
      "Other nongovernmental organizations have stepped up funding, including the Global Seaweed Coalition, which oversees the safety and sustainability of the sector as it scales up.",
      "Most of Zanzibar\u2019s 25,000 seaweed farmers are women, notable in a society where fewer than half of women are employed, according to a government census taken in 2021.",
      "The Associated Press spoke with five of the women, who described sometimes harsh working conditions in the manual labor. The vast majority of seaweed farmers work independently or in collectives, selling to local middlemen. There are few if any protections.",
      "Long days are spent wading under the equatorial sun. Back aches and skin irritation can result, with stings from sea urchins or other creatures being another worry.",
      "\u201cThere are health and safety challenges in this work,\u201d said Simai, an independent farmer who said she makes around $50 per month to help support her small family of two. The work may be more challenging for those with larger families, she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not an easy job, it\u2019s tiresome,\u201d said Pili Khalid Pandu, 43, who works for Mwani, doing rotations between its factory and collecting in the sea.",

      "But the stress can be reduced if people have a plan for preparing their homes and for deciding whether to stay and ride out a storm or evacuate, according to emergency management officials. That preparation, which includes putting together a kit of essential supplies, should begin long before a storm is approaching.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t be complacent, take preparedness seriously, spend the time now to do the little things that will make a big difference for you and your loved ones when something does happen,\u201d said Brian Mason, director of Houston\u2019s Office of Emergency Management.",
      "Anything in the backyard that isn\u2019t tied down, such as furniture and barbecue grills, should be secured or brought inside so it doesn't become a projectile that can come through a window, said Shawn Schulze, regional CEO for the American Red Cross Texas Gulf Coast Region.",

      "Well before a storm is brewing, people should trim or remove dead or weakened tree limbs and shrubs that hang over their homes to lessen potential damage from high winds, said Mistie Hinote, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Insurance.",

    "story": [
      "Notices of rising health insurance premiums are landing in voters\u2019 mailboxes and sending some to town halls to vent their frustration",
      "WASHINGTON -- The first caller on a telephone town hall with Maryland Rep. Andy Harris, leader of the House\u2019s conservative Freedom Caucus, came ready with a question about the Affordable Care Act. Her cousin's disabled son is at risk of losing the insurance he gained under that law, the caller said.",
      "\u201cNow she\u2019s looking at two or three times the premium that she\u2019s been paying for the insurance,\u201d said the woman, identified as Lisa from Harford County, Maryland. \u201cI\u2019d love for you to elucidate what the Republicans\u2019 plan is for health insurance?\u201d",
      "Harris, a seven-term Republican, didn\u2019t have a clear answer. \u201cWe think the solution is to try to do something to make sure all the premiums go down,\u201d he said, predicting Congress would \u201cprobably negotiate some off-ramp\u201d later.",
      "His uncertainty reflected a familiar Republican dilemma: Fifteen years after the Affordable Care Act was enacted, the party remains united in criticizing the law but divided on how to move forward. That tension has come into sharp focus during the government shutdown as Democrats seize on rising premiums to pressure Republicans into extending expiring subsidies for the law, often referred to as Obamacare.",
      "President Donald Trump and GOP leaders say they\u2019ll consider extending the enhanced tax credits that otherwise expire at year's end \u2014 but only after Democrats vote to reopen the government. In the meantime, people enrolled in the plans are already being notified of hefty premium increases for 2026.",
      "As town halls fill with frustrated voters and no clear Republican plan emerges, the issue appears to be gaining political strength heading into next year's midterm elections.",
      "\u201cPremiums are going up whether it gets extended or not,\u201d said GOP Sen. Rick Scott. \u201cPremiums are going up because health care costs are going up. Because Obamacare is a disaster.\u201d",
      "At the center of the shutdown \u2014 now in its fourth week with no end in sight \u2014 is a Democratic demand that Affordable Care Act subsidies passed in 2021 be extended.",
      "Trump has long promised an alternative. \u201cThe cost of Obamacare is out of control, plus, it\u2019s not good Healthcare,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social in November 2023. \u201cI\u2019m seriously looking at alternatives.\u201d",
      "Pressed on health care during a September 2024 presidential debate, Trump said he had \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d",
      "But nearly 10 months into his presidency, that plan has yet to come. Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told NBC on Wednesday, \u201cI fully believe the president has a plan,\u201d but didn't go into details.",
      "Republicans say they want a broader overhaul of the health care system, though such a plan would be difficult to advance before next year. Party leaders have not outlined how they\u2019ll handle the expiring tax credits, insisting they won\u2019t negotiate on the issue until Democrats agree to end the shutdown.",
      "A September analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that permanently extending the tax credits would increase the deficit by $350 billion from 2026 to 2035. The number of people with health insurance would rise by 3.8 million in 2035 if the credits are kept, CBO projected.",
      "Asked Wednesday on CNN whether Republicans have a plan to address the subsidies if the government reopened, House Speaker Mike Johnson said they had \u201cproposals\u201d that can be \u201cready immediately.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated, very complex issue, that requires a long time to build consensus around,\u201d he said.",
      "With notices of premium spikes landing in mailboxes now and the open enrollment period for Affordable Care Act health plans beginning Nov. 1, the political pressure has been evident in Republican town halls.",
      "In Idaho, Rep. Russ Fulcher told concerned callers that \u201cgovernment provided health care is the wrong path\u201d and that \u201cprivate health care is the right path.\u201d In Texas, freshman Rep. Brandon Gill responded to a caller facing a sharp premium increase by saying Republicans are focused on cutting waste, fraud and abuse.",

      "About 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they trust the Democrats to do a better job handling health care, compared with about one-quarter who trust the Republicans more, a recent AP-NORC poll found. About one-quarter trust neither party, and about 1 in 10 trust both equally, according to the poll.",
      "Even as GOP leaders pledge to discuss ending the subsidies when the government opens, it's clear that many Republican lawmakers are adamantly opposed to an extension.",

      "Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he\u2019s working with multiple congressional offices on alternatives that would let the subsidies end. For example, he wants to expand the Affordable Care Act exemption given to U.S. territories to all 50 states and reintroduce a first-term Trump policy that gave Americans access to short-term health insurance plans outside the Affordable Care Act marketplace.",
      "Cannon declined to name the lawmakers he\u2019s working with, but said he hopes they act on his ideas \u201csooner than later.\u201d",

      "About 99% of Americans have PFAS chemicals in their blood, but state health and environmental officials have found higher concentrations in one corner of New Mexico",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- It's a name many people have trouble pronouncing, but these synthetic chemicals have been used in everything from fast-food packaging to nonstick cookware, clothing, household cleaning products and even firefighting foam.",
      "PFAS \u2014 or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances \u2014 resist breaking down and as a result have found their way into drinking water, soil, air and the bloodstreams of 99% of Americans.",
      "This is certainly true for people who live or work near a plume of contamination that has seeped beyond the boundaries of Cannon Air Force Base, where PFAS-laden firefighting foam was used for years.",
      "New Mexico health and environmental officials conducted a $1.2 million testing project, drawing blood from nearly 630 people. They shared the results Thursday night during a public meeting.",
      "The research shows 99.7% of participants had one or more PFAS in their blood, with the most common being associated with firefighting foams.",
      "While the percentage isn't surprising given the overall prevalence of so-called forever chemicals in the environment, officials said some residents living in the plume area showed dramatically higher concentrations than the broader testing group. About one-quarter of them had levels reaching the highest concentration tier used in national guidelines.",
      "The findings suggest a correlation with groundwater contamination migrating from the base, state officials said.",
      "New Mexico Environment Secretary James Kenney said during the meeting that his agency will help the community in any way that it can but that the state is still locked in litigation with the U.S. Defense Department over the damage caused by the contamination.",
      "At Cannon Air Force Base, state officials have reported that PFAS has been detected in groundwater at concentrations of 26,200 parts per trillion, exceeding state and federal drinking water standards by over 650,000%.",
      "Cannon reported earlier this year that it has spent more than $73 million so far on investigating the problem and installing pilot projects to treat contaminated groundwater.",
      "Kenney said it's time for the federal government to move ahead with cleanup outside the base.",

Research by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has also found it can take weeks to years for levels of many PFAS to decrease by half in human blood, assuming exposure isn't ongoing.",
      "It's not easy to draw a bright line between exposure and health effects, said Tasha Stoiber, a senior scientist with the Washington, D.C.-based Environmental Working Group.",

      "Watchdog groups that track PFAS nationwide say contamination is more widespread than previously thought. They're using data released by the EPA and states to compile maps showing spots across the country where drinking water systems report levels above what's recommended. Contamination has also been confirmed at hundreds of military bases around the country.",

New Mexico just this week held a webinar on a new state law that calls for phasing out and ultimately prohibiting the sale of products containing intentionally added PFAS.",

      "It also comes during a moment of uncertainty for Affordable Care Act enrollees, with Congress deadlocked on how to handle expiring subsidies that have made marketplace health insurance less expensive for millions since 2021.

The proposal would have to receive more than 870,000 signatures by next spring to qualify for the ballot in November 2026. If it qualifies, it's not guaranteed to pass. Democratic Gov.

      "It\u2019s a problem that climate change, caused by the burning of fuels like gasoline and coal, is worsening.

Heat leaves your body through your skin, so when the belly gets larger, the heat has farther to travel to escape.",
      "As pregnancy progresses, the body burns more calories, creating internal heat. The heart has to work harder, which can already be strained by extreme heat. And people who are pregnant also need more liquid to stay hydrated, so they might get dehydrated more easily, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "One way the body cools itself is by shunting blood toward the skin and away from the central organs, which is why a person's skin may flush and turn red when they get hot. Emerging research indicates that reduced blood flow to the placenta can affect the development of the fetus.",

      "Pope Leo XIV has reaffirmed the Catholic Church's commitment to fighting antisemitism amid rising tensions from Israel's war in Gaza",

But he strongly confirmed the Catholic Church\u2019s condemnation of antisemitism and commitment to fighting it as part of Christians\u2019 Gospel-mandated friendship with the Jewish people.",
      "At a time of rising antisemitism stemming from Israel\u2019s war, Leo adopted as his own the Vatican\u2019s official position abhorring antisemitism as he marked the 60th anniversary of a landmark Vatican document that revolutionized the Catholic Church\u2019s relations with Jews.",
      "Leo dedicated his Wednesday general audience to the anniversary of the \u201cNostra Aetate\u201d declaration, speaking to a crowd that included several Jewish leaders and representatives of other religions who had come to Rome this week to participate in anniversary celebrations.",
      "In the text, \u201cNostra Aetate,\u201d Latin for \u201cIn Our Time,\u201d the Catholic Church deplored antisemitism in every form and repudiated the \u201cdeicide\u201d charge that blamed Jews as a people for Christ\u2019s death.",
      "The idea of Jewish collective guilt for the crucifixion had fueled antisemitism for centuries. The Vatican crafted the document repudiating it as the church reckoned with the role traditional Christian teaching had played in the Holocaust.",
      "Leo quoted the document as saying the Catholic Church decries \u201chatred, persecutions, displays of antisemitism, directed against Jews at any time and by anyone\u201d and noted that all his predecessors since then had clearly condemned antisemitism.",
      "\u201cAnd so I, too, confirm that the church does not tolerate antisemitism and fights against it, on the basis of the Gospel itself,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWe cannot deny that there have been misunderstandings, difficulties and conflicts in this period, but these have never prevented the dialogue from continuing,\u201d he added. \u201cEven today, we must not allow political circumstances and the injustices of some to divert us from friendship, especially since we have achieved so much so far.\u201d",
      "This year\u2019s anniversary comes amid a surge in antisemitism linked to Israel\u2019s military actions in Gaza following the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attacks. In the United States alone, the Anti-Defamation League says the number of antisemitic incidents  reached a record high last year, with 58% of the 9,354 incidents related to Israel, notably chants, speeches and signs at rallies protesting Israeli policies.",
      "The war has similarly strained the Vatican\u2019s relations with the Jewish community. Pope Francis repeatedly angered Jewish and Israeli leaders with comments they perceived as drawing a moral equivalence between the Hamas attacks and Israel\u2019s military actions.",
      "Francis did meet with relatives of hostages taken by Hamas and called repeatedly for them to be returned. But he called for an investigation to determine if Israel\u2019s attacks in Gaza constitute genocide and said Israel\u2019s military response was disproportionate.",

      "\u201cIt's an important step forward, and one that we hope would be implemented and believe will be as soon as possible,\u201d Hegseth told a joint news conference after holding talks with Japanese Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi. \u201cThe result, through our shared strength, will deter threats.\"",

Data collected by the organization show that survivors are experiencing more complicated health needs and increased disability, with the number of survivors who qualify for full-time assistance due to extreme disability \u2014 such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia \u2014 has nearly doubled during that time period.",
      "Additionally, the Hardship Fund Supplemental payments, which were previously guaranteed to be paid annually to eligible Holocaust survivors until 2027, have been extended through 2028 at an amount of \u20ac1,450 per survivor, impacting more than 127,000 Holocaust survivors globally.",
      "The Claims Conference projected in April that approximately 200,000 survivors are still alive, most of them living in Israel, the United States and Europe, but also scattered all over the globe.",
      "Also, righteous rescuers \u2013 non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust - currently receiving a monthly pension from the Claims Conference, will be eligible to receive home care similar to that provided to Jewish survivors, allowing them to live their final years with dignity in their own homes, the group announced.",

      "Environmentalists fear carbon tax concessions to global oil giants may undermine efforts to shift to cleaner energy",
      "SINGAPORE, Singapore -- Carbon tax concessions granted to global oil giants may undermine incentives to shift to cleaner energy, environmentalists fear.",
      "So conservation groups in Singapore are seeking more transparency over what discounts the city-state of 6 million giving polluters for taxes on their climate-changing emissions. Singapore is the only Southeast Asian country to have imposed a carbon tax so far. Most of the European Union, California, South Korea and Japan also do so.",
      "Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand are preparing to implement similar taxes next year and Vietnam and Brunei are considering the idea. The groups are pressing the Singaporean government to disclose more information about \u201callowances\u201d Singapore\u2019s National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) has awarded to certain companies.",
      "The government says the tax breaks are \u201cnot a free pass\" for corporations to continue emitting. But it has balked at providing details or even full data about the impact of the carbon tax.",
      "Singapore accounts for only 0.1% of global carbon emissions, but its emissions per person were 27th highest out of 142 countries, said Vinod Thomas, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, a Singapore-based think tank.",
      "\u201cSingapore is being watched and is being seen as a leader,\u201d Thomas said, adding that \"it matters to a great extent what others will do. If one country alone reduces emissions, that's great. But the atmosphere only cares about the total, so it is critical the rest of Southeast Asia also plays its part.\"",
      "Implemented in 2019, the carbon tax was set to increase every few years to allow emissions-intensive, trade-exposed companies time to invest in cleaner technologies.",
      "But the island nation has granted closed-door concessions to certain businesses.",
      "The NCCS says the deals are private because corporations raised valid concerns about how information on allowances could be used to compromise their business strategies and operations. Only facilities with credible plans for ending their net carbon emissions have been granted partial concessions, it said.",
      "The policy partly is meant to prevent carbon leakage, a term for when companies move to countries with less stringent climate regulations.",
      "While the tax covers around 70% of Singapore\u2019s emissions, the NCCS has not disclosed the exact amount of emissions reductions brought on by the carbon tax. It says it is \u201cdifficult to isolate the exact amount of emissions reductions\u201d and that more information will be provided \u201cin due course.\u201d",
      "Local climate groups issued a joint letter in September demanding more information about the scale and scope of the tax breaks, contending that \u201ctransparency is not incompatible with competitiveness.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t even come to a conclusion about whether the carbon tax is effective because we don\u2019t have the data,\u201d said Rachel Cheang, co-founder of Energy CoLab, a youth-led local climate group. \u201cAny conversation with the government is just not on equal ground.\u201d",
      "The city-state\u2019s carbon tax started at 5 Singapore dollars ($3.7) per ton of emissions. It has risen gradually, to 25 Singapore dollars ($19) per metric ton last year, and will be 45 Singapore dollars ($34.70) in 2026. By the end of this decade, it\u2019s expected to be 50-80 Singapore dollars (about $40-$60) per metric ton.",
      "The carbon tax burden falls most heavily on global energy companies \u2014 like ExxonMobil, which operates Singapore\u2019s largest refining facility on Jurong Island; Shell, which runs the country\u2019s oldest refinery on Pulau Bukom and Chevron, which has a 50% interest in the Singapore Refining Co.",
      "ExxonMobil and Chevron did not respond to requests for comment. Shell said \u201cWe won\u2019t be commenting.\u201d",

      "Ordinary Singaporeans have a stake in this since the tax may be passed on in the form of higher utility rates.",
      "LepakInSG calculates a set carbon tax of 50 Singapore dollars would increase the household utility bill for a 4-room, government-subsidized apartment by 8 Singapore dollars ($6.20) a month.",
      "That's probably tolerable for most families and may encourage people to conserve electricity, said Ho, but \u201cWe have also called for the government to ensure protection for the more vulnerable groups, to ensure it will not disproportionately impact them.\u201d",
      "The push for a more transparent policy coincides with the derailing this month by U.S. President Donald Trump of a months-long international effort to set up the first global tax on shipping emissions.",
      "Trump vehemently opposes charging such fees.",
      "Progress toward expanding carbon taxes will face obstacles as long as the U.S. \u2014 the world\u2019s second largest emitter after China \u2014 stays committed to fossil fuels, said Shi-Ling Hsu, a professor at Florida State University\u2019s College of Law and author of \u201cThe Case for a Carbon Tax: Getting Past Our Hang-ups to Effective Climate Policy.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a big block on global carbon taxes as long as Trump is in office,\" Hsu said.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- An American airstrike in April on a prison run by Yemen's Houthi rebels that killed over 60 detained African migrants should be investigated as a possible war crime, activists said Wednesday.",
      "The call by Amnesty International renews scrutiny on the April 28 strike in Yemen's Saada province. The attack came as part of an intense campaign of airstrikes waged under U.S. President Donald Trump targeting rebels for disrupting shipping through the Red Sea corridor amid the Israel-Hamas war.",
      "The U.S. military's Central Command has yet to offer any explanation for the strike on the prison, which previously had been hit by a Saudi-led coalition also fighting against the Houthis and had been known to hold detained African migrants trying to reach Saudi Arabia through the war zone.",
      "\u201cWe take all reports of civilian harm seriously and are working to release the assessment results for Operation Rough Rider soon,\" said U.S. Navy Capt. Tim Hawkins, a spokesperson for Central Command.",
      "After the strike, the Houthis displayed debris likely from two, 250-pound precision-guided GBU-39 small-diameter bombs used by the U.S. military, Amnesty said. Survivors interviewed by Amnesty, all Ethiopian migrants detained while trying to reach Saudi Arabia, told the rights group that they saw no Houthi fighters posted inside the building.",
      "Amnesty said the strike appeared to be an \u201cindiscriminate attack\u201d as it assessed there was no clear military objective. International law prohibits striking sites like hospitals and prisons unless the structures are being used to plan attacks or stockpile weapons \u2014 and even then, every precaution should be made to avoid hurting civilians.",
      "Amnesty said the Houthis recently put the death toll in the strike at 61, lower than the 68 it initially reported. Gunfire could be heard in footage filmed after the airstrikes, with the Houthis saying their guards fired warning shots around the time of the strikes.",
      "The April strike recalled a similar strike by a Saudi-led coalition battling the Houthis in 2022 on the same compound, which caused a collapse killing 66 detainees and wounding 113 others, a United Nations report later said. The Houthis shot dead 16 detainees who fled after the strike and wounded another 50, the U.N. said.",
      "The Houthis denied any misconduct in the April strike, but Amnesty noted the rebels' \u201congoing crackdown on ... activists, journalists, human rights defenders and humanitarian workers\u201d limited its ability to investigate. The Houthis hold at least 59 United Nations staffers and more aid group workers, with the rebels seizing electronics at U.N. offices in recent days. The Iranian-backed rebels, under economic pressure, also increasingly have been threatening Saudi Arabia in recent weeks as well.",

      "Boeing on Wednesday reported mixed third-quarter results, with higher aircraft deliveries and a growing order backlog offset by certification delays for its 777X jet",
      "Boeing reported mixed third-quarter results on Wednesday, as higher aircraft deliveries and a growing backlog of orders were offset by continued certification delays for its 777X jets.",
      "CEO Kelly Ortberg said the first delivery of its next generation of long-haul, wide-body jets is now expected in 2027 instead of 2026, resulting in a $4.9 billion charge in the quarter through September. But Ortberg emphasized in a call with analysts that the delays stemmed from the certification process, and not from any newly discovered technical issues.",
      "\u201cWhile we are disappointed in the 777 delays, it shouldn't overshadow the progress we're making,\" he said.",
      "Ortberg said Boeing was making progress on stabilizing its production. The aerospace giant delivered 160 planes in the third quarter, the most quarterly deliveries since 2018. The same time last year, Boeing said it delivered 116 planes.",
      "Boeing also reported that its backlog of orders, including 5,900 commercial planes, had grown to $636 billion in the third quarter.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s strong demand in our products,\u201d Ortberg said in an interview Wednesday morning with CNBC.",
      "In September, the Federal Aviation Administration restored Boeing's ability to perform final safety checks and certify 737 Max jets for flight more than six years after two crashes of the then-new aircraft killed 346 people.",
      "That decision was followed by the FAA's move this month to raise Boeing's 737 Max production limit that it had set in January 2024, after a door plug flew off an Alaska Airlines jet. Boeing is now allowed to build 42 Max jets per month, up from 38, and Ortberg said Wednesday that the company expects to raise that cap further once it demonstrates to the FAA that it can do so safely.",
      "If the FAA approves future production boosts, Ortberg said, they'd come in increments of five jets and wouldn't happen more than once every six months.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t move to higher rates until we reach stability and readiness,\u201d he said.",
      "Boeing also reported $238 million in free cash flow, marking its first cash flow-positive quarter since 2023. But that figure was partly boosted by a delay in a potential $700 million payment to the Justice Department, part of a still-pending deal under consideration by a federal judge that could spare Boeing from criminal prosecution in the two deadly 737 Max crashes.",

      "SINGAPORE, Singapore -- Carbon tax concessions granted to global oil giants may undermine incentives to shift to cleaner energy, environmentalists fear.",
      "So conservation groups in Singapore are seeking more transparency over what discounts the city-state of 6 million giving polluters for taxes on their climate-changing emissions. Singapore is the only Southeast Asian country to have imposed a carbon tax so far. Most of the European Union, California, South Korea and Japan also do so.",
      "Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand are preparing to implement similar taxes next year and Vietnam and Brunei are considering the idea. The groups are pressing the Singaporean government to disclose more information about \u201callowances\u201d Singapore\u2019s National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) has awarded to certain companies.",
      "The government says the tax breaks are \u201cnot a free pass\" for corporations to continue emitting. But it has balked at providing details or even full data about the impact of the carbon tax.",
      "Singapore accounts for only 0.1% of global carbon emissions, but its emissions per person were 27th highest out of 142 countries, said Vinod Thomas, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, a Singapore-based think tank.",
      "\u201cSingapore is being watched and is being seen as a leader,\u201d Thomas said, adding that \"it matters to a great extent what others will do. If one country alone reduces emissions, that's great. But the atmosphere only cares about the total, so it is critical the rest of Southeast Asia also plays its part.\"",
      "Implemented in 2019, the carbon tax was set to increase every few years to allow emissions-intensive, trade-exposed companies time to invest in cleaner technologies.",
      "But the island nation has granted closed-door concessions to certain businesses.",
      "The NCCS says the deals are private because corporations raised valid concerns about how information on allowances could be used to compromise their business strategies and operations. Only facilities with credible plans for ending their net carbon emissions have been granted partial concessions, it said.",
      "The policy partly is meant to prevent carbon leakage, a term for when companies move to countries with less stringent climate regulations.",
      "While the tax covers around 70% of Singapore\u2019s emissions, the NCCS has not disclosed the exact amount of emissions reductions brought on by the carbon tax. It says it is \u201cdifficult to isolate the exact amount of emissions reductions\u201d and that more information will be provided \u201cin due course.\u201d",
      "Local climate groups issued a joint letter in September demanding more information about the scale and scope of the tax breaks, contending that \u201ctransparency is not incompatible with competitiveness.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t even come to a conclusion about whether the carbon tax is effective because we don\u2019t have the data,\u201d said Rachel Cheang, co-founder of Energy CoLab, a youth-led local climate group. \u201cAny conversation with the government is just not on equal ground.\u201d",
      "The city-state\u2019s carbon tax started at 5 Singapore dollars ($3.7) per ton of emissions. It has risen gradually, to 25 Singapore dollars ($19) per metric ton last year, and will be 45 Singapore dollars ($34.70) in 2026. By the end of this decade, it\u2019s expected to be 50-80 Singapore dollars (about $40-$60) per metric ton.",
      "The carbon tax burden falls most heavily on global energy companies \u2014 like ExxonMobil, which operates Singapore\u2019s largest refining facility on Jurong Island; Shell, which runs the country\u2019s oldest refinery on Pulau Bukom and Chevron, which has a 50% interest in the Singapore Refining Co.",

      "A federal appeals court has overturned a landmark decision in an opioid lawsuit in West Virginia",
      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- A federal appeals court on Tuesday overturned a landmark decision in West Virginia that had rejected attempts by an opioid-ravaged area to be compensated by U.S. drug distributors for a influx of prescription pain pills into the region.",
      "The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, ruled that a lower court judge erred when he said West Virginia's public nuisance law did not apply to the lawsuit involving the distribution of opioids.",
      "\u201cWest Virginia law permits abatement of a public nuisance to include a requirement that a defendant pay money to fund efforts to eliminate the resulting harm to the public,\u201d the 4th Circuit wrote. \u201cWest Virginia has long characterized abatement as an equitable remedy.\u201d",
      "The ruling sends the case back to U.S. District Court in Charleston for \u201cfurther proceedings consistent with the principles expressed in this opinion.\u201d",
      "Thousands of state and local governments have sued over the toll of opioids. The suits relied heavily on claims that the companies created a public nuisance by failing to monitor where the powerful prescriptions were ending up. Most of the lawsuits were settled as part of a series of nationwide deals that could be worth more than $50 billion. But there wasn\u2019t a decisive trend in the outcomes of those that have gone to trial.",
      "In July 2022, U.S. District Judge David Faber ruled in favor of three major U.S. drug distributors who were accused by Cabell County and the city of Huntington of causing a public health crisis by distributing 81 million pills over eight years in the county. AmerisourceBergen Drug Co., Cardinal Health Inc. and McKesson Corp. also were accused of ignoring the signs that Cabell County was being ravaged by addiction.",
      "Faber said West Virginia\u2019s Supreme Court had only applied public nuisance law in the context of conduct that interferes with public property or resources. He said to extend the law to cover the marketing and sale of opioids \u201cis inconsistent with the history and traditional notions of nuisance.\u201d",
      "Last year the federal appeals court sent a certified question to the state Supreme Court, which states: \u201cUnder West Virginia\u2019s common law, can conditions caused by the distribution of a controlled substance constitute a public nuisance and, if so, what are the elements of such a public nuisance claim?\u201d",

If allowed, he said, that would \u201ccreate an avalanche of activist litigation.\u201d",

      "In his 2022 decision, Faber also said the plaintiffs offered no evidence that the defendants distributed controlled substances to any entity that didn\u2019t hold a proper registration from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration or the state Board of Pharmacy. The defendants also had suspicious monitoring systems in place as required by the Controlled Substances Act, he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate approved a resolution Tuesday evening that would nullify President Donald Trump's tariffs on Brazil, including oil, coffee and orange juice, as Democrats tested GOP senators' support for Trump's trade policy.",
      "The legislation from Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat, passed on a 52-48 tally.",
      "It would terminate the national emergencies that Trump has declared to justify 50% tariffs on Brazil, but the legislation is likely doomed because the Republican-controlled House has passed new rules that allow leadership to prevent it from ever coming up for a vote. Trump would almost certainly veto the legislation even if it were to pass Congress.",
      "Still, the vote demonstrated some pushback in GOP ranks against Trump\u2019s tariffs. Five Republicans \u2014 Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Thom Tillis of North Carolina \u2014 all voted in favor of the resolution along with every Democrat.",
      "Kaine said the votes are a way force a conversation in the Senate about \u201cthe economic destruction of tariffs.\u201d He's planning to call up similar resolutions applying to Trump's tariffs on Canada and other nations later this week.",
      "\u201cBut they are also really about how much will we let a president get away with? Do my colleagues have a gag reflex or not?\u201d Kaine told reporters.",
      "Trump has linked the tariffs on Brazil to the country's policies and criminal prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro. The U.S. ran a $6.8 billion trade surplus with Brazil last year, according to the Census Bureau.",
      "\u201cEvery American who wakes up in the morning to get a cup of java is paying a price for Donald Trump\u2019s reckless, ridiculous, and almost childish tariffs,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York.",
      "Republicans have also been increasingly uneasy with Trump's aggressive trade policy, especially at a time of turmoil for the economy. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said last month that Trump\u2019s tariff policy is one of several factors that are expected to increase jobless rates and inflation and lower overall growth this year.",
      "In April, four Republicans voted with Democrats to block tariffs on Canada, but the bill was never taken up in the House. Kaine said he hoped the votes this week showed how Republican opposition to Trump's trade policy is growing.",
      "To bring up the votes, Kaine has invoked a decades-old law that allows Congress to block a president\u2019s emergency powers and members of the minority party to force votes on the resolutions.",
      "However, Vice President JD Vance visited a Republican luncheon on Tuesday in part to emphasize to Republicans that they should allow the president to negotiate trade deals. Vance told reporters afterwards that Trump is using tariffs \"to give American workers and American farmers a better deal.\u201d",

      "The three credit bureaus jointly announced in 2023 they would no longer track any medical debts below $500, which at the time the bureaus said would eliminate 70% of all medical debts reported on consumers\u2019 credit files. But some states have gone further than that. New York, Delaware and others passed laws where medical debts can no longer be reported to the credit bureaus.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is expected to cut its short-term rate Wednesday for the second time this year despite an increasingly cloudy view of the economy it is trying to influence.",
      "The government shutdown has cut off the flow of data that the Fed relies on to track employment, inflation, and the broader economy. September's jobs report, scheduled for release three weeks ago, is still postponed. This month's hiring figures, to be released Nov. 7, will likely be delayed and may be less comprehensive when they are finally released. And the White House said last week that October's inflation report may never be issued at all.",
      "The data drought raises risks for the Fed because it is widely expected to keep cutting rates in an effort to shore up growth and hiring. Fed officials signaled at their last meeting in September that they would likely implement rate reductions in October and December, and financial markets now consider a cut in December to be a near-certainty.",
      "Yet should job gains pick up soon, the Fed may not detect the change. And if hiring rebounds after weak job gains during the summer, further rate cuts may not be justified.",
      "On Tuesday, payroll processor ADP released a new weekly measure of hiring by businesses, using payroll data from millions of clients. It shows that in late September and earlier this month, companies resumed adding jobs, after shedding workers in July and August.",
      "Still, a key reason rate cuts are so widely expected is that most Fed officials see its key rate, which is now about 4.1%, to be high enough that it is restraining the economy's growth. Under this view, the Fed can cut several more times before reaching a level that might provide unnecessary stimulus to the economy.",
      "Before the government shutdown cut off the flow of data Oct. 1, monthly hiring gains had weakened to an average of just 29,000 a month for the previous three months, according to the Labor Department's data. The unemployment rate ticked up to a still-low 4.3% in August from 4.2% in July.",
      "Meanwhile, last week\u2019s inflation report \u2014 released more than a week late because of the shutdown \u2014 showed that inflation remains elevated but isn\u2019t accelerating and may not need higher interest rates to tame it.",
      "The government's first report on the economy's growth in the July-September quarter was scheduled to be published on Thursday, but will be delayed, as will Friday's report on consumer spending that also includes the Fed's preferred inflation measure.",

To shrink its holdings, the Fed lets securities mature without replacing them, reducing bank reserves.

      "Air traffic controllers are missing another paycheck due to the ongoing government shutdown, raising concerns about financial stress affecting their work",
      "Air traffic controllers will miss their paychecks Tuesday because of the ongoing government shutdown, raising concerns that mounting financial stress could take a toll on the already understaffed employees who guide thousands of flights each day.",
      "Flight delays are becoming more common across the country as more controllers call out sick because the Federal Aviation Administration was already so short on controllers before the shutdown.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and the president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association Nick Daniels have continued to emphasize the pressure that controllers are feeling. They say the problems are likely to only get worse the longer the shutdown continues.",
      "Not only are controllers worrying about how to pay for their mortgages and groceries, but Daniels said some of them are also grappling with how to pay for the medicine needed to keep their children alive. Duffy said he heard from one controller who had to tell his daughter she couldn't join the traveling volleyball team she had earned a spot on because he couldn't afford the cost during the shutdown.",
      "\u201cAir traffic controllers have to have 100% of focus 100% of the time,\u201d Daniels said Tuesday at a news conference alongside Duffy at LaGuardia Airport in New York. \u201cAnd I\u2019m watching air traffic controllers going to work. I\u2019m getting the stories. They\u2019re worried about paying for medicine for their daughter. I got a message from a controller that said, 'I\u2019m running out of money. And if she doesn\u2019t get the medicine she needs, she dies. That\u2019s the end.'\u201d",
      "The FAA restricts the number of flights landing and taking off at an airport anytime there is a shortage of controllers to ensure safety. Most of the time that has meant delays \u2014 sometimes hours long \u2014 at airports like New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport or Burbank airport in California. But over the weekend, Los Angeles International Airport actually had to stop all flights for nearly two hours.",
      "Controllers are planning to assemble outside at least 17 airports nationwide Tuesday to hand out leaflets urging an end to the shutdown as soon as possible. Worrying about how to pay their bills is driving some to take second jobs to make ends meet.",

      "The number of controllers calling in sick has increased during the shutdown both because of their frustration with the situation and because controllers need the time off to work second jobs instead of continuing to work six days a week like many of them routinely do. Duffy has said that controllers could be fired if they abuse their sick time, but the vast majority of them have continued to show up for work every day.",
      "Air traffic controller Joe Segretto, who works at a regional radar facility that directs planes in and out of airports in the New York area, said morale is suffering as controllers worry more about money.",
      "\u201cThe pressure is real,\u201d Segretto said. \"We have people trying to keep these airplanes safe. We have trainees \u2014 that are trying to learn a new job that is very fast-paced, very stressful, very complex \u2014 now having to worry about how they\u2019re going to pay bills.\"",
      "Duffy said the shutdown is also making it harder for the government to reduce the longstanding shortage of about 3,000 controllers. He said that some students have dropped out of the air traffic controller academy in Oklahoma City, and younger controllers who are still training to do the job might abandon the career because they can't afford to go without pay.",
      "\u201cThis shutdown is making it harder for me to accomplish those goals,\u201d Duffy said.",
      "The longer the shutdown continues, pressure will continue to build on Congress to reach an agreement to reopen the government. During the 35-day shutdown in President Donald Trump's first term the disruptions to flights across the country contributed to the end of that disruption. But so far, Democrats and Republicans have shown little sign of reaching a deal to fund the government.",

      "It's a game-changing piece of news for Olympic athletes, most of whom toil in obscurity outside of the two weeks the lights go on at the Games, and many of whom live in or near poverty: According to the foundation, some 57% of U.S. athletes earn $50,000 or less a year.",

      "MILAN -- With 100 days to go, northern Italy is gearing up to host the Milan-Cortina Olympics, the most spread-out Winter Games in history.",
      "The two main clusters of the Games are Milan \u2014 the beating heart of Italy\u2019s industrial north \u2014 and Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo, an upscale winter resort in the Dolomites mountain range. Visitors should expect a full day of travel between the two locations, which are more than 400 kilometers (250) miles apart by road.",
      "In addition, athletes will compete in three other mountain clusters, while the closing ceremony will be held in Verona, the largest city in the northeastern Veneto region.",
      "The games will mostly make use of existing infrastructure, though some venues are being renovated or built from scratch. Here\u2019s a closer look at the venues:",
      "SAN SIRO STADIUM: The opening ceremony will be held in Milan\u2019s iconic 80,000-seat San Siro stadium, home of the city\u2019s two famous soccer teams \u2014 AC Milan and Inter Milan. It will be a last hurrah for the historic venue, which is set to be demolished and replaced by a new teams-owned stadium after the games.",
      "SANTAGIULIA ICE HOCKEY ARENA: The timeline is tight for the new 16,000-seat arena that will serve as the main hockey venue for the games. A test event scheduled for December had to be moved, but organisers are confident that it will be completed by the end of the year. New test events have been set for Jan. 9-11 \u2014 less than a month before the first puck is dropped at the Olympics. The multipurpose facility, which is being built by private investors, is slated to become Italy\u2019s largest indoor arena and is a majestic sight to those arriving into the southeastern periphery of Milan.",
      "ICE PARK: While the ice hockey finals will be held in the Santagiulia Arena, some matches will take place in the Fiera Milano exhibition venue, which will also host the speed skating. The trade fair complex, which opened in 2005 in the northwest of Milan, will use temporary structures for the games. The so-called Ice Park will occupy four pavilions of the huge exhibition center and comprise the Speed Skating Stadium and the Rho Ice Hockey Arena, which still needs to be completed. The Speed Skating Stadium was delivered in August and the work to lay down the ice was set to start on Wednesday.",
      "ICE SKATING ARENA: Short-track speed skating and figure skating events will take place in the Forum di Milano, a multipurpose facility that is mainly used for basketball, ice hockey and tennis as well as live concerts. The 12,500-capacity venue in the southwestern outskirts of Milan was opened in 1990 and renovated in 2017, the year before it hosted the figure skating world championships.",
      "TOFANE ALPINE SKIING CENTER: Regularly referred to as the queen or the pearl of the Dolomites, Cortina hosted the Winter Olympics in 1956. The Olympia delle Tofane course will be the site of the women\u2019s Alpine skiing next year. The iconic slope is a regular stop on the women\u2019s World Cup circuit and also held the world championships in 2021.",
      "CURLING OLYMPIC STADIUM: Curling will take place in the Olympic Ice Stadium, one of the legacies of the 1956 Games, when it also hosted the opening ceremony. The arena \u2014 and Cortina in general \u2014 also served as a filming location for the 1981 James Bond film \u201cFor Your Eyes Only,\u201d starring Roger Moore.",
      "CORTINA SLIDING CENTER: The century-old sliding center in Cortina has been completely rebuilt for the 2026 Games at a cost of 118 million euros ($123 million) amid staunch opposition from the International Olympic Committee. The timeframe was so tight that it necessitated a Plan B option that would have required moving bobsled, luge and skeleton events all the way to Lake Placid, New York. However, it appears the gamble has paid off with the IOC even saying recently that the venue has \u201csurpassed expectations.\u201d The track secured preliminary certification in March and test events are taking place through November. Completion of the roofing and all the facilities next to the track is scheduled for Nov. 5.",

The Stelvio Ski Center will also be the venue for ski mountaineering, which will be making its Olympic debut. Bormio is about 200 kilometers (120 miles) northeast of Milan.",
      "Livigno, about an hour's drive north of Bormio, will host the sports that are perhaps most popular among young people. Snowboarding and freestyle skiing will be held at Livigno Snow Park and Livigno Aerials and Moguls Park, with 26 medals awarded. The small town in Valtellina, near the border with Switzerland, proudly unveiled the Aerials and Moguls Park last December, boasting that it had delivered the first 2026 Olympic venue.",
      "Surrounded by the peaks of the Dolomites, Predazzo will be a stunning setting for the ski jumping events. Predazzo, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of Cortina, is the most populated municipality in Val di Fiemme, an area which has a rich history of hosting Nordic skiing world championships and World Cup races. The ski jumping facility spans an area of 3,000 square meters (32,000 square feet) and consists of two main ramps for international competitions as well as training ramps and other equipped spaces for athletes.",
      "Tesero, less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Predazzo, will host the cross-country skiing events. The cross-country skiing stadium was opened in 1990, the year before the area hosted the Nordic World Ski Championships for the first time.",
      "The biathlon competition will be held in Anterselva, nestled in the South Tyrol mountains and with 60 kilometers (40 miles) of tracks. The Anterselva Biathlon Arena has a rich history with the sport, having hosted the world championships multiple times since the 1970s. It also hosts World Cup races every year. The town itself, which is near the border with Austria, has a unique cultural heritage: more than 98% of the population speak German as their mother tongue.",
      "The closing ceremony will take place at the historic Verona Arena, a large Roman amphitheater built almost 2,000 years ago that is mainly used to host large-scale opera performances. It is an imposing presence in the main piazza of Verona, which is a UNESCO world heritage city. Originally built to host 30,000 spectators in ancient Roman times, it currently has a capacity of around half that for its world-famous summer festival. About 15,000 spectators will be allowed for the closing ceremony on Feb. 22.",

      "The dramatic changes in the Arctic are complicating the impact of climate change elsewhere, Cohen added. Some places are now experiencing more severe winter weather with more snow because the rapid warming in the Arctic disrupts the polar vortex, sending frigid air south.",

      "Week 8 in the NFL has been one of the most lopsided since the merger with the AFL in 1970",
      "The typical Sunday in the NFL features slates filled with tight games in the second half, back-and-forth lead changes and several comeback attempts.",
      "That's all part of the parity built into a league with a salary cap, a draft that rewards losing teams and a scheduling formula designed to give the best teams the toughest matchups.",
      "Despite all of that, the drama was missing in a Week 8 that was one of the most lopsided the NFL has seen since the merger with the AFL in 1970.",
      "The 13 games featured only one decided by single digits \u2014 a 39-38 win for the New York Jets against Cincinnati. That's the first time since the final week of the 1970 season that only one game was decided by fewer than 10 points and down dramatically from the average of 8.7 games per week decided by single digits in the first seven weeks and 8.3 per week over the last 10 seasons.",
      "Nine of the games were decided by at least 18 points, marking just the sixth time that has happened in a single week in NFL history and the first since Week 12 of the 2008 season.",
      "There were some blowouts that were somewhat expected based on the pregame betting lines like Indianapolis beating one-win Tennessee 38-14 and Tampa Bay beating one-win New Orleans 23-3.",
      "But even several matchups that figured to be tighter turned into blowouts with Minnesota losing 37-10 to the Chargers, Miami upsetting Atlanta 34-10 and Denver beating Dallas 44-24.",
      "That contributed to the average scoring margin for the week being 18.5 points per game, the highest since Week 15 of the 2012 season (18.7) and the seventh highest of any week since the merger.",
      "Only three games all week had the winning team taking the lead in the second half with the Jets rallying from 15 points down to beat the Bengals, Green Bay coming back from nine points down at the half to beat Pittsburgh 35-25 and Kansas City turning a 7-7 game at the half against Washington into a 28-7 blowout.",
      "The one true comeback was a complete surprise as the winless Jets trailed the Bengals 31-16 at the start of the fourth quarter and seemed headed to their eighth straight loss to open the season.",
      "But two TD runs by Breece Hall and another TD pass by Hall helped New York pull out a 39-38 win and end a streak of 112 straight losses in games the Jets trailed by at least 15 points. The last win came in 2003 against Miami.",
      "Headed into the 2025 season, teams had lost 135 consecutive games in the regular season and playoffs when trailing by at least 15 points at the start of the fourth quarter since Green Bay rallied from 17 down for an 18-17 win over New Orleans on Sept. 24, 2023.",
      "But four teams have engineered such comebacks already this season with Buffalo doing it in Week 1 against Baltimore, Tennessee in Week 5 against Arizona and Denver in Week 7 against the New York Giants. This is the first time that has happened at least four times in any regular season.",
      "This also marked the first time quarterback Justin Fields won a game when his team allowed at least 21 points. Fields had lost his first 26 starts in that scenario. Now Colt McCoy holds the record for most losses without a win when his team allows at least 21 points at 0-19.",
      "Indianapolis' Jonathan Taylor is off to a touchdown scoring stretch that hadn't been done for more than 75 years.",
      "Taylor ran for two scores and caught a TD pass on Sunday for the Colts, for his fourth game this season with at least three touchdowns. The last time any player did that in an entire season came in 2006 when LaDainian Tomlinson did it six times in his MVP season. The only other time a player did it in the first eight games of a season came in 1949 when Gene Roberts pulled it off for the New York Giants.",

      "\u201cYeah, it was awesome,\u201d Bieber said with a wide smile after pitching Toronto over the Los Angeles Dodgers 6-2 on Tuesday night to tie the World Series at two games apiece.",
      "Bieber nearly made his first Fall Classic appearance in the 19th inning Monday, but the Dodgers won 6-5 on Freddie Freeman's 18th-inning home run. Max Scherzer had approached Bieber in the 11th or 12th inning about getting ready to relieve.",
      "\u201cMax is always one step ahead,\u201d Bieber explained. \u201cHe was like, 'Biebs, if this gets squirrely' -- you could tell the wheels were turning \u2014 \u2018and he\u2019s like, \u2019Can you pitch?'\u201d",
      "So Bieber told manager John Schneider and pitching coach Pete Walker he was available, and Bieber warmed up in the 18th.",
      "\u201cI was definitely amped up,\u201d he said. \u201cPotentially, I was thinking about my first big league save, and in the World Series. That would have been very cool.\u201d",
      "Bieber got back to the team hotel at 1 a.m. and dozed off about 45-60 minutes later. But not for long.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t sleep very well,\" he said.",
      "His first batter was Ohtani, who reached nine times on Monday with two homers, two doubles and five walks.",
      "Bieber walked him on a full count with an outside corner changeup that could have been strike three. He struck out Ohtani in the third on a changeup at the outside corner and froze him with a knuckle curve for a called third strike in the fifth, a three-pitch at-bat that left Ohtani shaking his head.",
      "\u201cHe attacked really at the edge and was able to execute location-wise,\" Ohtani said through a translator.",
      "A 30-year-old right-hander who went to high school in nearby Laguna Hills, Bieber was drafted by Cleveland in 2016. He made it to the majors two years later and became an All-Star in 2019. He was a unanimous winner of the AL Cy Young Award for the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, when he led the major leagues with a 1.68 ERA.",
      "He missed more than two months in 2023 with elbow issues, pitched 12 scoreless innings while striking out 20 in his first two outings in 2024, then had Tommy John surgery in April 2024 with Dr. Keith Meister.",

      "\u201cIn speaking with the medical staff in Cleveland and most specifically Dr. Keith Meister in Texas, he\u2019s like, \u2018Hey, it\u2019s very rare for anybody to not have any sort of hiccup, so this was probably always going to happen, and your body\u2019s just telling you it needs a couple days off,\u2019\u201d Bieber recounted. \u201cI was able to get back on track after that.\u201d",

He made seven outings down the stretch, going 4-2 with a 3.57 ERA in helping boost Toronto to its first AL East title since 2015.",
      "As the banged-up Blue Jays pieced together a postseason rotation without injured Jos\u00e9 Berr\u00edos, they slotted Kevin Gausman first, followed by rookie Trey Yesavage, Scherzer and Bieber, shifting Chris Bassitt to the bullpen.",
      "Bieber is 2-0 with a 3.57 ERA in four postseason starts, the last three Blue Jays wins that included victories in Games 3 and 7 of the American League Championship Series against Seattle. His stay with Toronto might be a short one, since he's likely to turn down a player option for 2026 and become a free agent.",
      "\u201cThese are the spots that we acquired him for,\u201d Toronto manager John Schneider said. \u201cIt\u2019s asking a lot of him, based on what he\u2019s been through with the recovery from the surgery and stuff. But he\u2019s enjoying it and he\u2019s embracing it and he\u2019s been a huge part of us getting here.\u201d",

      "If it happens, the deal would mark the end of months of uncertainty about the fate of the popular video-sharing platform in the United States. After wide bipartisan majorities in Congress passed \u2014 and President Joe Biden signed \u2014 a law that would ban TikTok in the U.S. if it did not find a new owner in the place of China's ByteDance, the platform was set to go dark on the law's January deadline. For a several hours, it did. But on his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order to keep it running while his administration tries to reach an agreement for the sale of the company.",
      "Three more executive orders followed, as Trump, without a clear legal basis, continued to extend the deadline for a TikTok deal. The second was in April, when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump\u2019s tariff announcement. The third came in June, then another in September, which Trump said would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States in a way that meets national security concerns.",
      "Trump\u2019s order was meant to enable an American-led group of investors to buy the app from China\u2019s ByteDance, though the deal also requires China\u2019s approval.",
      "However, TikTok deal is \u201cnot really a big thing for Xi Jinping,\u201d said Bonnie Glaser, managing director of the German Marshall Fund's Indo-Pacific program, during a media briefing Tuesday. \u201c(China is) happy to let (Trump) declare that they have finally kept a deal. Whether or not that deal will protect the data of Americans is a big question going forward.\u201d",

      "Among those who said they supported banning the social media platform, about 8 in 10 cited concerns over users\u2019 data security being at risk as a major factor in their decision, according to the report.",

China previously stated the algorithm must remain under Chinese control by law.

      "A doomsday outlook has led the climate community to focus too much on near-term goals to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that cause warming, diverting resources from the most effective things that can be done to improve life in a warming world, Gates said.

      "\u201cIf you think climate is not important, you won\u2019t agree with the memo. If you think climate is the only cause and apocalyptic, you won\u2019t agree with the memo,\u201d Gates said during a roundtable discussion with reporters ahead of the release. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of this pragmatic view of somebody who\u2019s, you know, trying to maximize the money and the innovation that goes to help in these poor countries.\u201d",
      "Every bit of additional warming correlates to more extreme weather, risks species extinction and brings the world closer to crossing tipping points where changes become irreversible, scientists say.",

      "With their distinctive shaggy orange manes, pale blue faces and dense fur covering their hands and feet, it's hard to mistake China's endangered golden snub-nosed monkeys for any other animal.",
      "These rare and charismatic monkeys, unique to the frigid mountains of central China, have recently joined the country's famous pandas as furry envoys to zoos in Europe for the first time \u2014 on loan for 10 years from the same government-overseen group that coordinates official panda exchanges.",
      "As with \u201c panda diplomacy,\u201d some observers cheer new opportunities for scientific and conservation collaboration, while others raise concerns about the welfare of individual animal ambassadors transported around the world.",
      "Three golden monkeys arrived at France\u2019s Beauval Zoo in the city of Saint-Aignan this April, following an agreement to mark the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the People\u2019s Republic of China and France.",

      "While both species are considered national treasures, only monkeys have deep roots in Chinese art and culture, appearing in countless paintings and as characters in classic literature, including the wily Monkey King in the 16th century novel \u201cJourney to the West.\"",

      "In 1972, a pair of pandas was sent to the U.S. for the first time, following President Richard Nixon\u2019s historic visit to Beijing. In 1984, China switched from gifting pandas to loaning them.",
      "Following outcry from animal-rights activists, China ended the practice of short-term loans and began longer leases, usually around a decade. In this arrangement through the China Wildlife Conservation Association, part of the money that an overseas zoo pays annually to China must be earmarked for habitat conservation or scientific research to benefit the species.",

      "In some of the most agriculturally rich regions in the U.S., researchers from San Diego State University are working to understand how climate change is impacting heat in rural areas and the farmworkers who toil in them",
      "In the summers, the sky is jet black when Raul Cruz arrives at this Imperial Valley sugarcane field to start his day. He chops, cleans and bundles the crop, taking heed as the sun rises. It's hard work, but so is starting at 4 a.m., even though he knows it's the safest thing when temperatures in this California desert frequently soar into the triple digits.",
      "\u201cWe just have to because we need to beat the heat,\" said Cruz, who\u2019s worked here for 15 years. They finish work by 9 or 10 a.m. to avoid the risk of heat stroke, he added, but when heat starts creeping up around 8 a.m., \"mentally, it's stressful.\"",
      "The hot climate that makes this Southern California region a farming powerhouse is also what makes it dangerous for farmworkers, who are increasingly vulnerable to rising temperatures due to greenhouse gas emissions from burning coal, oil and natural gas. Researchers from San Diego State University are working to understand the health consequences of heat stress on farmworkers and where heat is most extreme in this rural landscape. They hope their findings can lead to a better understanding of rural heat islands, identify gaps in research and help develop interventions that better protect them in the face of climate change.",
      "\u201cWorkers could potentially be dying or having some serious issues,\" said project leader Nicolas Lopez-Galvez, assistant professor in the School of Public Health at SDSU. \u201cIt\u2019s better to start acting sooner.\"",
      "Since the start of the 20th century, California temperatures have increased almost 3 F (about 1.7 C), according to state and federal data. Warming has accelerated, and seven of the state\u2019s last eight years through 2024 were the warmest on record. While all areas of the state have warmed, Southern California is heating up about twice as fast as Northern California.",
      "Ana Solorio, an organizer with the farmworker advocacy group L\u00edderes Campesinas that is working with researchers, remembered feeling \u201csuffocated\u201d in the Coachella Valley summer heat when she was a farmworker. \"With the humidity, it felt awful,\" said Solorio, who's lived in the Imperial Valley for more than 30 years. The heat was so intense she didn\u2019t return for another season, preferring instead the cooler winter harvesting months of lettuce in the Imperial Valley.",
      "\u201cThis (heat) can cause a lot of harm to their health,\" she said.",
      "Researchers are trying to understand how farmworkers' heat stress might vary depending on the crops, the season and the number of breaks they take.",
      "Over the past two years, they've collected year-round data from some 300 farmworkers. Body sensors measure things like core body temperature and heart rate while they work. Elsewhere in the fields, environmental monitors measure the day's temperature, humidity, wind speed, sun angle and cloud cover, also known as the wet-bulb globe temperature, considered the best metric to understanding heat stress. Using satellite imagery along with historical and current wet-bulb globe temperature data, researchers are mapping areas of extreme heat, particularly in the Imperial and Coachella valleys.",
      "Researchers are learning that ground level crops can expose workers to higher heat levels compared to tree crops, for example, but it also depends on their harvesting months. In the summers, farmworkers who prepare fields for planting or help maintain irrigation systems are also more exposed.",
      "Rural heat can vary based on things like tree cover, proximity to a body of water and empty fields, which may be hotter. \u201cIt creates this island where people might be living or working that are higher in terms of heat stress compared to other places,\u201d said Lopez-Galvez.",

It grows two-thirds of winter vegetables consumed nationally and provides thousands of jobs. From 2023 to 2024 alone, about 17,579 migrant and seasonal farmworkers were employed in Imperial County, according to the state.",
      "It's also extremely hot. In a given year, there are about 123 days with temperatures over 95 F (35 C), often exceeding 110 F (43 C) in August and early September, according to calculations by Sagar Parajuli, research scientist and adjunct faculty with SDSU's geography department. The county has one of the largest Latino populations and the highest number of heat-related illnesses among workers than anywhere else in the state.",
      "Some of their data analysis has already been published.",
      "One study found that irrigating crop fields in the Imperial Valley reduced the wet-bulb globe temperature on summer days, thanks to the cooling effect of evaporating water. But on summer nights, the opposite occurred: irrigation increased the wet-bulb globe temperature as humidity spiked. Irrigation also heightened heat in nearby urban and fallow areas adjacent to crop fields due to moisture transport.",
      "\u201cIt is a concern because an elevated nighttime temperature restricts the ability of farmworkers to cool down,\u201d said Parajuli, the study's lead author. \u201cSo they can\u2019t recover from the heat stress they could be accumulating from the daytime.\"",
      "Through this research, the authors were able to recommend how frequently farmworkers should take rest breaks to protect themselves from heat stress, based on how often wet-bulb globe temperatures exceed safety thresholds across seasons and work shifts. While California has heat rules, they're not strictly enforced, he added.",
      "\u201cWe realized that farmworkers are not getting enough rest breaks, and also there are no clear policy guidelines in terms of heat-related rest breaks,\" he said.",

      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union on Friday said Meta and TitTok had breached their transparency obligations after an investigation that could result in billions of dollars in fines.",
      "The inquiry found both companies had violated the Digital Services Act, the EU\u2019s trailblazing digital rule book that imposes a set of strict requirements designed to keep internet users safe online, including making it easier to report counterfeit or unsafe goods or flag harmful or illegal content like hate speech, as well as a ban on ads targeted at children.",

That means platforms must empower users, respect their rights, and open their systems to scrutiny. The DSA makes this a duty, not a choice.\u201d",
      "The 27-nation bloc launched investigations in 2024 into both Meta and TikTok. They found that the companies did not allow easy access to data for researchers. They also found that Meta's Instagram and Facebook did not make it easy for users to flag illegal content and effectively challenge moderation decisions. \u201cAllowing researchers access to platforms\u2019 data is an essential transparency obligation under the DSA, as it provides public scrutiny into the potential impact of platforms on our physical and mental health,\u201d according to a statement by the European Commission, the EU's executive body. The inquiry found both Facebook and Instagram deployed \u201cdark patterns\u201d or deceptive interface designs for its protocol for flagging malicious content like child sex abuse or terrorist content. That led to a kind of obfuscation, with the Commission saying it was \u201cconfusing and dissuading\u201d and \u201cmay therefore be ineffective.\u201d",

TikTok said Friday that it would review the findings but said that the transparency obligations of the DSA conflict with the EU's strict privacy rules, the General Data Protection Regulation. \"If it is not possible to fully comply with both, we urge regulators to provide clarity on how these obligations should be reconciled,\u201d said Paolo Ganino, a spokesperson for TikTok.",

      "News stories in recent weeks about offensive or ill-advised text messages have blown up the careers of several young Republicans in a chat group, led a nominee for a White House job to drop out, threatened the campaign of a Democrat running for Virginia attorney general and embarrassed a federal prosecutor.",
      "Memories are still fresh of this spring's inadvertent inclusion of a journalist on a Signal chain where Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other leaders discussed military strikes, possibly the second Trump administration's most embarrassing moment.",
      "For journalists, it's something else entirely. Bad smartphone behavior is fertile ground for reporters seeking insight into people who look to lead us \u2014 and presents a challenge to nail down stories when \u201cthat's fake\u201d looms as a default defense.",
      "Paul Ingrassia, who was President Donald Trump's pick to lead the Office of Special Counsel, withdrew his name from consideration Tuesday. His Senate support had crumbled following Politico's Oct. 20 report that Ingrassia said in a text chain that he had a \u201cNazi streak\u201d and believed the federal holiday honoring the birth of Martin Luther King Jr. should be tossed into hell.",
      "Less than a week earlier, Politico exposed a Telegram chat group with leaders of youthful Republican groups across the country involved in casually racist and violent talk. So far, the outlet says seven people have lost jobs due to the story.",
      "\u201cPart of the reason this is such an important line of coverage for Politico right now is it gives readers as close to an unfiltered look at the way powerful people think and express themselves in private as they're going to get,\u201d said Alex Burns, its senior executive editor.",
      "He described texts as one of the few remaining frontiers of inadvertent authenticity. They recall past moments of infamy, like when President Richard Nixon made the ill-advised decision to tape his White House conversations, transcripts of which brought the phrase \u201cexpletive deleted\u201d into the American lexicon.",
      "There are countless cringeworthy moments caught on \u201chot\u201d microphones, such as during the Cold War with the Soviet Union, when President Ronald Reagan joked before a 1984 radio address that \u201cwe begin bombing in five minutes.\" Most public figures now know that virtually everyone around them carries a video camera-equipped smartphone.",
      "Some of the recently-unearthed text messages \u2014 Black people called monkeys or \u201cwatermelon people,\u201d images of gas chambers or urinating on the graves of opponents \u2014 are stunning and dark. You can't help but wonder: what were they thinking? Were they thinking?",
      "Probably not, in part because texting is such a ubiquitous, low-friction form of communication in today's world, said Cal Newton, professor of computer science at Georgetown University. Guards that people have up when talking with other people \u2014 be reasonable, civil, careful \u2014 are often missing.",
      "Some parts of our brain \u201cdon't recognize text on a glowing piece of glass as \u2018I\u2019m in a conversation with other people,'\u201d Newton said. Bad impulses, and the tendency to amplify or exaggerate, slip out because they can't see reactions.",
      "Still, it's not like people don't understand, on some level, that they're communicating on a medium where conversations can be saved on screen shots. There were nervous warning signs in some of the chats: \u201cIf we ever had a leak of this chat we would be cooked,\u201d one young Republican said.",

      "Beyond texts, Burns said Politico is in the market for other insightful open source reporting, such as audio, video or behind-the-scenes memos. He would not say whether the Ingrassia texts came as direct result of how Politico handled its previous story, but he believes his outlet has proven it has handled these stories responsibly.",

      "Elon Musk literally left a government job with a black eye, has seen profits at his car company sink and must worry about federal regulators disrupting his plans to unleash a fleet of driverless taxis on America's roads in the next few years",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 If someone left a government job with a black eye, literally, ran a company with shrinking profits, and suddenly had federal investigators crawling over their business, you might say they\u2019re having a bad year.",
      "But most people are not Elon Musk.",
      "The world\u2019s richest man has only gotten richer this year and shareholders at Tesla, his electric car company, may make him wealthier yet by approving a trillion-dollar pay package in a bet he will succeed with new plans for a \u201crobot army\u201d and other technological breakthroughs even as some past promises remain unfulfilled.",
      "\u201cThe genius of Elon Musk is keeping investors focused on what the company might look in like 5 or 10 years \u2014 while ignoring very near-term challenges,\u201d marvels Garrett Nelson of CFRA Research. Or put more bluntly by Zacks Investment's Brian Mulberry, \"Your average CEO would likely not survive this.\"",
      "Musk started out the year with a side hustle \u2014 promising to cut $2 trillion in government spending as head of President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, before cutting that pledge in half. In the end, DOGE posted only $240 billion in savings, according to its own notoriously unreliable estimates, and it's not even clear those savings will hold as the Trump administration scrambles to refill many essential jobs DOGE cut that it shouldn't have.",
      "\u201cThere is a pattern of them announcing great big firings, and then turning about and saying, \u2019No, that\u2019s a mistake,\u2019\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, a Brookings Institute senior fellow who has compiled a list of 17,000 positions being refilled. \u201cThey cut without a plan, without regard to function.\u201d",
      "Musk used the same slash-and-burn tactics after he took over Twitter and evidence of that backfiring has emerged this year, too.",
      "In the past two months, he\u2019s settled a pair of lawsuits filed by 2,000 former Twitter employees and executives alleging that they were pushed out under false pretenses or never given severance as promised. The amount the ex-workers got was undisclosed, but if they received even a fraction of the combined $628 million they were demanding, the cost will cut deeply for a company whose advertising has plunged since his takeover.",
      "More bad news for Musk came Wednesday when Tesla announced earnings had plunged 37% in the third quarter. Vehicle sales rose 6% as customers rushed to take advantage of a federal tax credit before it expired last month, but the figure for the full year is expected to drop significantly as car buyers turned off by Musk's right-wing political stances have boycotted the business.",
      "This time a year ago Musk was telling investors sales could grow 20% to 30%.",
      "The stock fell earlier this year as the bad news piled up. But after Musk appeared in the Oval Office in May for his farewell to DOGE sporting a shiner, it has doubled and is now posting a year-to-date gain of nearly 9% after the close of regular trading Wednesday. His net worth has also jumped \u2014 up $62 billion this year to $483 billion, according to Forbes magazine.",

      "But there are big questions surrounding these endeavors, particularly the driverless cabs.",
      "Musk's robotaxis, which began picking up passengers in Austin, Texas, and San Francisco this summer, can\u2019t yet be called driverless because they still require \u201csafety monitors\u201d who are ready to seize control in case something goes wrong, which occasionally happens. One of them drove down the opposing lane, for example.",

      "Musk has disappointed before, talking big and missing deadlines repeatedly, only to deliver for shareholders eventually. Tesla investors who held on through a tough 2018 as the company struggled to produce its Model 3 vehicle at a profit, eventually saw their stock soar as sales jumped.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Researchers have unearthed a spooky pair of dinosaur mummies that seem to have been preserved in an unexpected way.",
      "These dinosaur remains are different from the wrapped mummies of Egypt or natural human mummies that get accidentally preserved in bogs or deserts. Mummified dinosaurs are so old that their skin and soft tissues fossilize. Scientists use these rare remnants, along with dinosaur bones, to recreate what these prehistoric creatures may have looked like.",

      "Many of them \u2014 including a duck-billed dinosaur mummy discovered in 1908 \u2014 hail from an area in eastern Wyoming. In the new study, scientists returned to this so-called mummy zone and found new remains, including the mummy of a duck-billed dinosaur that was only a few years old when it died.",
      "\u201cThis is the first juvenile of a dinosaur that really is mummified,\u201d said Paul Sereno, a University of Chicago paleontologist who was involved in the discovery.",
      "Surprisingly, the new mummies seem to have been preserved without any evidence of fossilized skin. Instead, they left impressions of their skin and scales on a thin layer of clay that hardened with help from microbes.",
      "This style of mummification has preserved other organisms before, but scientists didn't think it could happen on land. It\u2019s possible that other mummies found at the Wyoming site could have formed in a similar way, Sereno said.",

      "\u201cEver since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions. The issue is just the lingering effect of it,\" Naroditsky said, adding that Kramnik used to be one of his \u201cheroes.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s not the first time Kramnik has been accused of harassment. The popular internet chess server Chess.com shut down Kramnik\u2019s blog on the site in 2023, saying he had used it to spread baseless allegations about \u201cmany dozens of players.\u201d",
      "The following year, Kramnik published a list of players on social media with the title \u201cCheating Tuesdays\u201d that included Czech grandmaster David Navara. Navara later shared on his blog that Kramnik\u2019s public accusations had pushed him to consider suicide. Kramnik responded by accusing Navara of defamation.",

      "For little ghosts, witches, KPop Demon Hunters and superheroes, Halloween is one of the most exciting nights of the year",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 For little ghosts, witches, KPop Demon Hunters and superheroes, Halloween is one of the most exciting nights of the year. But it's also one of the busiest for parents as they try to keep track of their trick-or-treaters, give out candy and watch over their homes.",
      "Fortunately, there are some tech tricks out there that can help families stay safe this Halloween, and have a little more fun too.",
      "If your children are outfitted with Apple or Google-branded smart phones or watches or tracking tags, you can use the Find My or Family Link apps to keep tabs on them as they embark on their candy journeys. But don't think of these apps as basic. Because branded peripherals \u2014 like Apple Air Tags or Pixel smartwatches \u2014 are built to be used with Apple and Google platforms, their tracking platforms can be more reliable than some third-party services.",
      "One trick I discovered last Halloween is that I can set up a geofence with Find My. This gave my kids a little more freedom to navigate a set trick-or-treating area while I struggled to keep up with them. If anyone broke from the pack and left the designated area, I would get a notification. Here's how to set it up:",
      "Go to the Find My app on your iPhone. Scroll and tap on the name of the person or device you want to be notified about. Below notifications, tap \u201cAdd,\u201d then \u201cNotify me.\u201d Continue through the menu options until you get to a location option. Choose \u201cNew Location\u201d and you will be given the option to set a location radius. Then you will be asked how often you wish to be notified if the tracked individual leaves the area.",
      "Next is a critical step if you wish to set a recurring notification. Unless it's an air tag, your child must give a one-time authorization to the request. They will receive an alert asking for approval when they arrive at or leave the location you chose for the first time.",
      "Google users have a similar geofencing option. First, you need to set up a new Family Location in the Family Link app. Then select your child in the main menu of the app and tap Family Locations, add the place you just created and select how often you'd like to be notified when they enter or exit the area.",
      "If you have a smart doorbell installed on your front door, you can have a little extra fun with visiting trick-or-treaters by adding spooky messages and specialized chimes.",

      "For those with Eufy Doorbells, navigate to your app and select your doorbell. A Voice Response list should include selectable Halloween-themed effects and chimes. You can also take advantage of a message recording function in more recent doorbell models to create your own, hopefully scary, response.",
      "Nest and Google home users should be able to use their app to select a Halloween setting under Doorbell Themes (Google was updating Nest in October so your menu may be different from mine).",
      "One unrelated tip for smart doorbell users, you may want to lower your motion sensitivity just for Halloween. If your device isn't hardwired, the extra motion from trick-or-treaters could drain your doorbell's batteries quickly (as I discovered). You can also avoid a flood of notifications if you do so.",
      "Smart phones have flashlights, sure, but they're not the brightest nor are they the best option if you're carrying jackets, candy baskets, water bottles or costume parts. Instead, give yourself or your children more portable lumens so they can see (and be seen) easily in the dark.",
      "There are plenty of options for all budget ranges, but I'm partial to lights that you can clip onto jackets or costumes to keep your hands free.",

      "Amid the Trump Administration's focus on mass deportation, Vedam's lawyers must persuade an immigration court that a 1980s drug conviction should be outweighed by the years he wrongly spent in prison. For a time, immigration law allowed people who had reformed their lives to seek such waivers. Vedam never pursued it then because of the murder conviction.",
      "\u201cHe was someone who\u2019s suffered a profound injustice,\u201d said immigration lawyer Ava Benach. \u201c(And) those 43 years aren\u2019t a blank slate. He lived a remarkable experience in prison.\u201d",
      "Vedam earned several degrees behind bars, tutored hundreds of fellow inmates and went nearly half a century with just a single infraction, involving rice brought in from the outside.",
      "His lawyers hope immigration judges will consider the totality of his case. The administration, in a brief filed Friday, opposes the effort. So Vedam remains at an 1,800-bed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in central Pennsylvania.",

      "Vedam was detained on drug charges while police investigated, and was ultimately charged with murder. He was convicted in 1983 and sentenced to life without parole. To resolve the drug case, he pleaded no contest to four counts of selling LSD and a theft charge. The 1988 retrial offered no reprieve from his situation.",
      "Although the defense long questioned the ballistics evidence in the case, the jury, which heard that Vedam had bought a .25-caliber gun from someone, never heard that an FBI report suggested the bullet wound was too small to have been fired from that gun. Balachandran only found that report as he dug into the case in 2023.",

      "TOKYO -- U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday welcomed Japan's determination to accelerate its ongoing military buildup and defense spending.",
      "During a visit to Japan, Hegseth said he hopes to see those pledges implemented as soon as possible, noting China's increasingly assertive military activity.",
      "\u201cThe threats we face are real, and they are urgent. China's unprecedented military buildup and its aggressive military actions speak for themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cMake no mistake about it, our alliance is critical to deterring Chinese military aggression, to responding to regional contingencies, and keeping our countries safe.\"",
      "Hegseth said he was \u201cglad\u201d to see Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi \u2014 speaking alongside U.S. President Donald Trump this week \u2014 make a commitment to increase Japan's defense spending, calling it \u201cwonderful.\u201d",
      "He said the U.S. government had not demanded Japan\u2019s spending increase.",
      "His comment comes a day after Takaichi, who became prime minister only last week, explained to Trump during their first summit that her government will raise Japan's defense spending to 2% of its gross national product by March, two years ahead of initially planned. Japan also plans to revise its ongoing national security strategy several years ahead of schedule.",
      "\u201cIt's an important step forward, and one that we hope would be implemented and believe will be as soon as possible,\u201d Hegseth told a joint news conference after holding talks with Japanese Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi. \u201cThe result, through our shared strength, will deter threats.\"",

      "These efforts mark a historic shift from Japan's longstanding policy of limiting use of force to self-defense only under a pacifist Constitution written after World War II.",
      "It made a major break from that policy under the 2022 security strategy that calls for more offensive roles for Japan\u2019s Self-Defense Forces and easing restrictions on arms exports. The Takaichi government is also seeking to further relax weapons transfers.",

      "Prosecutors are seeking 55-year prison terms for Rafat Amirov, 46, and Polad Omarov, 41, at their sentencing on Wednesday in Manhattan federal court. Prosecutors said Amirov, of Iran, and Omarov, of Georgia, were crime bosses in the Russian mob.",

      "A federal trial over whether President Donald Trump can deploy the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, is set to begin Wednesday",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- A federal trial over whether President Donald Trump can deploy the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, is set to begin Wednesday, with local police officials expected to testify that federal agents at the city\u2019s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building have inflamed protests in recent weeks through excessive force.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, will preside over the trial in Portland. The trial stems from a lawsuit filed by the city and state against the Trump administration in a bid to block the troop deployment.",
      "Immergut has already issued two temporary restraining orders in the case blocking the troops pending further litigation. She found that Trump had failed to show that he had met the conditions set out by Congress for using the military domestically. She described his assessment of the situation in Portland, which Trump called \u201cwar ravaged,\u201d as \u201csimply untethered to the facts.\u201d",
      "One of Immergut's orders was paused last week by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Court of Appeals. But late Tuesday the appeals court vacated that decision and said it would rehear the case before an 11-judge panel.",
      "The complex case comes as Democratic cities targeted by Trump for military involvement \u2014 including Chicago, which has filed a separate lawsuit on the issue \u2014 seek to push back. They argue the president has not met the legal requirements to deploy troops and that doing so would violate states\u2019 sovereignty. The administration argues that it needs the troops because protests have impeded law enforcement operations.",
      "Portland\u2019s ICE building outside downtown has been the site of nightly protests that peaked in June when police declared one demonstration a riot. Smaller clashes have also occurred since then, and federal officers have fired tear gas to clear crowds, which at times have included counterprotesters and live-streamers.",
      "During the trial, witnesses are expected to take the stand for both sides and face cross-examination. The federal defendants will call officials from ICE, the Defense Department and the Federal Protective Service, the agency that provides security for federal buildings.",
      "The administration argues that it has had to shuffle Department of Homeland Security agents from elsewhere around the country to respond to the protests, showing that it has been unable to enforce the law with regular forces \u2014 one of the conditions set by Congress for calling out the National Guard. It has also characterized the protests as a \u201crebellion\" or \u201cdanger of rebellion\u201d \u2014 another of the conditions.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s deployment of the nation\u2019s most advanced aircraft carrier to South America is pulling the ship out of the Mediterranean Sea",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's decision to shift the nation's most advanced aircraft carrier to South America in his campaign against drug cartels is pulling the ship out of the Mediterranean Sea at a time when a tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has been threatened by new strikes in Gaza.",
      "The U.S. is set to be in the fairly unusual position of having only a single aircraft carrier deployed and none in the waters off both Europe and the Middle East. The change is especially stark after the U.S. joined Israeli strikes on Iran in June and has engaged in some of the most intense combat operations since World War II against Yemen's Houthi rebels in the Red Sea.",
      "Aircraft carriers, with their thousands of sailors and dozens of warplanes, have long been recognized as one of the ultimate signifiers of U.S. military might and the nation's foreign policy priorities. There have been five carrier deployments to the Middle East since the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, including two carriers in the region at multiple points this year and last.",
      "The new orders for the USS Gerald R. Ford illustrate the Trump administration\u2019s increasing focus on the Western Hemisphere and mark a major escalation of firepower as the U.S. military ramps up fatal strikes on alleged drug boats. With a buildup of warships, aircraft and troops already in the region, Trump himself has signaled what could be next.",
      "Speaking from another aircraft carrier, the USS George Washington, in its home port of Japan, Trump noted the U.S. attacks at sea and reiterated that \"now we\u2019ll stop the drugs coming in by land.\u201d",
      "Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a retired Marine colonel, questioned how long the Ford would be able to remain in South America, when only three of the 11 U.S. aircraft carriers are typically out to sea.",
      "\u201cIt's such a powerful and scarce resource, there will be a lot of pressure to do something or send it elsewhere,\u201d Cancian said. \u201cYou can imagine the peace negotiations breaking down in the eastern Mediterranean or something happening with Iran.\u201d",
      "The USS Nimitz also is deployed but is heading home from the South China Sea to the West Coast before being decommissioned. It recently lost two aircraft \u2014 a fighter jet and a helicopter \u2014 in separate crashes that are under investigation. A third carrier, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, is not deployed but is conducting exercises off the coast of San Diego.",
      "The shift is happening just as violence has flared up again in Gaza despite a ceasefire that Trump helped broker after two years of war. The Israeli army launched a barrage of attacks Tuesday as tensions with Hamas grew two weeks into the fragile ceasefire.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. military's growing presence near Venezuela and its 13 fatal strikes on alleged drug boats have stoked fears that Trump could try to topple authoritarian President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who faces charges of narcoterrorism in the U.S.",
      "In response to questions about the speculation, Secretary of State Marco Rubio insisted Saturday that the U.S. is taking part in a counterdrug operation. And he again accused Maduro\u2019s government of participating in the shipment of narcotics.",

The Navy already has eight warships in the region \u2014 three destroyers, three amphibious assault ships, a cruiser and a smaller littoral combat ship that\u2019s designed for coastal waters. It was not clear if all five of the destroyers in the Ford strike group would make the journey.",

The U.S. military also sent a squadron of F-35B Lightning II fighter jets to an airstrip in Puerto Rico and recently flew a pair of supersonic, heavy bombers up to the coast of Venezuela.",
      "The administration says the military has killed at least 57 people in the strikes against vessels accused of transporting drugs.

      "WASHINGTON -- Stewart McLaurin knew it was coming.",
      "An entire wing of the White House, a building he calls \u201cthe most special, important building on the planet,\u201d was going to be replaced to make way for a ballroom that President Donald Trump wants to add to the building.",
      "But when McLaurin, president of the White House Historical Association, saw the first images of backhoes tearing into the East Wing, it still came as a bit of a shock.",
      "\u201cWhen the reality of things happen, they strike us a little bit differently than the theory of things happening, so it was a bit of a jarring moment,\u201d McLaurin told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview Tuesday.",
      "McLaurin, who has led the nonprofit, nonpartisan organization for more than a decade, did not take a position on the changes. It\u2019s not his job. \u201cOurs is not to make happen, or to keep from happening \u2014 but to document what does happen, what happens in this great home that we call the White House,\u201d he said.",
      "But he said he sees a silver lining from the \u201cjarring\u201d images: they have piqued public interest in White House history.",
      "\u201cWhat has happened since then is so amazing in that in the past two weeks, more people have been talking about White House history, focused on White House history, learning what is an East Wing, what is the West Wing ... what are these spaces in this building that we simply call the White House,\u201d McLaurin said.",
      "The general public became aware of the demolition work on Oct. 20 after photos of construction equipment ripping into the building began to circulate online, prompting an outcry from Democrats, preservationists and others.",
      "In a matter of days, the entire two-story East Wing \u2014 the traditional base of operations for first ladies and their staffs \u2014 was gone. The demolition included a covered walkway between the White House, the family movie theater and a garden dedicated to first lady Jacqueline Kennedy.",
      "Trump had talked about building a ballroom for years, and pushed ahead with his vision when he returned to office in January. His proposal calls for a 90,000-square-foot structure, almost twice the size of the 55,000-square-foot White House itself and able to accommodate 1,000 people. The plan also includes building a more modern East Wing, officials have said.",
      "The Republican president ordered the demolition despite not yet having sign-off for the ballroom construction from the National Capital Planning Commission, one of several entities with a role in approving additions to federal buildings and property. The White House has yet to submit the ballroom plans for the commission's review because it is closed during the government shutdown.",
      "Trump appointed loyalists to the planning commission in July. On Tuesday, he also fired the six members of the Commission of Fine Arts, a group of architectural experts that advises the federal government on historic preservation and public buildings. A new slate of members who are more aligned with Trump\u2019s policies will be named, a White House official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly on personnel decisions. The Washington Post was first to report the firings.",
      "It was the job of the White House curator and their staff to carefully remove, catalogue and store the art, the official portraits of former first ladies, and furnishings from the East Wing, McLaurin said.",
      "The White House Historical Association does not have a decision-making role in the construction. But it has been working with the White House to prepare for the changes.",

      "Working with the curator and chief usher, the association used 3D scanning technology \u201cso that every room, space, nook and cranny of the East Wing, whether it was molding or hinges or door knobs or whatever it was, was captured to the -nth degree\" to be digitally recreated as an exhibit or to teach the history of that space, McLaurin said.",
      "A photographer also documented the building as it was being taken apart.",
      "It will be a while before any images are available, but McLaurin said items were found when flooring was pulled up and when wall coverings were pulled back that \u201cno living person remembered were there. So those will be lessons in history.\"",
      "Trump's aides have responded to criticism of the demolition by arguing that other presidents have made changes to the White House, too. Trump has said the White House needs a bigger entertaining space.",
      "McLaurin said the building continues to evolve from what it looked like when it was built in 1792.",
      "\u201cThere is a need to modernize and to grow,\" he said, noting that White House social secretaries for generations have chafed at the space limitations for entertaining. \u201cBut how it's done and how it's accomplished and what results is really the vision of the president who undertakes that project.\u201d",
      "Jacqueline Kennedy created the historical association in 1961 to help preserve the museum quality of the interior of the White House and educate the public. It receives no government funding and raises money mostly through private donations and sales of retail merchandise.",
      "It is not the mission of the association to take a position on construction, McLaurin said. Its primary mandate is preserving the State Floor and some of the historic bedrooms upstairs in the private living quarters, and teaching the history of the White House, which is an accredited museum. The State Floor is made up of the Green, Blue and Red Rooms, the East Room and State Dining Room, the Cross Hall and Grand Foyer.",

      "The podcast is one of many projects Honnold is involved in amid the growing threats to public lands in the U.S., denial of climate change and questioning of science.",
      "\u201cI interview guests who are very passionate about what they do and very good at what they do, and I typically come out of the interviews feeling all fired up, basically to do what I do, but do it a little better,\u201d Honnold said.",
      "But still a climber at heart, Honnold is also training to climb Taiwan's tallest skyscraper without a rope next year for a live Netflix event, a building he's been eyeing for over a decade, he said.",
      "Honnold's foray into environmental work began with a nonprofit he founded in 2012 to fund community solar energy projects around the world. He was climbing and living in a van, and felt like he should be \u201cdoing something useful for the world,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t be a professional climber without caring about protecting nature,\u201d Honnold said.",
      "As he traveled to far-flung places looking for different things to climb, he saw a pressing need for energy access, not just to decrease reliance on fossil fuels but getting rural communities reliable energy access for the first time.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t care about nature unless their basic needs are met,\u201d Honnold said. \u201cThey\u2019ll cut down the last tree in the whole region if it means they can boil water for their family. So obviously you need to meet people\u2019s basic needs first before you can try to protect a place environmentally.\u201d",

      "ATLANTA -- A $180,000 Range Rover customized for NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal was stolen in Georgia earlier this month, and law enforcement is still on the hunt for it.",
      "The Lumpkin County Sheriff's Office in northeast Georgia said investigators believe the SUV was taken from a local fabrication business and brought to the metro Atlanta area last week. The car was supposed to be transported to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, for the basketball star to use while he was in town for a Louisiana State University game, but it never arrived, CBS News Atlanta reported.",
      "Investigators have identified multiple potential suspects and obtained several search warrants.",
      "A spokesperson for California-based Effortless Motors, which customized the car and has worked with O'Neal since 2023, told CBS News Atlanta that FirstLine Trucking LLC, which was responsible for transporting the car, said the company's system was hacked.",

    "story": [
      "In widely expected job cuts after completing its $8 billion merger with Skydance, Paramount has begun layoffs set to impact about 2,000 employees.",
      "Paramount initiated roughly 1,000 of those layoffs companywide on Wednesday (Paramount Skydance owns CBS News.) The rest of the cuts are expected to be made at a later date. In all, 2,000 job reductions amount to about 10% of Paramount's total workforce.",
      "\"These decisions are never made lightly, especially given their effect on our colleagues who have made meaningful contributions to the company,\" CEO David Ellison wrote Wednesday in a memo to employees.",
      "The prospect of job cuts has hovered over Paramount employees for some time. Ellison on Wednesday reiterated that the company has been working to restructure since the completion of its merger in August, and noted that workforce cuts are \"part of that process.\"",
      "It's not uncommon for businesses to initiate layoffs following a merger. When Skydance completed its purchase of Paramount, the combined company said it would look for \"opportunities to streamline its business.\" Paramount is also rumored to have interest in buying Warner Bros. Discovery, the home of HBO, CNN and DC Studios, among other brands.",
      "Neither Paramount nor Warner has publicly confirmed talks. But Warner earlier this month signaled that it may be open to selling all or parts of its business\u00a0in light of \"unsolicited interest\" it said it had received from multiple parties. The company has\u00a0reportedly been resistant to Paramount's initial approach. According to CNBC, which cited anonymous sources, Warner had rejected three offers from Paramount as of last week.",

      "Morgan plays Frank Crutchfield, a widowed father of two adult kids who move back into the family home in New York City's Harlem. It's a spinoff of the hit CBS show \"The Neighborhood.\"",
      "\"Prepping my whole life, man. I've got kids. My real wife died, Sabina. She passed away eight years ago. I \u2026 knew this role. I know this guy,\" Morgan said in an interview with \"CBS Mornings\" that aired on Wednesday.",
      "Morgan's ex-wife Sabina, who was his high school sweetheart, died of cancer in 2016.",
      "\"I was with her in the hospital the day she closed her eyes and I said, 'I love you. I miss you and please forgive me for any hurt I've ever caused you and I will see you again.'\"",

      "Humor has helped the comedian through some of life's most demanding moments, all while he built one of comedy's most impressive resumes. Morgan found comfort in commanding an audience, standing out in everything he put his fingers on, including \"Saturday Night Live.\"",
      "\"When I first got there, I felt socially pushed away,\" he said. \"Because it is like the whitest show in the world and I didn't want no one to portray me in a way that wasn't true. It was like I had the whole Black community on my back.\"",
      "Morgan said then he had a conversation with the show's creator and producer Lorne Michaels, which changed everything.",

      "\"I just thank the Lord that I'm alive and I'm here and \u2026 I move on,\" he said.",

      "\"The man almost killed me in that Walmart truck. I forgave him. As soon as I came out the coma, I forgave him,\" he said.",
      "For Morgan, forgiveness is the key to moving forward, but adds you don't have to forget.",
      "\"I wouldn't have been able to be funny no more. I would have been too angry. He almost killed me. I forgave him just to move forward with my life. Now look at me. I'm funnier than ever,\" he added.",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Actress June Lockhart (June 25, 1925-Oct 23, 2025) was best known for roles in two popular TV series: as Ruth Martin in \"Lassie,\" and as Maureen Robinson, matriarch of a family that was \"Lost in Space.\"",
      "The daughter of actors Gene and Kathleen Lockhart, June appeared on stage in New York beginning at age 6. After her parents moved to Hollywood, she made her unbilled film debut at age 13 alongside Gene and Kathleen, who played Bob Cratchit and his wife, in 1938's \"A Christmas Carol.\" June's first credit was in the Bette Davis drama \"All This, and Heaven Too.\" \u00a0She appeared in \"Sergeant York,\" \"The White Cliffs of Dover,\" \"Meet Me in St. Louis\" and \"She-Wolf of London,\" and won a Tony Award for the 1947 comedy \"For Love or Money.\" But her starring role in 1945's \"Son of Lassie\" (as the adult version of the character played by Elizabeth Taylor in the original) foreshadowed what would become her most familiar role.",
      "In 1958, Lockhart joined the TV series \"Lassie\" as Ruth Martin (taking over the role played by Cloris Leachman). For six years, in more than 200 episodes, Lockhart dispensed motherly wisdom to young Timmy (Jon Provost), who would engage in less-than-proper behavior or find himself in danger (but never, as the trope suggested, fallen down a well), only to be rescued by his faithful collie.",
      "And she knew who the star of the show was. \"Often, if the scene had gone well, and maybe we hadn't gotten the dialogue quite right, if the dog was right, they'd print it,\" she told The New York Times in 2004.",
      "The show, which aired on CBS, featured scripts that were in some cases written by blacklisted writers. \"When people come up to me and say, 'Well, sure wish we had wonderful American shows like that the way we used to in the 50's,' I say, 'Let me tell you who wrote those scripts Yes, they were good Americans, and they were in jail,'\" she said.",
      "Beginning in 1965, Lockhart starred in the frequently campy science fiction series \"Lost in Space.\" For three seasons, the Robinson Family \u2013 crewmembers aboard the doomed Jupiter II spacecraft \u2013 were marooned, or attacked by monsters and evil aliens (and in one notorious incident, a talking carrot), all while dealing with typical family drama. \"It was really endearing. 'Lost in Space' was like going out in the backyard in the sand and playing space. We did have fun,\" she said at a 2010 public appearance. She was also a NASA spokesperson, and attended space shuttle launches.",
      "In 1968, she joined the cast of \"Petticoat Junction\" for the sitcom's last two seasons. She also appeared on \"General Hospital,\" \"Marcus Welby, M.D.,\" \"Ellery Queen,\" \"Quincy, M.E.,\" \"Vega$,\" \"Magnum, P.I.,\" \"Knots Landing,\" \"Murder, She Wrote,\" \"Full House,\" \"Roseanne,\" \"Beverly Hills, 90210,\" \"Grey's Anatomy,\" and \"Cold Case.\" She provided the voice of Alpha Control in the 2021 Netflix reboot of \"Lost in Space.\" She also starred in touring productions of \"Steel Magnolias,\" \"Bedroom Farce\" and \"Once More with Feeling.\"",
      "In the 1950s, while appearing as a panelist on the Fred Friendly-produced game show \"Who Said That?,\" Lockhart met White House press correspondents. A self-described \"news junkie,\" she later traveled with them while they covered the 1956 presidential campaigns. When she filled in for the host of a TV talk show, she used her connections to interview President Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty. As thanks, Hagerty gave Lockhart a lifetime press pass. She used it for decades to attend White House briefings whenever she was in Washington."

      "Her family said in the statement, \"We will miss this truly remarkable woman, mom and grandmama.\"",

She made her professional debut at age 8, playing Mimsey in a Metropolitan Opera production of Peter Ibbetson. She later made her screen debut in MGM's version of \"A Christmas Carol\", playing the daughter of her real-life parents in the movie.",

She was the first recipient of the award, which is now no longer a category. Her award was later donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 2008.",
      "The actor became a household name to American audiences when she starred as Ruth Martin, the mother in \"Lassie,\" the hit TV show featuring a beloved long-haired collie that aired from 1954 to 1973.",

      "In his new book, \"The Running Ground: A Father, a Son, and the Simplest of Sports\" (to be published Oct. 28 by Random House), tech journalist and CEO of The Atlantic Nicholas Thompson explores his passion for running, the simplicity of the sport, and how it has changed his sense of self.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Tony Dokoupil's interview with Nicholas Thompson on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" October 26!",
      "\"The Running Ground\" by Nicholas Thompson",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Running is the simplest of sports: right foot, left foot, right foot. There's no ball to focus on, no mat to land on, no one charging toward you with their shoulder down. But the simplicity opens up complexity. As you run, your attention shifts inward. You're just you \u2014 right foot, left foot, and whatever goes on in your mind.",
      "Running strips you down. The less clothing you wear, the faster you go. The lighter your shoes, the faster you go. As you go faster, your head empties too. At a certain point, all you can register is the sensation of each foot striking the pavement. Mind and matter briefly become one.",
      "You may have to worry about wind and rain and heat, but you rarely have to worry about anyone else. You do it by yourself, which gives you control. You don't need to travel to a gym or a field; you just need to open your front door. The sport's simplicity means your successes are your own, and also that there's no one else to blame when you fail. And no sport shows the relentless decline of the aging body more clearly than running. If you can't do what you did a year or a month ago, the evidence is right there on your watch.",
      "Sometimes, I use running as a form of meditation. I put on my shoes and go out. I connect my watch to satellites and then try to disconnect my mind from the swirl inside. Eventually, I'm alone in my head. Sometimes, I'll focus on a musical mantra: \"one-two-three, one-two-three,\" tracking my steps and making sure I keep my left and right feet alternating symmetrically on the downbeat. Other times, I focus on my breath or on the sounds and motion around me, whether the blue jays in the Catskills or the trucks rumbling by on Broadway. Sometimes, as with all meditation, my attention wanders, like a stream flowing haphazardly through my mind, collecting sticks and carrying them until they wash to the side.",
      "When I run a workout, though, everything changes. I'm not trying to open my mind; I'm trying to close it. I shut out the blue jays and the trucks. I have to focus. If I'm with a training partner, I lock my attention on their shoulder if I'm behind or on their breath if I'm ahead. Usually, though, I'm on my own. I look for runners up the road and set imaginary races against them: Can I catch the lady in the purple sweatshirt before the second oak tree? Can I stay an even twenty meters behind the cyclist playing John Coltrane on a boom box? I check my watch and try not to let my pace deviate from the goal. I try to identify the parts of my body that hurt and then I push the pain away from them. I remind myself that I have run this fast before. Self-doubt is a smoldering fire. In a workout, the embers often flash. I don't want to give them any air. Every action we take helps to build our habits. Quit once and it'll be easier to quit the second time too.",
      "I don't listen to music while I run. Every workout is a physical challenge \u2014 I'm trying to strengthen the muscles in my legs and my heart \u2014 but it's also a mental challenge. I'm trying to teach my body how to move quickly and with good coordination through space. Running is a process of learning about your body and developing habits deep inside it. Music can confuse the signals. I want to deepen my understanding of the relationship between my stride, my pace, my breath. I don't want a bassline, or the adrenaline that can flow with it, to get in the way.",
      "When I race in a marathon, my goal early on is to spend as little energy as possible thinking about anything extraneous. I think about posture and form and balance. I try not to think about the people cheering. I try not to think about past fail\u00adures or successes. I try to glance as infrequently as possible at my watch. It takes energy, after all, to turn your head, and it takes energy to think. When people in my pack ask questions, or offer commentary, I respond in grunts. On easy runs with friends in the park, I'm a chatterbox. When I race, I'm a vault.",
      "Over the years, the sport has shifted my imagination and my sense of self. When I travel by train, I find myself looking out the window and noting spots to run by the creeks and forests nearby. When I arrive in a new city, I like to circle it with a run. I've seen more of the world while running than I have while walking. I have recurring dreams of mountains I've run up. But I spend much of the day at a desk, mind-wired to my to-do list. Running is my one connection to na\u00adture and to a younger, adventurous self who only and always wanted to be outside.",

      "Over the past three decades, Kenny Chesney has been one of the most celebrated singers in music. In his first book, \"Heart Life Music\" (written with journalist Holly Gleason, to be published Tuesday by William Morrow), Chesney recounts his life's journey, from East Tennessee, to No Shoes Nation and beyond.",
      "Read an excerpt below, in which he writes about a soulful collaboration with singer-songwriter Grace Potter \u2013 and don't miss Lee Cowan's interview with Kenny Chesney on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" October 26!",
      "\"Heart Life Music\" by Kenny Chesney with Holly Gleason",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Grace",
      "There was a show on tv called \"Let's Make A Deal.\" People would be contestants, hoping host Monty Hall would pick them to compete for prizes. New cars, new kitchens with all the appliances, expensive watches. You had to pick.",
      "",
      "One of two things: color tvs and washer/dryer sets, or what was behind Door No. 3, knowing it could be a wheelbarrow with some grass seed, or a new car.",
      "I've always been attracted to what's behind Door No. 3. That idea of the big unknown you can't see always appealed to me. The seeker inside has chased the unknown all my life.",
      "When you're a dreamer, you can't not take Door No. 3. That mentality fuels you. Seeking inspiration, wanting to find out has risk involved. Some Door No. 3s don't work out. But Grace Potter? She's the epitome of why Door No. 3 is always better than playing it safe.",
      "\"You & Tequila\" showed up in my email in the middle of the night.",
      "I remember listening, thinking, \"Damn\u2026,\"",
      "That idea of a person you can't quit, because they're so addictive is real. You can't resist, only overdo it to the point of poisoning yourself hit me. I called Matraca Berg, asked if there was a demo with a man singing it; she had one. Hearing Tim Krekel sing it hit me even harder.",
      "We cut it really simple. That pull between what you want and knowing you shouldn't made \"You & Tequila\" burn into people.",
      "We were about done with Hemingway's Whiskey. I wanted something to make it shine. Buddy Cannon and I were talking about who might sound good; Clint Higham, my co-manager, even reached out to Irving Azoff about the Eagles, since this sounded like a classic Laurel Canyon song.",
      "Then the woman who sent me the demo asked, \"Why don't you get Grace Potter? She captures that haunted and haunting feeling.\"",
      "What makes Grace Potter, the ultimate Door No. 3, was the mystery. The hippie songwriter/rock girl.",
      "Once she was suggested, as much as it made no sense on paper, I knew she was the person we needed.",
      "I listen to a lot of music at night in the Virgin Islands. No light pollution, you can drift in the sounds. I'd been given Grace's live CD. \"Apologies\" poured out of the speakers.",
      "Motionless on a chaise lounge, when I heard Grace's voice \u2013 so soulful, but beautiful and real \u2013 I was floored. Nobody in my life had heard this voice except my friend. I felt blessed.",
      "She wrote her own songs. She had a band, wasn't overproduced. Really listening, it was how she played that B-3 organ, but especially how she sang those songs.",
      "I looked up at the sky and exhaled. She sounded like coming home.",
      "When we put her on \"You & Tequila,\" all she knew about me was \"She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy\" because the Eagle in Burlington, Vermont had played it to death.",
      "Was it even possible? Grace had finished a European tour, traveled 24 hours with no sleep and was landing in America. We laugh now, but she listened to the demo on the rental car shuttle having cleared customs.",
      "She was tired. She missed her family. And we needed her in Nashville within 48 hours to make the deadline for mastering \u2013 or we'd have to move the record. Her manager wasn't optimistic. My friend insisted, \"Give her the song.\"",
      "",
      "Thirty minutes later, we had a yes. Thirty hours later, Grace Potter landed in Nashville in a flowy leopard print dress, walked into Blackbird Recording Studios and changed both of our lives. Brash, smart and funny, she oozed music. She told wild stories, made some people blush and asked us what we were thinking.",
      "Buddy suggested, \"Get in the booth and put your headphones on. See how it feels to you.\"",
      "Probably warming up, she was humming. Then that \"ooooohOOOOOHohhhh\" she does on the record rolled out.",
      "\"Do some more of that.\"",
      "Two or three takes later, we were done. We'd talked longer than she was in the vocal booth. Even before it was mixed, we knew it was something. That's the thing: you know.",
      "It was my birthday. I asked her and her boyfriend if they'd like to have dinner. We went to Sunset Grille, sat outside on the patio and laughed. We came from musically different places; her country music was Willie, Townes Van Zandt and Lucinda Williams. But we were of the same heart, same small town, family-oriented life.",
      "She was tired, so we didn't hang long. When I got up to leave, she followed me, jumped in the passenger seat of my car, and announced, \"I don't know what the future holds, but we're going to be friends for life.\"",
      "Grace Potter knew things. I've always believed there are things in our lives that were pre-determined; set into motion by some larger power. Grace was absolutely one.",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Oct 2025 10:24:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Nicholas Thompson, CEO of The Atlantic and author of \"The Running Ground,\" talks about how his father inspired him to become a world-class long-distance runner.",
    "story": [
      "One of the first things you realize about Nick Thompson is just how busy he is, as CEO of The Atlantic; as a public speaker; and on top of it all, as a family man. But he is also a world-class long-distance runner.",
      "He ran to the office on the day we talked. \"I did, of course,\" he said.",
      "\"Why do you like it?\" I asked.",
      "\"Every time I go running, I'm opening my mind up, I'm engaging with nature,\" he said. \"I have a chance to think. I like to have my body in motion. It's a break from the rest of life. It's something I've always loved.\"",
      "And if you can imagine, Thompson has actually gotten faster as he's gotten older, shaving 14 minutes off his best marathon time at 44 \u2013 and just this year, posting the fastest 50-mile time in the world for his age group.",
      "If you're wondering how he does it, and why, he explains in \"The Running Ground\" \u2013 part memoir, part call to the runner in all of us.",
      "\"Everybody can run,\" he said. \"Go to Prospect Park, right, and look at the incredible, beautiful variety. Short people, tall people, really skinny people, wide people. Everybody can run. Humans were made to run.\"",
      "Thompson says he started running because his father was a runner. \"There was always energy and chaos and life around him,\" he said. \"He never slowed down, he never stopped.\"",
      "But in a life of great professional success \u2013 teaching and working in both the Ford and Reagan administrations \u2013 Scott Thompson also suffered personal turmoil.",
      "Thompson writes that one of his father's refrains was to tell him that his life is going to crack apart when he turns 40. \"He told me that all the time,\" he said. \"You know, his father, his life had gotten much harder and kind of fallen apart at 40. And then my dad felt that his life had kind of fallen apart at 40.\"",
      "Scott left the family when Nick was just a kid, and then struggled with just about everything. \"He was an alcoholic and he was a sex addict,\" said Thompson. \"But he wasn't a mean drunk, a fall-over drunk. He just drank way too much. And then in his later life, after he came out of the closet \u2013 in his 40s and 50s, 60s, 70s \u2013 he had a terrible problem with sex addiction.\"",
      "For Nick, running became both a way to be like his father, while also rejecting the chaos that followed him. \"In some ways, running is a way of mourning him after he passed away,\" he said. \"I also am well aware that he could not control his emotions. He could not control what he did during the course of a day. I felt like one of the ways I could prevent that from happening to me was to run, that running gave me discipline through the rest of my life.\"",
      "So, Thompson ran. He ran in high school, and briefly in college at Stanford. And after a break, he picked it up again in his late 20s, which is when he got the news: \"I had just run my first really good marathon and felt on top of the world. And it's two weeks later, the next week I go in and see the doctor and he is like, 'I feel something.'\"",
      "It turned out to be thyroid cancer. \"I was diagnosed when I was 30 years old and it was just a shock,\" he said.",
      "Shocking as it was, it was treatable, and it gave Thompson a new goal. He said, \"One of the reasons I kept marathoning in my 30s and in my 40s was because I wanted to feel like the person I had been before I got sick.\"",
      "As he got faster, his career took off, too. He joined Cond\u00e9 Nast, where he would eventually become editor of newyorker.com and editor-in-chief of Wired. Longtime viewers of \"Sunday Morning\" may remember he even reported for this show, in stories on QAnon, the 2020 election, and Wikipedia.",
      "I asked, \"Do you think you'd be where you are professionally without running?\"",
      "\"Definitely not,\" he replied. \"I think running has been a great tool professionally. It is a way for me to add discipline to my days, for me to have time where my mind can just wander, where I can think through things.\"",
      "But for Thompson, now 50, what's really unexpected is what happened next. He is faster today than he was at age 35. \"I like to think of it as the aging process as a moving sidewalk, you know, pushing you backwards, right? Like, every year I get a little bit weaker. But you can do things to kind of move forward faster than the moving sidewalk is going backwards. You can figure out how to train more intelligently. You can get a better understanding of your body. You can eat differently.\"",
      "Which is not to say that's it's easy.",
      "I asked, \"If you're trying to encourage people to run, why do you post from time to time pictures of yourself looking in absolute agony? Like crossing a finish line? I mean, terrible photos. Some of the all-time worst anyone's ever put out in public voluntarily!\"",
      "\"So, that race was really hard,\" he said. \"It was the Lake Waramaug 50-miler, and I wanted to set the American record for my age group. And I was on pace through 45, 46 miles. And then the last few miles, I knew I was gonna be close, and so I was pushing so hard. I was just \u2026 hurting so much everywhere. But I still won the race. I still ran the fastest time in the world this year. It was still like a pretty good result.\"",
      "Running continues to be a family tradition for the Thompsons. Nick runs with his own three sons, and coaches weekly track sessions with his youngest son's soccer team. He said, \"It feels like full circle to have learned the sport from my father when I was about 5 or 6, and now being able to pass it to my children \u2013 James is 11, Zachary's 15, Ellis is 17. It's a great thing. And there's all these other kids!\"",
      "And as it turns out, life hasn't fallen apart like his father warned.",
      "\"You've kind of done it!\" I said.",
      "\"Well, I mean, I keep going because I enjoy it, right?\" Thompson laughed. \"I keep running because, you know, my life didn't fall apart at 40 'cause I didn't lose my discipline at 40, but could still fall apart at 50, which I just turned. And so, I don't wanna let it go. The really interesting transition in my life will be at some point I won't be able to do this, and then I'll have to figure out how else to hold on.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Oct 2025 10:14:43 -0400",
    "summary": "The Oscar-winning director is adding his spin to the mythic tale of a scientist creating a man from body parts. He talks about his lifelong fascination with Mary Shelley's story, and how \"in reality we're all weird in some way.\"",
    "story": [
      "Director Guillermo del Toro (\"Pan's Labyrinth,\" \"The Shape of Water\") hovered over a model representing the creature in his latest film, \"Frankenstein.\" \"We made, I think, the most extensive, minute, anatomical putting together of the monster in the history of cinema,\" he said.",
      "He considered every tendon, every suture, every organ, and admits for some that can be a bit much. \"Sorry about breakfast!\" he laughed.",
      "But to bring Victor Frankenstein's monster to life in cinema, the filmmaker first was playing creator himself. Del Toro, who resurrected \"Frankenstein\" for Netflix as writer, producer and director, took \"Sunday Morning\" around a London exhibition detailing his elaborate vision for the gothic classic \u2013 from wardrobe and props, to his extensive notes, which he spent years writing.",
      "There is also, in a glass case, the original text, inscribed from Mary Shelley to Lord Byron. \"This is the one I would steal,\" he joked. \"I would do a full Pink Panther.\"",
      "The groundbreaking novel about a scientist who creates a living, feeling being mixes horror, romance, and humanity. It was penned by Mary Shelley, who finished it when she was just 19, more than 200 years ago.",
      "So, why does her story endure? \"Well, first of all, it was written by a teenager that was full of questions and rage and rebellion,\" del Toro said. \"You know, it's the same questions we have now: What are we? Why am I human? Why am I here?\"",
      "Is it a coincidence that the film comes out around Halloween? \"No! No!\" he said. \"To me, Halloween is all year long.\"",
      "\"What do you mean?\" I asked.",
      "\"I live a house that has secret passages. I live in a house that is inhabited full of monsters,\" he said.",
      "\"In your mind?\"",
      "\"No, I built it! When I was forty-something, I invested everything I had into creating the house I wanted when I was 7.\"",
      "\"Well, no wonder you wanted to make 'Frankenstein'!\"",
      "\"I have a room dedicated to 'Frankenstein.' I call it the living room.\"",
      "And what does he do in that room? \"I say hello to all the figures in the morning, I write, I investigate, I design.\"",
      "He started experiencing life through literature, he says, growing up in Guadalajara, Mexico. But for him, \"Frankenstein\" was not just any story he'd read. \"You really wanted to make this film,\" I said.",
      "\"I gave it over 50 years of my life, so yes,\" del Toro said. \"It's in all of my movies. All 13 movies have elements   of the film. 'Pinocchio' is another prodigal father asking for forgiveness of his child. My first movie, 'Cronus,' deals with eternal life. 'Shape of Water,' certainly, the idea of the monster being of the same essence than the main female character, and the female character recognizing herself in it.\"",
      "\"We are all creatures,\" he said. \"I mean, we have a world that tells you you shouldn't be a creature, but in reality we're all weird in some way.\"",
      "And in what ways is del Toro weird? \"I was this strange, pale creature that liked to read, and I was a hypochondriac at age seven. I thought I had trichinosis. I thought have cirrhosis. And I studied medical manuals, and I would go to my mom and say, 'I think I have a terminal cancer.' So I was a weird, weird kid.\"",
      "And for del Toro, there is an appeal to monsters: \"Monsters tell you, look, it's okay to be you. It's okay to be imperfect.\"",
      "\"You say someone needs to tell you it's okay to be you. Who was that person for you?\" I asked.",
      "\"Boris Karloff, Godzilla, the Creature from the Black Lagoon! What is beautiful about monsters is they become patron saints of imperfection.\"",
      "Boris Karloff's 1931 portrayal of Mary Shelley's monster is film history. In del Toro's reimagination, Oscar Isaac is Victor Frankenstein, birthing a creature played by Jacob Elordi.",
      "\"Every day there was some new, beautiful, strange thing waiting for me to try and do,\" said Isaac. \"To be invited to do these kinds of things as a performer, it was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing.\"",
      "Asked what he did to become the creature, Elordi replied, \"I don't know if that will really fit into a news bit. I couldn't tell you. It's this elusive thing. Guillermo and I shared a language together immediately. I was, like, fully creatively ready to play something like that.\"",
      "Asked why he picked Isaac and Elordi for the roles, del Toro replied, \"Eyes. I cast the eyes.\"",
      "I asked, \"What do you see in their eyes?\"",
      "\"Oscar had brilliance, madness, seduction and pain. And Jacob was completely open. He had an innocence and an openness and a purity in his eyes that was completely disarming.\"",
      "And did the filmmaker want his monster to be beautiful? \"Oh yeah. 100%, it has to look like something newly minted,\" he said. \"Not like a repair job in an ICU.\"",
      "\"But, there's also a handsomeness, a sexiness to Jacob as the creature,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, I was raised Catholic, and a lot of those crucifixions in Mexico have the loin cloth a little too low!\"",
      "\"Were you thinking about that?\"",
      "\"No,\" del Toro said, \"but my grandma certainly was!\"",
      "Del Toro's \"Frankenstein\" is rich with Catholic imagery, and inspired by all the monsters he grew up with \u2013 fuelling his lifelong cinematic mission.",
      "I asked, \"Do you feel any connection to the Frankensteins of the past?\"",
      "\"To the myth,\" he replied. \"I mean, my first crush was Mary Shelley. I truly can tell you this, you are born to sing one or two songs in your lifetime. This is my song.\"",
      "\"So, what do you do now? \"",
      "\"Oh, I don't know,\" del Toro replied. \"Macrame? Pottery?\"",

    "summary": "He's one of country music's most celebrated singers. But Kenny Chesney's latest work is a book, \"Heart Life Music,\" in which he describes his life's journey, from East Tennessee, to No Shoes Nation and beyond.",
    "story": [
      "Just as the sun was going down in the heart of old Key West, Florida, a self-described pirate rode his rust-ravaged bike to the Blue Heaven restaurant to meet a friend \u2013 a friend we just happened to be in the middle of interviewing. \"She said come in!\" David Wegman laughed, as he joined Kenny Chesney.",
      "But that's the thing about Chesney \u2013 down here, he's not really a country music superstar. He's just another laid-back local. \"We know a lot of the same people,\" Chesney laughed.",
      "He collects characters like seashells \u2013 he met Wegman at Ivan's Stress-Free Bar down in the British Virgin Islands. \"Above the bar was written in shells: 'No Shirt, No Shoes, No Problem,'\" Wegman recalled.",
      "That 2002 song, \"No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems,\" helped make Chesney one of the biggest touring acts around. Almost every summer he turns stadiums into beach parties. Among his many accolades: the Academy of Country Music's Entertainer of the Year Award, which he won four years in a row. And just last week, he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame \u2013 a career-topping accomplishment that he credits to taking that tropical turn in his career.",
      "\"You know what's crazy?\" he said. \"I had an 18-song Greatest Hits album, and nobody knew who I was. They knew the songs, but I wasn't comfortable in my skin yet. I didn't know who I was supposed to be as an artist yet. I would go do shows and they would go, 'Oh yeah, that's the guy that sings that song.' And then, 'That's the guy that sings that song.' When I started being my true, authentic self, that's when everything changed.\"",
      "He could have taken us to some Tiki bar down in the Keys to keep up his tropical brand. But instead, he wanted to show us the room where Ernest Hemingway worked on \"To Have and Have Not\" and \"Green Hills of Africa.\"",
      "I said, \"The space, it's almost like sacred place.\"",
      "\"Yeah, do you feel it? I feel it,\" Chesney said. \"I spent so much, almost two weeks straight on the bow of my boat in the Virgin Islands reading those books.\"",
      "Which might explain why he came down here to work on his first book, out next month: \"Heart Life Music.\" \"This book forced me to pause,\" he said.",
      "For all of his love of the islands, he writes it was his own mom who first realized that he may have drifted too far from his East Tennessee roots. \"She wanted her 12-year-old boy back in ways, and he was gone. Gone gone gone,\" he said.",
      "\"She had a hard time finding you, kind of had a hard time reaching you?\" I asked.",
      "\"It hit me a little bit, but I was so already so addicted to seeking an adventure and all of it, and all these new things happening in my life that I dismissed it.\"",
      "He kept going, kept touring, kept writing, until a concert in Indianapolis back in 2009, which he describes as hitting a wall, and crying on stage. \"In that moment I was so exhausted and numb to all of it, that it wasn't making me happy,\" he said. \"I wasn't creating the same way.\u00a0 I wasn't connecting to the audience. It just hit me.\u00a0 It took sports to get me out of that funk.\"",
      "He grew up playing baseball and football \u2013 loving every inning, every down. So, when a song called \"The Boys of Fall\" crossed his path, he didn't only record it; he began interviewing coaches and players about sports and life, and turned it into a documentary for ESPN, \"Boys of Fall.\" \"I needed Joe Namath, I needed Bill Parcells,\" he said. \"I sat in Bobby Bowden's living room and he talked to me like a deacon in a Baptist church! I woke up one day, and I went, I'm back.\"",
      "Now he's the one doing pre-game pep talks backstage, like at Sphere in Las Vegas. Many on his team have been with him for decades. There's confidence in familiarity. \"If I had to sit on the bus and think about what I'm getting ready to go do, it would \u2013 yeah, I don't do well with that,\" he said.",
      "He put on the kind of show his fans expect \u2013 a kaleidoscope of sand, sunsets and songs.",
      "When me met him the next morning, he was still buzzing about performing in Sphere. \"The first couple of nights, I caught myself singing a song and I was like, Well, this is so cool! \u00a0And then, I forgot the words to a song that I actually wrote!\"",
      "On stage with him this night was Grace Potter, the singer-songwriter he recruited for a duet, even though country really wasn't her thing. The two are now lifelong friends.",
      "\"There's people who have always seen him as just the iconic, you know, Statue of David of country music,\" she said.",
      "\"I'm gonna go to Florence and stand beside it!\" he laughed.",
      "\"But there's just so much more underneath it that's more interesting than the sculpture itself,\" Potter added.",
      "Indeed, the off-stage Kenny Chesney is a more complicated guy, a more thoughtful guy, even a little shy if you can believe it. That's the East Tennessee part that will always remain even as he's chasing sunsets.",
      "Chesney said, \"It takes a certain amount of ego to be up there on stage and to do what I do, right? But I try really hard to leave that person up there. I can't live that person every day. And I don't want that person in my life every day, but I'm really glad to meet him when I go back up there.\"",

    "summary": "Kim Kardashian revealed she was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm and appeared to blame stress. Doctors say stress isn't usually a direct cause, but can influence risk factors.",
    "story": [
      "Kim Kardashian revealed she was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm in a teaser for the new season of her family's reality TV show, \"The Kardashians.\" She appears to blame the diagnosis on stress \u2014 but doctors say that usually isn't a direct cause.",
      "In the clip shared Thursday, Kardashian, 45, is seen going in for an MRI scan and telling her family, \"There was a little aneurysm.\" She then appears to say she was told the cause was \"just stress.\" Footage from the teaser also features a sometimes emotional Kardashian talking about her difficult divorce with ex-husband Kanye West, who now goes by Ye.",
      "While stress itself doesn't create an aneurysm, it can raise blood pressure, which is related to aneurysm formation and growth, said Dr. Brian Snelling, director of cerebrovascular and endovascular neurosurgery and director of the stroke program at Marcus Neuroscience Institute, part of Baptist Health South Florida.",
      "\"The real culprits are genetics, elevated blood pressure, smoking and age-related changes in the arteries,\" he told CBS News.",
      "\"It is not proven that stress alone causes an aneurysm,\" said Dr. Greg Albers, co-founder of health platform RapidAI and director of the Stanford Stroke Center, but adds stress can over time cause an increase in blood pressure which can make an individual more vulnerable to one.",
      "A brain aneurysm is a \"bulge or ballooning in a blood vessel in the brain,\" the\u00a0Mayo Clinic explains.",
      "You can think of it as a weak spot in the artery \u2014 imagine a garden hose that has one spot where the rubber's thin like balloon, instead of thick, said Dr. Adam Arthur, neurosurgeon and a chief medical officer at Medtronic, a medical device company.",
      "\"Over time, with pressure going through that hose, it's caused a little sack,\" he explained.",
      "Brain aneurysms, which tend to be more prevalent in women, aren't uncommon: \"Around 1 in 50 adults have a brain aneurysm,\" Snelling said. But, most people never know they have one.",
      "\"They are often found incidentally on scans done for unrelated reasons. Unless they grow large or rupture, they're usually silent,\" he said.",
      "Most brain aneurysms aren't serious, especially if they're small, as most don't rupture and usually don't cause symptoms or cause health problems, according to the Mayo Clinic.",
      "\"Aneurysms themselves aren't dangerous unless they leak or burst, which leads to a life-threatening brain bleed,\" Snelling said.",
      "Hemorrhagic strokes and subarachnoid hemorrhages are two types of brain bleeds related to ruptured brain aneurysms, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "The best prevention is controlling blood pressure, avoiding smoking and stimulants, screening at-risk populations and monitoring with imaging, he added.",
      "Alleviating stress can be important in preventing a rupture, Arthur added, noting the development of aneurysms is \"something that can happen to anybody, regardless of risk factors.\"",
      "Arthur said if a patient has risks factors \u2014 for example, two close relatives with aneurysms \u2014 screenings can be done to check for them.",
      "\"If somebody is very worried or has a lot of risk factors, that's something that we can do for them,\" he said, adding he hopes Kardashian's news helps bring awareness.",
      "\"I don't want to scare people unnecessarily, but anything that we can use to put more of a focus on women's health and on how stroke can hurt women or cause disability, I think is something that we can make more positive,\" he said.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Oct 2025 13:53:28 -0400",
    "summary": "In an exclusive interview with \"CBS Mornings,\" Misty Copeland reflects on her decision to step away from the American Ballet Theatre.",
    "story": [
      "Under the bright lights of the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center, Misty Copeland took her final bow, a moment that marked not just the end of a performance but the close of a chapter that transformed American ballet. The trailblazing dancer, who shattered racial barriers in the art form, retired on Wednesday as a principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre after 25 years with the company.",
      "But she told \"CBS Mornings\" in an exclusive interview that the decision to perform one last time wasn't something she initially wanted.",
      "\"It's been such an interesting kind of lead up to this moment, because I in all honesty I didn't wanna come back to the stage and have this moment,\" she told Gayle King.",
      "When asked why, Copeland explained that by 2019, her last year performing with the American Ballet Theatre\u00a0before taking a 5-year hiatus, she had begun to feel drained after decades of dancing.",
      "\"I really was starting to feel burnt out, kind of losing that passion that I've had my whole career and whole life for dance,\" she said. \"And I always promised myself I wouldn't go onstage if I didn't feel that I was delivering from my heart and, you know, my soul.\"",
      "She said that after taking time away, she viewed her return as an opportunity for closure and gratitude.",
      "\"In taking these five years, and really thinking about what this moment means in terms of just closure and saying thank you, that, I think, is what has gotten me back onstage for the show,\" Copeland said.",
      "The final bow",
      "At Copeland's farewell gala at Lincoln Center, Oprah Winfrey and Debbie Allen were among those who honored her career and impact.",
      "\"Misty Copeland didn't just perform ballet, she changed it,\" Winfrey said. \"She did. She redefined who belongs, who gets to be seen, and who gets to lead.\"",
      "Allen also praised Copeland's influence. \"You are a prophecy come true. A prophecy of goodness, and genius and grace and power,\" she said.",
      "Copeland helped organize the evening's program, which included a scene from \"Romeo and Juliet.\"",
      "\"I really wanted to do this piece because Calvin Royal, he's the second Black male principal dancer in ABT's history,\" Copeland said. \"And we were set to perform the full-length ballet, the first two Black dancers to perform the leads together at ABT right before the pandemic hit. And then that never came to fruition. So I thought, even though it's not the full ballet, to be able to perform just a piece of it.\"",
      "The night ended with a standing ovation. Copeland received bouquets from her husband, Olu Evans, and their 3-year-old son, Jackson, who saw her perform for the first time.",
      "Redefining ballet",
      "Copeland looked back on the moment that made history, becoming the first Black woman promoted to principal dancer at the American Ballet Theatre. She said the title carried a deeper meaning beyond personal recognition.",
      "\"I think that and I've gone back and forth over the years in terms of, like, what that really means and the title is what has opened the doors for the next generation,\" she said.",
      "Her 2015 promotion was celebrated around the world, but it also brought new challenges. Copeland said the attention came with intense pressure and unfair expectations. \"There were articles being written, 'If Misty doesn't go onstage and perform Swan Lake perfectly does she deserve to be a principal dancer? Is this because she's Black? Is this why she's getting this opportunity?'\" she recalled.",
      "For Copeland, ballet was never just about perfect lines or technical mastery. \"I know deep down, like, to me the art form and dance is not even, it's not about, these technical feats. It's not about, to me, the aesthetic and, and what's on the outside. To me what's saved my life is the storytelling, and being able to kind of step into this beautiful world and express myself in ways that I couldn't as a child,\" she said.",
      "Her relationship with dance began at 13, an age when most professional ballerinas were already years into their training. Growing up amid uncertainty and instability, she said ballet became a place of safety and self-discovery.",
      "\"I felt beautiful and I felt powerful and I felt strong and I felt like I had a voice. I felt confident and I felt stability for the first time in my life,\" she said. \"Because the way I grew up there was no stability. There was a lot of chaos and movement, and, didn't always have a home and food on the table. And so ballet became, dance allowed me to flourish. It gave me structure. It gave me discipline. It gave me grace. It gave me a purpose.\"",
      "As diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives face growing criticism, Copeland said she believes this is the right time to step away from performing.",
      "\"I think it's the exact right time for me to be stepping off the stage for this,\" she said. \"Because I think that the impact that I can have off the stage is, is going to be, greater than what I've done. It's been 25 years that I've been a Black body on this stage, and I think that there's been a lot of movement and shifts.\"",
      "She said progress in ballet must also happen behind the curtain.",
      "\"It's more than just seeing yourself on the stage. It's what's being implemented behind the scenes,\" she said. \"It's the schools. It's how are we getting teachers in schools who look like the children they're serving? It's getting board members who are making these decisions who represent a greater group of people. There's so much work to be done.\"",
      "Copeland also announced that she will \u00a0be joining ABT's board of trustees.",
      "\"You know, it's not common that you see artists come onto boards and that you see women of color. And so to be able to have a seat at the table \u2014 in a really impactful way \u2014 I think is progress. And that, to me, is \u2014 is so thrilling and so exciting to be able to stay connected to this company that has been everything to me. I mean, it's been my dream since I was 13 years old. And I still to this day can't believe I've been able to live it out the way that I have.\"",
      "Copeland said the timing of her departure was important.",
      "\"I always said to myself, like, I'm not gonna be that ballerina that they're pulling off by the pointe shoes, like, 'Girl, it's time.' You know, that I wanna be able to say, you know, like, I feel good in this moment, and now is time for me to bow,\" she said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-interest-rate-decision-today-fomc-meeting/",
    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 15:53:53 -0400",
    "summary": "The Fed on Wednesday announced its second interest-rate cut of 2025, reducing borrowing costs in a move to spur U.S. hiring.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, but Chair Jerome Powell hinted that the central bank might pause before further lowering borrowing costs.",
      "The Fed cut lowers the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 3.75% and 4%, down from its prior range of 4% to 4.25%. The Fed reduced rates by the same amount in September, its first cut since December of 2024.",
      "In a Wednesday afternoon press conference to discuss the decision, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said another rate cut at its next meeting, set for Dec. 10, \"isn't a foregone conclusion.\" That may disappoint some borrowers and investors, given that the Fed last month had penciled in an additional rate cut for its final meeting of the year.",
      "\"There were strongly differing views on how to proceed in December\" during the central bank's meeting today, Powell said. Those conflicting views mean \"we haven't made a decision about December. I'm saying something in addition here \u2014 that it's not to be seen as a foregone conclusion. In fact, far from it.\"",
      "He added, \"We've cut 50 more basis points in the last two meetings, and there's a sense from some, 'Let's pause here,' and a sense from others, 'Let's go ahead.'\"",
      "Stocks erased modest gains after Powell's comments, with the S&P 500 slipping 0.2% in afternoon trading and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipping 0.4%.",
      "The central bank's move to ease monetary policy is aimed at shoring up economic growth by lowering borrowing costs, spurring consumer spending and investment by businesses. Although the ongoing U.S. government shutdown has delayed release of the Labor Department's September jobs report, other indicators point to a continued slowdown in hiring. The ADP National Employment Report, for instance, showed private-sector payrolls shrinking by 32,000 last month.",
      "In its policy\u00a0statement on Wednesday, the Fed said \"downside risks to employment rose in recent months.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve's so-called dual mandate requires monetary policymakers to keep both inflation and unemployment low, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting last month that risks to the labor market are growing.",
      "While Powell said the Fed is watching layoff announcements from large businesses such as Amazon, he added that the weakness in the job market does not appear to be accelerating. His comments indicate that another back-to-back rate cut this year isn't a certainty, financial experts said.",
      "\"The knee-jerk reaction of the markets to the Fed meeting (and press conference) was to sell stocks and bonds, because Chairman Powell said that an additional rate cut in December wasn't a sure thing,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email. Investors \"were negatively surprised that future cuts might be taken off the table.\"",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the panel that sets the Fed's monetary policy, isn't scheduled to meet on interest rates in November.",
      "Data blackout",
      "The near-total blackout on government economic data during the shutdown may complicate the Fed's decision-making, experts said. Typically, Fed officials are able to draw on a host of official reports, ranging from measures of employment growth to inflation markers, as they seek to determine the best path for policy.",
      "\"While today's rate cut and the general direction of future policy remain relatively clear, guidance on the committee's perspective on economic conditions is more necessary than ever,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates said in an email. \"A prolonged government shutdown and ongoing tariff negotiations continue to introduce significant uncertainty into the immediate monetary policy outlook.\"",
      "Powell noted that the lack of official economic data may complicate the Fed's December decision, given that the central bank relies on such information to assess the economy.",
      "\"What do you do when you are driving in the fog? You slow down,\" Powell said.",
      "On Wednesday, 10 of the 12 FOMC members voted in favor of the quarter-point cut, with two members objecting. Fed Governor Stephen Miran dissented, preferring a 0.50 percentage point cut, as he did at the September meeting. Kansas City Fed President Jeffry Schmid also dissented, saying he preferred no rate change.",
      "Inflation battle",
      "While the Fed is now focused on weakness in the labor market, its battle against inflation isn't over. The Fed cranked rates higher after consumer prices soared during the pandemic, with inflation hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022.",
      "Because higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow, businesses and consumers typically react by paring spending, which dampens demand throughout the economy and cools inflation. Since mid-2022, inflation has receded to an annual rate of 3% as of September, although that remains higher than the Fed's target of a 2% annual pace.",
      "While the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs are starting to trickle through to consumer prices, the impact has been more muted than economists had predicted earlier this year. Some businesses are eating some of the tariff costs, while others stocked up on imports earlier in the year to get ahead of the import duties.",
      "\"Though inflation is still higher than comfortable, the jobs market is holding on to signs of weakness, and their desire to stimulate the economy further is likely to continue outweighing inflation concerns,\" said Steve Rick, chief economist at financial services company TruStage.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 14:05:38 -0400",
    "summary": "Elon Musk's partisan stances and foray into politics in recent years have dented the electric vehicle maker's business, Yale researchers say.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk is widely recognized as an electric car pioneer. Yet the Tesla CEO has also single-handedly chilled the automaker's sales, according to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0by researchers at Yale University.",
      "Public controversy over Musk's role as leader of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), as well as his acquisition of social media platform Twitter (now known as X) in 2022, reduced Tesla's sales by up to 1.2 million vehicles over a three-year period, the researchers estimated in a working paper published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research that aimed to measure the effect of Musk's politics on Tesla's business.",
      "\"This study highlights just how impactful a CEO's partisan actions can be,\" the researchers wrote. \"We show that Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person and CEO of the most valuable automaker by market capitalization, had a dramatic effect on Tesla sales due to his politically partisan activities unrelated to Tesla's core business.\"",
      "Musk's adverse impact on Tesla's business became visible starting in mid-2022, with sales especially dropping in Democratic-leaning states and counties, the study further concludes.",
      "\"Musk's actions antagonized his most loyal customer base, for, as we show, Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to purchase a Tesla,\" the researchers said.",
      "The study's lead author is energy and environmental economist Kenneth Gillingham, who is the senior associate dean of academic affairs at the Yale School of the Environment. His research focuses on consumer behavior and policy in the transportation and energy sectors.",
      "Musk announced in May that he was pulling back from DOGE, which the Trump administration formed to shrink the federal government and cut spending.",
      "Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on the paper's findings.",
      "Musk's foray into politics and emergence as a prominent adviser to President Trump early in his second term raised the entrepreneur's visibility but alienated some potential Tesla customers, Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, previously told CBS News.",
      "Tesla last week reported third-quarter earnings of $1.4 billion, down 37% from the year-ago period, citing higher costs and tariff-related headwinds. Tesla's vehicle sales fell 1% in 2024 despite a 7% increase in EV sales across the car industry.",
      "Tesla's stock fell 27% in February, a period of time that coincided with Mr. Trump's first full month in the White House. But the shares have rebounded and are now up roughly 14% on the year, with investors betting on growth in the company's fledgling robotaxi business, autonomous driving technology and plans to build AI-powered humanoid robots.",
      "\"We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,\"\u00a0Wedbush Securities technology analyst Dan Ives said in a recent report, adding that he expects the Trump administration to fast-track such initiatives.",
      "Another measure of Musk's perceived value to Tesla is the enormous pay package shareholders are preparing to vote on for the executive. That total package could be worth up to $1 trillion in a decade, one of the richest compensation packages in corporate history.",
      "For Musk to earn the full amount, Tesla would have to hit certain profitability and production targets, as well as reach a market cap of $8.5 trillion \u2014 nearly six times its current value \u2014 in 10 years.",
      "Robyn Denholm, chairman of Tesla's board of directors, is urging shareholders to approve Musk's proposed compensation. \"Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become: a transformative force reimagining the fundamental building blocks of mobility, energy and labor,\"\u00a0 Denholm said in the letter.",

      "Hospitals nationwide are urging the Trump administration to reconsider a steep new fee for hiring highly skilled workers from other countries. Many turn to medical professionals from abroad to fill the gaps, but the new $100,000 price tag for the popular H-1B visa is making that nearly impossible, particularly for midsize hospitals or smaller.",
      "\"We need to stabilize,\" said Jamie White, the chief nursing officer at Frederick Health in Maryland. She also said, \"We have had a continual desire to bring on about 100 nurses for the last three years.\"",
      "Frederick Health, like others nationwide, looked abroad to fill in the gaps, planning to sponsor up to 45 nurses on H-1B visas. Now, those plans are on hold, with a new $100,000 fee to obtain the visa and hire foreign employees.",
      "\"We cannot afford that for even one individual,\" White said.",
      "The Trump administration announced the policy change in September, with President Trump saying it provides an incentive to hire American workers. The administration has since clarified that the fee is for new applicants living abroad, not those already here.",
      "White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers called the administration's actions a necessary reform.",
      "\"President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages,\" Rogers said in a recent statement to CBS News.",
      "Frederick Health and other hospitals are hoping for an exemption for medical workers, given an ongoing national shortage.",
      "\"I know there's a lot of concern with bringing people to the United States, and they might be taking U.S. jobs, but we do have a shortage of clinical team and highly skilled workers,\" White said.",
      "The American Hospital Association wrote the Trump administration a letter in late September asking for exemptions for health care personnel. The letter\u00a0detailed the association's concerns\u00a0and said that\u00a0rural\u00a0and underserved communities could be hit hardest.",
      "\"Given the staffing and financial challenges our hospitals are already facing, the increased petition fees outlined in the September 19 Proclamation would likely prevent many of them from continuing to recruit essential health care staff and could force a reduction in the services they are able to provide,\" said the letter, addressed to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security did not comment on the letter when contacted by CBS News.",

    "story": [
      "For most of 2025, the job market was described by economists as \"no hire, no fire\" \u2014 a stretch of time when job seekers faced slim prospects, but workers could count on job security. But that fragile balance may now be shifting, labor experts warn, as mass layoffs at companies like Amazon and UPS signal a possible turning point for the labor market.",
      "Amazon on Tuesday announced 14,000 job cuts, citing a shift toward artificial intelligence, while UPS on the same day said it has reduced its workforce by 48,000 from a year earlier. Paramount Skydance, the owner of CBS News, on Wednesday also announced it is shedding jobs, part of an ongoing effort to cut costs at the entertainment and media company.",
      "Target on Tuesday also notified a state employment agency in Minnesota, where the retailer is based, that it plans to lay off more than 800 workers in January as part of a broader corporate restructuring,\u00a0CBS News Minnesota reported. The retailer announced last week that it would cut 1,800 corporate positions as the chain trims its global workforce by about 8%.",
      "The mass layoffs come as the Federal Reserve scrutinizes the labor market for signs of weakness, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month citing concerns about slower hiring\u00a0in announcing the central bank's first interest-rate cut of 2025. The announcements from Amazon and UPS could signal that the Fed has good reason to be worried, experts said.",
      "\"No question that this is a shift, and it does seem to me it signals that 'no hire, no fire' is a thing of the past,\" John Challenger, CEO of outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told CBS News.",
      "\"These are major layoffs, the kind of which we only see in periods of real change in the economy,\" he added.",
      "Layoffs picking up",
      "Even before Tuesday's job cuts, layoffs had been trending higher, according to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Employers across the U.S. cut nearly 950,000 jobs this year through September, the largest number of layoffs since 2020, its most recent data shows.",
      "Official federal reports on the state of the labor market have been suspended due to the government shutdown, which means the Fed will make its next interest rate decision tomorrow, Oct. 29, without information about hiring in September.",
      "But job growth has slowed sharply in recent months, with average monthly payroll gains of roughly 27,000 between May and August \u2014 down from average gains of nearly 123,000 per month between January and April, labor data shows.",
      "On Oct. 1, the ADP National Employment Report, a measure of private employment in the U.S., said payrolls at private employers declined by 32,000 jobs in September.",
      "At the same time, recent reports suggest layoffs have accelerated in October, Grace Zwemmer, associate economist with Oxford Economics, said in a report Wednesday. State-level data also shows jobless claims by federal employees topped 10,000 in the week ended Oct. 18, a sign the stalemate in Congress is taking a toll, the investment advisory firm said in a separate research note.",
      "To be sure, the nation's unemployment rate remains low by historical standards, edging up to 4.3% in August from 4.2% in July. The latest layoffs are unlikely to dramatically drive up joblessness, experts say.",
      "\"When we look at the scale of the announcements vis-\u00e0-vis the broader economy and the data we have from unemployment claims, we don't see them yet at a scale where the unemployment rate is going to shoot up,\" said Andy Stettner, director of economy and jobs at the left-leaning Century Foundation.",
      "But, he added, \"These larger corporate downsizings are happening at a time when there aren't many job openings.\"",
      "That means some workers who lose their jobs could struggle to find new employment, experts say. As a result, the ranks of long-term unemployed people, or those who have been searching for work for more than six months, are predicted to rise even higher from its August figure of almost 2 million, the highest level since 2022.",
      "What's impacting the labor market?",
      "Employers are cutting jobs due to several factors, experts say, ranging from artificial intelligence to economic uncertainty. Earlier this year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the e-commerce giant's investment in AI tools would allow the company to\u00a0trim its human workforce\u00a0as the business becomes more efficient.",
      "\"Amazon really pointed to robotics, AI and new technology \u2014 and being on the cutting edge of that technology \u2014 for shifting jobs,\" Challenger said.",
      "About one-quarter of technology industry workers said they had experienced layoffs or role eliminations due to AI adoption during the past two years, according to a new study from career site Indeed.",
      "Other companies are holding off on hiring or are cutting jobs for other reasons. UPS cited the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, as well as shipping declines from Amazon, its biggest customer, on its business. Amazon has been building its own delivery infrastructure, leading it to cut back on its use of UPS.",
      "On Monday, children's clothing brand Carter's said it is cutting 300 jobs, or 15% of its workforce, and closing 150 stores over the next three years due to higher costs from tariffs, which are import duties paid by U.S. companies to the federal government.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-fomc-interest-rate-meeting-decision-october-29-forecast/",
    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 07:44:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Concerns about a weakening labor market may outweigh worries about rising inflation, tipping the Fed toward another rate cut, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve is set to make its next interest rate decision today, even as a near-total blackout of federal economic data continues amid the government shutdown.",
      "The Labor Department, however, on Friday released one key report ahead of its meeting:\u00a0the Consumer Price Index. That report showed that the inflation rate rose at a pace of 3% last month, cooler than expected, as the impact of President Trump's wide-ranging tariffs have so far been more muted than economists have forecast.",
      "Economists say the softer inflation report likely opens the door to a rate cut today.",
      "\"Concerns about tariffs driving prices higher are still not showing up in most categories,\" Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, said Friday in an email. \"Nothing in the inflation print should stop the Fed from cutting rates next week. Yes, prices are higher, but not enough to keep them from helping the economy,\" he added.",
      "There's a 96.7% probability that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points on Oct. 29,\u00a0according to CME FedWatch, which bases its predictions on 30-Day Fed Funds futures prices.",
      "A quarter-point cut would bring down the benchmark rate to a range of between 3.75% to 4%, down from its current range of between 4% to 4.25%, and mark the Fed's second rate cut this year.",
      "What's the argument for cutting rates?",
      "The Federal Reserve has a so-called dual mandate to keep both inflation and unemployment low. When inflation is soaring \u2014 such as when it hit a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022 \u2014 the Fed ratchets rates higher to make borrowing more expensive, which in turn dissuades consumers and businesses from spending, tempering inflation.",
      "But a weak labor market can be bolstered by lower interest rates, because it's easier for businesses to expand and hire more workers if it's less expensive to borrow money.",
      "When Powell last month announced the Fed's first rate cut of 2025, he signaled the central bank was growing increasingly concerned about a sharp slowdown in the labor market. \"In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen,\" he said in September.",
      "However, the monthly jobs report for September wasn't released earlier this month due to the federal shutdown. In an Oct. 14 speech, Powell acknowledged the data halt, yet added that the central bank has access to \"a wide variety of public- and private-sector data that have remained available.\"",
      "According to those sources of information, \"the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting,\" Powell noted.",
      "Friday's CPI report \"should keep the Fed focused on the labor market in terms of the near-term policy trajectory. In the absence of the September jobs report, an October cut appears to be a done deal,\" Bank of America economists noted in a Friday research report.",
      "How would a rate cut impact your money?",
      "While a quarter-point rate cut is relatively small, it would come after September's reduction \u2014 and economists are also expecting the Fed to usher in a third cut at its December meeting. Together, that means the benchmark rate by year-end could sit 0.75 percentage points lower than it was in January.",
      "That would help reduce rates for credit cards and loans such as home equity lines of credit, or HELOCs. Those types of credit products are based on the prime rate, or the interest rate that banks charge each other, and which in turn is based on the Fed's benchmark rate.",
      "Mortgage rates, meanwhile, have already dipped ahead of the Fed's rate decision. While mortgage rates aren't set by the Fed, they're\u00a0heavily influenced\u00a0by its policy moves, as well as bond market investors' expectations for economic growth and inflation.",
      "The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 6.19% as of Oct. 23, marking their lowest level in a year, according to Freddie Mac. Homebuyers might not see much more of a break, at least in the near-term, economists said.",
      "\"Mortgage rates have moved down notably in advance of the Fed's meeting, hitting their lowest level in more than a year, but further declines will depend on new developments,\" noted Realtor.com's chief economist Danielle Hale in an email. \"The Fed's decisions are anticipated by the market, which means that the upcoming rate cut and several more over the next few months are already largely priced in.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Oct 2025 19:05:22 -0400",
    "summary": "The Senate passed a measure that would block President Trump's tariffs on Brazil, after Democrats drew support from a handful of Republicans.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted on Tuesday to approve a resolution that would block President Trump's tariffs on Brazil, with five Republicans joining Democrats to back the measure in a rebuke to the president.",
      "Led by Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, the resolution would terminate the national emergency that the administration is using to impose 50% tariffs on goods from Brazil.",
      "The vote to approve the measure was 52 to 48. Republican Sens. Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Thom Tillis, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul joined Democrats to vote in favor. The resolution required a simple majority and was not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation.",
      "In July, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency with respect to \"recent policies, practices, and actions of the Government of Brazil\" that he said constitute an \"unusual and extraordinary threat.\" The move came during the trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who was ultimately convicted and sentenced to 27 years in prison for attempting a coup in 2022.",
      "\"President Trump's tariff regime \u2014 global, Brazilian tariffs, Canadian tariffs, tariff deals announced then paused, tariff deals negotiated, exceptions granted and in some cases not granted \u2014 have created huge chaos in the national economy,\" Kaine said in a speech on the Senate floor before the vote. \"Tariffs are a tax on American consumers. Tariffs are a tax on American businesses. And they are a tax that is imposed by a single person: Donald J. Trump.\"",
      "Kaine told reporters that the president's emergency order was \"unusual and extreme,\" and accused him of putting it in place due to the \"decision to prosecute Donald Trump's friend.\"",
      "\"If that's an emergency, then anything is an emergency, and any president can make up anything and call it an emergency and then use massive powers to impose regulations or evade regulations,\" Kaine said.",
      "The bill will still need to pass the House and be signed by the president, meaning it is mostly symbolic. House Republican leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs in the lower chamber.",
      "But Kaine said Tuesday that he has learned that \"the president is responsive to things like this.\"",
      "\"When he sees Republicans starting to vote against his policies, even in small numbers, that makes an impression on him and can often cause him to alter his behavior,\" he said.",
      "One of those Republican yes votes was McConnell, a former Senate majority leader who has clashed with Mr. Trump for years \u2014 including on trade policy. McConnell has long been skeptical of tariffs and supportive of free trade, a stance that was essentially considered doctrine in pre-Trump GOP politics.",
      "\"Tariffs make both building and buying in America more expensive,\" McConnell said in a statement prior to the vote. \"The economic harms of trade wars are not the exception to history, but the rule.\"",
      "Earlier in the day, Vice President JD Vance met with Senate Republicans at the Capitol and urged them to reject the resolution.",
      "\"The point that I made to my Republican colleagues, recognizing that there's a diversity of opinions about it, is that the tariffs give us the ability to put American workers first,\" Vance told reporters after the meeting. \"They force American industry to reinvest in the United States of America, instead of a foreign country. They're also incredible leverage for the president of the United States in negotiating these trade deals overseas.\"",
      "The president cited a law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act in his order imposing the Brazil tariffs. The act gives any senator the authority to force a vote to challenge the move, effectively bypassing Senate leadership.",
      "In April, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve a measure aimed at blocking the Canada tariffs. Those Republicans were Murkowski of Alaska, Collins of Maine and McConnell, along with Paul of Kentucky, a Republican who cosponsored the legislation. Later that month, an effort aimed at blocking Mr. Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on countries around the world fell short, with two senators who had previously backed the tariff measure absent from the vote. The resolutions need a simple majority to pass.",
      "Kaine said he would force additional votes on Canadian tariffs and global tariffs throughout the week as he pushes back on the administration and puts pressure on Senate Republicans.",
      "\"So the votes are about tariffs, and they're about the economic destruction of tariffs, but they are also really about, how much will we let a president get away with?\" Kaine said. \"Do my colleagues have a gag reflex or not, in terms of powers that constitutionally are handed to Congress?\"",

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds the SNAP program, warned earlier this month that there would be insufficient funding to pay full November benefits if the shutdown continued, prompting local governments to post notices on their websites about the potential interruption in payments.",
      "\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the USDA said in a memo\u00a0posted Sunday on its website. \"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.\"",
      "Democratic lawmakers have asked the USDA to use contingency funds to cover most of next month's SNAP benefits, but an agency memo surfaced on Friday that says \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.\" The document says the money is reserved for such things as helping people in disaster areas.",
      "That means beginning Nov. 1, the government will halt about $8 billion in monthly SNAP payments, cutting off food assistance for the one in eight Americans who are enrolled in the program. Recipients, who include households in every state, typically get about $187 a month on a prepaid card to help cover the cost of groceries.",
      "Unused benefits on SNAP recipients' cards will roll over into November.",
      "\"That's money that's already been appropriated. It's been put on their card,\" Mackenzie Libbey, a staff attorney with Community Legal Services, told CBS News Philadelphia. \"So we definitely do not want people rushing out to try to use up their benefits at the end of October thinking they're not going to be able to buy anything in November.\"",
      "The USDA said it is incumbent on Democrats in Congress to end the government shutdown.",
      "\"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely\" SNAP benefits and other federal food aid, the agency said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Some U.S. states, including Louisiana, Vermont and Virginia, have vowed to continue disbursing SNAP benefits even if the federal government suspends payments. New York on Monday\u00a0pledged $30 million in emergency food assistance, while also recently committing to provide millions more in support for food banks. The USDA memo stipulates that states won't be reimbursed for temporarily providing food aid to residents, raising questions about the viability of that approach.",
      "Other states are taking legal action.",
      "A coalition of 25 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday\u00a0sued the Trump administration, alleging that the suspension of food stamps is unlawful and threatens the health and well-being of millions. The states are asking a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the USDA to provide SNAP benefits in November by tapping into a contingency fund, which is estimated to hold around $5 billion.",
      "\"Where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sharlene Sutton, a 45-year-old single mother of four in Dorchester, Massachusetts, who left her job as a security officer last month to care for one of her children, who has epilepsy, said she relies on the $549 she gets in monthly SNAP benefits to feed her family.",
      "\"I was freaking out because I'm like, 'Oh my god, now I don't have a job,'\" she told CBS News. \"I'm not worried about myself that much. It's about the kids. Like, where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sutton said she's looking for a food bank to help fill the gap if her food aid is cut off. But experts warn that the non-profit organizations alone aren't capable of filling the $8 billion monthly hole left by a looming SNAP suspension.",
      "\"The charitable food system and food banks don't have the resources to replace all those food dollars,\" John Sayles, CEO of Vermont Foodbank in Barre, Vermont, told CBS News.",
      "Already, food banks are getting an influx of calls from SNAP recipients who are worried about the payment freeze, and food shelves could see long lines next month if the shutdown persists, Sayles said.",
      "\"There is no safety net after SNAP other than the food shelf,\" he added.",
      "Albuquerque, New Mexico's Roadrunner Food Bank, which typically serves 83,000 households per week, is \"seeing panic\" among residents due to the SNAP halt, said Katy Anderson, vice president of strategy, partnerships and advocacy at the nonprofit organization.",
      "George Matysik, executive director of the Share Food Program in Philadelphia, has also noticed an uptick in demand. He told CBS News in a text message that some of the pantries the hunger relief nonprofit works with have reported 12-fold increases in new registrations week to week.",
      "Even before this new surge in demand, food banks were already facing pressures because of the growing number of people seeking their services, aggravated this year by\u00a0persistent inflation, and funding constraints. In March, the\u00a0USDA said it was nixing $420 million in funding\u00a0for a program that allows food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.",
      "Broader economic impact",
      "A temporary halt in $8 billion in monthly food aid could also impact local businesses, from grocers to farm stands, said Sayles of Vermont Foodbank. Each $1 in SNAP benefits provides an economic benefit of $1.60, he said, referring to the so-called\u00a0multiplier effect\u00a0in which dollars flowing through the local economy help support spending, jobs and growth.",
      "\"SNAP is the foundation of economic support for a lot of food retailers, like those smaller places in rural areas and the corner store in our cities,\" said Kate Bauer, an associate professor of nutritional services at the University of Michigan. \"So this has far-reaching impacts beyond just the people who get SNAP.\"",
      "SNAP is designed to provide supplemental aid for a family's grocery budget, but some families depend on it as their main source of income to buy food, Bauer noted. For those living paycheck to paycheck, even a short disruption in benefits can have immediate consequences, experts said.",
      "The loss of SNAP funding threatens some of the most vulnerable people in the U.S., with the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities noting that two-thirds of food-stamp recipients are children, seniors or people with disabilities.",
      "For McBlais, the single mom, the issue isn't political. Rather, it's about making sure families can eat in an economy where many are already struggling to afford rent, utilities and basic groceries, she told CBS News.",
      "\"Everybody needs food \u2014 SNAP recipients are Democratic, Republicans and everything in between,\" McBlais said.",

      "Some federal workers who are not being paid during the government shutdown have a nagging fear: They might not receive retroactive pay once the impasse is resolved.",
      "Roughly 1.4 million federal employees\u00a0whose wages are being withheld during the government shutdown are\u00a0hunkering down\u00a0and cutting all nonessential spending, as they missed their first full paychecks on Friday.",
      "Here's what to know about retroactive pay for those workers when the shutdown ends.",
      "Do all federal workers get back pay?",
      "Both furloughed workers and so-called \"excepted\" government employees, who must continue to show up to work during the shutdown without compensation, are entitled to back pay under a federal law called the\u00a0Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019.",
      "The law makes clear that both classes of federal employees affected by a lack of funding will eventually be paid in full. They \"shall be paid for the period of the lapse in appropriations, and each excepted employee who is required to perform work during a covered lapse in appropriations shall be paid for such work, at the employee's standard rate of pay.\"",
      "Legal challenges",
      "However, a draft memo from the White House's Office of Management and Budget suggests that furloughed workers are not guaranteed back pay, an administration official confirmed to CBS News. When asked on Oct. 7 about furloughed workers getting back pay, President Trump said, \"I would say it depends on who we're talking about.\"",
      "Legal experts insist that federal employees are unequivocally protected under the 2019 law. In an Oct. 7 statement, Max Stier, CEO of the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, said the act \"is very clear in its mandate to give automatic back pay to furloughed workers during a lapse in appropriations.\"",
      "Dan Meyer, a partner at Tully Rinckey in Washington, D.C., said the law appropriates, not authorizes, back pay for workers.",
      "\"If this came to a judge, I think the appropriations language would speak heavily that they were required to pay the federal employees based on that legislation,\" he told CBS News.",

      "\"The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-1) provides that upon enactment of appropriations to end a lapse, both furloughed and excepted employees will be paid retroactively as soon as possible after the lapse ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates,\" the agency's notice read. However, an updated version\u00a0of guidelines strikes that language.",
      "\"Excepted employees will be paid for any earned overtime pay or holiday premium pay when appropriations are enacted,\" the OPM now states in its guidance.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS News' question about whether or not federal workers will be paid once the shutdown ends.",
      "When would back pay arrive?",
      "The short answer is as soon as the government shutdown ends.",
      "The Government Employee Fair Treatment Act stipulates that federal workers are owed back pay \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"",
      "Michael LeRoy, professor of labor and employment relations at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign college of law, told CBS News, \"The law makes clear that they are entitled to back pay, and it preferences automatic payment.\"",
      "Federal workers' last partial paycheck arrived on Oct. 10. Their next pay day was scheduled for Oct. 24. Workers were not paid. Paychecks have yet to be issued, as the second-longest government shutdown in history entered its 27th day Saturday, with no resolution on the horizon.",
      "What about government contractors?",
      "In addition to federal employees, the government contracts with private sector firms who employ millions of workers in custodial, information technology and other roles. They are not similarly guaranteed back pay.",
      "\"Contract workers are simply not covered by the statute,\" LeRoy said.",
      "They may, however, continue to work and receive paychecks if their assigned contracts are fully funded.",
      "What about workers who collect unemployment during the shutdown?",
      "Federal employees may be eligible for unemployment compensation during the shutdown. The Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees program provides benefits to federal workers \"who lost their employment through no fault of their own,\" according to a fact sheet.",
      "Benefits are available for 26 weeks, with maximum amounts varying by state law, according to an Office of Personnel Management memo.",
      "When workers are paid retroactively, the funds are applied against any unemployment benefits they received to avoid overpayment, the memo states.

    "summary": "Trump administration officials say new trade deals and aid could ease the strain, but many farmers are struggling to stay afloat.",
    "story": [
      "After several years of losing money on cattle, Burleen and Pete Wobeter thought this would finally be the year things turned around. Their Iowa farm also grows corn and soybeans \u2014 crops that have been hit hard by the trade war with China \u2014 but cattle had been a bright spot so far in 2025.",
      "\"This year, it is the one thing that is going to make any money for us,\" Burleen said.",
      "That's why they were astounded when President Trump announced he wanted to quadruple beef imports from Argentina, claiming it would \"bring our beef prices down\" and help \"a very good ally.\"",
      "His words sent wholesale cattle prices plummeting.",
      "\"I thought the whole point of tariffs was to bring production back home, and now he is trying to do something to destroy that production,\" Burleen said, adding, \" It feels like being a pawn in a game we're not going to win.\"",
      "\"We're being used and abused as producers,\" Pete added.",
      "For farmers across the U.S., this harvest season brought a new kind of uncertainty. China, once the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans, cut off purchases after tariffs escalated, leaving producers with full silos and falling prices.",
      "The Wobeters were hoping stronger cattle prices could make up for those losses.",
      "But while cattle ranchers are earning less, shoppers aren't seeing any savings. Ground beef is up nearly 13% and steak is up 16% over the past year, according to federal data. Economists say the spike is tied to drought, high feed costs and a shrinking U.S. cattle herd \u2014 now at its lowest level in decades.",
      "Bryan Whaley, CEO of the Iowa Cattlemen's Association, said more imports from Argentina won't fix that.",
      "\"You have to look at the total supply chain,\" Whaley said. \"It really only is gonna be about 2.5% of our total beef supply. So it's really not going to make a substantial difference.\"",
      "To help farmers and ranchers weather the downturn, the Trump administration announced last week it would release about $3 billion in assistance by tapping a fund used in Mr. Trump's first term to aid farmers, officials told CBS News.",
      "The Trump administration has discussed offering upward of $10 billion in relief to farmers, CBS News reported earlier this month. That potential aid package is on the back burner due to the shutdown, and is separate from the $3 billion in new assistance, a senior administration official said.",
      "At the same time, the administration recently hinted that new trade agreements could also help turn things around for soybean farmers. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that new deals, including one with China, would be positive for U.S. agriculture.",
      "\"Soybean farmers are going to be extremely happy with this deal for this year and for the coming years,\" he said.",
      "During his Asia trip, Mr. Trump said he expected the new trade deal with China to be finalized in the coming days.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inflation-beef-coffee-bananas-food-prices-cpi/",
    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 15:49:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Americans are paying significantly more for these food staples, price inflation data shows. Will inflation ever relent?",
    "story": [
      "For evidence that the cost of food in the U.S. remains hard to stomach for many households, look no further than the price of bananas, beef and coffee.",
      "Banana prices were up 6.9% in September from a year ago, ground beef has risen 12.9% and roasted coffee has jumped an eye-watering 18.9%, according to the most recent\u00a0Consumer Price Index\u00a0data for September. And now for the bad news.",
      "\"One of the questions that I'm asked a lot is, when are prices coming down? And my answer is simple: never,\" Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru, told CBS News. \"The best that we can hope for is stabilization.\"",
      "So what's behind the surging price of such foods? There are a mix of factors, ranging from the impact of climate change on crop harvests and U.S. tariffs on imports to the simple laws of economics.",
      "Beef",
      "As of September, the average cost of a pound of ground beef was $6.30, according to Federal Reserve\u00a0data\u00a0\u2014 the highest since the Department of Labor started tracking beef prices in the 1980s and 65% higher than in late 2019, just before COVID-19 ravaged the economy.",
      "Over the trailing 12 months through September, the cost of ground beef has climbed 65 cents per pound, or more than 11%, while the cost of a pound of boneless sirloin steak has jumped $2.35, or around 20%, the CBS News Price Tracker shows\u00a0(see below).",
      "The main reason beef has become painfully expensive comes down to economics and climate: As global temperatures rise, shrinking cattle herds are straining the nation's beef supply even as demand remains strong. As with any other product, prices tend to rise when demand outstrips supply.",
      "Simply, \"The problem is that there's less cows,\" Lempert said.",
      "As of July, there were 28.7 million beef cows across the U.S., the lowest number in decades, USDA\u00a0data\u00a0shows. Experts say the decline in the nation's cattle count is mainly due to intensifying droughts in recent decades that have forced farmers to reduce their herds. During a drought from 2011 to 2015, for example, farmers and ranchers were forced to reduce their herd sizes by up to 2% a year, the USDA has\u00a0found.",
      "Other factors lifting beef prices include higher grain costs and labor supply shortages at slaughterhouses, according to Lempert.",
      "According to Derrell Peel, a professor in the department of agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University, domestic beef production is projected to account for 90% of total consumption in the U.S. in 2025.",
      "As for beef from Brazil, America's largest import source, Peel said tariffs could also curb supplies. The total tariff on Brazilian beef imports now sits at 76.4%,\u00a0according\u00a0to the American Farm Bureau Federation.",
      "Coffee",
      "The average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee reached a record high of $9.14 per pound in September, labor\u00a0data shows. That's well over double the price from December 2019, or shortly before the pandemic, when a pound of ground coffee cost just over $4.",
      "Several factors are behind this increase. First, volatile weather, including both heavy rain and droughts in major coffee-producing countries, such as Brazil and Colombia, are depressing crop yields, Lempert explained. Earlier this month, for example, coffee prices rose after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration noted the return of\u00a0La Ni\u00f1a, a recurring weather pattern that influences global temperatures. That raised concerns about the possibility of drought in Brazil.",
      "Andrew Hultgren, an assistant professor of agricultural and consumer economics at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, said global prices for bananas and coffee will continue to be sensitive to extreme heat or drought conditions, especially because the products are cultivated in a relatively small number of regions around the world.",
      "\"These types of price sensitivities will look like inflation to the average consumer,\" he said.",
      "Lempert also said American tariffs on foreign imports are having an impact on domestic coffee prices. As of 2023 the U.S. imported about 80% its unroasted beans from Latin America,\u00a0according to the USDA, with Hawaii and Puerto Rico the only U.S. states or territories that produce much coffee.",
      "The Trump administration this year has imposed new tariffs on several major coffee producers that export to the U.S. That includes a 50% levy on Brazil, a 10% tariff on Colombia and a 20% tax on Vietnam. In Brazil, that has led producers to withhold shipments as they negotiate with American roasters over who will absorb the added costs, throttling supplies in the U.S., according to investment bank UBS.",
      "In a September\u00a0report, the International Coffee Organization, an intergovernmental membership organization for the coffee sector, cited uncertainty around coffee tariffs as one catalyst impacting supply in the U.S. Coffee \"cannot be produced in the U.S. on a large enough scale to meet domestic demand,\" the trade group noted.",
      "Bananas",
      "Bananas remain cheaper than most fruits, but even this grocery store staple isn't immune from inflation. The average cost of the potassium-rich fruit rose to 67 cents per pound in September \u2014 the highest price on record in the U.S. and up 10 cents, or nearly 18%, since late 2019,\u00a0according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Among consumers, the issue caused an uproar last year after Trader Joe's announced it was upping the price of its bananas for the first time in over two decades, from 19 cents each to 23 cents.",
      "As with coffee beans, supply constraints and tariffs have pushed up banana prices, experts note. Most bananas sold in the U.S. are imported from Central and South America. According to the American Farm Bureau Federation, Guatemala supplied 40% of U.S. bananas in 2023, while Ecuador and Costa Rica each accounted for 16%.",
      "Tom Stenzel, executive director of the Banana Importers Association, recently told\u00a0CNBC\u00a0that U.S. tariffs on bananas from Guatemala, Ecuador, Honduras and Costa Rica remain in effect, with levies as high as 15%.",
      "A pesky fungal disease known as Panama Disease has also reduced U.S. banana supplies, specifically threatening Cavendish bananas, the most popular variety, Lempert noted.",
      "\"The banana that we know and love is getting destroyed by different pests,\" he said.",

    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 12:39:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Jim Farley discusses the difficulties of tariffs in imported parts, which have cost Ford a billion dollars \u2013 and may give an advantage to their competitors. He also explains why he drives a Chinese-made electric vehicle.",
    "story": [
      "At Ford's Michigan Assembly outside Detroit, more than 4,500 hourly employees turn out about 100,000 Broncos a year \u2013 a new one every 60 seconds.",
      "For obvious reasons, Ford's been touting its commitment to American manufacturing. It advertises itself as employing the most hourly workers in the country \u2013 and more than 80 percent of its vehicles sold in the U.S. are indeed made in America. That's the highest share of any Detroit automaker.",
      "But Ford imports many parts, and has been hit hard by President Trump's tariffs. Ford CEO Jim Farley says it's not affordable to make all the parts here, and that if Ford only used American-made parts, American-made cars would be too expensive for many Americans to buy.",
      "And there are some components, Farley says, that no one even makes in America: \"There are parts, fasteners, wiring looms from other countries. And we pay our tariffs, sometimes up to 70 percent on those parts.\"",
      "And who is paying for those tariffs? \"Well, the company right now,\" he said. \"And in the end of the day, it's all these workers.\"",
      "Farley has deep roots in Michigan. His grandfather was Ford Motor Company's 389th employee \u2013 one of the first to help build the Model T. \u00a0But Farley himself is not a Ford lifer. Before joining the company in 2007, he spent nearly two decades at Toyota.",
      "And how did that go over in the Farley family when he went to Toyota? \"Not well,\" Jim laughed. \"Because at the time, you know, they were just, all through the '70s, there was just job loss after job loss across southeast Michigan. And my grandfather was thinking about all the people that lost their jobs. And they were like, Why? Why are you doing this?\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you see similarities between the '80s, when the U.S. auto industry was facing the increased competition from Japan, to today where it's China?\"",
      "\"Oh, I think it's exactly the same thing, but it's on steroids,\" Farley replied.",
      "\"A completely different level of risk for our industry\"",
      "Ironically, it's a Biden-era tariff that has so far spared Detroit from that competition. In May of last year, the U.S. imposed a 100% surcharge on Chinese-made electric vehicles, which effectively bans them from the American road. But Chinese EVs are gaining ground in Europe, Latin America, and especially China, the world's largest market.",
      "Farley has called these small, inexpensive, tech-savvy cars an existential threat. \"They have enough capacity in China with existing factories to serve the entire North American market, put us all out of business,\" he said. \"Japan never had that. So, this is a completely different level of risk for our industry.\"",
      "\"Are the Chinese cars being made today something Americans would want to buy?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes,\" said Farley. \"I drive a Xiaomi SU7. High quality, great digital experience.\"",
      "\"You're driving a Chinese car? Why?\"",
      "\"Because of the competition. And to beat them, you have to know them.\"",
      "Farley's firsthand experience with Chinese EVs is a big reason Ford is pivoting to smaller, more affordable electric vehicles. This past summer, in announcing production of a new midsize electric pickup truck to sell for $30,000, Farley said, \"It represents the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T.\"",
      "That hands-on approach is one holdover from his days at Toyota. Another is his annual road trip to see his products in action. \"I believe in genchi genbutsu. It's a Japanese word that means 'go and see where the work is actually done.' I took a Lightning through California with my son. And it became pretty clear that we had a big problem with our charging network. So, after that trip, I called Elon [Musk]. Out of the blue, never met him or anything. I was like, is there any way you would share your supercharging network with Ford?\"",
      "If you heard his name and noticed the resemblance to the late actor Chris Farley, you weren't wrong: the \"Saturday Night Live\" star was Jim Farley's cousin. \"I think there's, uh, a little bit of kid in all of us Farleys, a little bit of that kind of devilish, little snarky tomfoolery,\" he said. \"On the other hand, I would say I was, you know, kind of on the pretty serious side of the Farley spectrum!\"",
      "Jim Farley will need every bit of that serious side to steer Ford through one of its biggest economic and political tests in decades \u2013 building a future that keeps tens of thousands of American auto workers on the line. \"What I care about is that transformation of Ford,\" he said. \"I'd like to be able to come back here in 20 years, if I'm still alive, and see all the people, that they're still busy, like my grandfather. My grandfather had nothing until he had the Ford job. Our jobs as leaders are about them.\"",
      "EDITOR'S NOTE: An earlier version of this story  stated that Ford would have a $2 billion tariff bill, amounting to 20%  of the company's global profits. Due to  recent changes to the Trump administration's  tariff program, including an extension to an offset program for  imported parts on domestically-assembled automobiles, Ford now estimates  that tariffs will cost the company $1 billion.",

    "summary": "A prolonged government shutdown, as occurred in 2018, could lead to long lines at TSA checkpoints and economic losses, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",

    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has posted a notice on its website saying federal food aid will not go out on Nov. 1, raising the stakes for families nationwide as the government shutdown drags on.",
      "The new notice comes after the Trump administration said it would not tap roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly referred to as SNAP, flowing into November. That program helps about 1 in 8 Americans buy groceries.",
      "\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the\u00a0USDA notice\u00a0says. \"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats.\"",
      "The shutdown, which began on Oct. 1, is now the second-longest on record. While the Republican administration took steps leading up to the shutdown to ensure SNAP benefits were paid this month, the cutoff would expand the impact of the impasse to a wider swath of Americans \u2014 and some of those most in need \u2014 unless a political resolution is found in just a few days.",
      "The administration blames Democrats, who say they will not agree to reopen the government until Republicans negotiate with them on extending expiring subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans say Democrats must first agree to reopen the government before negotiations.",
      "\"There is an urgent need to reopen the government, which is why we continue to demand that Republicans sit at the negotiating table so we can enact a spending agreement that's bipartisan in nature,\"\u00a0House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have written to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins requesting that she use contingency funds to cover the bulk of next month's benefits.",
      "But a USDA memo that surfaced Friday says \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.\" The document says the money is reserved for such things as helping people in disaster areas.",
      "The memo cited Hurricane Melissa, which has strengthened into a major hurricane, as an example of why it's important to have the money available to mobilize quickly in the event of a disaster.",
      "The prospect of families not receiving food aid has deeply concerned states run by both parties.",
      "Some states have pledged to keep SNAP benefits flowing even if the federal program halts payments, but there are questions about whether U.S. government directives may allow that to happen. The USDA memo also says states would not be reimbursed for temporarily picking up the cost.",
      "Other states are telling SNAP recipients to be ready for the benefits to stop. Arkansas and Oklahoma, for example, are advising recipients to identify food pantries and other groups that help with food.",
      "Gina Plata-Ni\u00f1o, interim director for SNAP at the Food Research and Action Center, told \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday that the situation is a \"man-made disaster that could be easily avoided regardless of what is going on in the shutdown.\"",

      "German businessman Alexander B\u00f6cker was reading the news with his wife last Sunday when she told him about a robbery at the Louvre in Paris.",
      "\"My wife said, 'Well, look at this: Somebody broke into the Louvre. There's a robbery going on!'\" he recalled in an interview with CBS News.",
      "Right away, his wife, Julia Scharwatz, noticed something familiar: the lift used in the robbery looked just like one that their company makes.",
      "\"If you know the product, you can really quickly identify that it was your product,\" B\u00f6cker said on Friday. \"It became clear to us that this is a reprehensible act, and they have used our machine for it.\"",
      "The machine was the B\u00f6cker Agilo, a lift that can be used in construction or to hoist furniture to apartments through upper-story windows.",
      "It is just one of the machines that B\u00f6cker's company \u2014 called B\u00f6cker \u2014 manufactures. And as more details of the robbery emerged \u2014 particularly that no one had been hurt \u2014 B\u00f6cker and Scharwatz, who works alongside her husband as the company's head of marketing, began getting messages from colleagues and employees asking: \"Can't we make something out of it?\"",
      "The next day, the brainstorming began as they tried to think of new ways to advertise in the wake of the heist, which saw thieves run off with an estimated $102 million\u00a0in jewels. The robbers used the B\u00f6cker lift to get to a second-story balcony where they accessed the Louvre by cutting through a window, and officials say they got in and out in just four minutes.",
      "One proposed ad slogan was: \"'Well even criminal professionals are using the best machinery,' something like that,\" B\u00f6cker said.",
      "But it was Scharwatz who had the winning idea \u2014 to focus on the speed of B\u00f6cker machines.",
      "\"We bought the picture, and then we had to decide: Shall we do it or not? And I said, 'Well, I hope everybody gets our sense of humor.' You know, normally, the Germans are not very famous for having a sense of humor,\" B\u00f6cker said.",
      "He said he felt like it was \"a very thin line,\" but because no one had been hurt, \"we said: 'Let's go for it.'\"",
      "The final ad, published on social media, shows an image of the B\u00f6cker machine positioned outside the Louvre after the robbery.",
      "\"If you're in a hurry,\" the tagline says. That's followed by details about the product: \"The B\u00f6cker Agilo carries your treasures up to 400 kg at 42 m/min \u2014 quiet as a whisper thanks to its 230 V electric motor.\"",
      "A post shared by B\u00f6cker Maschinenwerke GmbH (@boeckermaschinenwerke)",
      "The response to the campaign has been mixed. Many have found it funny, with some who work in marketing and advertising reaching out to the company calling it smart.",
      "It has also gotten a lot of attention. Posts on the company's social media sites typically draw 15,000-20,000 views per post, B\u00f6cker said, but this one garnered more than 4.3 million views on Instagram and Facebook.",
      "\"So, yeah, it is quite an unusual event for us,\" B\u00f6cker said.",
      "That publicity, though, has not translated into sales, at least yet.",
      "\"The normal customer base, especially in Europe, they know the product pretty well. We are (a) market leader in that segment,\" B\u00f6cker said. \"Maybe now, in other countries where this product is not so well known or not so known at all, there is maybe an interest.\"",
      "B\u00f6cker wanted to make clear, though, that neither he nor his company support the robbery at the Louvre.",
      "\"We are against, completely against, criminal activities, and we are also a serious company. 620 employees in Germany. Everything is produced in Germany, and we are also for safety,\" B\u00f6cker said. \"It was just a world event happening with one of our machines, and we tried to use it. And we really do not want \u2026 anybody to get bad feelings about that. And if so, we are sorry for that.\"",

      "Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One during his trip to Asia, the president said he could send the \"Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines,\" and \"anybody I wanted\" into U.S. cities, and would do so \"if I thought it was necessary.\" Earlier in his trip, the president told U.S. troops at the Yokosuka naval base near Tokyo that he was prepared to send \"more than the National Guard\" into U.S. cities if needed.",
      "Asked whether he meant sending other branches of the military into U.S. cities, Mr. Trump said Wednesday, \"You know if I want to enact a certain act, I'm allowed to do it routinely,\" an apparent reference to the Insurrection Act, which allows the military to act in a law enforcement capacity to suppress a rebellion or quell domestic violence. The authority that has not been invoked by a U.S. president in more than 30 years.",
      "\"And I'd be allowed to do whatever I want,\" Mr. Trump added. \"But we haven't chosen to do that because we're very well \u2014 we're doing very well without it. But I'd be allowed to do that, you understand that, and the courts wouldn't get involved, nobody would get involved, and I could send the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, I can send anybody I wanted. But I haven't done that because we're doing so well without it.\"",
      "The president touted the National Guard deployments in Washington, D.C., and Memphis, Tennessee, as the administration insists their presence is driving down crime. The president has generally targeted Democratic-led cities for National Guard deployments. The cities of Chicago and\u00a0D.C.\u00a0and the states of Illinois, California and Oregon have sued the administration over the deployments.",
      "The Posse Comitatus Act restricts the U.S. military from carrying out domestic law enforcement actions. But there are exceptions to the law.",

      "The last time a president invoked the Insurrection Act was in 1992, when Gov. Gray Davis of California asked President George H.W. Bush for help to quell the riots in Los Angeles after a jury acquitted four police officers who were accused of assaulting and beating Black man Rodney King. The incident was caught on video.",
      "\"He would have to invoke this provision unless a governor requested the help,\" Corn said of Mr. Trump.",
      "In D.C., Mr. Trump deployed the D.C. National Guard troops under a section of federal law known as Title 32, meaning they're not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act. Members of the D.C. Guard also deployed in Title 32 status in 2020, in response to protests over the murder of George Floyd, when the D.C. government requested additional manpower. They also deployed in Title 32 status in response to the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol, after some delay.",

      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune said in the morning that talks among rank-and-file senators have \"ticked up significantly,\" and that the conversations might be a \"precursor of things to come.\"",
      "Senators pointed to a number of upcoming deadlines as motivating factors, including pay for the military and an upcoming freeze of benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which helps 42 million Americans buy food.",

      "A federal judge ruled Tuesday that the Justice Department's top prosecutor in Los Angeles has served unlawfully in his role for months, the latest court to push back on the Trump administration's efforts to name acting prosecutors.",
      "U.S. District Judge Michael Seabright ruled that acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, who oversees the Justice Department's outpost in the Central District of California, cannot oversee the prosecutions of three people who were charged with gun crimes. The judge rejected a request by the three defendants to toss out their charges altogether.",
      "Essayli \u2014 a former California Republican state lawmaker \u2014 was named interim U.S. attorney in April, a role that's typically limited to just 120 days. But days before the clock ran out, Essayli resigned and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi immediately named him first assistant U.S. attorney because, under federal law, the holder of that job becomes the office's acting head when there's a vacancy.",
      "Seabright ruled that this maneuver was unlawful because only the first assistant U.S. attorney who is already in place when the office becomes vacant is eligible to become acting chief.",
      "\"Simply stated: Essayli unlawfully assumed the role of Acting United States Attorney for the Central District of California. He has been unlawfully serving in that capacity since his resignation from the interim role on July 29, 2025,\" Seabright wrote. \"Essayli may not perform the functions and duties of the United States Attorney as Acting United States Attorney. He is disqualified from serving in that role.\"",
      "Seabright said Essayli can continue to serve as first assistant U.S. attorney.",
      "Essayli responded to the ruling in a post on X that said \"nothing is changing\" and he will \"continue serving as the top federal prosecutor in the Central District of California.\"",
      "In several states, the Trump administration has sought to keep federal prosecutors in temporary roles for months. Critics argue the administration is trying to sidestep the Senate, which is responsible for confirming permanent U.S. attorneys, and the federal judiciary, which can opt to extend the terms of interim U.S. attorneys in some cases.",
      "Essayli joins two other acting U.S. attorneys \u2014 Alina Habba of New Jersey and Sigal Chattah of Nevada \u2014 who have been disqualified for similar reasons, though a judge put Chattah's disqualification on hold pending appeal.",

      "A former high-ranking homeland security official in the first Trump administration is launching a new online hub Wednesday to facilitate protests and other resistance efforts against President Trump and his policies.",
      "Miles Taylor, a former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security, is leading a group of dozens of former national security officials, whistleblowers and a bipartisan group of former elected officials to create a website called defiance.org.",
      "In its mission statement, the bipartisan group says the tool is \"designed to help Americans push back peacefully, lawfully, and defiantly against presidential abuses of power.\"",
      "Taylor told CBS News, \"There are many organizations and a million efforts, but there has not been a clearinghouse for people who regularly seek ways to engage. This is a 'Google' for defiance, where people can go to see their options to push back lawfully, peacefully and defiantly.\"",
      "In September 2018, Taylor wrote an anonymous opinion piece in the New York Times that said there was a \"quiet resistance\" to President Trump within his own administration, made up of people \"working diligently\" to block what he called the president's \"worst inclinations.\" He disclosed two years later that he had written the op-ed.",
      "The announcement of the new site is intended to capitalize on momentum from the October \"No Kings\" rallies earlier this month, which attracted participants across the country.",
      "The site launched Wednesday with a video of actor Robert DeNiro, a staunch Trump critic, urging protesters and critics to join forces.",
      "\"You can't just sit on your ass and wait for the insanity and cruelty to pass. No,\" DeNiro says in the video. \"You gotta stand up and fight.\"",
      "In April, Mr. Trump signed an executive memo targeting Taylor, accusing him of manufacturing stories to sell a book, and ordered DHS, the Justice Department and other government agencies to investigate him and revoke his security clearances, as well as for those who worked closely with him. Mr. Trump also ordered an investigation into the alleged dissemination of classified documents while Taylor worked for the government. Taylor denies he leaked any such material.",
      "Defiance.org is described in its mission statement as a \"nationwide 'mutual aid' pact to defend those under attack.\" It aims to support nonprofit partners, and says it will join \"peaceful protests and legal defense efforts.\"",
      "Taylor told CBS News supporters of the effort include Stephanie Grisham, a press secretary from the first Trump administration, and former aide Olivia Troye, both of whom have become vocal critics of the president.",
      "Dozens of former elected leaders and Trump critics, including former Republican congressmen Reid Ribble, Denver Riggleman and Joe Walsh, are also supporting the new portal.",
      "Taylor said the mutual aid feature of the portal is intended to help those targeted by the administration. He said a future effort could include rallying legal, political and community leaders to support Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who is under investigation by the Justice Department, if he is charged. Taylor said the Defiance.org hub would be used to galvanize and organize legal help, courthouse supporters and public statements in support of Schiff or against the Trump administration.",
      "Riggleman told CBS News the group would seek to \"protect Americans against political overreach and targeted retaliation.\"",
      "The White House has harshly criticized Taylor in the past, including in this statement in April.",
      "\"While serving as an administrative staff assistant at the Department of Homeland Security, Taylor stoked dissension by manufacturing sensationalist reports on the existence of a supposed 'resistance' within the federal government that 'vowed' to undermine and render effective (sic) a sitting President,\" the White House said.",

      "Senate Democrats want to extend a slate of expiring health insurance subsidies in exchange for their votes to reopen the government, but Republicans have pressed to end the shutdown with no strings attached before negotiating on health care. Meanwhile, thousands of federal employees are missing out on paychecks, and tens of millions of food aid recipients are set to lose their benefits starting this weekend.",

      "During a visit to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Vice President JD Vance put the onus on Senate Democrats to vote to end the shutdown.  \"We just need five more reasonable Democrats to do what the American people want us to do, to open up the government,\" he told reporters.",
      "In recent weeks, two moderate Democrats, Sens. John Fetterman and Catherine Cortez Masto, and an independent, Sen. Angus King, have voted with almost all Republicans in favor of a House-passed stopgap measure that would extend government funding at existing levels until mid-November, allowing the shutdown to end.",

      "Jeffries also blasted the Trump administration over the expected end to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits on Saturday, saying Republicans \"can't find a dime to make sure that 42 million Americans, including 16 million children, don't go hungry.\"",

      "House GOP leaders argue they don't need to return because the chamber has already passed a continuing resolution to keep the government open, and it's up to the Senate to follow suit.",
      "Raskin represents scores of federal workers in the D.C. suburbs who have faced missed paychecks and the threat of layoffs during the shutdown.

      "\"We are preparing to appoint a new slate of members to the commission that are more aligned with President Trump's America First Policies,\" a White House official told CBS News.",
      "The Commission of Fine Arts had six members, all of whom were appointed during former President Joe Biden's term. Their ouster is not without precedent: The Biden administration replaced at least six members of the commission who were named during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "The firings come as Mr. Trump seeks to put his stamp on D.C., with plans to replace the White House's East Wing with a 90,000-square-foot ballroom and build a gigantic triumphal arch across the river from D.C. He also signed an executive order in August titled \"Making Federal Architecture Beautiful Again,\" which called for classical architecture modeled on ancient Greece and Rome to be the default style for D.C.-area buildings moving forward.",
      "The Commission of Fine Arts is one of several boards that reviews, provides comments on and approves construction in the capital, along with the National Capital Planning Commission. Mr. Trump picked three new members of the latter commission in July, including Chair William Scharf, a White House aide.",
      "It's not clear whether the White House intends to submit its ballroom plans to the Commission of Fine Arts, which has overseen some prior White House projects. A White House official told CBS News last week that the plans will be submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission.",
      "Mr. Trump's construction kick has drawn a polarizing response. The sudden decision to demolish the East Wing last week \u2014 despite Mr. Trump's earlier claim that the ballroom project would not touch the existing building \u2014 has faced criticism, and some historic preservation groups have urged the Trump administration to go through the normal approval process for the ballroom project.",
      "\"This project represents one of the most substantial alterations to the White House in modern history,\" Democratic Reps. Jared Huffman, Robert Garcia and Yassamin Ansari said in a letter to the president. \"The decisions were made in complete secrecy and undertaken without public disclosure or proper consultation.\"",
      "The White House, meanwhile, has called the pushback \"manufactured outrage\" and argued that prior presidents have also made changes to the complex. The administration has also cast the ballroom as a necessary addition to a building that's lacking in large event spaces.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 09:04:06 -0400",
    "summary": "Officials from half the states and the District of Columbia are asking a federal judge to order the Department of Agriculture to provide food stamp benefits for November.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A coalition of officials from half of the states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration on Tuesday over the suspension of food stamp benefits amid the ongoing government shutdown, as millions of Americans brace for a disruption in federal food aid in the coming days.",
      "The states, which include California, New York and Pennsylvania, are asking a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the Department of Agriculture to provide benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program\u00a0for November, including by tapping into a contingency fund to ensure the assistance continues to flow to more than 25 million people living within their borders.",
      "They argue that the administration's decision to cut off food stamp payments, which are provided to roughly 42 million people nationwide, is unlawful and threatens to deprive millions of Americans of essential food benefits that help protect against food insecurity and hunger.",
      "\"Shutting off SNAP benefits will cause deterioration of public health and well-being,\" state officials wrote in their lawsuit. \"Ultimately, the States will bear costs associated with many of these harms. The loss of SNAP benefits leads to food insecurity, hunger, and malnutrition, which are associated with numerous negative health outcomes in children, such as poor concentration, decreased cognitive function, fatigue, depression, and behavioral problems.\"",
      "The states involved in the suit are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania,\u202fRhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.",
      "As the government shutdown continues to drag on, the Trump administration announced last week that federal food aid would not go out on Nov. 1 after the Department of Agriculture declined to tap into roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits through the food stamp program flowing.",
      "The agency blamed Democrats for failing to back a House-passed stopgap bill to fund the government, writing on its website that \"the well has run dry.\"",
      "\"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats,\" a spokesperson for the USDA said in response to the lawsuit. \"Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments.\"",
      "The agency's plan for a lapse in funding, issued Sept. 30, said that multi-year contingency funds could be used for state administrative expenses to ensure states could continue SNAP operations during a shutdown and were also available \"to fund participant benefits in the event\" of a funding lapse.",
      "But a memo from the USDA issued last week said \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits\" and are instead meant for things like assisting people in disaster areas. The document cited Hurricane Melissa, which made landfall Tuesday in Jamaica as one of the strongest Atlantic storms ever recorded.",
      "Still, state officials argued in their lawsuit that the USDA's claim that the contingency funds can't be used to fund food benefits during a lapse in federal funding violates the text of congressional appropriations law and is a \"dramatic change\" in its own policy.",
      "They noted that during the last shutdown, USDA said in guidance in January 2019 that said that \"limited funding is available from the contingency that can be used to provide benefits for February.\"",
      "\"Millions of Americans are about to go hungry because the federal government has chosen to withhold food assistance it is legally obligated to provide,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. \"SNAP is one of our nation's most effective tools to fight hunger, and the USDA has the money to keep it running. There is no excuse for this administration to abandon families who rely on SNAP, or food stamps, as a lifeline. The federal government must do its job to protect families.\"",
      "The Trump administration has attempted to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to reopen the government, announcing cancellations of federal funding for programs in blue states and issuing layoff-notices to thousands of federal workers.",
      "The ongoing shutdown, which is in its 28th day, is now the second-longest on record.",
      "Ahead of the approaching halt to food stamp payments, some states have said they will work to keep the assistance going to beneficiaries. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans receive food stamps, and recipients receive, on average, a payment of $187 on prepaid cards that can be used to buy groceries.",
      "The impending lapse in food stamps has raised concerns among Republicans and Democrats. GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced legislation last week that aims to ensure continued funding for the food assistance program during the shutdown. The plan has garnered support from 10 other Republican senators and Democratic Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont.",
      "Democrats have separately urged Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to use the agency's reserve funds to help cover food stamp benefits next month, though she has declined to do so.",

      "\"We're going to be, I hope, making a deal. I think we're going to have a deal. I think it will be a good deal for both,\" the president said. \"The world is watching, and I think we'll have something that's very exciting for everybody.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made the remarks during a speech to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, the last major scheduled stop of a nearly weeklong swing through Asia. Much of his trip has focused on cementing trade agreements and boosting economic ties with U.S. partners in the region.",
      "Trump says U.S. and South Korea deal \"pretty much finalized\"",
      "The president has signed trade and tariff deals with Japan, Malaysia and several other countries during his trip, and after scheduled talks with South Korean officials on Wednesday, he told reporters before a formal state dinner hosted by South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung: \"We reached a deal. We had a great session. It's an honor.\"",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had told reporters ahead of Mr. Trump's visit that he didn't expect a U.S.-South Korea trade agreement to be completely nailed down during the president's trip, but he said he thought it was close.",
      "Mr. Trump, speaking later to the leaders gathered for the dinner, indicated there were still some details to nail down, saying the U.S. and South Korea had \"pretty much finalized a trade deal,\" and adding that the negotiating teams \"came to a conclusion on a lot of very important items.\"",
      "The two countries\u00a0announced\u00a0a framework deal over the summer similar to the one signed earlier in the week with Japan, with 15% tariffs on South Korean goods and investments pledged in the U.S.",
      "An end to the U.S.-China trade war?",
      "But a direct meeting with China's Xi in South Korea on Thursday is the most hotly anticipated part of his trip. The foreign ministry in Beijing confirmed on Wednesday that a sit-down was planned, saying Xi would meet with Mr. Trump in Busan, \"to exchange views on bilateral relations and issues of mutual interest.\"",
      "Officials in Beijing have not yet voiced the same optimism publicly over a looming deal to end the trade war, and the meeting could be tense, as China and the U.S. have clashed for months, imposing reciprocal tariffs and restrictions on the import and export of key items.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to press Xi to loosen a set of tough export restrictions on rare earth elements from China, which are essential for everything from computer chips to aerospace. He had threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese goods starting from Saturday unless Beijing backs off.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday\u00a0that the additional\u00a0100% tariffs\u00a0\u2014 which would boost the total U.S. tariff rate on Chinese imports to 140% \u2014 were \"effectively off the table\" after a two-day meeting with a Chinese negotiator.",
      "The trade war has led China to halt purchases of U.S. soybeans, causing pain for American farmers, though Bessent said Sunday that he\u00a0expects Beijing to end its soybean boycott.",
      "Mr. Trump also\u00a0needs Chinese approval\u00a0for a deal to transfer TikTok's U.S. operations from Beijing-based parent company ByteDance.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0predicted\u00a0earlier this week that the two leaders will reach an agreement by the end of his trip, saying he has \"a lot of respect for President Xi\" and, \"I think we're going to come away with a deal.\"",
      "Nicholas Burns, a Biden-era U.S. ambassador to China, told CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes that Wednesday's meeting is \"very important,\" calling the trade war a \"test of wills\" between the world's two biggest economies.",
      "\"China is the most important competitor, adversary of the United States worldwide now. It will be in the future,\" Burns said. \"So the stakes are high, because we have lots of issues where we are competing with China.\"",
      "Trump addresses U.S. partners in Asia",
      "The president also used his speech at the APEC event to tout the other trade deals he's inked in Asia. He highlighted his plans to partner with other countries on key industries including shipbuilding, semiconductors and critical minerals, and framed the trade negotiations as an extension of the U.S. defense alliances in the region, telling audience members that \"economic security is national security.\"",
      "APEC is a regional economic group with 21 member countries around the Pacific Rim, including China, Mexico, Russia, Singapore, South Korea and Vietnam. Promoting free trade is a major component of the forum, despite Mr. Trump's push for higher tariffs on many member countries, a strategy that the president argues is necessary to rebalance trade.",
      "Critics warn his strategy could lead to higher inflation and more sluggish economic growth.",
      "The president is looking to cinch a trade agreement with South Korea, the United States' sixth-largest trading partner. Over the summer, Mr. Trump announced a framework deal that involves the U.S. charging 15% tariffs on South Korean goods, while South Korea invests billions in U.S. industry and opens its market to American cars. Bessent told reporters the South Korea deal is unlikely to be resolved this week, but it's close.",
      "During his APEC remarks, Mr. Trump called South Korea \"a cherished American friend and a close ally.\" He said he's looking to work with the country on investments in U.S. shipbuilding.",
      "Before leaving his previous stop in Japan, Mr. Trump signed a trade deal\u00a0on Tuesday with new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, cementing 15% tariffs on imported Japanese goods, lower than the 25% initially threatened by the president. Japan also pledged $550 billion in investments in U.S. industry.",

      "There are questions about the legality of a donation of this sort (the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits federal agencies from exceeding congressional appropriations or accepting voluntary services). Over the weekend, The New York Times identified the anonymous donor as Timothy Mellon, a reclusive railroad magnate and heir to the Gilded Age Mellon family fortune.",
      "Mellon, 83, emerged as one of the top Republican donors only in the past few years, giving far less in the decades before 2017.",
      "Anna Massoglia, a campaign finance researcher, told CBS News, \"Timothy Mellon was a relatively unknown political donor but his contributions have surged in recent years, putting him in the very top ranks of political contributors.\"",
      "Early in his adult life, he held liberal views on race, the problem of income inequality and the environment. As Mellon's business career evolved, he began to express a strong antipathy for what he viewed as intrusive government regulations on business. One turning point seems to be when he ran afoul of environmental regulators in Connecticut in the late 1990s over an airport he bought.",
      "He's written a memoir and penned some opinion pieces that offer some insight into his political views. Mellon wrote that a favorite quote of his came from Winston Churchill: \"Show me a young Conservative and I'll show you someone with no heart. Show me an old Liberal and I'll show you someone with no brains.\"",
      "Mellon did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here are some numbers associated with Mellon:",
      "At least $197 million: How much Mellon donated to Trump and Republicans in the 2024 election",
      "Mellon may be an obscure figure to the wider public, but he's well known in political circles for giving more than virtually any other donor to Mr. Trump and other Republican committees during the 2024 election cycle \u2014 at least $197 million, according to Federal Election Commission records. The only person who gave more was SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.",
      "He emerged on the political scene as a megadonor relatively late in life. Over two decades, from 1996 to 2017, he gave a total of $350,000 in donations to political candidates. But in the four years between January 2020 and June 2024 he gave $227 million to federal candidates and political committees.",
      "Last year, Mellon made a $50 million donation to a Trump-affiliated super PAC, one of the largest individual contributions ever made public. That was one of several donations to the super PAC during the 2024 election cycle, totaling around $150 million. He also contributed $13 million to the Sentinel Action Fund, a voter turnout super PAC that used to be affiliated with Heritage Action, the sister organization of the conservative Heritage Foundation.",
      "$25 million: How much Mellon gave to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presidential campaign",
      "Mellon also gave $25 million to support Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s 2024 presidential campaign. Some speculated that Mellon was trying to be a spoiler to help Mr. Trump, whom he was also backing financially.",
      "But last August, he wrote an article in the American Spectator explaining his support for Kennedy. Mellon, it turns out, is a COVID-19 vaccine skeptic. \"I could not fathom how a 'vaccine' could be foisted on the general public with so little (if any) adequate testing.\"",
      "He began giving to Kennedy's Children's Health Defense, which promotes false information about vaccines, and later to the Super PAC supporting Kennedy's campaign.",
      "$14.1 billion: The Mellon family's estimated wealth",
      "Timothy Mellon, the grandson of banker and industrialist Andrew Mellon, was estimated by Forbes to be worth about $1 billion last year, though he told Forbes in an email at the time that he was not a billionaire, writing, \"never have been, never will be.\" The estimated wealth of his family, including other branches, was estimated in 2024 by Forbes to be $14.1 billion.",
      "340: The number of trees he cut down at a Connecticut airport he bought",
      "One defining episode for Mellon occurred after he purchased an airport in Connecticut in the late 1990s. He cut down 340 trees, arguing that they posed a danger to pilots landing their planes. But state environmental regulators ultimately sued him and won. He was ordered to pay tens of thousands of dollars in damages.",
      "$53 million: How much he donated to build a border wall in Texas",
      "In 2021, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced Texas would build its own border wall and started his own private fund to build it. He made little progress \u2014 the Texas Tribune said his effort had slowed after raising a little over $1 million, and then Mellon chipped in $53 million. The private and public effort was quietly dropped earlier this year, as the GOP-led legislature defunded construction in June, and the crowdfunding link disappeared in late May, the Tribune reported. The state built about 65 miles of wall out of the 805 miles that Abbott planned, and it's riddled with gaps because many landowners do not want the border wall on their land.",
      "Editor's note: An earlier version of this article said that Mellon contributed $13 million to the Sentinel Action Fund, a super PAC affiliated with the conservative Heritage Foundation, which produced\u00a0Project 2025.

      "The four vessels were hit in three different strikes, Hegseth said. The strikes bring the total death toll in President Trump's campaign against alleged traffickers in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific to more than 50.",
      "\"The four vessels were known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics,\" Hegseth wrote. \"Eight male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessels during the first strike. Four male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the second strike. Three male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the third strike. A total of 14 narco-terrorists were killed during the three strikes, with one survivor. All strikes were in international waters with no U.S. forces harmed.\"",
      "He added: \"These narco-terrorists have killed more Americans than Al-Qaeda, and they will be treated the same. We will track them, we will network them, and then, we will hunt and kill them.\"",
      "Hegseth said U.S. military personnel immediately began search and rescue operations for the survivor, and Mexican authorities assumed responsibility for coordinating the rescue. It's not clear what happened to the survivor from there.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum confirmed at a Tuesday morning news conference that the strike was in international waters and the Mexican Navy rescued one person.",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Oct 2025 19:05:22 -0400",
    "summary": "The Senate passed a measure that would block President Trump's tariffs on Brazil, after Democrats drew support from a handful of Republicans.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted on Tuesday to approve a resolution that would block President Trump's tariffs on Brazil, with five Republicans joining Democrats to back the measure in a rebuke to the president.",
      "Led by Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, the resolution would terminate the national emergency that the administration is using to impose 50% tariffs on goods from Brazil.",
      "The vote to approve the measure was 52 to 48. Republican Sens. Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Thom Tillis, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul joined Democrats to vote in favor. The resolution required a simple majority and was not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed for most legislation.",
      "In July, Mr. Trump declared a national emergency with respect to \"recent policies, practices, and actions of the Government of Brazil\" that he said constitute an \"unusual and extraordinary threat.\" The move came during the trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who was ultimately convicted and sentenced to 27 years in prison for attempting a coup in 2022.",
      "\"President Trump's tariff regime \u2014 global, Brazilian tariffs, Canadian tariffs, tariff deals announced then paused, tariff deals negotiated, exceptions granted and in some cases not granted \u2014 have created huge chaos in the national economy,\" Kaine said in a speech on the Senate floor before the vote. \"Tariffs are a tax on American consumers. Tariffs are a tax on American businesses. And they are a tax that is imposed by a single person: Donald J. Trump.\"",
      "Kaine told reporters that the president's emergency order was \"unusual and extreme,\" and accused him of putting it in place due to the \"decision to prosecute Donald Trump's friend.\"",
      "\"If that's an emergency, then anything is an emergency, and any president can make up anything and call it an emergency and then use massive powers to impose regulations or evade regulations,\" Kaine said.",
      "The bill will still need to pass the House and be signed by the president, meaning it is mostly symbolic. House Republican leaders have taken steps to prevent lawmakers from forcing a vote on the president's tariffs in the lower chamber.",
      "But Kaine said Tuesday that he has learned that \"the president is responsive to things like this.\"",
      "\"When he sees Republicans starting to vote against his policies, even in small numbers, that makes an impression on him and can often cause him to alter his behavior,\" he said.",
      "One of those Republican yes votes was McConnell, a former Senate majority leader who has clashed with Mr. Trump for years \u2014 including on trade policy. McConnell has long been skeptical of tariffs and supportive of free trade, a stance that was essentially considered doctrine in pre-Trump GOP politics.",
      "\"Tariffs make both building and buying in America more expensive,\" McConnell said in a statement prior to the vote. \"The economic harms of trade wars are not the exception to history, but the rule.\"",
      "Earlier in the day, Vice President JD Vance met with Senate Republicans at the Capitol and urged them to reject the resolution.",
      "\"The point that I made to my Republican colleagues, recognizing that there's a diversity of opinions about it, is that the tariffs give us the ability to put American workers first,\" Vance told reporters after the meeting. \"They force American industry to reinvest in the United States of America, instead of a foreign country. They're also incredible leverage for the president of the United States in negotiating these trade deals overseas.\"",
      "The president cited a law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act in his order imposing the Brazil tariffs. The act gives any senator the authority to force a vote to challenge the move, effectively bypassing Senate leadership.",
      "In April, four Republicans joined Democrats to approve a measure aimed at blocking the Canada tariffs. Those Republicans were Murkowski of Alaska, Collins of Maine and McConnell, along with Paul of Kentucky, a Republican who cosponsored the legislation. Later that month, an effort aimed at blocking Mr. Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on countries around the world fell short, with two senators who had previously backed the tariff measure absent from the vote. The resolutions need a simple majority to pass.",
      "Kaine said he would force additional votes on Canadian tariffs and global tariffs throughout the week as he pushes back on the administration and puts pressure on Senate Republicans.",
      "\"So the votes are about tariffs, and they're about the economic destruction of tariffs, but they are also really about, how much will we let a president get away with?\" Kaine said. \"Do my colleagues have a gag reflex or not, in terms of powers that constitutionally are handed to Congress?\"",

    "summary": "The GOP majority report criticized Biden's autopen use, but did not offer clear evidence that aides conspired to enact policies without his knowledge.",
    "story": [
      "House Republicans on Tuesday unveiled their long-promised report on former President Joe Biden's use of the autopen, delivering a blistering critique of his time in office and inner circle. The report largely rehashes information that was already public, however, while making sweeping accusations about the workings of his White House.",
      "The GOP report does not include any concrete evidence that aides conspired to enact policies without Biden's knowledge or that the president was unaware of laws, pardons or executive orders signed in his name. But Republicans said their findings cast doubt on all of Biden's actions in office. They sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi urging a full investigation. President Trump ordered a similar inquiry earlier this year.",
      "At its core, the report advances contested claims that Biden's mental state declined to a degree that allowed White House officials to enact policies without his knowledge. It focuses heavily on the pardons he granted\u00a0while in office, including to his son, Hunter Biden, based on depositions with close Biden aides.",
      "\"The cost of the scheme to hide the fallout of President Biden's diminished physical and mental acuity was great but will likely never be fully calculated,\" the report reads. \"The cover-up put American national security at risk and the nation's trust in its leaders in jeopardy.\"",
      "Biden has strenuously denied he was unaware of his administration's actions, calling such claims \"ridiculous and false.\" Democrats on the House Oversight Committee denounced the probe as a distraction and waste of time, issuing a 13-page memo on Tuesday that said \"following more than a year of inquiry, extensive witness interviews, and significant time and effort expended by both Republican and Democratic staff, the Oversight Majority has failed to produce any evidence to support their allegations against President Biden.\"",
      "Democrats said in the memo that 14 former White House officials and aides provided nearly 60 hours of testimony.",
      "In a statement, a Biden spokesperson said it was an investigation into \"baseless claims\" that proved \"there was no conspiracy, no cover-up, and no wrongdoing.\"",
      "Republicans are shifting attention back to Biden at a politically tumultuous time, 10 months into Mr. Trump's presidency, with the government shut down and Congress at a standstill over legislation to fund it. House Speaker Mike Johnson has kept the House out of session for nearly a month, with most public-facing committee work grinding to a halt.",
      "Mr. Trump and his staff have zeroed in on Biden's autopen usage, with the White House in September putting a picture of an autopen along portraits of previous presidents the West Wing Colonnade. A White House official said at the time that Mr. Trump selected the autopen picture himself.",
      "The report on Biden was largely compiled over several months before the shutdown began. Based on interviews with more than a dozen members of Biden's inner circle, the report offers few new revelations, instead drawing broad conclusions from unanswered questions.",
      "It includes repeated references to polls of Biden's approval rating and perceptions of his public gaffes and apparent aging, much of it publicly known.",
      "It alleges a \"cover-up of the president's cognitive decline\" orchestrated by Biden's inner circle and takes particular aim at Biden's doctor, Kevin O'Connor, who invoked his Fifth Amendment right against testifying. Republicans also singled out senior aides Anthony Bernal and Annie Tomasini, who similarly pleaded the Fifth. All three \"should face further scrutiny\" from the Justice Department, Republicans said.",
      "Jonathan Su, Tomasini's attorney, said during her interview with the committee, \"There is no actual evidence of wrongdoing by Ms. Tomasini.\" Noting the ongoing criminal investigation by the Justice Department, he said \"any reasonable person would seriously consider an invocation of their Fifth Amendment rights\u2026The law is clear that there is absolutely no basis to suggest an invocation of the Fifth Amendment is evidence of wrongdoing.\" Su, who also represents Bernal, similarly told the committee on his behalf that \"it is entirely appropriate and justified for Mr. Bernal to invoke his rights under the Fifth Amendment.\"",
      "Republicans also sent a letter to the D.C. Board of Medicine urging that O'Connor face \"discipline, sanction or revocation of his medical license\" and \"be barred from the practice of medicine in the District of Columbia.\"",
      "O'Connor's attorneys, David Schertler and Mark MacDougall, said in July that he would decline to answer lawmakers' questions based on doctor-patient privilege and his rights under the Fifth Amendment, and they said that asserting Fifth Amendment privilege \"does not imply that Dr. O'Connor has committed any crime.\"",
      "The report does not include full transcripts of the multiple hours of recorded testimony that witnesses delivered before the committee. It repeatedly scolds Biden officials and Democratic allies for defending Biden's mental state.",
      "\"The inner-most circle, or cocoon, of the White House senior staff organized one of the largest scandals in American history \u2014 hiding a cognitively failing president and refusing any means of confirmation of such demise,\" the report says.",
      "While the report claims that record-keeping policies in the Biden White House \"were so lax that the chain of custody for a given decision is difficult or impossible to establish,\" Republicans do not offer any concrete instances of the chain of command being violated or a policy being enacted without Biden's knowledge.",
      "Still, Republicans argue that laws or other legal documents bearing an autopen version of Biden's signature\u00a0 should be considered invalid unless there is documented proof of him approving a decision.",
      "\"Barring evidence of executive actions taken during the Biden presidency showing that President Biden indeed took a particular executive action, the committee deems those actions taken through use of the autopen as void,\" the report says.",
      "Democrats and legal experts have warned that broad scrutiny of executive actions could pose future legal headaches for the Trump administration and congressional Republicans, who also often enact policies directed by lawmakers through devices like the presidential autopen.",

    "summary": "Staff Sgt. Demi Palecek and Capt. Dylan Blaha say they'll defy federal orders regarding Trump's immigration enforcement operation in Chicago.",
    "story": [
      "Chicago \u2014 Two Illinois National Guard members told CBS News they would refuse to obey federal orders to deploy in Chicago as part of President Trump's controversial immigration enforcement mission \u2014 a rare act of open defiance from within the military ranks.",
      "\"It's disheartening to be forced to go against your community members and your neighbors,\" said Staff Sgt. Demi Palecek, a Latina guardswoman and state legislative candidate from Illinois's 13th District. \"It feels illegal. This is not what we signed up to do.\"",
      "Both Palecek and Capt. Dylan Blaha, who is running for Congress in the same district, described growing unease among Guard members after the White House federalized 500 troops \u2013 including members of the Illinois and Texas National Guard \u2013 to secure federal immigration facilities and personnel in the Chicago area.",
      "\"I signed up to defend the American people and protect the Constitution,\" Blaha said. \"When we have somebody in power who's actively dismantling our rights \u2014 free speech, due process, freedom of the press \u2014 it's really hard to be a soldier right now.\"",
      "Refusing a lawful federal order while serving in the National Guard can sometimes result in court-martial, imprisonment, or a felony-level discharge, depending on who issued the order, whether the soldier is under state or federal control and the nature of the disobedience. When contacted by CBS News, the Defense Department declined comment.",
      "Palecek says members of military are \"being used as pawns\"",
      "Asked if she would refuse a direct order to deploy to Chicago, Palecek didn't hesitate. \"Absolutely. I would definitely say no,\" she said. \"I'm not going to go against my community members, my family and my culture. I believe this is the time to be on the right side of history.\"",
      "\"Look at 1930s, 1940s Germany,\" Blaha said. \"There is a point where if you didn't stand up to the Gestapo, are you just actively one of them now?\"",
      "A federal judge on Wednesday delayed the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago indefinitely, until a final ruling is issued or the Supreme Court rules on the matter.",
      "The two guardsmen accused the Trump administration of weaponizing the military against civilians under the guise of public safety. \"They're definitely being used as pawns,\" Palecek said.",
      "Blaha agreed, saying most Guard units \"train to fight and win our nation's wars,\" and they do not assist law enforcement or Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \"We're not trained to assist ICE and help them just be violent in our communities,\" he said, calling it \"shameful.\"",
      "The pair noted that Guard members currently mobilized in Illinois are on 29-day orders \u2014 too short to qualify for full benefits. \"They're not even getting paid right now because of the government shutdown,\" Blaha added. \"Most don't want to be there. They're scared, too.\"",
      "Lt. Col. Brad Leighton, a spokesperson for the Illinois National Guard later clarified that \"the approximately 300 Illinois Army National Guard Soldiers who were federalized in Illinois are on initial 60-day orders,\" allowing those service members to be eligible for health coverage as well as additional allowances to offset the cost of meals and housing.",
      "Fears for immigrant service members",
      "Roughly 200 green card holders serve in the Illinois National Guard \u2013 with 160 legal permanent residents in the state's Army National Guard and 30 in the state's Air National Guard.",
      "\"They're in sheer panic,\" Palecek said. \"They're choosing between standing up for their community or losing everything \u2014 their legal status, their path to citizenship.\"",
      "U.S. federal law generally prohibits undocumented immigrants from enlisting in the U.S. Armed Forces, including the Army National Guard and Air National Guard. But for green card holders, military service can help expedite U.S. citizenship under longstanding federal programs.",
      "Programs like Parole in Place exist to protect family members of service members from deportation and help them adjust status, but participants say applications have been slowed or outright denied in recent months, leaving families in legal limbo.",
      "\"I applied for parole in place,\" Palecek told CBS News. \"And [my application] has not been able to go through.\"",
      "\"Everyone says, 'Why don't they do it the right way?'\" Palecek continued, offering a sentiment often voiced by those condemning illegal immigration. \"But they are doing it the right way,\" Palecek said.",
      "Retribution in their ranks",
      "Both Blaha and Palecek said they've faced retaliation for speaking publicly. Blaha disclosed that his security clearance was suspended by the Defense Department after posting a viral video urging soldiers to disobey unlawful orders. \"They twisted my words,\" he said. \"I have about 30 days in order to provide them with a written response.\"",
      "Retribution, Palecek added, is \"real.\" She's received death threats since denouncing the deployments and launching her political campaign. \"It weighs on you mentally after a while,\" she said.",
      "Still, both say silence is not an option. \"We were trained to stand up for what we believe in and stand up for the American people,\" Blaha said.",
      "\"Today it's Chicago. Tomorrow it could be somewhere else.\"",
      "Palecek, who once served in active duty, said the current mission has made her ashamed of her uniform. \"I've been truly proud of what I've been able to do in the military,\" she said. \"And right now I hate saying I'm in the military. It's embarrassing.\"",
      "Both see a dangerous precedent in deploying federal troops to U.S. cities. \"It's a slow normalization of using the military in American cities,\" Blaha said. \"If he declares martial law enough times, people will start to think it's OK.\"",
      "A majority of Americans oppose Mr. Trump's deployment of the National Guard to U.S. cities as part of his crime crackdown, according to a September CBS News poll. But still, roughly 42% of Americans polled expressed support for sending members of the National Guard to cities nationwide.",
      "A CBS News analysis of FBI and Chicago Police Department data from 2024 found Chicago's violent crime is down double-digit percentage points so far in 2025 compared to 2024. Among American cities with populations of 100,000 or more, Chicago ranks 80th overall for violent crime per capita.",
      "When asked to describe what America looks like with a federalized National Guard presence nationwide, Blaha replied: \"Unsafe.\" Palecek offered: \"Disgusting.\"",
      "\"They're coming after communities that have built this country,\" Palecek added. \"To be used against my culture, my community, my neighbors \u2014 that's vile and disgusting to me.\"",
      "The two soldiers say they're speaking out to warn the rest of the country. \"Today it's Chicago. Tomorrow it could be somewhere else,\" Blaha said. \"We need to combat the misinformation and stand up to Donald Trump. Crime is down. This is not about safety \u2014 it's about control.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump told reporters as he flew into Japan that he expects to have a trade agreement with China finalized by the end of his tour of Asia.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump arrived Monday in Japan, where new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is banking on building a friendly personal relationship with the U.S. leader to ease trade tensions.",
      "Mr. Trump's Asian tour, which kicked off over the weekend, has a heavy focus on business ties, and speaking to journalists as he flew into the Japanese capital, he predicted that a U.S.-China trade agreement would be done before he returned to Washington.",
      "But first, the meeting with Takaichi will be an early diplomatic test for Japan's first woman leader. She took office only last week, and has a tenuous coalition backing her.",
      "During the flight to Tokyo, Mr. Trump came back to the press cabin on Air Force One, along with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. He said he'd talk about the \"great friendship\" between the U.S. and Japan during his visit.",
      "\"I hear phenomenal things\" about Takaichi, Mr. Trump said, noting her closeness with the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, with whom Mr. Trump had a good relationship during his first term.",
      "\"It's going to be very good,\" he said. \"That really helps Japan and the United States.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's only scheduled event on Monday following his arrival was a meeting at the Imperial Palace with Emperor Naruhito, Japan's ceremonial head of state. The emperor smiled and waved as Mr. Trump's limousine pulled up to the palace.",
      "They shook hands and exchanged pleasantries before smiling for a photo together, then walked inside the palace for a roughly half-hour meeting that the White House described as a \"courtesy call.\"",
      "The American leader spent Sunday in Malaysia, participating in a regional summit of Southeast Asian nations where he struck preliminary trade agreements with Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.",
      "Trump says he expects trade deal with China done this week",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he expected to reach a trade agreement with China in the coming days.",
      "Officials from the world's two largest economies said Sunday that they'd reached an initial consensus for Mr. Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping to try to finalize during a high-stakes meeting later in the week.",
      "\"I have a lot of respect for President Xi,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One. \"I think we're going to come away with a deal,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Bessent also\u00a0said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that a TikTok deal announced last month was set to be finalized Thursday during the Trump-Xi meeting.",
      "After his visit to Japan, Mr. Trump is set to end his Asian tour in South Korea, where he's expected to meet with Xi on the sidelines of a Pacific Rim summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.",
      "Trump renews openness to meeting North Korea's Kim Jong Un",
      "Mr. Trump also said he would be willing to extend his trip to Asia if there was a chance to talk with reclusive North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Since South Korea is the president's last stop before returning to the U.S., \"it's pretty easy to do,\" he told reporters on Air Force One.",
      "Mr. Trump's overtures to reconnect with Kim have gone unanswered.",
      "\"If he wants to meet, I'll be in South Korea,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Trump rules out running for U.S. vice presidency",
      "On other matters, Mr. Trump rejected the possibility of running for vice president as a way to get back to the presidency, saying, \"I'd be allowed to do it,\" but \"I wouldn't do that.\"",
      "\"I think it's too cute. Yeah, I would rule that out because it's too cute,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think the people wouldn't like that. It's too cute. It's not \u2014 it wouldn't be right.\"",
      "Steve Bannon, a Trump ally, has repeatedly said the president could serve a third term despite a constitutional prohibition. Mr. Trump himself has flirted with the idea.",
      "On Air Force One, Mr. Trump said, \"I haven't really thought about it.\"",
      "He praised Rubio and Vice President JD Vance as potential future Republican candidates. \"I'm not sure if anybody would run against those two. I think if they ever formed a group, it would be unstoppable,\" he said.",
      "South China Sea, Taiwan, and tariffs",
      "There's no shortage of security issues in the region, including access to the South China Sea and the future of Taiwan. But Mr. Trump's focus has undoubtedly been trade and his desire to realign the international economy in his vision of \"America first.\"",
      "For the most part, that means tariffs, or at least the threat of them. Mr. Trump has frequently used taxes on imports \u2014 from allies and adversaries alike \u2014   in an effort to boost domestic manufacturing or seek more favorable terms.",
      "However, his unilateral power to enact tariffs remains contested. The president is awaiting a Supreme Court decision in a case that could solidify his authority or limit it.",
      "The president flew to Tokyo from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where he attended the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. He participated in a ceremonial signing of an expanded ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia\u00a0earlier this year. Mr. Trump exerted pressure on both countries by threatening to withhold trade agreements.",

    "summary": "President Trump's lawyers filed their long-promised appeal of the Manhattan \"hush money\" criminal case that led to his felony conviction.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's lawyers on Monday filed their long-promised appeal of the Manhattan \"hush money\" criminal case that led to his felony conviction.",
      "The president's attorneys echoed arguments that Mr. Trump and his trial counsel made repeatedly throughout the proceedings in the spring of 2024. They said the case should not have been brought, the judge should have recused himself because he had previously made small donations to Democratic causes. They also argued the conviction should be discarded due to the Supreme Court's July 2024 ruling on presidential immunity. That decision was tied to another of Mr. Trump's criminal cases, but his lawyers said it has a bearing on Mr. Trump's conviction in the New York case. Many of these same arguments were rejected during the criminal trial in Manhattan.",
      "\"This case should have never seen the inside of a courtroom, let alone resulted in a jury conviction,\" the lawyers, led by Robert Giuffra Jr., wrote in the 96-page filing.",
      "The appeal is part of a multi-pronged effort by Mr. Trump to attempt to overturn the conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. He has also asked a federal appeals court to transfer his state case to federal court.",
      "The case revolved around Mr. Trump's efforts to cover up so-called \"hush money\" payments to the adult film star Stormy Daniels. Prosecutors for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg argued during the trial that Mr. Trump, through his then-lawyer Michael Cohen, paid Daniels $130,000 in the waning days of the 2016 presidential election to suppress her story of an alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. The jury concluded that Mr. Trump authorized an effort to falsify records related to reimbursements to Mr. Cohen for that payment.",
      "The trial played out over seven weeks last spring, in effect relegating Mr. Trump's third presidential campaign to hallway gaggles outside the courtroom. As Mr. Trump himself did regularly before, during and after the trial, his lawyers accused Bragg on Monday of bringing the case for political gain.",
      "\"The DA, a Democrat, brought those charges in the middle of a contentious presidential election in which President Trump was the leading Republican candidate. These charges against President Trump were as unprecedented as their political context,\" Mr. Trump's attorneys wrote.",
      "Bragg's office declined to comment on Mr. Trump's filing.",
      "Days before his return to the White House in January, Mr. Trump received a no-jail sentence. His felony criminal conviction, however, remains on the books unless the jury's verdict is overturned.",
      "Mr. Trump's lead attorney during the trial, Todd Blanche, is now the deputy U.S. attorney general. Another lawyer from his trial team, Emil Bove III, was nominated by Mr. Trump and confirmed as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.",
      "A spokesperson for Mr. Trump's legal team called the appeal a \"powerhouse.\"",

    "summary": "Tylenol maker Kenvue said Texas' claims \"lack legal merit and scientific support\" and vowed to defend itself in litigation.",
    "story": [
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a lawsuit against Kenvue and Johnson & Johnson, claiming the use of Tylenol leads to higher risk of autism and that the over-the-counter drug is deceptively marketed to pregnant women as safe.",
      "Many medical experts have disputed such claims.",
      "The lawsuit, dated Monday, alleges Johnson & Johnson and Tylenol maker Kenvue, which separated from Johnson & Johnson in 2023, knew for decades \"that acetaminophen \u2014 Tylenol's active ingredient \u2014 is dangerous to unborn children and young children. Yet they hid this danger and deceptively marketed Tylenol as the only safe painkiller for pregnant women.\"",
      "In the lawsuit, Paxton pointed to the Trump administration's claims about acetaminophen's risks, saying that: \"the federal government confirmed what Defendants knew for years: acetaminophen use during pregnancy likely causes conditions like [autism] and [attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder].\"",
      "Paxton also accused Johnson & Johnson of transferring its liabilities arising from Tylenol to Kenvue in order to shield its assets from potential lawsuits related to Tylenol and its alleged \"harmful impact\" on children.",
      "Kenvue said in a statement that Texas' claims \"lack legal merit and scientific support\" and vowed to defend itself in litigation. It maintained that acetaminophen \"is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy.\"",
      "\"We are deeply concerned by the perpetuation of misinformation on the safety of acetaminophen and the potential impact that could have on the health of American women and children,\" Kenvue said.",
      "Kenvue also warned that failing to treat fevers and other ailments with acetaminophen could also expose pregnant women to health risks.",
      "\"Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives,\" Kenvue's statement continued. \"High fevers and pain are widely recognized as potential risks to a pregnancy if left untreated.\"",
      "A Johnson & Johnson spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News: \"Johnson & Johnson divested its consumer health business years ago, and all rights and liabilities associated with the sale of its over-the-counter products, including Tylenol (acetaminophen), are owned by Kenvue.\"",
      "In September, President Trump, standing alongside Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.\u00a0 Kennedy Jr.,\u00a0announced\u00a0the FDA would immediately notify physicians \"that the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy can be associated with a very increased risk of autism.\"",
      "Kennedy said the FDA based its decision on studies that \"suggest a potential association between acetaminophen used during pregnancy and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes,\" including\u00a0one study\u00a0in the public health journal Environmental Health. He added that \"NIH [National Institutes of Health] research teams are currently testing multiple hypotheses.\"",
      "After the Trump administration issued its warning about Tylenol, many top medical experts in the field\u00a0stressed\u00a0that scientific evidence does not support such concerns. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement provided to CBS News that \"there is no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and fetal developmental issues.\"",

    "summary": "Trump meets Japan's new, first female prime minister, and they sign a bilateral trade deal before going together to greet troops on the USS George Washington.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump signed a trade agreement with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Tuesday, as he focuses on cementing deals with key U.S. trading partners during his nearly weeklong trip through Asia.",
      "The deal \u2014 which the two countries agreed to over the summer \u2014 will see\u00a0the U.S. charge\u00a015% tariffs on imported Japanese goods, lower than the 25% initially threatened by Mr. Trump. In exchange, Japan has pledged to invest $550 billion in U.S. industry and open its market to American rice, cars and defense equipment. It's not yet clear exactly where those invested dollars would go.",
      "Mr. Trump and Takaichi, who became Japan's first ever female prime minister just last week, also signed a framework that calls for the U.S. and Japan to cooperate on supplying critical minerals and rare earth metals to each other. Mr. Trump has sought mineral deals with countries including Australia\u00a0and\u00a0Ukraine in recent months, as China imposes new restrictions on its exports of rare earths, which are essential for computer chips, aerospace and other technology, as part of a tit-for-tat trade war with Washington.",
      "During brief remarks to the press before a signing ceremony on Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump touted the trade deal as \"very fair.\"",
      "\"We're going to do tremendous trade together, I think more than ever before,\" he said, calling Japan an \"ally at the strongest level.\"",
      "Japan is the United States' fifth-largest trading partner, according to\u00a0federal statistics. Japan bought $79.7 billion worth of American goods last year, and the U.S. imported $148.2 billion worth of Japanese goods.",
      "More than one-third of U.S. imports from Japan last year \u2014 or $52.3 billion \u2014 were cars and car parts, powered by Japan's massive auto industry, according to\u00a0federal data.",
      "The American and Japanese leaders, whose countries share a rivalry with China, also spoke about defense cooperation, with Mr. Trump thanking Japan for its weapons orders from the U.S.",
      "During their meeting, which was held at Tokyo's Akasaka Palace guest house, Takaichi called the bilateral relationship the \"greatest alliance in the world\" and said she would like to work with the U.S. toward a \"shared goal of achieving a free and open Indo-Pacific.\"",
      "It was the first meeting for Mr. Trump with Takaichi, a staunch conservative who took office last week. She was close with the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a friend of Mr. Trump's up until his assassination in 2022.",
      "\"He was a great friend of mine and a great friend of yours,\" the U.S. president said as he shook Takaichi's hand on Tuesday. Their meeting came within hours of a court hearing in Tokyo during which Abe's assassin pleaded guilty to murdering the former premier with a homemade gun.",
      "In a moment of levity, Takaichi apologized to reporters for a late start to the meeting, saying she was watching game three of the World Series. The Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star, Shohei Ohtani, is a native of Japan and has a large following in his home country. After an exciting, 18-inning contest, Los Angeles pulled ahead for a 6-5 victory.",
      "Trump, Takaichi visit troops on the USS George Washington",
      "Later Tuesday, Mr. Trump touched down by helicopter with Takaichi aboard the USS George Washington aircraft carrier at the Yokosuka Naval Base, south of Tokyo, and they saluted service members before the prime minister and president delivered remarks to the troops.",
      "Mr. Trump was heard praising Takaichi, predicting that she would \"go down as one of the great prime ministers.\"",
      "The Japanese leader was first to step to a lectern on the massive ship to speak to the gathered troops, of whom the White House said there were around 6,000.",
      "She thanked the U.S. forces in Japan for their dedication to peace in the region, and mentioned that six years ago in the same city, Mr. Trump and her predecessor, the late Abe, together and \"demonstrated resolve that Japan and the United States will join hands to ensure peace and security.\"",
      "She said she had a renewed determination to \"carry forward that result\" and make the Indo-Pacific free and open.",
      "\"Now we are facing an unprecedented security environment,\" said Takaichi. \"Peace cannot be preserved\" by conflict alone, she added. \"It can be protected only when there is an unwavering determination and action.\"",
      "When Mr. Trump took the podium, he heaped praise on the U.S. forces gathered before him, as well as the strength of the U.S. military. As the U.S. federal government shutdown neared the one-month mark, Mr. Trump said all the troops present would receive full pay for their deployment despite having to come back to port to attend his visit.",
      "He brought up immigration and the controversial deployment of U.S. National Guard forces to American cities, saying: \"We need safe cities \u2014 whether people like it or not, it's what we're doing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also mentioned the U.S.\u00a0strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean, saying each boat had enough drugs to kill 25,000 people and asserting that the attacks had \"stopped almost completely the drugs coming in by sea, and now we'll stop the drugs coming in by land.\"",
      "Following his appearance on the ship, President Trump was to fly back to Tokyo to attend a business leadership reception on Tuesday evening.",
      "On Monday, the president met with Japanese Emperor Naruhito at Tokyo's imperial palace.",
      "Trump to visit South Korea next \u2014 and meet with China's Xi Jinping",
      "South Korea is the next and final stop on the president's trip, which started over the weekend in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia \u2014 a visit marked by trade frameworks between the U.S. and Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "On the South Korean front, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters he doesn't expect to finalize a trade deal with the country when the U.S. president visits on Wednesday, but said he thinks they're close. Mr. Trump and the South Korean government announced a framework over the summer that was similar to the Japan deal, with 15% tariffs on South Korean goods and investments pledged in the U.S.",
      "The multi-stop Asia trip will culminate with a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday at a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, as they look to put an end to the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China.",
      "On his way to Tokyo, Mr. Trump predicted the U.S. and China would complete a trade agreement before he returns to Washington later in the week. The two sides have had a rocky relationship in recent months. The president threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China \u2014 for a total rate of 140% \u2014 starting Saturday, Nov. 1, lashing out against new export restrictions imposed by Beijing.",

    "summary": "A Utah judge has ruled that the 22-year-old man charged with killing Charlie Kirk can appear in court wearing street clothes but must be physically restrained due to security concerns.",
    "story": [
      "A judge ruled Monday that the 22-year-old Utah man charged in the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk will be allowed to wear regular clothes at all pretrial hearings but must be physically restrained due to security concerns.",
      "Attorneys for Tyler Robinson argued that images of him shackled and in jail clothing would spread widely in a case with extensive press coverage and public interest, which they said could prejudice future potential jurors.",
      "Judge Tony Graf approved limited measures to protect Robinson's presumption of innocence before a trial, agreeing that the case has drawn \"extraordinary\" public and media attention.",
      "\"Mr. Robinson shall be dressed as one who is presumed innocent,\" Graf said during a virtual court hearing on Monday.",
      "Kirk, who was 31, was assassinated on Sept. 10 at Utah Valley University in Orem as he addressed a large crowd at an outdoor debate.",
      "Robinson was charged last month with aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, two counts of obstruction of justice, two counts of witness tampering and committing a violent offense in the presence of a child. Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray has said they will plan to seek the death penalty.",
      "While Robinson has no prior criminal history, Judge Graf said Monday that the charges he faces are extremely serious and present safety concerns in the courtroom. It's the court's highest priority to protect the attorneys, court staff and Robinson himself during what could be emotional hearings, Graf said before denying Robinson's request to appear without restraints. He did, however, prohibit members of the media from photographing or filming Robinson's restraints.",
      "Robinson was arrested on Sept. 12 when he showed up with his parents to turn himself in at his hometown sheriff's office in southwest Utah, more than a three-hour drive from Orem. He is being held at the Utah County Jail without bail and hasn't yet entered a plea.",
      "As law enforcement agencies were scouring the state for the shooter last month, Washington County Sheriff Nate Brooksby said he received a phone call from a retired deputy saying he knew who killed Kirk.",
      "\"He said, 'Hey, I know who Charlie Kirk's shooter is. I know the family through religious association and he's in Washington County now, and we're working on trying to get him to come in voluntarily,'\" Brooksby said at the time.",
      "\"He didn't want a big SWAT team hitting his parents' house or his apartment. He was truly fearful of being shot by law enforcement,\" Brooksby said. \"So the conditions were as relaxed and comfortable and almost to the point of inviting. And if at the end of the day we accomplish him surrendering peacefully on his own, I'm going to make some concessions to make that happen.\"",
      "Two federal law enforcement sources previously confirmed to CBS News that\u00a0Robinson's father saw the photos\u00a0released by authorities and confronted his son. Robinson admitted to being the person in the photos and said he would rather die by suicide than turn himself in, prompting his father to call a youth pastor close to the family, the sources said.",
      "Authorities said Robinson had allegedly\u00a0confessed to the killing in text exchanges with his roommate. A spokesperson for Discord\u00a0also previously confirmed\u00a0to CBS News that Robinson appeared to admit to committing the shooting in messages he had posted to the social media platform.",
      "Judge Graf ordered Robinson to appear on Jan. 16 and Jan. 30, 2026, for his first in-person public hearings. He appeared Monday from jail on a blacked-out screen and spoke only to confirm he was present.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is staging a major shake-up at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with plans to reassign senior leaders in agency offices across the country amid frustrations over current arrest and deportation levels, two sources familiar with the changes told CBS News on Monday.",
      "One U.S. official, who requested anonymity to talk about internal matters, said as many as roughly a dozen local ICE leaders could be reassigned, with some expected to be replaced by current or former officials at Customs and Border Protection, its sister Department of Homeland Security agency. Some of those ICE officials have already been informed of their reassignments, the official added.",
      "The planned shake-up at ICE would be a major leadership overhaul, affecting roughly half of the agency's 25 field offices.",
      "In most cases, the field office directors won't be demoted or fired, said two U.S. officials, who described the plan as a way to give certain ICE offices additional support.",
      "The Trump administration has increasingly turned to CBP and Border Patrol officials like Commander Gregory Bovino to expand its government-wide crackdown on illegal immigration, deploying them to apprehend unauthorized immigrants far away from the U.S.-Mexico border, in Democratic-led cities like Chicago and Los Angeles.",
      "Operations by green-uniformed Border Patrol agents in those cities \u2014 including arrests at Home Depot parking lots and worksites like car washes \u2014 have triggered significant local backlash, with critics accusing the agents of being heavy-handed and arresting immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally but without criminal records.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, \"While we have no personnel changes to announce at this time, the Trump Administration remains laser focused on delivering results and removing violent criminal illegal aliens from this country.\"",
      "Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said, \"The President's entire team is working in lockstep to implement the President's policy agenda, and the tremendous results from securing the border to deporting criminal illegal aliens speak for themselves.\"",
      "The Washington Examiner reported on the reassignments earlier Monday.",
      "Internally, U.S. officials tell CBS News, some ICE leaders have been frustrated with Border Patrol's operations in cities \u2014 and the opposition they have garnered from local residents. While the Trump administration has made anyone in the U.S. illegally who is encountered by federal officials subject to arrest, ICE says its operations have continued to primarily target immigrants who have committed crimes in addition to being in the country unlawfully.",
      "\"We're arresting criminals, while they are going to Home Depots and car washes,\" one U.S. official told CBS News, referring to Border Patrol agents.",
      "Some inside the Trump administration, however, see Border Patrol officials as better equipped to carry out the aggressive and expansive operations needed to reach the ambitious arrest targets set by the White House.",
      "In the spring, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the architect of President Trump's mass deportation plans, suggested on Fox News that ICE should be carrying out \"a minimum\" of 3,000 arrests per day. ICE officials have not met that target. While they have peaked above 2,000 on some days, arrests by the agency typically hover over 1,000 each day.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/reproductive-health-trump-administration-hhs-cuts/",
    "published": "Mon, 27 Oct 2025 17:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "\"People don't realize how much these clinics hold together the local health system until they're gone,\" said the head of Maine Family Planning clinics.",
    "story": [
      "In late October, Maine Family Planning announced three rural clinics in northern Maine would close by month's end. These primary care and reproductive health clinics served about 800 patients, many uninsured or on Medicaid.",
      "\"People don't realize how much these clinics hold together the local health system until they're gone,\" George Hill, the group's president and CEO, told CBS News. \"For thousands of patients, that was their doctor, their lab, and their lifeline.\"",
      "Maine Family Planning's closures are among the first visible signs of what health leaders call the biggest setback to reproductive care in half a century. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Population Affairs, which administers the Title X Family Planning Program, has been effectively shut down. At the same time, Medicaid cuts, the potential lapse of Affordable Care Act subsidies, as well as cuts across programs in the Health Resources and Services Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are eroding the broader safety net.",
      "\"When you cut OPA, HRSA, and Medicaid together, you're removing every backup we have,\" said Clare Coleman, president of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association. \"It's like taking EMTs off the road while closing the emergency rooms.\"",
      "Asked about the cutbacks, HHS press secretary Emily G. Hilliard told CBS News, \"HHS will continue to carry out all of OPA's statutory functions.\"",
      "How the safety net frays",
      "For more than 50 years, Title X has underwritten a national network of over 4,000 clinics providing contraception, pregnancy testing, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, cancer screening, and other primary and preventive care to nearly 3 million low-income or uninsured patients annually. OPA managed roughly $400 million in grants, issued clinical guidance and ensured compliance.",
      "In mid-October, OPA's operations went dark amid federal layoffs that also affected hundreds of CDC staff. \"Under the Biden administration, HHS became a bloated bureaucracy \u2014 expanding its budget by 38 percent and its workforce by 17 percent,\" a spokesperson for the department said at the time, adding, \"HHS continues to eliminate wasteful and duplicative entities, including those inconsistent with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda.\"",
      "According to Jessica Marcella, who led OPA under the Biden administration, the office was previously staffed by 40 to 50 people. Now, she says, only one U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps officer remains.",
      "\"The structure to run the nation's family planning program disappeared overnight,\" said Liz Romer, OPA's former chief clinical adviser.",
      "\"This isn't just about government jobs,\" said Coleman. \"It's a patient care crisis. Every safety net program that touches reproductive health is being weakened.\"",
      "A policy linking health, autonomy and opportunity",
      "Created in 1970 under President Richard Nixon and rooted in President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, Title X was designed as a cornerstone of preventive public health, not a partisan cause. Nixon called family planning a \"national commitment to give every American the means to plan their families,\" and Congress agreed overwhelmingly across party lines.",
      "Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law at George Washington University, said the program reflected a pivotal shift in how policymakers understood health itself.",
      "\"By the late 1960s, there was a deep appreciation that the ability to time and space pregnancies was absolutely essential to women's and children's health,\" she said. \"Title X represented the idea that reproductive care wasn't a privilege or a moral issue. It was basic health care.\"",
      "UCLA economist Martha Bailey later found that children born after the first federally-funded family-planning programs were 7% less likely to live in poverty, and had household incomes 3% higher, than those born before. Bailey's research, just published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, also showed that when low-income women can access free birth control, unintended pregnancies drop by 16% and abortions drop by 12% within two years.",
      "Those findings underscore what Rosenbaum calls \"one of the great public health achievements of the 20th century \u2014 a program that linked economic opportunity to health and autonomy.\"",
      "That bipartisan foundation and evidence-based mission, Rosenbaum said, make today's unraveling especially striking.",
      "\"What was once common sense, that access to family planning is essential to a functioning health system, has become politically fragile,\" she noted. \"Title X was built for continuity, but it's being undone by neglect.\"",
      "The hidden health risks behind unplanned pregnancies",
      "Family planning is central to maternal and infant health because it gives women the time to optimize medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease before pregnancy, and allows them to safely space out their births.",
      "\"Pregnancy is the ultimate stress test,\" said Dr. Andra James, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist who advised the CDC on its contraceptive guidelines. \"It increases the heart's workload by up to 50%. For people with heart disease, diabetes, or hypertension, that stress can be dangerous.\"",
      "Brianna Henderson, a Texas mother, learned this firsthand. Weeks after delivery, she developed peripartum cardiomyopathy, a form of heart failure that can occur during or after pregnancy. She survived. Her sister, who had the same undiagnosed condition, died three months after giving birth to her second child. Those kids are now 12 and 16, and they're growing up without a mom. Their dad and his mother look after the kids now.",
      "\"Contraception has been a life-saving option for me,\" Henderson said.",
      "James and other specialists warn that without CDC-informed guidance on contraceptive safety for complex conditions, clinicians and patients are left without clear, current standards.",
      "What history and the data predict happens next",
      "Title X clinics provide millions of STI tests each year and are often the only cancer screening sites for uninsured women. Cuts to Medicaid and ACA subsidies will make it even harder for people to afford preventive visits.",
      "\"If these clinics close, we'll see more infections, more unplanned pregnancies, and more maternal deaths, especially among Black, Indigenous, and rural communities,\" said Whitney Rice, an expert on reproductive health at Emory University.",
      "And the geographic gaps are large already. Power to Decide, a nonprofit reproductive rights group, counts more than 19 million women living in \"contraceptive deserts,\" where there's no reasonable access to publicly supported birth control.",
      "\"These are places where the nearest clinic might be 60 or 100 miles away,\" said Power to Decide interim co-CEO Rachel Fey. \"For many families, that distance might as well be impossible.\"",
      "The high price of short-term savings",
      "Each pregnancy averted through Title X saves about $15,000 in public spending on medical and social services, according to an analysis by Power to Decide. The analysis shows that every $1 invested in publicly funded family-planning programs saves roughly $7 in Medicaid costs.",
      "Cutting federal funding for reproductive health services \"isn't saving money. It's wasting it,\" said Brittni Frederiksen, a KFF health economist and former OPA scientist. \"We'll spend far more fixing the problems these cuts create.\"",
      "Supporters of cuts argue federal spending must be reduced and states should set their own priorities.",
      "Strain on the ground",
      "Affirm, Arizona's Title X grantee, oversees a network of more than 50 clinic sites serving tens of thousands of patients each year. The organization has begun drawing down its limited reserves to stay open.",
      "\"Some partners haven't been paid since summer,\" Affirm CEO Br\u00e9 Thomas said. \"We're delaying lab payments and cutting back appointments. The people hit hardest are rural, low-income, and uninsured.\"",
      "Thomas said the disruptions are already visible in patient access: reduced hours at partner clinics, longer wait times for birth control refills, and a halt to some preventive screenings.",
      "\"When a clinic can't process labs or stock Depo-Provera, people simply stop coming,\" she said. \"In rural areas, there is no backup plan.\"",
      "Megan Kavanaugh, a scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, underscored those limits.",
      "\"Federally Qualified Health Centers do not have the capacity to absorb the number of patients who will lose care,\" she said, referring to federally funded community-based clinics for underserved populations. \"Some people may find another clinic, but a large share simply won't, and we'll see that reflected in higher rates of unintended pregnancy, untreated infections, and later-stage disease.\"",
      "Hospitals are beginning to absorb the spillover.",
      "\"The safety net is shrinking, and hospitals can't absorb everyone,\" said Dr. Sonya Borrero, a reproductive health expert at the University of Pittsburgh and a former Chief Medical and Scientific Adviser at OPA. \"Wait times will get longer, and preventable problems will rise.\"",
      "Funding frozen, oversight halted",
      "With OPA offline, Title X dollars already awarded can be spent, but no new funds are moving.",
      "\"Most programs can hang on for a few months,\" Romer said. \"By spring, many won't have enough money to stay open.\"",
      "The halt also suspends compliance reviews and technical assistance tied to CDC-aligned guidelines.",
      "Marcella, the former OPA leader, warned of a \"backdoor dismantling.\"",
      "\"If there aren't people to administer the grants, then the administration can later argue the program isn't working and redirect the funds elsewhere,\" she said. \"This is a functional elimination, done quietly.\"",
      "Kavanaugh called the moment \"one more step toward dismantling the public health infrastructure that has supported people's reproductive health for decades.\"",
      "Without staff to move money and guidance, she said, \"that's how a system collapses.\"",
      "What can still be done",
      "According to the National Association of Community Health Centers, Federally Qualified Health Centers can still use HRSA money that was already approved, even during the government shutdown. But no new funding is being released, similar to the freeze on Title X funds. At the same time, HRSA has stopped first-quarter payments for its Title V Maternal and Child Health program, which limits how states can provide preventive care and services for children and young people with special health needs.",
      "Some states \u2014 California, New Mexico, Washington \u2014 are plugging holes with state dollars, and health systems are expanding telehealth, but most jurisdictions cannot replace federal support at scale.",
      "\"Private donors can't replace the federal government,\" Hill said. \"You can't crowdfund your way to a working health system.\"",
      "Congress could restore Title X and rebuild OPA's staffing, but without administrators in place, money can't reach clinics quickly. States have a short window to bridge care by stabilizing Medicaid coverage, shoring up community health centers, and protecting contraceptive access.",
      "\"This isn't a political debate,\" Romer said. \"It's women showing up for care and finding the doors locked.\"",

    "summary": "In an exclusive interview, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said that he will consider a presidential campaign after the 2026 midterm elections.",
    "story": [
      "Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has become one of President Trump's most high-profile adversaries, told \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" in an exclusive interview that he will consider whether to run for president after the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "In an interview taped Thursday in San Jose, Newsom was asked whether he would give \"serious thought\" to a White House bid once next year's midterm elections are over.",
      "\"Yeah, I'd be lying otherwise,\" Newsom replied. \"I'd just be lying. And I'm not \u2014 I can't do that.\"",
      "Newsom, whose term ends in January 2027 and is prevented from running again due to term limits, cautioned that any decision is years away.",
      "\"Fate will determine that,\" he said, when asked about whether he is moving closer to working out a reason for a national candidacy.",
      "Newsom, 58, has made trips to key battleground states,\u00a0including a visit this past July to South Carolina,\u00a0which as of now is slated to host the first Democratic primary in the 2028 presidential election, although that could change.",
      "During that trip, which featured multiple stops and was covered by \"CBS News Sunday Morning,\" Newsom met with state Democratic leaders and stopped by a coffee shop to rally activists and help employees serve espresso drinks.",
      "\"I happen to, and thank God, I'm in the right business,\" Newsom said in the interview, when asked about his evident enjoyment in meeting Democrats in South Carolina. \"I love people. I actually love people.\"",
      "Newsom said talk of him possibly running for president, after facing challenges throughout his life, including dyslexia, is a reminder to him that lives can go in surprising directions.",
      "\"I have no idea,\" Newsom said of whether he will decide to run. \"The idea that a guy who got 960 on his SAT, that still struggles to read scripts, that was always in the back of the classroom, the idea that you would even throw that out is, in and of itself, extraordinary. Who the hell knows? I'm looking forward to who presents themselves in 2028 and who meets that moment. And that's the question for the American people.\"",
      "Newsom said his focus now is\u00a0on passing Proposition 50, a California ballot measure\u00a0he has championed that would allow state Democrats to temporarily change the boundaries of U.S. House districts and make them more favorable to the party. Newsom has cast his effort, which will be decided in a special election next week, as a response to Mr. Trump's push for Republican-controlled states, like Texas, to change their congressional maps so the GOP has a better chance at holding on to its narrow House majority next year.",
      "\"I think it's about our democracy. It's about the future of this republic. I think it's about, you know, what the Founding Fathers lived and died for, this notion of the rule of law, and not the rule of Don,\" Newsom said.",
      "Tensions have run high ahead of the vote, with both parties seeing redistricting efforts as critical\u00a0 to achieving their goal of winning the U.S. House majority next year. Whichever party holds control of the House has subpoena and oversight powers over the Executive Branch.",
      "\"We've got hundreds and hundreds, ICE and Border Patrol,\" Newsom told Proposition 50 supporters on Thursday at a labor event, referring to federal agents in the state. Newsom predicted their presence might increase ahead of the Nov. 4 special election.",
      "\"Don't think for a second we're not going to be seeing more of that through Election Day,\" Newsom said. \"These guys are not screwing around.\"",
      "In recent days, the Justice Department\u00a0said it would send its own monitors to supervise the special election in California and the gubernatorial election in New Jersey. Newsom has denounced the move, calling it a Trump administration move to intimidate Democrats.

On Tuesday, it\u00a0pummeled Jamaica as one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph.",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Melissa's core was about 110 miles south-southeast of the central Bahamas and about 955 miles southwest of Bermuda, according to the hurricane center. It had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph, making it a Category 2 storm, and was moving northeast at about 15 mph.",
      "It was expected to move over the southeast or central Bahamas Wednesday evening and pass near Bermuda late Thursday, the hurricane center said.",
      "Officials across the parts of the Caribbean already hit by Melissa were assessing the storm's impacts. At least 23 people have died in Haiti and 13 are missing, the country's Civil Protection Agency said in a statement. Eight deaths were reported in Jamaica, and one in the Dominican Republic.",
      "Jamaica rushes to assess the damage",
      "In Jamaica, more than 25,000 people were packed into shelters Wednesday and more streamed in throughout the day after the storm ripped roofs off their homes and left them temporarily homeless. Dana Morris Dixon, Jamaica's education minister, said 77% of the island was without power.",
      "Outages complicated assessing the damage because of \"a total communication blackout\" in areas, Richard Thompson, acting director-general of Jamaica's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, told the Nationwide News Network radio station.",

      "Moving toward the Bahamas",

The storm was restrengthening as it approached eastern Cuba, the NHC said, and was expected to make landfall there as an extremely dangerous major hurricane early Wednesday morning.",
      "The storm initially came ashore Tuesday near New Hope, on the southwestern coast of Jamaica, and was traveling northeast at 9 mph, the center said. Landslides, fallen trees and numerous power outages were already being reported earlier Tuesday as the hurricane made its approach, with officials cautioning that the damage assessment will be slow.",
      "More than 530,000 Jamaicans were without power as of Tuesday evening, according to Minister of Local Government Desmond McKenzie.

      "\"It's a no-brainer, especially because I'm from there,\" Escobar said. \"We found that the clinic had an excellent rating and really good results.\"",
      "At the clinic, called Inser, the couple met with Dr. Juan Luis Giraldo, who treats patients from around the world. He said nearly half of his clients come from outside Colombia, and about 15% are from the United States.",

      "The fish, named Arnie after Australia's recently retired Olympic champion Ariarne Titmus, was first tagged in early 2022 in Mullaroo Creek, about a 13-hour drive west of Sydney, said Arthur Rylah Institute researcher Zeb Tonkin.",
      "Four years old and weighing in at 3.7 pounds at the time, it \"took off\" when floods hit the area in the spring of that year, Tonkin said, traveling an initial 470 miles upstream in fewer than two months.",
      "The scaly river dweller, an apex water predator, was able to cover longer distances because barriers had been removed along the Murray River to let flood waters pass through.",
      "\"It basically provided free passage for fish,\" said Tonkin.",
      "Arnie then turned around at some point in the past 12 months, swimming another 60 miles downstream toward home.",
      "Researchers only discovered the extent of the fish's travels when sharing data with colleagues a couple of weeks ago.",
      "\"We've been working on these species for decades ... and we haven't come across that sort of scale of movement beforehand,\" Tonkin said. \"Probably the best we have seen a Murray cod do is around 160 kilometers (100 miles).\"",
      "Understanding Murray cod allows researchers to adapt water flows to protect their environment, said Tonkin, whose institute is part of the state of Victoria's department of energy, environment and climate action.",
      "The fish \u2014 not related to ocean cod species \u2014 can live more than 48 years, grow to about 6 feet and weigh more than 180 pounds, according to the government's survey of Australian fish stocks.",
      "\"If we see this species breeding, growing well, migrating well, it's a pretty good indication that the ecosystem in general is pretty healthy,\" Tonkin said.",

      "Scientists now say those fossils and the surrounding rocks date from around 400,000 years before the asteroid struck, which is considered a short interval in geologic time. The age was determined by analyzing small particles of volcanic glass within sandstone and by studying the direction of magnetic minerals within the mudstone of the rock formation.",
      "The results show \"the animals deposited here must have been living close to the end of the Cretaceous,\" the last dinosaur era, said Peppe.",
      "The findings were published Thursday in the journal Science.",
      "Differences between the dinosaur species found in New Mexico and those found at a site in Montana that were previously dated to the same time frame \"run counter to the idea that dinosaurs were in decline,\" Peppe said.",

      "The biggest dinosaur examined in the study was the plant-eating Alamosaurus, which could weigh more than 30 tons and measure about 100 feet long.",
      "\"Nothing illustrates how dinosaurs were thriving up to the very end more than the fact that Alamosaurus, one of the biggest dinosaurs ever - in fact, one of the very biggest animals to ever live on land in the entire history of the Earth - was there to witness the asteroid,\" University of Edinburgh paleontologist and study co-author Steve Brusatte told the Reuters news agency.",
      "\"So not only were sauropods still around when the asteroid hit, they were still thriving, still sublime, still colossal, still glorious,\" Brusatte told Reuters. \"I can imagine the scene: one minute, a jet plane-sized dinosaur was shaking the ground as it walked, the next minute the whole Earth was shaking with the energy unleashed by the asteroid.\"",
      "A research team in 2019 found that the steroid strike ignited a chaotic day of fires, earthquakes, and tsunamis, which led to a prolonged period of global cooling.",
      "Scientists who weren't involved in the study cautioned that evidence found at a single location might not point to a broader trend.",
      "\"This new evidence about these very late-surviving dinosaurs in New Mexico is very exciting,\" said University of Bristol paleontologist Mike Benton, who was not involved in the study. But he added, \"This is just one location, not a representation of the complexity of dinosaur faunas at the time all over North America or all over the world.\"",
      "Although scientists have found dinosaur fossils on every continent, accurately dating them can be a challenge, said paleontologist and study co-author Andrew Flynn of New Mexico State University. Easily datable material, such as carbon, doesn't survive in fossils, so scientists must look for surrounding rocks with precise characteristics that can be used to determine ages.",
      "Further research might help complete the picture of what range of dinosaur species was alive globally on the eve of the asteroid crash, said Flynn.",

    "title": "Heat wave caused key part of Florida coral reef to become \"functionally extinct\"",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/florida-coral-reef-functionally-extinct-marine-heat-wave/",
    "published": "Thu, 23 Oct 2025 14:01:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A record 2023 heat wave all but eradicated two species of coral that historically served as the backbone of Florida's reefs, researchers said in a new report.",
    "story": [
      "A record-setting marine heat wave stripped huge portions of Florida's coral reef of their colors in 2023, triggering the ninth and worst mass bleaching event in the Caribbean. Temperatures soared for weeks, almost completely killing off two of the region's oldest and most important coral species, according to a new report that aims to shine a light on how warming waters can be lethal for the ecosystems they've historically sustained.",
      "Co-authored by scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the University of South Florida and several nonprofit organizations, the report was published Thursday in the peer-reviewed academic journal Science. It shared striking findings from an investigation into the effects of that record heat wave on a 350-mile stretch of the Florida reef, which, researchers said, wilted as sea surface temperatures remained at or above 31 degrees Celsius \u2014 87.8 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 for an average of 40.7 days over the summer.",
      "The heat stress in pockets of the reef during that time was as much as four times greater than it had been during any previous heat wave or any prior year that scientists recorded temperature data for the area, said Ross Cunning, one of the report's lead authors and a biologist at the Chicago-based Shedd Aquarium, whose research centers around ways to make coral reefs more resilient against the effects of climate change.",
      "Among the heat wave's most devastating impacts were the deaths of two types of coral, staghorn and elkhorn, which are known as \"reef builders\" because they have provided the structural foundation from which Caribbean reef ecosystems can grow for thousands of years. According to the report, between 97.8% and 100% of coral belonging to those two species perished in the heat wave, marking what researchers characterized as \"their functional extinction from the region.\"",
      "\"Functional extinction\" means there is no longer enough of either coral species in the Caribbean in order for staghorn or elkhorn to continue performing their longstanding services to the reef at large.",
      "\"These corals are the ecosystem engineers of reefs,\" Cunning told CBS News. \"They literally build the three-dimensional framework that we know as the coral reef.\"",
      "Cunning likened the \"huge losses\" felt by the Caribbean reef in their absence to those a diverse forest might suffer after losing its largest and most vital trees: \"What you're left with is a range of smaller trees and shrubs and other plants, and they'll continue to grow and form together some type of forest,\" he said, \"but it's a forest transformed without these major contributors.\"",
      "The 2023 heat wave in Florida's reef has been\u00a0described as a bleaching event, when corals purge their colorful algae and appear white and brittle in response to warming oceans. Bleaching robs coral of nutrition and makes them more susceptible to disease, which kills them over the long term. But the circumstances in this case were so severe that they actually accelerated that process in some of the affected reefs, said John Parkinson, a professor at the University of South Florida who specializes in marine ecology and is another co-author of the new report.",
      "\"Coral bleaching is definitely a problem, but some of these corals didn't even get a chance to bleach,\" Parkinson told CBS News. \"They actually just started melting. Essentially, they were sloughing their tissue.\"",
      "Damages felt in the wake of the 2023 heat wave are most likely permanent, researchers said. A stark example of the warning call from climate scientists at the University of Exeter's Global Systems Institute in England, who earlier this month released a report of their own that found\u00a0coral reefs\u00a0had become the first environmental system on Earth to pass a climate \"tipping point,\" as global warming has increased ocean temperatures around the world.",
      "Around 25% of all marine life depend on coral reefs for protection and habitats, while the Global Systems Institute estimated that reefs provide crucial support for about 1 billion jobs. Climate scientists have also noted how reefs, in Florida and elsewhere, help shield coastlines and the communities that populate them from things like storm surge, flooding and erosion.",
      "Scientists expect heat waves to become more intense and more common without stronger efforts to reduce the prevalence of fossil fuels and the greenhouse gas emissions that linger in the atmosphere after burning them. In their new report in Science, the co-authors wrote, \"the frequency and severity of extreme climate and weather events, including marine heat waves, are increasing, resulting in widespread degradation of the function, structure, resilience, and adaptive capacity of ecosystems.\"",
      "Those aren't reasons to lose hope for a brighter future, they said. While Parkinson referred to the record heat wave as \"devastating\" and \"off the charts,\" he also told CBS News that he likes to remain optimistic about the possibility that things will change for the better.",
      "\"You know, some corals survived, and the people who are involved in restoration are still going at it, and we're still trying to keep corals around,\" he said. \"We all believe that we can, but we really need help from the people who have the power to adjust our approach to these climate policies.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 14:05:38 -0400",
    "summary": "Elon Musk's partisan stances and foray into politics in recent years have dented the electric vehicle maker's business, Yale researchers say.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk is widely recognized as an electric car pioneer. Yet the Tesla CEO has also single-handedly chilled the automaker's sales, according to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0by researchers at Yale University.",
      "Public controversy over Musk's role as leader of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), as well as his acquisition of social media platform Twitter (now known as X) in 2022, reduced Tesla's sales by up to 1.2 million vehicles over a three-year period, the researchers estimated in a working paper published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research that aimed to measure the effect of Musk's politics on Tesla's business.",
      "\"This study highlights just how impactful a CEO's partisan actions can be,\" the researchers wrote. \"We show that Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person and CEO of the most valuable automaker by market capitalization, had a dramatic effect on Tesla sales due to his politically partisan activities unrelated to Tesla's core business.\"",
      "Musk's adverse impact on Tesla's business became visible starting in mid-2022, with sales especially dropping in Democratic-leaning states and counties, the study further concludes.",
      "\"Musk's actions antagonized his most loyal customer base, for, as we show, Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to purchase a Tesla,\" the researchers said.",
      "The study's lead author is energy and environmental economist Kenneth Gillingham, who is the senior associate dean of academic affairs at the Yale School of the Environment. His research focuses on consumer behavior and policy in the transportation and energy sectors.",
      "Musk announced in May that he was pulling back from DOGE, which the Trump administration formed to shrink the federal government and cut spending.",
      "Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on the paper's findings.",
      "Musk's foray into politics and emergence as a prominent adviser to President Trump early in his second term raised the entrepreneur's visibility but alienated some potential Tesla customers, Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, previously told CBS News.",
      "Tesla last week reported third-quarter earnings of $1.4 billion, down 37% from the year-ago period, citing higher costs and tariff-related headwinds. Tesla's vehicle sales fell 1% in 2024 despite a 7% increase in EV sales across the car industry.",
      "Tesla's stock fell 27% in February, a period of time that coincided with Mr. Trump's first full month in the White House. But the shares have rebounded and are now up roughly 14% on the year, with investors betting on growth in the company's fledgling robotaxi business, autonomous driving technology and plans to build AI-powered humanoid robots.",
      "\"We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,\"\u00a0Wedbush Securities technology analyst Dan Ives said in a recent report, adding that he expects the Trump administration to fast-track such initiatives.",
      "Another measure of Musk's perceived value to Tesla is the enormous pay package shareholders are preparing to vote on for the executive. That total package could be worth up to $1 trillion in a decade, one of the richest compensation packages in corporate history.",
      "For Musk to earn the full amount, Tesla would have to hit certain profitability and production targets, as well as reach a market cap of $8.5 trillion \u2014 nearly six times its current value \u2014 in 10 years.",
      "Robyn Denholm, chairman of Tesla's board of directors, is urging shareholders to approve Musk's proposed compensation. \"Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become: a transformative force reimagining the fundamental building blocks of mobility, energy and labor,\"\u00a0 Denholm said in the letter.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump told reporters Wednesday that he has the authority to send U.S. military forces beyond the National Guard into U.S. cities, claiming not even the courts could stop him, but said that hasn't been necessary so far.",
      "Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One during his trip to Asia, the president said he could send the \"Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines,\" and \"anybody I wanted\" into U.S. cities, and would do so \"if I thought it was necessary.\" Earlier in his trip, the president told U.S. troops at the Yokosuka naval base near Tokyo that he was prepared to send \"more than the National Guard\" into U.S. cities if needed.",
      "Asked whether he meant sending other branches of the military into U.S. cities, Mr. Trump said Wednesday, \"You know if I want to enact a certain act, I'm allowed to do it routinely,\" an apparent reference to the Insurrection Act, which allows the military to act in a law enforcement capacity to suppress a rebellion or quell domestic violence. The authority that has not been invoked by a U.S. president in more than 30 years.",
      "\"And I'd be allowed to do whatever I want,\" Mr. Trump added. \"But we haven't chosen to do that because we're very well \u2014 we're doing very well without it. But I'd be allowed to do that, you understand that, and the courts wouldn't get involved, nobody would get involved, and I could send the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, I can send anybody I wanted. But I haven't done that because we're doing so well without it.\"",
      "The president touted the National Guard deployments in Washington, D.C., and Memphis, Tennessee, as the administration insists their presence is driving down crime. The president has generally targeted Democratic-led cities for National Guard deployments. The cities of Chicago and\u00a0D.C.\u00a0and the states of Illinois, California and Oregon have sued the administration over the deployments.",
      "The Posse Comitatus Act restricts the U.S. military from carrying out domestic law enforcement actions. But there are exceptions to the law.",
      "\"He is talking about the Insurrection Act, which allows use of federal military forces in a law enforcement capacity,\" said Geoffrey Corn, director of the Center for Military Law and Policy at Texas Tech University School of Law, in an email to CBS News. \"This is very rarely used.\"",
      "The last time a president invoked the Insurrection Act was in 1992, when Gov. Gray Davis of California asked President George H.W. Bush for help to quell the riots in Los Angeles after a jury acquitted four police officers who were accused of assaulting and beating Black man Rodney King. The incident was caught on video.",
      "\"He would have to invoke this provision unless a governor requested the help,\" Corn said of Mr. Trump.",
      "In D.C., Mr. Trump deployed the D.C. National Guard troops under a section of federal law known as Title 32, meaning they're not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act. Members of the D.C. Guard also deployed in Title 32 status in 2020, in response to protests over the murder of George Floyd, when the D.C. government requested additional manpower. They also deployed in Title 32 status in response to the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol, after some delay.",

      "A jury found former Sangamon County deputy Sean Grayson guilty of second-degree murder for the fatal police shooting of Sonya Massey.",
      "Grayson was charged with three counts of first-degree murder in the 2024 deadly police shooting, and the jury was given the option of convicting him of second-degree murder. They found him not guilty on all three counts of first-degree murder.",
      "A first-degree murder conviction could have meant up to life in prison. The conviction on second-degree murder in the state of Illinois could carry a prison sentence of anywhere from four to 20 years, but Grayson is also eligible for probation with no prison time at all. A sentencing date has not yet been set.",
      "The jury alerted the judge that they had reached a verdict around 2 p.m.\u00a0 It was read at 2:28 p.m.",
      "Grayson was stoic as the verdict was read. Afterward, he stood from the table, put his hands to be handcuffed, and was led out of the courtroom through the back door.",
      "One of Grayson's family members was seen crying in the courtroom when the verdict was read.",
      "Massey's family, by contrast, was quiet and appeared deflated or upset as the second-degree conviction was handed down. They are expected to speak after court is adjourned, but they have been vocal in their desire for justice in this case.",
      "CBS News Chicago legal expert Irv Miller said the jury's verdict was not particularly surprising, considering the evidence presented at trial and the fact that the judge gave the option for second degree murder in the first place.",
      "Miller explained that by finding Grayson guilty of second-degree murder, the jury determined that as a police officer he had an unreasonable belief that he was acting in self-defense when he opened fire on Massey. In this case, Miller said, whether or not Grayson's belief he was acting in self-defense was reasonable was pivotal; if a jury had found it was a reasonable belief, he would have been found not guilty. Since the jury found his belief was not reasonable, they found him guilty of second degree murder.",
      "Miller said he expects whatever sentence is handed down, Grayson will be expected to serve at least 50% of it. While probation is an option, Miller said he wouldn't expect that sentence in this case.",
      "The jury deliberated\u00a0for a total of about 12 hours over the course of two days before they reached their verdict. They asked several questions and to see Grayson's previous employment and training history. They also re-watched the body camera footage after closing arguments on Tuesday.",
      "Massey, a 36-year-old unarmed Black woman, called police for help in July 2024 for a possible prowler outside her home.",
      "Inside the home, Grayson said Massey began acting erratically and rebuked him \"in the name of Jesus\" while walking towards a pot of water on her stove. Body cam video from Grayson's partner captured the shooting; Grayson's body camera was not activated for most the call, only turning on shortly after he pulled his weapon.",
      "Massey died of a gunshot wound. Grayson faces three first-degree murder charges.",
      "Dawson Farley, his former partner on that night, testified during the trial that he was not afraid of Massey during the call, but instead feared Grayson. Farley told the jury that, while he was confused after Massey said \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,\" he never perceived that as a threat. He added he only unholstered his gun because Grayson did.",
      "Grayson took the stand in his own defense. He testified that finding broken windows on her car, her 911 call for help and waiting four minutes for her to answer the phone made him concerned someone else was inside. He also said he believed she may have been \"under the influence of something\" and said she appeared \"scatterbrained.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-interest-rate-decision-today-fomc-meeting/",
    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 15:53:53 -0400",
    "summary": "The Fed on Wednesday announced its second interest-rate cut of 2025, reducing borrowing costs in a move to spur U.S. hiring.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, but Chair Jerome Powell hinted that the central bank might pause before further lowering borrowing costs.",
      "The Fed cut lowers the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 3.75% and 4%, down from its prior range of 4% to 4.25%. The Fed reduced rates by the same amount in September, its first cut since December of 2024.",
      "In a Wednesday afternoon press conference to discuss the decision, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said another rate cut at its next meeting, set for Dec. 10, \"isn't a foregone conclusion.\" That may disappoint some borrowers and investors, given that the Fed last month had penciled in an additional rate cut for its final meeting of the year.",
      "\"There were strongly differing views on how to proceed in December\" during the central bank's meeting today, Powell said. Those conflicting views mean \"we haven't made a decision about December. I'm saying something in addition here \u2014 that it's not to be seen as a foregone conclusion. In fact, far from it.\"",
      "He added, \"We've cut 50 more basis points in the last two meetings, and there's a sense from some, 'Let's pause here,' and a sense from others, 'Let's go ahead.'\"",
      "Stocks erased modest gains after Powell's comments, with the S&P 500 slipping 0.2% in afternoon trading and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipping 0.4%.",
      "The central bank's move to ease monetary policy is aimed at shoring up economic growth by lowering borrowing costs, spurring consumer spending and investment by businesses. Although the ongoing U.S. government shutdown has delayed release of the Labor Department's September jobs report, other indicators point to a continued slowdown in hiring. The ADP National Employment Report, for instance, showed private-sector payrolls shrinking by 32,000 last month.",
      "In its policy\u00a0statement on Wednesday, the Fed said \"downside risks to employment rose in recent months.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve's so-called dual mandate requires monetary policymakers to keep both inflation and unemployment low, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting last month that risks to the labor market are growing.",
      "While Powell said the Fed is watching layoff announcements from large businesses such as Amazon, he added that the weakness in the job market does not appear to be accelerating. His comments indicate that another back-to-back rate cut this year isn't a certainty, financial experts said.",
      "\"The knee-jerk reaction of the markets to the Fed meeting (and press conference) was to sell stocks and bonds, because Chairman Powell said that an additional rate cut in December wasn't a sure thing,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email. Investors \"were negatively surprised that future cuts might be taken off the table.\"",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the panel that sets the Fed's monetary policy, isn't scheduled to meet on interest rates in November.",
      "Data blackout",
      "The near-total blackout on government economic data during the shutdown may complicate the Fed's decision-making, experts said. Typically, Fed officials are able to draw on a host of official reports, ranging from measures of employment growth to inflation markers, as they seek to determine the best path for policy.",
      "\"While today's rate cut and the general direction of future policy remain relatively clear, guidance on the committee's perspective on economic conditions is more necessary than ever,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates said in an email. \"A prolonged government shutdown and ongoing tariff negotiations continue to introduce significant uncertainty into the immediate monetary policy outlook.\"",
      "Powell noted that the lack of official economic data may complicate the Fed's December decision, given that the central bank relies on such information to assess the economy.",
      "\"What do you do when you are driving in the fog? You slow down,\" Powell said.",
      "On Wednesday, 10 of the 12 FOMC members voted in favor of the quarter-point cut, with two members objecting. Fed Governor Stephen Miran dissented, preferring a 0.50 percentage point cut, as he did at the September meeting. Kansas City Fed President Jeffry Schmid also dissented, saying he preferred no rate change.",
      "Inflation battle",
      "While the Fed is now focused on weakness in the labor market, its battle against inflation isn't over. The Fed cranked rates higher after consumer prices soared during the pandemic, with inflation hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022.",
      "Because higher interest rates make it more expensive to borrow, businesses and consumers typically react by paring spending, which dampens demand throughout the economy and cools inflation. Since mid-2022, inflation has receded to an annual rate of 3% as of September, although that remains higher than the Fed's target of a 2% annual pace.",
      "While the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs are starting to trickle through to consumer prices, the impact has been more muted than economists had predicted earlier this year. Some businesses are eating some of the tariff costs, while others stocked up on imports earlier in the year to get ahead of the import duties.",
      "\"Though inflation is still higher than comfortable, the jobs market is holding on to signs of weakness, and their desire to stimulate the economy further is likely to continue outweighing inflation concerns,\" said Steve Rick, chief economist at financial services company TruStage.",

      "Paramount initiated roughly 1,000 of those layoffs companywide on Wednesday (Paramount Skydance owns CBS News.) The rest of the cuts are expected to be made at a later date. In all, 2,000 job reductions amount to about 10% of Paramount's total workforce.",
      "\"These decisions are never made lightly, especially given their effect on our colleagues who have made meaningful contributions to the company,\" CEO David Ellison wrote Wednesday in a memo to employees.",
      "The prospect of job cuts has hovered over Paramount employees for some time. Ellison on Wednesday reiterated that the company has been working to restructure since the completion of its merger in August, and noted that workforce cuts are \"part of that process.\"",

      "U.S. District Judge Michael Seabright ruled that acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, who oversees the Justice Department's outpost in the Central District of California, cannot oversee the prosecutions of three people who were charged with gun crimes. The judge rejected a request by the three defendants to toss out their charges altogether.",

But days before the clock ran out, Essayli resigned and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi immediately named him first assistant U.S. attorney because, under federal law, the holder of that job becomes the office's acting head when there's a vacancy.",
      "Seabright ruled that this maneuver was unlawful because only the first assistant U.S. attorney who is already in place when the office becomes vacant is eligible to become acting chief.",
      "\"Simply stated: Essayli unlawfully assumed the role of Acting United States Attorney for the Central District of California. He has been unlawfully serving in that capacity since his resignation from the interim role on July 29, 2025,\" Seabright wrote. \"Essayli may not perform the functions and duties of the United States Attorney as Acting United States Attorney.

    "story": [
      "Hurricane Melissa\u00a0was heading toward the Bahamas Wednesday afternoon after hitting eastern Cuba and\u00a0Jamaica. Melissa was\u00a0one of the strongest hurricanes\u00a0ever recorded in the Atlantic basin when it reached Jamaica Tuesday afternoon as a Category 5 storm.",
      "Its wind speeds had slowed since its landfalls in Jamaica and Cuba with 100 mph winds recorded Wednesday, making it a Category 2 hurricane, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said.",
      "Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, isn't expected to have major impacts on the mainland United States.",
      "Melissa's forecast and path",
      "At 2 p.m. EDT Wednesday, the hurricane center said Melissa's core was about 110 miles south-southeast of the central Bahamas and about 955 miles southwest of Bermuda.",
      "\"The core of Melissa is expected to move across the southeastern or central Bahamas this afternoon and evening, and pass near or to the west of Bermuda late Thursday and Thursday night,\" the hurricane center said.",
      "Melissa was moving at about 15 mph. Hurricane-force winds extended out up to 40 miles from Melissa's center and tropical-storm-force winds extended out up to 185 miles, the NHC said.",
      "The storm made landfall in Cuba early Wednesday as a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph. Before that, it slammed Jamaica's southwestern coast Tuesday afternoon, packing maximum sustained winds of 185 mph, the hurricane center said. Hurricanes reach Category 5 \u2014 the top of\u00a0the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale\u00a0\u2014 when their winds hit 157 mph.",
      "The storm's extremely slow pace as it hit Jamaica raised its potential destructive force.",
      "The strongest previous hurricane to pound Jamaica was Gilbert in 1988, which killed 45 people and caused more than $700 million in damage.",
      "The crew of a U.S. Air Force 403rd Wing \"Hurricane Hunters\" flight ran into severe turbulence as it approached Melissa's eyewall on Monday and had to return to their base in Florida, but they did capture stunning images of the center of the storm. Another flight on Tuesday to gather data on the hurricane also had to turn back after hitting strong turbulence.",
      "Hurricane advisories",
      "A hurricane warning was in effect Wednesday for the Cuban provinces of Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, Holguin and Las Tunas, the southeastern and central Bahamas, and Bermuda.",
      "And a tropical storm warning is posted for Haiti, the Cuban province of Camaguey and the Turks and Caicos Islands.",
      "Rainfall forecasts",
      "Rainfall of 5 to 10 inches is expected in the southeast Bahamas Wednesday, \"which will result in areas of flash flooding,\" the hurricane center said.",
      "In the Turks and Caicos, rainfall totals of 1 to 3 inches are expected, and heavy rain was forecast to affect Bermuda on Thursday or Thursday night.",
      "Climate change fueling the storm",
      "Above-average Atlantic Ocean temperatures, made worse by climate change, helped Melissa rapidly intensify into a major hurricane, according to climate scientists.",
      "\"That part of the Atlantic is extremely warm right now \u2014 around 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), which is 2 to 3 degrees Celsius above normal,\" Akshay Deoras, a meteorologist at the University of Reading in the U.K., told The Associated Press. \"And it's not just the surface. The deeper layers of the ocean are also unusually warm, providing a vast reservoir of energy for the storm.\"",
      "Stronger winds, heavier rainfall and higher sea level rise will make storm surge more intense.",
      "Preliminary data from Climate Central, a nonprofit group of scientists monitoring the effects of climate change, suggests that climate change has increased Melissa's wind speed by 10 mph.",
      "\"Climate change is fundamentally changing our weather. It does not mean that every single tropical cyclone is going to go through rapid or super-rapid intensification. However, in our warmer world, it will continue to increase the likelihood of storms going through rapid and super-rapid intensification,\" Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central, told the AP.",

    "story": [
      "Monkeys being transported Tuesday on a Mississippi highway escaped after the truck carrying them overturned, and all but three that got out have since been killed, authorities said.",
      "The crash happened approximately 100 miles from the state capital of Jackson. It's not clear what caused the truck to overturn. Video showed monkeys crawling through the tall grass on the side of Interstate 59 just north of Heidelberg, Mississippi, with wooden crates labeled \"live animals\" crumpled and strewn about.",
      "The Jasper County Sheriff's Department said the rhesus monkeys were from Tulane University, and initially wrote in a post on Facebook that \"they are aggressive to humans and they require PPE to handle.\"",
      "The department later said on Facebook that \"[t]here are 3 monkeys still on the loose after the officials from Tulane were able to get inside the truck and get a correct count.\"",
      "It's not clear how many monkeys were originally in the truck or how many were killed.",
      "The sheriff's department said the driver of the truck relayed that \"the monkeys were dangerous and posed a threat to humans,\" and that it took \"appropriate actions after being given that information.\"",
      "Rhesus monkeys, which typically weigh around 16 pounds, are among the most medically studied animals on the planet.",
      "The sheriff's department initially said the monkeys were carrying diseases, including herpes, but Tulane University said in a statement that the monkeys \"are not infectious.\" Law enforcement officials did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for clarification.",
      "The monkeys were being housed at the Tulane University National Biomedical Research Center in New Orleans, Louisiana, which routinely provides primates to scientific research organizations, according to the university.",
      "The monkeys \"are provided to other research organizations to advance scientific discovery,\" a Tulane University spokesperson told CBS News in a statement. \"The primates in question belong to another entity and are not infectious. We are actively collaborating with local authorities and will send a team of animal care experts to assist as needed.\"",
      "\"The primates in question were not carrying any diseases and had received recent checkups confirming that they were pathogen-free,\" Tulane spokesperson Andrew Yawn said in another statement on Wednesday.",
      "Mississippi Wildlife and Fisheries was also on site, according to the sheriff's department. It wasn't clear who the monkeys belong to or where they were going.",
      "Rhesus macaque primates have brown fur with red faces and ears. They have close-cropped hair on their heads, which accentuates their very expressive faces. Rhesus macaques were imported to the United States in the 1970s for biomedical research in laboratories, according to the\u00a0New England Primate Conservancy. Rhesus macaques are \"bold, extremely curious and adventurous monkeys,\" and the species is \"highly adaptable to coexisting alongside humans,\" the conservancy says.",
      "In November 2024, 43 rhesus macaque primates escaped from an Alpha Genesis research facility in Beaufort County, South Carolina, prompting warnings for nearby residents to secure their doors and windows. They were all eventually safely captured as of January. Greg Westergaard, CEO of Alpha Genesis, told CBS News in November last year that a caretaker inadvertently failed to secure a door at the enclosure, allowing the monkeys to roam free.",

      "A former high-ranking homeland security official in the first Trump administration is launching a new online hub Wednesday to facilitate protests and other resistance efforts against President Trump and his policies.",
      "Miles Taylor, a former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security, is leading a group of dozens of former national security officials, whistleblowers and a bipartisan group of former elected officials to create a website called defiance.org.",
      "In its mission statement, the bipartisan group says the tool is \"designed to help Americans push back peacefully, lawfully, and defiantly against presidential abuses of power.\"",
      "Taylor told CBS News, \"There are many organizations and a million efforts, but there has not been a clearinghouse for people who regularly seek ways to engage. This is a 'Google' for defiance, where people can go to see their options to push back lawfully, peacefully and defiantly.\"",
      "In September 2018, Taylor wrote an anonymous opinion piece in the New York Times that said there was a \"quiet resistance\" to President Trump within his own administration, made up of people \"working diligently\" to block what he called the president's \"worst inclinations.\" He disclosed two years later that he had written the op-ed.",
      "The announcement of the new site is intended to capitalize on momentum from the October \"No Kings\" rallies earlier this month, which attracted participants across the country.",
      "The site launched Wednesday with a video of actor Robert DeNiro, a staunch Trump critic, urging protesters and critics to join forces.",
      "\"You can't just sit on your ass and wait for the insanity and cruelty to pass. No,\" DeNiro says in the video. \"You gotta stand up and fight.\"",
      "In April, Mr. Trump signed an executive memo targeting Taylor, accusing him of manufacturing stories to sell a book, and ordered DHS, the Justice Department and other government agencies to investigate him and revoke his security clearances, as well as for those who worked closely with him. Mr. Trump also ordered an investigation into the alleged dissemination of classified documents while Taylor worked for the government. Taylor denies he leaked any such material.",
      "Defiance.org is described in its mission statement as a \"nationwide 'mutual aid' pact to defend those under attack.\" It aims to support nonprofit partners, and says it will join \"peaceful protests and legal defense efforts.\"",
      "Taylor told CBS News supporters of the effort include Stephanie Grisham, a press secretary from the first Trump administration, and former aide Olivia Troye, both of whom have become vocal critics of the president.",
      "Dozens of former elected leaders and Trump critics, including former Republican congressmen Reid Ribble, Denver Riggleman and Joe Walsh, are also supporting the new portal.",
      "Taylor said the mutual aid feature of the portal is intended to help those targeted by the administration. He said a future effort could include rallying legal, political and community leaders to support Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who is under investigation by the Justice Department, if he is charged. Taylor said the Defiance.org hub would be used to galvanize and organize legal help, courthouse supporters and public statements in support of Schiff or against the Trump administration.",
      "Riggleman told CBS News the group would seek to \"protect Americans against political overreach and targeted retaliation.\"",
      "The White House has harshly criticized Taylor in the past, including in this statement in April.",
      "\"While serving as an administrative staff assistant at the Department of Homeland Security, Taylor stoked dissension by manufacturing sensationalist reports on the existence of a supposed 'resistance' within the federal government that 'vowed' to undermine and render effective (sic) a sitting President,\" the White House said.",

    "summary": "Elon Musk's partisan stances and foray into politics in recent years have dented the electric vehicle maker's business, Yale researchers say.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk is widely recognized as an electric car pioneer. Yet the Tesla CEO has also single-handedly chilled the automaker's sales, according to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0by researchers at Yale University.",
      "Public controversy over Musk's role as leader of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), as well as his acquisition of social media platform Twitter (now known as X) in 2022, reduced Tesla's sales by up to 1.2 million vehicles over a three-year period, the researchers estimated in a working paper published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research that aimed to measure the effect of Musk's politics on Tesla's business.",
      "\"This study highlights just how impactful a CEO's partisan actions can be,\" the researchers wrote. \"We show that Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person and CEO of the most valuable automaker by market capitalization, had a dramatic effect on Tesla sales due to his politically partisan activities unrelated to Tesla's core business.\"",
      "Musk's adverse impact on Tesla's business became visible starting in mid-2022, with sales especially dropping in Democratic-leaning states and counties, the study further concludes.",
      "\"Musk's actions antagonized his most loyal customer base, for, as we show, Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to purchase a Tesla,\" the researchers said.",
      "The study's lead author is energy and environmental economist Kenneth Gillingham, who is the senior associate dean of academic affairs at the Yale School of the Environment. His research focuses on consumer behavior and policy in the transportation and energy sectors.",
      "Musk announced in May that he was pulling back from DOGE, which the Trump administration formed to shrink the federal government and cut spending.",
      "Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on the paper's findings.",
      "Musk's foray into politics and emergence as a prominent adviser to President Trump early in his second term raised the entrepreneur's visibility but alienated some potential Tesla customers, Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at Jonestrading, previously told CBS News.",
      "Tesla last week reported third-quarter earnings of $1.4 billion, down 37% from the year-ago period, citing higher costs and tariff-related headwinds. Tesla's vehicle sales fell 1% in 2024 despite a 7% increase in EV sales across the car industry.",
      "Tesla's stock fell 27% in February, a period of time that coincided with Mr. Trump's first full month in the White House. But the shares have rebounded and are now up roughly 14% on the year, with investors betting on growth in the company's fledgling robotaxi business, autonomous driving technology and plans to build AI-powered humanoid robots.",
      "\"We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,\"\u00a0Wedbush Securities technology analyst Dan Ives said in a recent report, adding that he expects the Trump administration to fast-track such initiatives.",
      "Another measure of Musk's perceived value to Tesla is the enormous pay package shareholders are preparing to vote on for the executive. That total package could be worth up to $1 trillion in a decade, one of the richest compensation packages in corporate history.",
      "For Musk to earn the full amount, Tesla would have to hit certain profitability and production targets, as well as reach a market cap of $8.5 trillion \u2014 nearly six times its current value \u2014 in 10 years.",
      "Robyn Denholm, chairman of Tesla's board of directors, is urging shareholders to approve Musk's proposed compensation. \"Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become: a transformative force reimagining the fundamental building blocks of mobility, energy and labor,\"\u00a0 Denholm said in the letter.",

      "Senate Democrats want to extend a slate of expiring health insurance subsidies in exchange for their votes to reopen the government, but Republicans have pressed to end the shutdown with no strings attached before negotiating on health care. Meanwhile, thousands of federal employees are missing out on paychecks, and tens of millions of food aid recipients are set to lose their benefits starting this weekend.",

      "During a visit to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Vice President JD Vance put the onus on Senate Democrats to vote to end the shutdown.  \"We just need five more reasonable Democrats to do what the American people want us to do, to open up the government,\" he told reporters.",
      "In recent weeks, two moderate Democrats, Sens. John Fetterman and Catherine Cortez Masto, and an independent, Sen. Angus King, have voted with almost all Republicans in favor of a House-passed stopgap measure that would extend government funding at existing levels until mid-November, allowing the shutdown to end.",

      "\"It's extraordinary that Republicans have been able to find $40 billion to bail out a right-wing wannabe dictator in Argentina, but can't find a dime to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" said Jeffries, referring to a plan by the Trump administration to offer loans and financial support to Argentinian President Javier Milei's government.",
      "Jeffries also blasted the Trump administration over the expected end to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits on Saturday, saying Republicans \"can't find a dime to make sure that 42 million Americans, including 16 million children, don't go hungry.\"",

      "Raskin represents scores of federal workers in the D.C. suburbs who have faced missed paychecks and the threat of layoffs during the shutdown.

      "The senator has called for Congress to pass his standalone bill to restore funding for SNAP benefits. He said he's \"available to talk to anybody who wants to talk on any subject.\" Senate Democrats have also introduced a measure to fully fund SNAP and WIC, the Women, Children and Infants nutritional program, for the duration of the shutdown.",

      "67 is an ambiguous slang term made popular by Gen Alpha on social media and in schools and friend groups across the country. Its pervasiveness is what stuck out to the team selecting the word of the year, Steve Johnson, director of lexicography for the Dictionary Media Group at IXL Learning, told CBS News.",
      "\"Something that you would have thought would have gone away, it just kept on growing larger and larger, snowballing into kind of like a cultural phenomenon,\" Johnson said.",

      "\"Because of its murky and shifting usage, it's an example of brainrot slang and is intended to be nonsensical and playfully absurd,\" the dictionary says.",

Many turn to medical professionals from abroad to fill the gaps, but the new $100,000 price tag for the popular H-1B visa is making that nearly impossible, particularly for midsize hospitals or smaller.",

      "The firings come as Mr. Trump seeks to put his stamp on D.C., with plans to replace the White House's East Wing with a 90,000-square-foot ballroom and build a gigantic triumphal arch across the river from D.C. He also signed an executive order in August titled \"Making Federal Architecture Beautiful Again,\" which called for classical architecture modeled on ancient Greece and Rome to be the default style for D.C.-area buildings moving forward.",
      "The Commission of Fine Arts is one of several boards that reviews, provides comments on and approves construction in the capital, along with the National Capital Planning Commission.

The sudden decision to demolish the East Wing last week \u2014 despite Mr. Trump's earlier claim that the ballroom project would not touch the existing building \u2014 has faced criticism, and some historic preservation groups have urged the Trump administration to go through the normal approval process for the ballroom project.",
      "\"This project represents one of the most substantial alterations to the White House in modern history,\" Democratic Reps. Jared Huffman, Robert Garcia and Yassamin Ansari said in a letter to the president. \"The decisions were made in complete secrecy and undertaken without public disclosure or proper consultation.\"",
      "The White House, meanwhile, has called the pushback \"manufactured outrage\" and argued that prior presidents have also made changes to the complex. The administration has also cast the ballroom as a necessary addition to a building that's lacking in large event spaces.",

      "Official federal reports on the state of the labor market have been suspended due to the government shutdown, which means the Fed will make its next interest rate decision tomorrow, Oct. 29, without information about hiring in September.",
      "But job growth has slowed sharply in recent months, with average monthly payroll gains of roughly 27,000 between May and August \u2014 down from average gains of nearly 123,000 per month between January and April, labor data shows.",
      "On Oct. 1, the ADP National Employment Report, a measure of private employment in the U.S., said payrolls at private employers declined by 32,000 jobs in September.",
      "At the same time, recent reports suggest layoffs have accelerated in October, Grace Zwemmer, associate economist with Oxford Economics, said in a report Wednesday. State-level data also shows jobless claims by federal employees topped 10,000 in the week ended Oct. 18, a sign the stalemate in Congress is taking a toll, the investment advisory firm said in a separate research note.",
      "To be sure, the nation's unemployment rate remains low by historical standards, edging up to 4.3% in August from 4.2% in July. The latest layoffs are unlikely to dramatically drive up joblessness, experts say.",
      "\"When we look at the scale of the announcements vis-\u00e0-vis the broader economy and the data we have from unemployment claims, we don't see them yet at a scale where the unemployment rate is going to shoot up,\" said Andy Stettner, director of economy and jobs at the left-leaning Century Foundation.",
      "But, he added, \"These larger corporate downsizings are happening at a time when there aren't many job openings.\"",
      "That means some workers who lose their jobs could struggle to find new employment, experts say. As a result, the ranks of long-term unemployed people, or those who have been searching for work for more than six months, are predicted to rise even higher from its August figure of almost 2 million, the highest level since 2022.",
      "What's impacting the labor market?",
      "Employers are cutting jobs due to several factors, experts say, ranging from artificial intelligence to economic uncertainty. Earlier this year, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said the e-commerce giant's investment in AI tools would allow the company to\u00a0trim its human workforce\u00a0as the business becomes more efficient.",
      "\"Amazon really pointed to robotics, AI and new technology \u2014 and being on the cutting edge of that technology \u2014 for shifting jobs,\" Challenger said.",
      "About one-quarter of technology industry workers said they had experienced layoffs or role eliminations due to AI adoption during the past two years, according to a new study from career site Indeed.",
      "Other companies are holding off on hiring or are cutting jobs for other reasons. UPS cited the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, as well as shipping declines from Amazon, its biggest customer, on its business. Amazon has been building its own delivery infrastructure, leading it to cut back on its use of UPS.",
      "On Monday, children's clothing brand Carter's said it is cutting 300 jobs, or 15% of its workforce, and closing 150 stores over the next three years due to higher costs from tariffs, which are import duties paid by U.S. companies to the federal government.",
      "The Trump administration has said that its tariffs would help protect U.S. manufacturing and boost domestic production as businesses move their operations stateside.",
      "In the meantime, Americans are growing more pessimistic about the job market, according to recent\u00a0CBS News polling. About 52% of Americans describe the labor market as \"bad,\" up seven percentage points from April, the poll found.",
      "\"We are moving more into a time where job security might be more precarious,\" Challenger said.",

    "summary": "Officials from half the states and the District of Columbia are asking a federal judge to order the Department of Agriculture to provide food stamp benefits for November.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A coalition of officials from half of the states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration on Tuesday over the suspension of food stamp benefits amid the ongoing government shutdown, as millions of Americans brace for a disruption in federal food aid in the coming days.",
      "The states, which include California, New York and Pennsylvania, are asking a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the Department of Agriculture to provide benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program\u00a0for November, including by tapping into a contingency fund to ensure the assistance continues to flow to more than 25 million people living within their borders.",
      "They argue that the administration's decision to cut off food stamp payments, which are provided to roughly 42 million people nationwide, is unlawful and threatens to deprive millions of Americans of essential food benefits that help protect against food insecurity and hunger.",
      "\"Shutting off SNAP benefits will cause deterioration of public health and well-being,\" state officials wrote in their lawsuit. \"Ultimately, the States will bear costs associated with many of these harms. The loss of SNAP benefits leads to food insecurity, hunger, and malnutrition, which are associated with numerous negative health outcomes in children, such as poor concentration, decreased cognitive function, fatigue, depression, and behavioral problems.\"",
      "The states involved in the suit are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania,\u202fRhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.",
      "As the government shutdown continues to drag on, the Trump administration announced last week that federal food aid would not go out on Nov. 1 after the Department of Agriculture declined to tap into roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits through the food stamp program flowing.",
      "The agency blamed Democrats for failing to back a House-passed stopgap bill to fund the government, writing on its website that \"the well has run dry.\"",
      "\"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats,\" a spokesperson for the USDA said in response to the lawsuit. \"Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments.\"",
      "The agency's plan for a lapse in funding, issued Sept. 30, said that multi-year contingency funds could be used for state administrative expenses to ensure states could continue SNAP operations during a shutdown and were also available \"to fund participant benefits in the event\" of a funding lapse.",
      "But a memo from the USDA issued last week said \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits\" and are instead meant for things like assisting people in disaster areas. The document cited Hurricane Melissa, which made landfall Tuesday in Jamaica as one of the strongest Atlantic storms ever recorded.",
      "Still, state officials argued in their lawsuit that the USDA's claim that the contingency funds can't be used to fund food benefits during a lapse in federal funding violates the text of congressional appropriations law and is a \"dramatic change\" in its own policy.",
      "They noted that during the last shutdown, USDA said in guidance in January 2019 that said that \"limited funding is available from the contingency that can be used to provide benefits for February.\"",
      "\"Millions of Americans are about to go hungry because the federal government has chosen to withhold food assistance it is legally obligated to provide,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. \"SNAP is one of our nation's most effective tools to fight hunger, and the USDA has the money to keep it running. There is no excuse for this administration to abandon families who rely on SNAP, or food stamps, as a lifeline. The federal government must do its job to protect families.\"",
      "The Trump administration has attempted to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to reopen the government, announcing cancellations of federal funding for programs in blue states and issuing layoff-notices to thousands of federal workers.",
      "The ongoing shutdown, which is in its 28th day, is now the second-longest on record.",
      "Ahead of the approaching halt to food stamp payments, some states have said they will work to keep the assistance going to beneficiaries. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans receive food stamps, and recipients receive, on average, a payment of $187 on prepaid cards that can be used to buy groceries.",
      "The impending lapse in food stamps has raised concerns among Republicans and Democrats. GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced legislation last week that aims to ensure continued funding for the food assistance program during the shutdown. The plan has garnered support from 10 other Republican senators and Democratic Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont.",
      "Democrats have separately urged Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to use the agency's reserve funds to help cover food stamp benefits next month, though she has declined to do so.",
      "We asked Vance and 7 lawmakers what they're doing to end the government shutdown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenators cautiously optimistic about talks to end government shutdown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAirlines feeding air traffic controllers as they miss first paychecks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25 states sue Trump administration over food stamp freeze during shutdown\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenate fails to advance GOP bill to end shutdown for 13th time",

    "summary": "CBS News is tracking a record number of measles cases around the country after an outbreak in West Texas that led to the deaths of two children.",
    "story": [
      "In 2025, the United States has recorded the most measles cases in more than 30 years, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. A large share of the infections were connected to an outbreak in West Texas that led to\u00a0the deaths\u00a0of two children.",
      "The number of cases in Texas alone grew to over\u00a0760\u00a0before the state declared it officially over in August, while total cases nationwide have topped 1,500, with infections confirmed in at least 39 states.",
      "Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and in some cases, can cause\u00a0severe infections\u00a0in the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death. But doctors and health officials say the vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is\u00a0highly safe and effective.",
      "While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.",
      "The largest outbreak so far this year has been in West Texas, but cases have been reported in other states around the country, as well. In South Carolina, for example,\u00a0dozens of students were quarantined in October due to an outbreak.",
      "The CBS News data team is tracking confirmed measles cases nationwide as new data is released by state health departments and the CDC. (The map below is updated on Wednesdays when the CDC releases its latest weekly numbers.)",
      "The Texas outbreak primarily affected\u00a0children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were\u00a0unvaccinated\u00a0or had an unknown vaccination status. State and local health officials confirmed the first patient who died was an unvaccinated school-aged child, and the second was an unvaccinated 8-year-old girl. Neither of the children had underlying health conditions, the Texas health department said. New Mexico also reported the death of an adult with measles.",
      "The last measles death in the U.S. before this year was in 2019, when a 37-year-old man died from measles complicated by meningitis in California, according to CDC data.",
      "Until now, the highest number of confirmed cases in the U.S. in recent years was 1,274 in 2019, driven by outbreaks in New York, California and Washington state, but most years the total has been much lower.",
      "Health experts point to lower vaccination rates as a reason for increases in preventable diseases like the measles.",
      "CDC data shows about 93% of kindergarteners in the U.S. were vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year and only 92.7% in the 2023-2024 school year. This is\u00a0down from 95.2% during the 2019-2020 school year \u2014 a critical threshold to keep people safe.",
      "\"When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated, most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity),\" the CDC states.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a history\u00a0of making\u00a0false and misleading claims\u00a0about vaccines, voiced support for vaccination as the\u00a0deadly outbreak\u00a0spread in the Southwest.",
      "\"We encourage people to get the measles vaccine,\" Kennedy told CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook in an interview\u00a0April 8, marking the first time Kennedy has publicly urged people to get the measles vaccine since becoming HHS secretary.",
      "Asked by LaPook what the federal government's official position on the vaccine is, Kennedy reiterated, \"The federal government's position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine,\" but added, \"The government should not be mandating those.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Oct 2025 07:44:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Concerns about a weakening labor market may outweigh worries about rising inflation, tipping the Fed toward another rate cut, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve is set to make its next interest rate decision today, even as a near-total blackout of federal economic data continues amid the government shutdown.",
      "The Labor Department, however, on Friday released one key report ahead of its meeting:\u00a0the Consumer Price Index. That report showed that the inflation rate rose at a pace of 3% last month, cooler than expected, as the impact of President Trump's wide-ranging tariffs have so far been more muted than economists have forecast.",
      "Economists say the softer inflation report likely opens the door to a rate cut today.",
      "\"Concerns about tariffs driving prices higher are still not showing up in most categories,\" Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, said Friday in an email. \"Nothing in the inflation print should stop the Fed from cutting rates next week. Yes, prices are higher, but not enough to keep them from helping the economy,\" he added.",
      "There's a 96.7% probability that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points on Oct. 29,\u00a0according to CME FedWatch, which bases its predictions on 30-Day Fed Funds futures prices.",
      "A quarter-point cut would bring down the benchmark rate to a range of between 3.75% to 4%, down from its current range of between 4% to 4.25%, and mark the Fed's second rate cut this year.",
      "What's the argument for cutting rates?",
      "The Federal Reserve has a so-called dual mandate to keep both inflation and unemployment low. When inflation is soaring \u2014 such as when it hit a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022 \u2014 the Fed ratchets rates higher to make borrowing more expensive, which in turn dissuades consumers and businesses from spending, tempering inflation.",
      "But a weak labor market can be bolstered by lower interest rates, because it's easier for businesses to expand and hire more workers if it's less expensive to borrow money.",
      "When Powell last month announced the Fed's first rate cut of 2025, he signaled the central bank was growing increasingly concerned about a sharp slowdown in the labor market. \"In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen,\" he said in September.",
      "However, the monthly jobs report for September wasn't released earlier this month due to the federal shutdown. In an Oct. 14 speech, Powell acknowledged the data halt, yet added that the central bank has access to \"a wide variety of public- and private-sector data that have remained available.\"",
      "According to those sources of information, \"the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting,\" Powell noted.",
      "Friday's CPI report \"should keep the Fed focused on the labor market in terms of the near-term policy trajectory. In the absence of the September jobs report, an October cut appears to be a done deal,\" Bank of America economists noted in a Friday research report.",
      "How would a rate cut impact your money?",
      "While a quarter-point rate cut is relatively small, it would come after September's reduction \u2014 and economists are also expecting the Fed to usher in a third cut at its December meeting. Together, that means the benchmark rate by year-end could sit 0.75 percentage points lower than it was in January.",
      "That would help reduce rates for credit cards and loans such as home equity lines of credit, or HELOCs. Those types of credit products are based on the prime rate, or the interest rate that banks charge each other, and which in turn is based on the Fed's benchmark rate.",
      "Mortgage rates, meanwhile, have already dipped ahead of the Fed's rate decision. While mortgage rates aren't set by the Fed, they're\u00a0heavily influenced\u00a0by its policy moves, as well as bond market investors' expectations for economic growth and inflation.",
      "The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 6.19% as of Oct. 23, marking their lowest level in a year, according to Freddie Mac. Homebuyers might not see much more of a break, at least in the near-term, economists said.",
      "\"Mortgage rates have moved down notably in advance of the Fed's meeting, hitting their lowest level in more than a year, but further declines will depend on new developments,\" noted Realtor.com's chief economist Danielle Hale in an email. \"The Fed's decisions are anticipated by the market, which means that the upcoming rate cut and several more over the next few months are already largely priced in.\"",

      "Mr. Trump made the remarks during a speech to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, the last major scheduled stop of a nearly weeklong swing through Asia. Much of his trip has focused on cementing trade agreements and boosting economic ties with U.S. partners in the region.",
      "Trump says U.S. and South Korea deal \"pretty much finalized\"",
      "The president has signed trade and tariff deals with Japan, Malaysia and several other countries during his trip, and after scheduled talks with South Korean officials on Wednesday, he told reporters before a formal state dinner hosted by South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung: \"We reached a deal. We had a great session. It's an honor.\"",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had told reporters ahead of Mr. Trump's visit that he didn't expect a U.S.-South Korea trade agreement to be completely nailed down during the president's trip, but he said he thought it was close.",
      "Mr. Trump, speaking later to the leaders gathered for the dinner, indicated there were still some details to nail down, saying the U.S. and South Korea had \"pretty much finalized a trade deal,\" and adding that the negotiating teams \"came to a conclusion on a lot of very important items.\"",
      "The two countries\u00a0announced\u00a0a framework deal over the summer similar to the one signed earlier in the week with Japan, with 15% tariffs on South Korean goods and investments pledged in the U.S.",
      "An end to the U.S.-China trade war?",
      "But a direct meeting with China's Xi in South Korea on Thursday is the most hotly anticipated part of his trip. The foreign ministry in Beijing confirmed on Wednesday that a sit-down was planned, saying Xi would meet with Mr. Trump in Busan, \"to exchange views on bilateral relations and issues of mutual interest.\"",
      "Officials in Beijing have not yet voiced the same optimism publicly over a looming deal to end the trade war, and the meeting could be tense, as China and the U.S. have clashed for months, imposing reciprocal tariffs and restrictions on the import and export of key items.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to press Xi to loosen a set of tough export restrictions on rare earth elements from China, which are essential for everything from computer chips to aerospace. He had threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese goods starting from Saturday unless Beijing backs off.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday\u00a0that the additional\u00a0100% tariffs\u00a0\u2014 which would boost the total U.S. tariff rate on Chinese imports to 140% \u2014 were \"effectively off the table\" after a two-day meeting with a Chinese negotiator.",
      "The trade war has led China to halt purchases of U.S. soybeans, causing pain for American farmers, though Bessent said Sunday that he\u00a0expects Beijing to end its soybean boycott.",

      "Jurors began deliberating late Tuesday morning in the murder trial for\u00a0former Sangamon County Sheriff's deputy\u00a0Sean Grayson, in the shooting death of Sonya Massey, an unarmed Black woman who had called police for help.",
      "The jury received the case following closing arguments from prosecutors and defense attorneys.",
      "In court on Tuesday, prosecutors held Massey's cooking pot up for the jury and sarcastically said, \"This is the dangerous pot that Sean Grayson was so afraid of.\"",
      "Prosecutors also for the second time showed unedited camera footage in court. Massey's family was visibly emotional and upset, and a juror wiped away tears as she cried while watching the video.",
      "In July 2024, Massey called 911 to report a prowler. Grayson was among the officers who responded.",
      "During their interaction, Massey walked towards a pot of water on the stove. Massey told officers, \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,\" before the officers pulled out their weapons, yelling for her to drop the pot. That's when Grayson shot Massey.",
      "Grayson, who faces three counts of first-degree murder, took the stand on Monday and offered his version of events. When he and his partner arrived at Massey's home in the Springfield area on July 6, 2024, Grayson's body-worn camera was not on.",
      "\"I should have turned it on when I saw the broken windows of the car outside,\" Grayson told jurors.",
      "Grayson said that the broken window, Massey's call for help, and having to wait four minutes for Massey to answer the door made him concerned that someone else could have been in the house.",
      "He also claimed, \"I believed she was possibly under the influence of something,\" and said that she appeared \"scatterbrained.\"",
      "He said he turned his camera on as he began to question her. He testified that Massey had a pot of boiling water on the stove, and told the jury that he was scared of being hit with boiling hot water inside the pot, and when Massey said \"I rebuke you in the name of Jesus,\" he perceived that as a threat and opened fire.",
      "\"I saw the bottom of the pot was turning red, so it seemed very hot,\" he said. \"Then she picked up the pot and walked towards me. \u2026 I wasn't quite sure what she was going to do.\"",
      "Grayson said Massey asked, \"Where are you going?\" and he responded, \"Away from your hot steaming water.\"",
      "\"I took it as a threat,\" he said. \"It raises a lot of concern for me, and I believe she's going to throw the water. \u2026 We were trained to use force that's going to gain compliance.\"",
      "Grayson said he was equipped with a Taser, but testified, \"She was wearing layers and both prongs have to stick in for the Taser to work.\"",
      "Grayson's attorneys during the trial called Massey the aggressor and accused her of escalating the encounter, leaving the former deputy with no other options.",
      "During closing arguments, Grayson's attorneys instructed the jury that this case is not a question of who shot and killed Massey\u2014rather, it's a question of whether or not Grayson was justified to do so under Illinois law. State prosecutors painted a picture of Grayson as a man trying to control the entire situation, but was unable to control himself and his own emotions the night he killed Massey.",
      "Jurors last week heard from Grayson's partner,\u00a0who said he wasn't afraid of Massey\u00a0but said he was afraid of Grayson.",
      "The\u00a0jury was selected for the trial\u00a0last week and is made up of nine women and three men. One juror is Black.",
      "CBS News Chicago legal analyst Irv Miller says the jury will have to decide if he was acting reasonably or unreasonably.",
      "\"The jury would then have to decide if he was acting reasonably in, thinking he was acting in self-defense, or whether or not that belief was unreasonable. That's the difference between being found guilty of potentially first-degree murder and second-degree murder.\u00a0 If the belief was unreasonable, that will be second-degree murder,\" Miller said.",
      "In August,\u00a0Gov. JB Pritzker signed the Sonya Massey Bill, which requires more thorough background checks for officers in the state.",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Oct 2025 14:26:16 -0400",
    "summary": "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" said one mother of two about a looming freeze in food aid.",
    "story": [
      "Roughly 42 million Americans rely on food stamps that arrive every month on their electronic benefit transfer cards. On Nov. 1, that aid is set to abruptly stop amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, potentially leaving households scrambling to figure out how to put food on the table.",
      "People enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, told CBS News they're bracing for some tough financial choices. Kasey McBlais, a 42-year-old single mom who lives in Buckfield, Maine, said she's planning to delay paying her electric and credit card bills to make sure her two children have enough to eat.",
      "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" McBlais, who works for a Maine social services agency and who draws about $600 a month in SNAP benefits, said. \"My children won't go hungry.\"",
      "The suspension of food aid comes as Democratic and Republican lawmakers continue to trade blame over the\u00a0government shutdown, which now stands as the second-longest funding lapse in U.S. history. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds the SNAP program, warned earlier this month that there would be insufficient funding to pay full November benefits if the shutdown continued, prompting local governments to post notices on their websites about the potential interruption in payments.",
      "\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the USDA said in a memo\u00a0posted Sunday on its website. \"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.\"",
      "Democratic lawmakers have asked the USDA to use contingency funds to cover most of next month's SNAP benefits, but an agency memo surfaced on Friday that says \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.\" The document says the money is reserved for such things as helping people in disaster areas.",
      "That means beginning Nov. 1, the government will halt about $8 billion in monthly SNAP payments, cutting off food assistance for the one in eight Americans who are enrolled in the program. Recipients, who include households in every state, typically get about $187 a month on a prepaid card to help cover the cost of groceries.",
      "Unused benefits on SNAP recipients' cards will roll over into November.",
      "\"That's money that's already been appropriated. It's been put on their card,\" Mackenzie Libbey, a staff attorney with Community Legal Services, told CBS News Philadelphia. \"So we definitely do not want people rushing out to try to use up their benefits at the end of October thinking they're not going to be able to buy anything in November.\"",
      "The USDA said it is incumbent on Democrats in Congress to end the government shutdown.",
      "\"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely\" SNAP benefits and other federal food aid, the agency said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Some U.S. states, including Louisiana, Vermont and Virginia, have vowed to continue disbursing SNAP benefits even if the federal government suspends payments. New York on Monday\u00a0pledged $30 million in emergency food assistance, while also recently committing to provide millions more in support for food banks. The USDA memo stipulates that states won't be reimbursed for temporarily providing food aid to residents, raising questions about the viability of that approach.",
      "Other states are taking legal action.",
      "A coalition of 25 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday\u00a0sued the Trump administration, alleging that the suspension of food stamps is unlawful and threatens the health and well-being of millions. The states are asking a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the USDA to provide SNAP benefits in November by tapping into a contingency fund, which is estimated to hold around $5 billion.",
      "\"Where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sharlene Sutton, a 45-year-old single mother of four in Dorchester, Massachusetts, who left her job as a security officer last month to care for one of her children, who has epilepsy, said she relies on the $549 she gets in monthly SNAP benefits to feed her family.",
      "\"I was freaking out because I'm like, 'Oh my god, now I don't have a job,'\" she told CBS News. \"I'm not worried about myself that much. It's about the kids. Like, where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sutton said she's looking for a food bank to help fill the gap if her food aid is cut off. But experts warn that the non-profit organizations alone aren't capable of filling the $8 billion monthly hole left by a looming SNAP suspension.",
      "\"The charitable food system and food banks don't have the resources to replace all those food dollars,\" John Sayles, CEO of Vermont Foodbank in Barre, Vermont, told CBS News.",
      "Already, food banks are getting an influx of calls from SNAP recipients who are worried about the payment freeze, and food shelves could see long lines next month if the shutdown persists, Sayles said.",
      "\"There is no safety net after SNAP other than the food shelf,\" he added.",
      "Albuquerque, New Mexico's Roadrunner Food Bank, which typically serves 83,000 households per week, is \"seeing panic\" among residents due to the SNAP halt, said Katy Anderson, vice president of strategy, partnerships and advocacy at the nonprofit organization.",
      "George Matysik, executive director of the Share Food Program in Philadelphia, has also noticed an uptick in demand. He told CBS News in a text message that some of the pantries the hunger relief nonprofit works with have reported 12-fold increases in new registrations week to week.",
      "Even before this new surge in demand, food banks were already facing pressures because of the growing number of people seeking their services, aggravated this year by\u00a0persistent inflation, and funding constraints. In March, the\u00a0USDA said it was nixing $420 million in funding\u00a0for a program that allows food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.",
      "Broader economic impact",
      "A temporary halt in $8 billion in monthly food aid could also impact local businesses, from grocers to farm stands, said Sayles of Vermont Foodbank. Each $1 in SNAP benefits provides an economic benefit of $1.60, he said, referring to the so-called\u00a0multiplier effect\u00a0in which dollars flowing through the local economy help support spending, jobs and growth.",
      "\"SNAP is the foundation of economic support for a lot of food retailers, like those smaller places in rural areas and the corner store in our cities,\" said Kate Bauer, an associate professor of nutritional services at the University of Michigan. \"So this has far-reaching impacts beyond just the people who get SNAP.\"",
      "SNAP is designed to provide supplemental aid for a family's grocery budget, but some families depend on it as their main source of income to buy food, Bauer noted. For those living paycheck to paycheck, even a short disruption in benefits can have immediate consequences, experts said.",
      "The loss of SNAP funding threatens some of the most vulnerable people in the U.S., with the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities noting that two-thirds of food-stamp recipients are children, seniors or people with disabilities.",
      "For McBlais, the single mom, the issue isn't political. Rather, it's about making sure families can eat in an economy where many are already struggling to afford rent, utilities and basic groceries, she told CBS News.",
      "\"Everybody needs food \u2014 SNAP recipients are Democratic, Republicans and everything in between,\" McBlais said.",

    "summary": "Staff Sgt. Demi Palecek and Capt. Dylan Blaha say they'll defy federal orders regarding Trump's immigration enforcement operation in Chicago.",
    "story": [
      "Chicago \u2014 Two Illinois National Guard members told CBS News they would refuse to obey federal orders to deploy in Chicago as part of President Trump's controversial immigration enforcement mission \u2014 a rare act of open defiance from within the military ranks.",
      "\"It's disheartening to be forced to go against your community members and your neighbors,\" said Staff Sgt. Demi Palecek, a Latina guardswoman and state legislative candidate from Illinois's 13th District. \"It feels illegal. This is not what we signed up to do.\"",
      "Both Palecek and Capt. Dylan Blaha, who is running for Congress in the same district, described growing unease among Guard members after the White House federalized 500 troops \u2013 including members of the Illinois and Texas National Guard \u2013 to secure federal immigration facilities and personnel in the Chicago area.",
      "\"I signed up to defend the American people and protect the Constitution,\" Blaha said. \"When we have somebody in power who's actively dismantling our rights \u2014 free speech, due process, freedom of the press \u2014 it's really hard to be a soldier right now.\"",
      "Refusing a lawful federal order while serving in the National Guard can sometimes result in court-martial, imprisonment, or a felony-level discharge, depending on who issued the order, whether the soldier is under state or federal control and the nature of the disobedience. When contacted by CBS News, the Defense Department declined comment.",
      "Palecek says members of military are \"being used as pawns\"",
      "Asked if she would refuse a direct order to deploy to Chicago, Palecek didn't hesitate. \"Absolutely. I would definitely say no,\" she said. \"I'm not going to go against my community members, my family and my culture. I believe this is the time to be on the right side of history.\"",
      "\"Look at 1930s, 1940s Germany,\" Blaha said. \"There is a point where if you didn't stand up to the Gestapo, are you just actively one of them now?\"",
      "A federal judge on Wednesday delayed the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago indefinitely, until a final ruling is issued or the Supreme Court rules on the matter.",
      "The two guardsmen accused the Trump administration of weaponizing the military against civilians under the guise of public safety. \"They're definitely being used as pawns,\" Palecek said.",
      "Blaha agreed, saying most Guard units \"train to fight and win our nation's wars,\" and they do not assist law enforcement or Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \"We're not trained to assist ICE and help them just be violent in our communities,\" he said, calling it \"shameful.\"",
      "The pair noted that Guard members currently mobilized in Illinois are on 29-day orders \u2014 too short to qualify for full benefits. \"They're not even getting paid right now because of the government shutdown,\" Blaha added. \"Most don't want to be there. They're scared, too.\"",
      "Lt. Col. Brad Leighton, a spokesperson for the Illinois National Guard later clarified that \"the approximately 300 Illinois Army National Guard Soldiers who were federalized in Illinois are on initial 60-day orders,\" allowing those service members to be eligible for health coverage as well as additional allowances to offset the cost of meals and housing.",
      "Fears for immigrant service members",
      "Roughly 200 green card holders serve in the Illinois National Guard \u2013 with 160 legal permanent residents in the state's Army National Guard and 30 in the state's Air National Guard.",
      "\"They're in sheer panic,\" Palecek said. \"They're choosing between standing up for their community or losing everything \u2014 their legal status, their path to citizenship.\"",
      "U.S. federal law generally prohibits undocumented immigrants from enlisting in the U.S. Armed Forces, including the Army National Guard and Air National Guard. But for green card holders, military service can help expedite U.S. citizenship under longstanding federal programs.",
      "Programs like Parole in Place exist to protect family members of service members from deportation and help them adjust status, but participants say applications have been slowed or outright denied in recent months, leaving families in legal limbo.",
      "\"I applied for parole in place,\" Palecek told CBS News. \"And [my application] has not been able to go through.\"",
      "\"Everyone says, 'Why don't they do it the right way?'\" Palecek continued, offering a sentiment often voiced by those condemning illegal immigration. \"But they are doing it the right way,\" Palecek said.",
      "Retribution in their ranks",
      "Both Blaha and Palecek said they've faced retaliation for speaking publicly. Blaha disclosed that his security clearance was suspended by the Defense Department after posting a viral video urging soldiers to disobey unlawful orders. \"They twisted my words,\" he said. \"I have about 30 days in order to provide them with a written response.\"",
      "Retribution, Palecek added, is \"real.\" She's received death threats since denouncing the deployments and launching her political campaign. \"It weighs on you mentally after a while,\" she said.",
      "Still, both say silence is not an option. \"We were trained to stand up for what we believe in and stand up for the American people,\" Blaha said.",
      "\"Today it's Chicago. Tomorrow it could be somewhere else.\"",
      "Palecek, who once served in active duty, said the current mission has made her ashamed of her uniform. \"I've been truly proud of what I've been able to do in the military,\" she said. \"And right now I hate saying I'm in the military. It's embarrassing.\"",
      "Both see a dangerous precedent in deploying federal troops to U.S. cities. \"It's a slow normalization of using the military in American cities,\" Blaha said. \"If he declares martial law enough times, people will start to think it's OK.\"",
      "A majority of Americans oppose Mr. Trump's deployment of the National Guard to U.S. cities as part of his crime crackdown, according to a September CBS News poll. But still, roughly 42% of Americans polled expressed support for sending members of the National Guard to cities nationwide.",
      "A CBS News analysis of FBI and Chicago Police Department data from 2024 found Chicago's violent crime is down double-digit percentage points so far in 2025 compared to 2024. Among American cities with populations of 100,000 or more, Chicago ranks 80th overall for violent crime per capita.",
      "When asked to describe what America looks like with a federalized National Guard presence nationwide, Blaha replied: \"Unsafe.\" Palecek offered: \"Disgusting.\"",

      "An expedition to try to locate Amelia Earhart's plane on a remote island in the Pacific has been delayed until next year, Purdue University said Monday.",
      "A team of researchers was planning to travel to Nikumaroro Island in early November to determine whether something known as the Taraia Object \u2014 a visual anomaly seen in satellite and other imagery \u2014 is Earhart's aircraft. They are now awaiting additional clearances from local authorities as they work through the permit approvals, and cannot go later this year due to the start of cyclone season, according to a news release.",
      "\"We've overcome other challenges to this project over the past four years, and we will get past this one, too,\" Richard Pettigrew, executive director of the Archaeological Legacy Institute, said in the release. \"Because of the compelling evidence we have in front of us, we have to go to Nikumaroro and get a close look at the Taraia Object. Rest assured that we will do just that, so stay tuned! We will have a revised project schedule worked out soon.\"",
      "The underwater object has been visible in photos dating back to 1938, the year after Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan\u00a0disappeared\u00a0while Earhart \u2014 flying a Lockheed 10-E Electra \u2014 tried to become the first female aviator to circle the world.",
      "Researchers previously said there is \"very strong\" evidence that the object, which is in a lagoon on Nikumaroro, a small island in Kiribati about halfway between Australia and Hawaii, is the iconic aviator's plane. Some, however, have expressed skepticism. \"We've looked there in that spot, and there's nothing there,\" Ric Gillespie, executive director of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, told NBC News in July.",
      "A team of researchers from Purdue and the Archaeological Legacy Institute plan to take photos and videos of the site, then use magnetometers and sonar devices to scan the area. The item will then be dredged and lifted from the water so researchers can attempt to identify it.",
      "Expedition member Steve Schultz, who is Purdue University's senior vice president and general counsel, said \"maritime expeditions require thorough preparation and numerous clearances.\"",
      "\"We have gained valuable insights throughout this process and are very confident and resolved to continue this quest with a planned 2026 departure,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "A nonprofit organization in Alaska has rescued at least 180 dogs \u2014 and a turtle \u2014 after flooding devastated several remote villages in Alaska earlier this month.",
      "Hundreds of people were airlifted out of the villages\u00a0that were hit by high surf and strong winds from the remnants of Typhoon Halong, but many dogs had to be left behind. The villages, most on the western coast of Alaska, have no road access, which means everything needs to flown in and out, including pets.",
      "That has been the biggest challenge for Bethel Friends of Canines, or BFK9, as the organization continues rescues, said Jenna Stewart, the nonprofit's director of development. BFK9, which started as an animal rescue in 2011, is based in Bethel, Alaska, a hub for the villages in the region.",
      "\"We are thankful to have so many pilots and airlines that help us,\" Stewart said in an email. \"It is hard for people outside of Alaska, and even some in Alaska, to fathom not being able to just drive and save these dogs.\"",
      "BFK9, which typically takes in about 500 animals a year, has also gotten help from some people who stayed behind. In Kipnuk, one of the hard-hit villages, a group of teachers and others rounded up dogs to transfer to the rescuers, who arrived with airline kennels.",
      "\"The first dogs they sent in to us arrived in a plastic tote and a couple puppies in a Spiderman backpack,\" Stewart said. \"They had nothing else to hold these dogs, but knew they had to get out of the Village and to safety with BFK9.\"",
      "While nearly all the rescues are of dogs, the group also rescued its first turtle \u2014 a red-eared slider turtle that was a classroom pet in one of the villages.",
      "\"The turtle is now in Bethel with a local veterinarian,\" Stewart said.",
      "The group will take in cats as well, but there aren't many in rural Alaska, Steward said. They usually only get three to five cats a year, she said.",
      "After BFK9 gets the dogs to Bethel, they work to reunite them with their families.",
      "\"These Villages are pretty small, which means usually everyone knows everyone's dog,\" Stewart said.",
      "If a dog's owner is unknown, the group posts pictures on its Facebook page. Foster homes are also available if owners can't take their dogs right away.",
      "As of Friday, BFK9 was still getting information about more dogs that needed rescuing. \"A lot of these dogs left out there are the scared ones. They are so scared, and so confused and are hiding,\" Stewart said.",
      "\"This ordeal is far from over,\" she said.",
      "BFK9 has partnered with other groups, including the Humane World of Animals, Best Friends Animal Rescue and the August Fund in Anchorage, to help rescue and hold the dogs while they wait to be reunited.",
      "The nonprofit has received donations and support from people across Alaska and around the country.",
      "\"Bethel Friends of Canines has an incredible Village. We are doing great things, but we couldn't do it without all the people helping us,\" Stewart said.",

On Tuesday, it\u00a0pummeled Jamaica as one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record with maximum sustained winds of 185 mph.",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Melissa's core was about 110 miles south-southeast of the central Bahamas and about 955 miles southwest of Bermuda, according to the hurricane center. It had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph, making it a Category 2 storm, and was moving northeast at about 15 mph.",
      "It was expected to move over the southeast or central Bahamas Wednesday evening and pass near Bermuda late Thursday, the hurricane center said.",
      "Officials across the parts of the Caribbean already hit by Melissa were assessing the storm's impacts. At least 23 people have died in Haiti and 13 are missing, the country's Civil Protection Agency said in a statement. Eight deaths were reported in Jamaica, and one in the Dominican Republic.",
      "Jamaica rushes to assess the damage",
      "In Jamaica, more than 25,000 people were packed into shelters Wednesday and more streamed in throughout the day after the storm ripped roofs off their homes and left them temporarily homeless. Dana Morris Dixon, Jamaica's education minister, said 77% of the island was without power.",
      "Outages complicated assessing the damage because of \"a total communication blackout\" in areas, Richard Thompson, acting director-general of Jamaica's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, told the Nationwide News Network radio station.",
      "Prime Minister Andrew Holness said in a statement that teams are working to rescue people and bring relief where it's needed the most.",
      "\"Recovery will take time, but the government is fully mobilized,\" he said. \"Relief supplies are being prepared, and we are doing everything possible to restore normalcy quickly.\"",
      "Officials in Black River, Jamaica, a coastal town of approximately 5,000 people in the southwestern part of the island, pleaded for aid at a news conference Wednesday.",
      "\"Catastrophic is a mild term based on what we are observing,\" Mayor Richard Solomon said.",
      "Solomon said the local rescue infrastructure had been demolished by the storm. The hospital, police units and emergency services were inundated by floods and unable to conduct emergency operations. The storm also destroyed the facility where relief supplies were being stored.",
      "In southwest Jamaica, David Muschette, 84, sat among the rubble of his roofless house. He said he lost everything as he pointed to his wet clothes and furniture strewn across the grass while part of his roof partially blocked the road.",

      "Cuba rides out the storm",
      "People in the eastern Cuban province of Santiago de Cuba began clearing debris around the collapsed walls of their homes on Wednesday after Melissa made landfall in the region hours earlier.",

      "Local media showed images of the Juan Bruno Zayas Clinical Hospital with severe damage: glass scattered across the floor, waiting rooms in ruins and masonry walls crumpled on the ground.",
      "\"It has been a very complex early morning,\" President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel wrote on X. \"As soon as conditions allow, we will begin the recovery. We are ready.\"",
      "The hurricane could worsen Cuba's severe economic crisis, which has already led to prolonged power blackouts along with fuel and food shortages.",

      "Moving toward the Bahamas",

    "summary": "10 days after the brazen robbery of the Louvre Museum in Paris, a prosecutor says there's no sign of the missing jewels, and still only 2 people in custody.",
    "story": [
      "The Paris prosecutor said Wednesday that none of the French crown jewels stolen in the brazen daytime robbery of the landmark Louvre Museum had been located 10 days after the heist, and that the only two men detained so far in connection with the crime had partially admitted to a role in the theft.",
      "\"I want to remain hopeful that (the jewels) will be found and they can be brought back to the Louvre, and more broadly to the nation,\" Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau told reporters.",
      "She said the two suspects in custody were to be charged with theft and criminal conspiracy after \"partially admitting to the charges.\"",
      "The jewels date back hundreds of years and are considered national treasures with an estimated value of some $102 million. Experts have told CBS News the elaborate pieces of jewelry may have already been broken down into their component parts, greatly diminishing their value, and they may never be found.",
      "At least four people in total were seen on security camera video taking part in the robbery on Oct. 19, and Beccuau said at a news conference in the French capital on Wednesday afternoon that her office could not rule out the culprits being part of a larger criminal gang.",
      "Dozens of detectives have been on the trail of the four thieves, who used a cherry-picker lift and cutting gear to break into a first-floor gallery at the world-renowned museum and then fled with the jewels.",
      "But few details have emerged so far about how investigators have managed to track down the culprits, some of whom wore balaclavas and high-visibility vests.",
      "The two men who were arrested Saturday in connection with the heist could be held only until Wednesday evening without being formally charged under French judicial rules, and Beccuau said they would be brought before magistrates with a view to \"charging them with organized theft, which carries a 15-year prison sentence,\" along with criminal conspiracy, punishable by 10 years.",
      "A source close to the case this weekend said the men in their 30s were known to the police for committing thefts, and Beccuau said they were believed to be the ones who actually broke into the museum gallery, based in part on DNA evidence.",
      "The two men hailed from Seine-Saint-Denis, a region just outside Paris, and one was arrested as he was about to board a plane for Algeria, the source said, requesting anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.",
      "After media reports of the detentions, Beccuau said authorities had \"carried out arrests on Saturday evening,\" and confirmed that \"one of the men arrested was about to leave the country\" from the capital's Charles de Gaulle airport.",

    "summary": "For decades, Bill Gates has warned of climate disaster \u2014 but his tone meaningfully shifted as he cautioned against taking a \"doomsday view\" on the planet's future.",
    "story": [
      "For decades, Bill Gates has warned of climate disaster \u2014 but his tone meaningfully shifted Tuesday as the billionaire Microsoft co-founder cautioned against taking a \"doomsday view\" on the planet's future.",
      "In a memo posted online, Gates wrote that while climate change is still a major problem that needs to be solved, \"People will be able to live and thrive on Earth for the foreseeable future.\" Gates, who has invested billions developing green technologies to cut greenhouse gases, says doomsday climate scenarios over-emphasize cutting emissions while \"diverting resources from the most effective things we should be doing to improve life in a warming world.\"",
      "The lengthy memo essentially argued that we should continue to innovate and back climate breakthroughs but not at the expense of funding for global health or development \u2014 \"programs that help people stay resilient in the face of climate change.\" He argued for putting \"human welfare at the center of our climate strategies,\" including improving health and agriculture in the world's poorest countries.",
      "In years past, Gates, the author of \"How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,\" struck a more alarmist tone.",
      "In an interview with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell in 2021, he warned: \"If we don't reduce emissions, then the death toll would be even worse near the equator, and the unrest would be global in nature.\" He added, \"You've got to start work now to avoid those terrible consequences much later.\"",
      "Gates described climate change as the most formidable challenge humanity has ever faced. He told Anderson Cooper in a \"60 Minutes\" interview that same year that climate change is \"way greater than the pandemic. And it needs a level of cooperation that would be unprecedented.\"",
      "Gates has personally invested over $2 billion in green technology and launched Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a firm formed with other billionaires to fund research and technology aimed at finding solutions to reduce carbon emissions.",
      "Gates' memo drew a mixed response. Some agreed that climate change isn't the greatest threat to humanity, while others slammed the memo for understating the consequences of climate change.",
      "Dr. Katharine Hayhoe, climate scientist and professor at Texas Tech University, says the problem of climate change cannot be separated from the other major threats that humanity faces because it contributes to them, including in the developing world.",
      "\"Just give me a list of people's top 10 things to worry about, and I can tell you how climate change is making every single one of those top 10 things worse,\" she said.",
      "Dr. Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources, called the memo a \"breathtaking misread\" that lacks an understanding of what it would mean for the world to experience 2 or 3 degrees Celsius of warming.",
      "\"I think it grossly misrepresents the magnitude of the consequences we're going to see, ironically, for the same people the memo claims to be looking out for \u2014 the global poor.\"",
      "Timothy Gallaudet, a retired Rear Admiral who oversaw weather forecasting for the U.S. Navy, questions some climate assessments, including doomsday scenarios.",
      "\"Ultimately, there's real impacts, but so much is reported erroneously,\" he said. \"There's so much misinformation in the climate space now, it's a real shame.\"",
      "Gallaudet believes moving away from \"climate doomsday alarmism\" and focusing on adaptation and technological improvements to forecasting is beneficial, more realistic, and practical.",
      "Ted Nordhaus is founder and executive director of global research center Breakthrough Institute (not to be confused with Gates' Breakthrough Energy). He said that climate change is a problem, but it doesn't pose the existential threat that some have cautioned.",
      "In a column for The Free Press (which, like CBS News, is owned by Paramount Skydance), Nordhaus wrote that climate tipping points like the melting of ice sheets and the deforestation of the Amazon \"don't add up to catastrophic outcomes for humanity.\"",
      "Per Nordhaus, scientific evidence doesn't suggest climate change is the greatest threat facing humanity, and it shouldn't take top consideration when the world has already proven it can adapt to a warming atmosphere.",
      "\"We've always adapted, that's why we have humans living across huge variances in climatic zones,\" he told CBS News. \"I think the point of Gates' letter is we're actually making a fair amount of progress here to reduce emissions and continuing to be more resilient.\"",
      "With the global climate summit known as COP30 coming up next month in Brazil, Gates urged world leaders, business and activists to chart a new path forward.",
      "\"This is a chance to refocus on the metric that should count even more than emissions and temperature change: improving lives,\" he wrote.",

      "Neville was killed in action a year later. Harley was wounded twice but survived the war, dying in Adelaide in 1934 of a cancer his family says was caused by him being gassed by the Germans in the trenches.",
      "Neville requested the bottle's finder deliver his letter to his mother Robertina Neville at Wilkawatt, now a virtual ghost town in South Australia. Harley, whose mother was dead by 1916, was happy for the finder to keep his note.",

      "Neville wrote that he and his comrades were, \"Somewhere at Sea.\" Harley wrote that they were, \"Somewhere in the Bight,\" referring to the Great Australian Bight. That's an enormous open bay that begins east of Adelaide and extends to Esperance on the western edge.",

      "Deb Brown suspects the bottle didn't travel far. It likely spent more than a century ashore buried in the sand dunes. Extensive erosion of the dunes caused by huge swells along Wharton Beach in recent months probably dislodged it.",
      "The paper was wet, but the writing remained legible. Because of that, Deb Brown was able to notify both soldiers' relatives of the find.",
      "The bottle \"is in pristine condition. It doesn't have any growth of any barnacles on it. I believe that if it had been at sea or if it had been exposed for that long, the paper would've disintegrated from the sun. We wouldn't have been able to read it,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Trump is in South Korea, the final stop of his Asia tour, where he says he expects to nail down a \"good deal for both\" China and the U.S. with Xi Jinping.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Wednesday in South Korea that he hoped to emerge from a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping with a U.S.-China trade deal in hand.",
      "\"We're going to be, I hope, making a deal. I think we're going to have a deal. I think it will be a good deal for both,\" the president said. \"The world is watching, and I think we'll have something that's very exciting for everybody.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made the remarks during a speech to the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Gyeongju, South Korea, the last major scheduled stop of a nearly weeklong swing through Asia. Much of his trip has focused on cementing trade agreements and boosting economic ties with U.S. partners in the region.",
      "Trump says U.S. and South Korea deal \"pretty much finalized\"",
      "The president has signed trade and tariff deals with Japan, Malaysia and several other countries during his trip, and after scheduled talks with South Korean officials on Wednesday, he told reporters before a formal state dinner hosted by South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung: \"We reached a deal. We had a great session. It's an honor.\"",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had told reporters ahead of Mr. Trump's visit that he didn't expect a U.S.-South Korea trade agreement to be completely nailed down during the president's trip, but he said he thought it was close.",
      "Mr. Trump, speaking later to the leaders gathered for the dinner, indicated there were still some details to nail down, saying the U.S. and South Korea had \"pretty much finalized a trade deal,\" and adding that the negotiating teams \"came to a conclusion on a lot of very important items.\"",
      "The two countries\u00a0announced\u00a0a framework deal over the summer similar to the one signed earlier in the week with Japan, with 15% tariffs on South Korean goods and investments pledged in the U.S.",
      "An end to the U.S.-China trade war?",
      "But a direct meeting with China's Xi in South Korea on Thursday is the most hotly anticipated part of his trip. The foreign ministry in Beijing confirmed on Wednesday that a sit-down was planned, saying Xi would meet with Mr. Trump in Busan, \"to exchange views on bilateral relations and issues of mutual interest.\"",
      "Officials in Beijing have not yet voiced the same optimism publicly over a looming deal to end the trade war, and the meeting could be tense, as China and the U.S. have clashed for months, imposing reciprocal tariffs and restrictions on the import and export of key items.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to press Xi to loosen a set of tough export restrictions on rare earth elements from China, which are essential for everything from computer chips to aerospace. He had threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese goods starting from Saturday unless Beijing backs off.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday\u00a0that the additional\u00a0100% tariffs\u00a0\u2014 which would boost the total U.S. tariff rate on Chinese imports to 140% \u2014 were \"effectively off the table\" after a two-day meeting with a Chinese negotiator.",
      "The trade war has led China to halt purchases of U.S. soybeans, causing pain for American farmers, though Bessent said Sunday that he\u00a0expects Beijing to end its soybean boycott.",
      "Mr. Trump also\u00a0needs Chinese approval\u00a0for a deal to transfer TikTok's U.S. operations from Beijing-based parent company ByteDance.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0predicted\u00a0earlier this week that the two leaders will reach an agreement by the end of his trip, saying he has \"a lot of respect for President Xi\" and, \"I think we're going to come away with a deal.\"",
      "Nicholas Burns, a Biden-era U.S. ambassador to China, told CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes that Wednesday's meeting is \"very important,\" calling the trade war a \"test of wills\" between the world's two biggest economies.",
      "\"China is the most important competitor, adversary of the United States worldwide now. It will be in the future,\" Burns said. \"So the stakes are high, because we have lots of issues where we are competing with China.\"",
      "Trump addresses U.S. partners in Asia",
      "The president also used his speech at the APEC event to tout the other trade deals he's inked in Asia. He highlighted his plans to partner with other countries on key industries including shipbuilding, semiconductors and critical minerals, and framed the trade negotiations as an extension of the U.S. defense alliances in the region, telling audience members that \"economic security is national security.\"",
      "APEC is a regional economic group with 21 member countries around the Pacific Rim, including China, Mexico, Russia, Singapore, South Korea and Vietnam. Promoting free trade is a major component of the forum, despite Mr. Trump's push for higher tariffs on many member countries, a strategy that the president argues is necessary to rebalance trade.",
      "Critics warn his strategy could lead to higher inflation and more sluggish economic growth.",
      "The president is looking to cinch a trade agreement with South Korea, the United States' sixth-largest trading partner. Over the summer, Mr. Trump announced a framework deal that involves the U.S. charging 15% tariffs on South Korean goods, while South Korea invests billions in U.S. industry and opens its market to American cars. Bessent told reporters the South Korea deal is unlikely to be resolved this week, but it's close.",
      "During his APEC remarks, Mr. Trump called South Korea \"a cherished American friend and a close ally.\" He said he's looking to work with the country on investments in U.S. shipbuilding.",
      "Before leaving his previous stop in Japan, Mr. Trump signed a trade deal\u00a0on Tuesday with new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, cementing 15% tariffs on imported Japanese goods, lower than the 25% initially threatened by the president. Japan also pledged $550 billion in investments in U.S. industry.",
      "The president announced trade framework agreements with Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand earlier in the trip.",
      "He's also expected to meet at some point with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, as the microchip giant\u00a0partners\u00a0with the Department of Energy to build an artificial intelligence supercomputer and presses for\u00a0more access\u00a0to China's market.",
      "No meeting planned with Kim Jong Un",
      "Mr. Trump said repeatedly that he would be open to meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his trip, though no such meeting has been planned.",
      "The president said Wednesday that the timing couldn't be worked out for a sit-down with Kim. North Korea's government has made no comment on Mr. Trump's suggestions of another face-to-face meeting between the leaders.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, he became the\u00a0first sitting president to visit North Korea, a trip that happened after\u00a0he put an invitation to Kim\u00a0on social media.",
      "Gyeongju, where Mr. Trump was for the APEC summit, is in southeast South Korea, on the opposite side of the country as the capital Seoul, and far from the border with North Korea. The two Koreas have remained technically at war since 1953, when the Korean War was halted by an armistice rather than a full treaty.",

    "story": [
      "Hurricane Melissa made landfall Tuesday in Jamaica as a\u00a0fearsome Category 5 storm, bringing heavy floodwaters across the country's southwest and catastrophic winds that tore roofs off buildings.",
      "The most powerful hurricane to lash the island since record-keeping began 174 years ago and one of the strongest Atlantic storms ever recorded, Melissa struck Jamaica with sustained winds of 185 mph, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said.",
      "Melissa weakened somewhat after landfall, with the hurricane center saying in its latest update Tuesday night that winds were at 130 mph, a Category 4 speed. The storm was restrengthening as it approached eastern Cuba, the NHC said, and was expected to make landfall there as an extremely dangerous major hurricane early Wednesday morning.",
      "The storm initially came ashore Tuesday near New Hope, on the southwestern coast of Jamaica, and was traveling northeast at 9 mph, the center said. Landslides, fallen trees and numerous power outages were already being reported earlier Tuesday as the hurricane made its approach, with officials cautioning that the damage assessment will be slow.",
      "More than 530,000 Jamaicans were without power as of Tuesday evening, according to Minister of Local Government Desmond McKenzie. A section of the roof of Black River Hospital in southwestern Jamaica was damaged by the storm, and the hospital evacuated 75 patients, McKenzie said during a news conference.",
      "Melissa was expected to continue its path over Jamaica and be over southeastern Cuba early Wednesday morning, the NHC said. It could then reach the southeastern or central Bahamas later on Wednesday, still as a hurricane.",
      "\"For Jamaica, it will be the storm of the century for sure,\" World Meteorological Organization tropical cyclone specialist Anne-Claire Fontan said. She told reporters in Geneva that she expects catastrophic damage on the island, according to the Reuters news service.",
      "Melissa could affect 1.5 million people in Jamaica, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies official Necephor Mghendi said in Geneva, warning there will be a \"massive impact,\" French news agency AFP reported.",
      "Hours before the storm, the Jamaican government said it had done all it could to prepare as it, too, warned of catastrophic damage.",
      "\"There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5,\" Prime Minister Andrew Holness said. \"The question now is the speed of recovery. That's the challenge.\"",
      "Melissa is forecast to bring 15 to 30 inches of rain to areas of Jamaica and 6 to 12 inches to southern Hispaniola (the island split into Haiti and the Dominican Republic) through Wednesday, with a total of 40 inches possible in some places. \"Catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides are likely,\" the hurricane center warned.",
      "\"We will get through it together,\" said Evan Thompson, principal director at Jamaica's meteorological service.",
      "For eastern Cuba, total rainfall could reach 10 to 20 inches, with as much as 25 inches in some spots through Wednesday, which could result in \"life-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding with numerous landslides,\" the hurricane center said.",
      "And total rainfall of 5 to 10 inches is expected into Wednesday in the southeastern Bahamas, resulting in areas of flash flooding.",
      "A life-threatening storm surge of up to 13 feet is expected across southern Jamaica, with officials concerned about the impact on some hospitals along the coastline.",
      "Health Minister Christopher Tufton said some patients were relocated from the ground floor to the second floor, \"and [we] hope that will suffice for any surge that will take place.\"",
      "The storm was already blamed for seven deaths in the Caribbean, including three in Jamaica, three in Haiti and one in the Dominican Republic, where another person was missing.",
      "Colin Bogle, a Mercy Corps adviser based near Kingston, said most families are sheltering in place despite the government ordering evacuations in flood-prone communities.",
      "\"Many have never experienced anything like this before, and the uncertainty is frightening,\" he said. \"There is profound fear of losing homes and livelihoods, of injury, and of displacement.\"",
      "Matthew Samuda, Jamaica's water and environment minister, said he had more than 50 generators available to deploy after the storm, but warned people to set aside clean water and use it sparingly.",
      "\"Every drop will count,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The order from Netanyahu follows heightened tensions after Hamas returned a set of remains that Israel said belonged to a hostage recovered earlier in the war.",
    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday he has ordered the army to immediately carry out \"powerful strikes\" in Gaza, and Hamas responded by saying it would delay handing over the body of a hostage, putting new pressure on the tenuous U.S.-brokered ceasefire.",
      "Associated Press reporters and witnesses heard tank fire and saw explosions in various parts of Gaza, including in Gaza City and Deir al-Balah.",
      "The order from Netanyahu follows heightened tensions, as Israel reported Hamas firing on its forces in southern Gaza and after Hamas returned a set of remains that Israel said belonged to a hostage recovered earlier in the war.",
      "\"This constitutes a clear violation of the\u00a0[Gaza peace] agreement\" by Hamas, Netanyahu's office said, adding that the prime minister would meet with the heads of Israel's defense establishment, \"during which Israel's steps in response to the violations will be discussed.\"",
      "In a sign of the fragility of the ceasefire, Israeli troops were shot at in the southern city of Rafah on Tuesday and returned fire, according to an Israeli military official who spoke on condition of anonymity because there hasn't been an official announcement yet.",
      "Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to South Korea, President Trump addressed the clashes, saying \"nothing's going to jeopardize\" the ceasefire.",
      "Mr. Trump said Hamas is a \"very small part of peace in the Middle East\" and that \"if they're not good, they're going to be terminated. Their lives will be terminated. and they understand that.\"",
      "\"Nobody knows what happened to the Israeli soldier, but they say it was sniper fire, and [the Israeli response] was retribution for that, and I think they have a right to do that,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "There are still 13 bodies of hostages in Gaza. Hamas said Tuesday it had recovered the body of a hostage, but after Netanyahu announced the plans to strike Gaza, Hamas said in a statement it would delay the handover.",
      "An Associated Press videographer in Khan Younis witnessed what appeared to be a white body bag being carried out from a tunnel by several men, including some masked militants, and then transported into an ambulance. It was not immediately clear what was in the bag.",
      "The slow return of hostages' bodies is posing a challenge to implementing the next stages of the ceasefire, which will address even knottier issues, such as the disarmament of Hamas, the deployment of an international security force in Gaza and deciding who will govern the territory.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces accused Hamas Tuesday of \"attempting to create a false impression of efforts to locate the bodies, while in fact holding deceased hostages whose remains it refuses to release as required by the agreement.\"",
      "The IDF said its drones had recorded Hamas operatives \"removing body remains from a structure that had been prepared in advance and burying them nearby\" on Monday, and then staging \"a false display of discovering a deceased hostage's body.\"",
      "Hamas has said it is struggling to locate the bodies amid the vast destruction in Gaza, while Israel has accused the militant group of purposely delaying their return. Over the weekend, Egypt deployed a team of experts and heavy equipment to help search for the bodies of the remaining hostages. That work continued Tuesday in Khan Younis and Nuseirat.",
      "Israeli hostage negotiator and peace campaigner Gershon Baskin told CBS News earlier this month that it was \"very likely that there might be Israeli bodies underneath the rubble\" in Gaza, where the Hamas-run government estimates that at least 90% of the\u00a0buildings have been damaged or destroyed.",
      "This is the second time since the ceasefire began on Oct. 10 that remains turned over by Hamas have been problematic. Israel said one of the bodies Hamas released in the first week of the ceasefire belonged to an unidentified Palestinian.",
      "During a previous ceasefire in February 2025, Hamas said it handed over the bodies of three hostages, Shiri Bibas and her two sons, but testing showed that one of the bodies returned was identified as a Palestinian woman. Shiri Bibas' body was returned a day later.",
      "The remains returned overnight have been identified as belonging to Ofir Tzarfati, Netanyahu's office said.",
      "Tzarfati was kidnapped from the Nova music festival in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel that started the war. In all, the militants killed some 1,200 people that day, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostages.",
      "Tzarfati was killed in captivity and his body was retrieved by Israeli troops in November 2023. In March 2024, his family received additional remains for burial.",
      "Tzarfati's family said in a statement that this is the third time \"we have been forced to open Ofir's grave and rebury our son.\"",
      "In exchange for 15 dead hostages returned from Gaza since the ceasefire began, Israel has handed back to Gaza 195 Palestinian bodies. The last 20 living hostages were returned to Israel at the start of the ceasefire, and in exchange, Israel freed roughly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, Israeli authorities said they had killed three Palestinian militants during an operation in the northern part of the occupied West Bank, the latest action in Israel's stepped-up military activity in the territory since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack.",
      "Israeli police said the three men were shot as they came out of a cave near Jenin, a town in the northern West Bank known as a militant stronghold. The Israeli military said in a statement that the militants \"took part in terror activity in Jenin,\" but gave no further details.",
      "Two militants were shot and killed in the initial volley of gunfire. The third, who was wounded, was killed shortly after, according to the Israeli military.",
      "An earlier statement said the Israeli military carried out an airstrike shortly afterward to destroy the cave. The army confirmed an airstrike in the area but gave no further details.",
      "Hamas condemned the Jenin strike and later identified two of the three men as militants with Hamas' Qassam Brigades. The third man was referred to as a \"comrade,\" but no additional details about him were given.",
      "Israel says its operations have cracked down on militants in the West Bank. But Palestinians and human rights groups say scores of uninvolved civilians have also been among the dead, while tens of thousands of people have been displaced from their homes.",
      "Over 68,500 Palestinians have died in the two-year war in Gaza, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count. The ministry maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts. Israel has disputed them without providing its own toll.",

      "The four vessels were hit in three different strikes, Hegseth said. The strikes bring the total death toll in President Trump's campaign against alleged traffickers in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific to more than 50.",
      "\"The four vessels were known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics,\" Hegseth wrote. \"Eight male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessels during the first strike. Four male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the second strike. Three male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the third strike. A total of 14 narco-terrorists were killed during the three strikes, with one survivor. All strikes were in international waters with no U.S. forces harmed.\"",
      "He added: \"These narco-terrorists have killed more Americans than Al-Qaeda, and they will be treated the same. We will track them, we will network them, and then, we will hunt and kill them.\"",
      "Hegseth said U.S. military personnel immediately began search and rescue operations for the survivor, and Mexican authorities assumed responsibility for coordinating the rescue. It's not clear what happened to the survivor from there.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum confirmed at a Tuesday morning news conference that the strike was in international waters and the Mexican Navy rescued one person.",
      "In a statement, the Mexican Navy confirmed it was \"conducting a maritime search and rescue operation 400 miles southwest of Acapulco\" at the request of the U.S. Coast Guard.",
      "Mr. Trump, currently on a multiday trip in Asia, has said his administration will provide information about the strikes to Congress, but he won't seek a declaration of war.",
      "\"I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. OK? We're going to kill them. You know? They're going to be like, dead,\" he said last week.",

      "During the flight to Tokyo, Mr. Trump came back to the press cabin on Air Force One, along with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.

    "summary": "The Israeli prime minister's office says he'll convene generals to discuss \"a clear violation\" of the U.S.-brokered peace deal by Hamas, and Israel's response.",
    "story": [
      "Israel's government said Tuesday that a set of partial hostage remains returned by Hamas the previous day belonged to a deceased hostage recovered by the military around two years ago, not one of those whose remains are still missing in Gaza. The prime minister's office called it a violation of the U.S.-brokered peace deal, and said it was considering its response.",
      "\"After completing the identification process this morning, it was found that last night remains belonging to the fallen hostage Ofir Tzarfati, who had been returned from the Gaza Strip in a military operation about two years ago, were returned,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said.",
      "\"This constitutes a clear violation of the [Gaza peace] agreement\" by Hamas, Netanyahu's office said, adding that the prime minister would meet with the heads of Israel's defense establishment, \"during which Israel's steps in response to the violations will be discussed.\"",
      "Israeli media reported the meeting between Netanyahu and his top security chiefs had concluded without any firm decisions taken about next steps. Veteran journalist Barak Ravid, with Israel's Channel 12, said Netanyahu had told his senior aides that any response would have to be discussed with the Trump administration.",
      "An Israeli group campaigning for the release of hostages held in Gaza urged authorities to \"act decisively\" against Hamas, accusing the U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist group of violating the peace deal brokered by President Trump by returning only the partial remains of the previously recovered hostage, Tzarfati, rather than one of the 13 whose bodies remain in Gaza.",
      "\"In light of Hamas' severe breach of the agreement last night ... the Israeli government cannot and must not ignore this, and must act decisively against these violations,\" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents many of the hostage families, said in a statement.",
      "The forum has urged Israel's leaders to declare Hamas in breach of the peace deal since it started handing over the remains of 28 deceased hostages that had been held in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Later Tuesday the Israel Defense Forces accused Hamas of \"attempting to create a false impression of efforts to locate the bodies, while in fact holding deceased hostages whose remains it refuses to release as required by the agreement.\"",
      "The IDF said its drones had recorded Hamas operatives \"removing body remains from a structure that had been prepared in advance and burying them nearby\" on Monday, and then staging \"a false display of discovering a deceased hostage's body.\"",
      "The IDF did not identify the remains involved in the incident, but the family of Tzarfati released a statement saying they were his.",
      "In a statement shared by the hostage families forum, the Tzarfati family said Hamas had inflicted a deception \"upon our family as we try to heal.\"",
      "\"This morning we were shown video footage of our beloved son's remains being removed, buried, and handed over to the Red Cross \u2014 an abhorrent manipulation designed to sabotage the deal and abandon the effort to bring all the hostages home,\" the family was quoted as saying.",
      "Hamas did not have an immediate response to that allegation, but it has said it needs more time, assistance and heavy equipment to locate and recover the remaining 13 bodies still in the Palestinian territory, and that work has ramped up in recent days, with Egypt sending a team to assist and help coordinate, and the Red Cross confirming to CBS News on Monday that its staff were accompanying recovery teams on the ground.",
      "President Trump warned on Saturday that he was \"watching very closely\" to ensure that Hamas returned more bodies within 48 hours.",
      "\"Some of the bodies are hard to reach, but others they can return now and, for some reason, they are not,\" he wrote on his Truth Social network.",
      "Speaking with the Al Jazeera network on Tuesday, Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said the group was communicating all logistical details about its effort to locate and retrieve hostage remains with a joint operations room established in Cairo. He said Hamas was updating the mediators on developments regularly and he accused Israel of obstructing the efforts by not allowing sufficient heavy equipment into Gaza to find and recover remains.",
      "Israel has permitted some digging machines into Gaza, and Al Jazeera aired live video on Tuesday that appeared to show a Hamas member emerging from a newly-cleared entrance to a tunnel in the southern city of Khan Younis holding several fingers up, possibly indicating that additional remains had been found.",
      "There was no immediate word from Hamas about the discovery of any additional bodies.",
      "\"Hamas is fully and completely committed to the ceasefire agreement on the Gaza Strip, which includes, among other things, the handover of Israeli captives \u2014 alive and dead,\" Qassem told Al Jazeera. \"Over the past period we have worked to hand over whatever remains of the captives' bodies are available. Now the occupation threatens and vows retaliation. It knows perfectly well that the obstacles preventing the retrieval of more bodies are caused by the occupation itself.\"",
      "He said Israel's two-year bombardment had \"destroyed the Gaza Strip and altered the landmarks of cities, streets and roads \u2014 all the markers the resistance [Hamas] could use to locate the remaining bodies,\" and accused Israel of using the incomplete handover of remains \"as a pretext to sustain its war\" in Gaza.",
      "In its statement on Tuesday, the IDF rejected Hamas' claims of a shortage of heavy equipment as false.",
      "It said such equipment \"is clearly unnecessary for the transfer of remains, and therefore these claims do not constitute an obstacle to the return of the remaining deceased hostages.\"",
      "Israeli hostage negotiator and peace campaigner Gershon Baskin told CBS News earlier this month that it was \"very likely that there might be Israeli bodies underneath the rubble\" in Gaza, where the Hamas-run government estimates that at least 90% of the\u00a0buildings have been damaged or destroyed.",
      "\"Some of the deceased hostages may never be found, and that's part of the reality, but we have to make sure that Hamas is doing everything possible to do it,\" Baskin said.",
      "During\u00a0negotiations on the Israel-Hamas peace deal, Hamas representatives said they did not know the location of all the remains of deceased hostages, according to\u00a0Israeli media.",

      "An expedition to try to locate Amelia Earhart's plane on a remote island in the Pacific has been delayed until next year, Purdue University said Monday.",
      "A team of researchers was planning to travel to Nikumaroro Island in early November to determine whether something known as the Taraia Object \u2014 a visual anomaly seen in satellite and other imagery \u2014 is Earhart's aircraft. They are now awaiting additional clearances from local authorities as they work through the permit approvals, and cannot go later this year due to the start of cyclone season, according to a news release.",
      "\"We've overcome other challenges to this project over the past four years, and we will get past this one, too,\" Richard Pettigrew, executive director of the Archaeological Legacy Institute, said in the release. \"Because of the compelling evidence we have in front of us, we have to go to Nikumaroro and get a close look at the Taraia Object. Rest assured that we will do just that, so stay tuned! We will have a revised project schedule worked out soon.\"",
      "The underwater object has been visible in photos dating back to 1938, the year after Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan\u00a0disappeared\u00a0while Earhart \u2014 flying a Lockheed 10-E Electra \u2014 tried to become the first female aviator to circle the world.",
      "Researchers previously said there is \"very strong\" evidence that the object, which is in a lagoon on Nikumaroro, a small island in Kiribati about halfway between Australia and Hawaii, is the iconic aviator's plane. Some, however, have expressed skepticism. \"We've looked there in that spot, and there's nothing there,\" Ric Gillespie, executive director of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, told NBC News in July.",
      "A team of researchers from Purdue and the Archaeological Legacy Institute plan to take photos and videos of the site, then use magnetometers and sonar devices to scan the area. The item will then be dredged and lifted from the water so researchers can attempt to identify it.",
      "Expedition member Steve Schultz, who is Purdue University's senior vice president and general counsel, said \"maritime expeditions require thorough preparation and numerous clearances.\"",
      "\"We have gained valuable insights throughout this process and are very confident and resolved to continue this quest with a planned 2026 departure,\" he said.",

      "Yamagami's trial had been a long time coming after the discovery of a suspicious item \u2014 later found to be harmless \u2014 caused its last-minute cancellation and the evacuation of the Nara court building in 2023.",
      "One issue central to the case was whether extenuating circumstances applied due to \"religious abuse\" in Yamagami's childhood stemming from his mother's extreme devotion to the Unification Church, according to Japanese media reports.",
      "In a recent interview with TBS News, cited by the Japan Times, she said her faith grew even stronger after the her son assassinated Abe.",

      "The Church has been accused of fomenting child neglect among its members and financially exploiting them, claims it denies.",

      "Yamagami gave up on advancing to higher education and joined the military instead, while his mother declared bankruptcy, according to the lawyer.",
      "He also attempted suicide in 2005.",
      "\"He began to think his whole life was ruined by the church,\" the lawyer said.",
      "Investigations after Abe's murder led to cascading revelations about close ties between the Church and many conservative lawmakers in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, prompting four ministers to resign.",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Oct 2025 05:11:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Trump meets Japan's new, first female prime minister, and they sign a bilateral trade deal before going together to greet troops on the USS George Washington.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump signed a trade agreement with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Tuesday, as he focuses on cementing deals with key U.S. trading partners during his nearly weeklong trip through Asia.",
      "The deal \u2014 which the two countries agreed to over the summer \u2014 will see\u00a0the U.S. charge\u00a015% tariffs on imported Japanese goods, lower than the 25% initially threatened by Mr. Trump. In exchange, Japan has pledged to invest $550 billion in U.S. industry and open its market to American rice, cars and defense equipment. It's not yet clear exactly where those invested dollars would go.",
      "Mr. Trump and Takaichi, who became Japan's first ever female prime minister just last week, also signed a framework that calls for the U.S. and Japan to cooperate on supplying critical minerals and rare earth metals to each other. Mr. Trump has sought mineral deals with countries including Australia\u00a0and\u00a0Ukraine in recent months, as China imposes new restrictions on its exports of rare earths, which are essential for computer chips, aerospace and other technology, as part of a tit-for-tat trade war with Washington.",
      "During brief remarks to the press before a signing ceremony on Tuesday morning, Mr. Trump touted the trade deal as \"very fair.\"",
      "\"We're going to do tremendous trade together, I think more than ever before,\" he said, calling Japan an \"ally at the strongest level.\"",
      "Japan is the United States' fifth-largest trading partner, according to\u00a0federal statistics. Japan bought $79.7 billion worth of American goods last year, and the U.S. imported $148.2 billion worth of Japanese goods.",
      "More than one-third of U.S. imports from Japan last year \u2014 or $52.3 billion \u2014 were cars and car parts, powered by Japan's massive auto industry, according to\u00a0federal data.",
      "The American and Japanese leaders, whose countries share a rivalry with China, also spoke about defense cooperation, with Mr. Trump thanking Japan for its weapons orders from the U.S.",
      "During their meeting, which was held at Tokyo's Akasaka Palace guest house, Takaichi called the bilateral relationship the \"greatest alliance in the world\" and said she would like to work with the U.S. toward a \"shared goal of achieving a free and open Indo-Pacific.\"",
      "It was the first meeting for Mr. Trump with Takaichi, a staunch conservative who took office last week. She was close with the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a friend of Mr. Trump's up until his assassination in 2022.",
      "\"He was a great friend of mine and a great friend of yours,\" the U.S. president said as he shook Takaichi's hand on Tuesday. Their meeting came within hours of a court hearing in Tokyo during which Abe's assassin pleaded guilty to murdering the former premier with a homemade gun.",
      "In a moment of levity, Takaichi apologized to reporters for a late start to the meeting, saying she was watching game three of the World Series. The Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star, Shohei Ohtani, is a native of Japan and has a large following in his home country. After an exciting, 18-inning contest, Los Angeles pulled ahead for a 6-5 victory.",
      "Trump, Takaichi visit troops on the USS George Washington",
      "Later Tuesday, Mr. Trump touched down by helicopter with Takaichi aboard the USS George Washington aircraft carrier at the Yokosuka Naval Base, south of Tokyo, and they saluted service members before the prime minister and president delivered remarks to the troops.",
      "Mr. Trump was heard praising Takaichi, predicting that she would \"go down as one of the great prime ministers.\"",
      "The Japanese leader was first to step to a lectern on the massive ship to speak to the gathered troops, of whom the White House said there were around 6,000.",
      "She thanked the U.S. forces in Japan for their dedication to peace in the region, and mentioned that six years ago in the same city, Mr. Trump and her predecessor, the late Abe, together and \"demonstrated resolve that Japan and the United States will join hands to ensure peace and security.\"",
      "She said she had a renewed determination to \"carry forward that result\" and make the Indo-Pacific free and open.",
      "\"Now we are facing an unprecedented security environment,\" said Takaichi. \"Peace cannot be preserved\" by conflict alone, she added. \"It can be protected only when there is an unwavering determination and action.\"",
      "When Mr. Trump took the podium, he heaped praise on the U.S. forces gathered before him, as well as the strength of the U.S. military. As the U.S. federal government shutdown neared the one-month mark, Mr. Trump said all the troops present would receive full pay for their deployment despite having to come back to port to attend his visit.",
      "He brought up immigration and the controversial deployment of U.S. National Guard forces to American cities, saying: \"We need safe cities \u2014 whether people like it or not, it's what we're doing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also mentioned the U.S.\u00a0strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean, saying each boat had enough drugs to kill 25,000 people and asserting that the attacks had \"stopped almost completely the drugs coming in by sea, and now we'll stop the drugs coming in by land.\"",
      "Following his appearance on the ship, President Trump was to fly back to Tokyo to attend a business leadership reception on Tuesday evening.",
      "On Monday, the president met with Japanese Emperor Naruhito at Tokyo's imperial palace.",
      "Trump to visit South Korea next \u2014 and meet with China's Xi Jinping",
      "South Korea is the next and final stop on the president's trip, which started over the weekend in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia \u2014 a visit marked by trade frameworks between the U.S. and Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "On the South Korean front, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters he doesn't expect to finalize a trade deal with the country when the U.S. president visits on Wednesday, but said he thinks they're close. Mr. Trump and the South Korean government announced a framework over the summer that was similar to the Japan deal, with 15% tariffs on South Korean goods and investments pledged in the U.S.",
      "The multi-stop Asia trip will culminate with a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday at a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, as they look to put an end to the ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China.",
      "On his way to Tokyo, Mr. Trump predicted the U.S. and China would complete a trade agreement before he returns to Washington later in the week. The two sides have had a rocky relationship in recent months. The president threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China \u2014 for a total rate of 140% \u2014 starting Saturday, Nov. 1, lashing out against new export restrictions imposed by Beijing.",
      "On his way to Tokyo, Mr. Trump also said he would like to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, although there are no such plans for a meeting.",

      "A small molecule has been hailed as potentially promoting longevity and combating certain diseases \u2014 but experts are also calling for more research.",
      "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) \u2014 often nicknamed the \"fountain of youth\" \u2014 is a coenzyme that is essential for cellular survival, which naturally declines with age. In recent years, supplements designed to boost NAD+ levels have grown in popularity.",

      "Previous research has shown that patients with Alzheimer's disease exhibit \"notably low levels\" of NAD+, the researchers noted \u2014 which aligns with the fact that NAD+ declines with age.",
      "\"NAD+ may hold the key to healthier aging and could protect us against diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease,\" said Evandro Fei Fang-Stavem, an associate professor at the University of Oslo, in a press release. \"However, we need further research on how to effectively utilize NAD+ in patient treatment.\"",
      "Benefits of NAD+",
      "Research has shown that boosting NAD+ can improve mitochondrial and stem cell function, improve energy metabolism, enhance focus and mood, and support tissue repair, according to Dr. Amanda Kahn, a board-certified internist and longevity expert in New York City.",
      "\"From a longevity standpoint, NAD+ is one of the most central molecules in maintaining youthful cellular function,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"It activates \u2026 longevity pathways that protect against DNA damage and inflammation.\"",
      "ONE OVERLOOKED DAILY HABIT COULD SLOW THE AGING PROCESS, RESEARCHERS SAY",
      "Boosting NAD+ also supports neuroprotection from Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s, enhances insulin sensitivity, reduces inflammation, repairs skin, boosts immune defense and improves symptoms in long COVID patients, Kahn added.",

      "Dr. Halland Chen, a double board-certified physician in New York who specializes in longevity, reiterated that studies in both animals and early human models show that maintaining healthy NAD+ levels can improve energy metabolism, cognitive function and overall vitality.",
      "\"Restoring NAD+ is ultimately about cellular repair and mitochondrial optimization, not just an energy boost,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Clinical experience shows that NAD+ therapy enhances energy, focus and endurance, while supporting detoxification and reducing oxidative stress from daily life, travel or poor sleep.\"",
      "COMMON DAILY VITAMIN SHOWN TO SLOW AGING PROCESS OVER FOUR-YEAR PERIOD",
      "NAD+ also activates sirtuins, a group of longevity-related proteins that regulate DNA repair, cellular stress responses and gene expression, Chen said, although he noted that larger human studies are still needed.",
      "Methods of boosting NAD+",
      "In clinical studies, patients with age-related diseases have taken compounds designed to boost NAD+.",
      "While NAD+ itself is a large molecule that can\u2019t cross into cells, NAD+ \"precursors\" can enter cells and then work to create NAD+, experts confirm.",
      "These precursors include nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). Most people take these NAD+ precursors in the form of pills, capsules or powders.",
      "\"Clinical experience shows that NAD+ therapy enhances energy, focus and endurance while supporting detoxification.\"",
      "\"Oral NAD precursors can modestly raise NAD+ levels and are convenient for daily maintenance,\" Kahn said. \"In contrast, injections or IV infusions bypass the gut and deliver NAD+ directly into circulation, leading to more rapid and noticeable effects on energy, focus and recovery.\"",
      "Kahn also prescribes a weaker NAD+ nasal spray for patients who can\u2019t tolerate needles, though she said the benefits are typically less pronounced.",
      "COMMON VITAMIN SHOWN TO SLASH SKIN CANCER RISK IN SOME GROUPS, STUDY SUGGESTS",
      "\"In general, I find that combining daily oral precursors with weekly NAD+ injections offers the most comprehensive support for both intracellular and extracellular NAD stores,\" she advised.",
      "Chen noted that oral supplements are best for maintenance, while IV therapy is often chosen for a \"rapid cellular reboot, post-travel recovery or enhanced performance.\"",
      "\"Sessions typically last two to four hours and are administered as a series of three infusions within seven to 10 days, followed by monthly maintenance.\"",
      "A doctor noted that oral supplements are best for maintenance, while IV therapy is often chosen for a \"rapid cellular reboot, post-travel recovery or enhanced performance.\" (iStock)",
      "NAD+ therapy tends to have the most benefit for those managing fatigue, metabolic dysfunction or neurological decline, as well as anyone seeking to enhance energy, focus and recovery, Chen said.",
      "\"In healthy adults, benefits are typically modest, but can be amplified when combined with optimized nutrition, exercise and sleep,\" he added.",
      "Risks and caveats",
      "While NAD+ therapy is generally safe and well-tolerated, it can cause some mild side effects, according to Chen.",

      "\"Headache, nausea or chest tightness can occur, especially during faster IV infusions, and typically resolve when the rate is slowed,\" Chen, who is also chief medical innovation officer at the digital wellness platform Eden, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Injections or IV infusions bypass the gut and deliver NAD+ directly into circulation, leading to more rapid and noticeable effects on energy, focus and recovery,\" a doctor said. (iStock)",
      "\"Most reactions are transient and self-limited, and therapy is considered safe under medical supervision,\" the doctor added.",
      "He advises caution for people with active liver or kidney disease, those with a personal or family history of cancer, and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.",

      "Kahn noted that common side effects include mild redness, itching or tenderness at the injection site, \"which is harmless and dissipates quickly.\"",
      "\"Some patients notice a transient rush, lasting no more than 10 minutes, after taking an NAD+ injection due to a brief release of adrenaline and mitochondrial ATP,\" she went on. \"While not dangerous, it can feel uncomfortable if not anticipated.\"",
      "\"If the core pillars \u2014 sleep, movement, nutrition, metabolic balance and stress regulation \u2014 are not in place, NAD+ therapy won\u2019t deliver its full potential.\"",

      "Like all beagles, Iceman has an incredible sense of smell. \u00a0His nose is so powerful, it's used to sniff out cancer. \u00a0Using the beagles' remarkable sense of smell, health startup 'Spotitearly' has created a test for people to get pre-screened for cancer as a way to increase chances of early detection. \u00a0\"Only 14% of the newly diagnosed cancers in the U.S. are done so through the routine screening. So not a lot of people are actually getting those tests on time,\" says CEO Shlomi Madar.",
      "The test is simple, according to Madar, \"All we ask from the patient is to wear a mask for a few minutes, breathe into it, put it in a capsule and send it back to the lab.\" Once the sample is back at the lab, the beagles get to work looking for the four most common types of cancer - breast, colorectal, prostate, and lung. \u00a0In 'Spotitearly's' initial clinical trials, they report, the dogs detected cancer with 94% accuracy. \"We pride ourselves as being able to detect cancer as early as stage one,\" he says, \"If you detect cancer early enough, you can actually increase survival rate up to 99%.\"",
      "The pups are picked for the job because their sense of smell is 100,000 times more sensitive than ours, allowing them to detect the equivalent of half a teaspoon of sugar in an Olympic-sized swimming pool. In the lab, their puppy power is coupled with artificial intelligence to detect cancer in the breath sample. \"We monitor the dogs' behavior and physiological signals. So, we look at things like their heart rate, their acceleration,\" Madar explains, \u00a0\"And all that plethora of information is being fed into a machine learning algorithm. So, it actually gets better with time.\"",
      "Each beagle must be trained as a sniffer dog already to even be considered. \u00a0Then they go through a rigorous training process - specifically aimed at identifying specific types of cancer. \"We use a lot of redundancy. So, every sample is being sniffed not by one dog, but the entire pack, and more than once,\" Madar notes.",
      "Results are provided by a healthcare professional within days, who will recommend next steps with a positive test. \u00a0Madar notes this screening isn't meant to replace going to a doctor. \u00a0And, while it is still in clinical studies in the United States, you can pre-order a test kit, expected to be commercially available next year.\u00a0Madar says 'Spotitearly' can detect even more types of cancer as long as they train new packs to sniff them out. \u00a0He adds that any dogs who don't pass training are donated to special needs families."

    "published": "Tue, 28 Oct 2025 13:00:21 -0400",
    "summary": "Revolutionary retinal implant restores central vision in 80% of patients with advanced macular degeneration, offering hope where treatments once only slowed blindness.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "A new study in\u00a0The New England Journal of Medicine revealed that the PRIMA brain computer interface (BCI) retinal implant helped people with advanced age-related macular degeneration regain some central vision. The device uses a tiny 2 millimeter by 2 millimeter photovoltaic implant that is only 30 micrometers thick, and thinner than a strand of hair. It sits beneath the retina and works with a special pair of smart glasses. The glasses capture images and send them as near-infrared light to the implant. The implant converts that light into small electrical signals that stimulate the optic nerve. This process mimics how healthy retinal cells normally send visual information to the brain.",
      "The study followed 38 participants, 32 of whom completed one year of follow-up. Twenty-six patients experienced measurable improvement in vision, which equals about 80% of the group. Many participants could read letters, numbers and even full pages of text again. Although the restored vision is black and white and slightly blurry, the results are remarkable for people who once believed they would never see clearly again.",

      "Why this matters for AMD treatment",
      "Age-related macular degeneration, often called AMD, is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness in older adults. Until now, available treatments could only slow down vision loss. None of them could restore what had already been lost.",
      "The PRIMA implant works with smart glasses to bring central vision back to life. (PRIMA by Science)",
      "The PRIMA implant takes a different approach. It directly replaces the missing function of the retina by turning light into electrical signals. Patients can still use their natural peripheral vision while the implant restores some central vision. This combination creates a more complete visual experience.",
      "The trial showed that the surgery is generally safe. Most side effects occurred within the first two months and resolved soon after. Importantly, the implant did not reduce the patients' remaining natural peripheral vision. Researchers call this a major step toward restoring sight rather than only slowing its decline.",
      "The PRIMA implant was developed by Science Corporation, a brain-computer interface company founded by Max Hodak, who previously cofounded Neuralink. Science Corporation acquired the PRIMA technology from the French firm Pixium Vision, continuing its development toward clinical use.",
      "EYE DROPS MAY REPLACE READING GLASSES FOR THOSE STRUGGLING WITH AGE-RELATED VISION LOSS",
      "The tiny chip sits under the retina and turns light into visual signals. (PRIMA by Science)",

      "If you or someone you love lives with late-stage AMD, this breakthrough may offer real hope. For the first time, there is a device that can restore some sight instead of only preserving what remains. You may want to talk with your ophthalmologist about upcoming trials or future approval of the PRIMA system in your area. The company behind the technology has already applied for European approval, and a process with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is underway.",
      "Regaining even partial central vision can make a big difference. Reading text, recognizing faces or simply moving independently becomes possible again. This progress also shows how fast medical innovation is moving. Patients who were once told that nothing could help may soon have a chance to see again.",
      "It is also a reminder to stay informed. Treatments that were once experimental are becoming available sooner than expected. Discussing new technologies with your doctor helps you understand timing, eligibility and what kind of results you can realistically expect.",

      "The PRIMA retinal implant represents a shift in how scientists and doctors think about blindness caused by AMD. For decades, the focus was on slowing down the disease. Now, researchers are proving that restoration is possible. While this generation of the implant provides limited black and white vision, it gives real, functional sight to people who had none. That alone changes lives. More work remains to improve image clarity, color perception and comfort. Still, this is only the beginning. Future versions of the device and smart glasses may make vision restoration even more effective and accessible.",

    "story": [
      "With one trick, you won't have to worry about forgetting passwords on your iPhone again.",
      "Keeping your computer secure is more important than ever. Cyberattacks target computers, accounts and sensitive data daily. Traditional passwords have long been the cornerstone of security, but they come with real challenges. Many of us reuse passwords across sites, and even strong passwords can be compromised in data breaches.",
      "Passkeys offer a safer and more convenient way to authenticate. However, they're still relatively new, and many of us are still trying to figure out how they work. For example, Peter recently reached out asking, \"How do I get a passkey from a PC desktop that doesn't have a camera or fingerprint device?\"",
      "That's a great question, Peter, and you're not alone in wondering about this. The good news is that passkeys are designed to work on virtually any device, whether or not it has biometric hardware like a fingerprint reader or camera. Let's explore what passkeys are, why they're worth using and how to set them up on both Windows and Mac, regardless of your hardware setup.",

      "10 WAYS TO SECURE YOUR OLDER MAC FROM THREATS AND MALWARE",
      "Passkeys make signing in faster and safer by replacing traditional passwords with encrypted keys. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What are passkeys?",
      "Passkeys use cryptography to prove who you are. When you create a passkey, your device makes two keys, one public and one private. The public key goes to the website, and your private key stays on your device. During login, your device confirms your identity with the private key. The website never sees or stores it.",
      "This process blocks phishing and password theft. It also makes sign-in faster. You don't need to remember or type long passwords anymore.",
      "While passkeys simplify authentication, they don't eliminate the need for a secure password manager. Password managers can safely store and sync your passkeys, just as they do with passwords, allowing you to access your credentials across devices and browsers \u2014 even if those devices don't natively sync passkeys, such as between Windows and Apple systems. Using a password manager alongside passkeys creates a bridge between platforms and provides an additional layer of security and convenience.",
      "Can you use passkeys without biometrics?",
      "Yes, you can. A PC or Mac without a camera or fingerprint reader can still use passkeys. On Windows, you unlock them with your Windows Hello PIN. On Apple devices, you can use Touch ID, Face ID or your passcode. The key is having an updated operating system and browser that support passkeys.",
      "If you manage multiple accounts or devices, a password manager that supports passkeys can act as your central vault. This lets you use passkeys even on systems that don't directly support syncing through iCloud or Google Password Manager. It's an easy way to ensure you always have access to your credentials, no matter what kind of device you use.",
      "Why you still need passwords",
      "Not every website supports passkeys yet. Some services still rely on passwords. Keep strong, unique passwords for those accounts. Passwords also serve as backup if you lose a device or can't use your passkey. Over time, more sites will support password-free logins.",
      "This is where password managers continue to play an important role. They bridge the gap between old and new authentication methods, allowing you to store both traditional passwords and passkeys in one secure place. Until the web is fully passkey-ready, combining the two provides both convenience and resilience, giving you a seamless experience across multiple devices and services.",
      "Passkeys also prevent phishing because your private key never leaves your device during sign-in. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "Passkeys are a major upgrade over traditional passwords, but we're not living in an all-passkey world just yet. Many sites still rely on passwords, and you'll need backups if something happens to your device. Supplementing passkeys with a password manager is the best move right now; it lets you store, sync and protect both passkeys and passwords under one roof. The good news is that setting up passkeys takes just a few minutes, and once they're enabled, logging in becomes faster and more secure.",

      "Mad Max Mode returns in Tesla's latest FSD update",
      "Tesla recently launched its FSD v14.1.2 update. The update follows last year's major FSD v14 release, which introduced \"Sloth Mode\" for slower, more cautious driving. The latest update moves to the opposite end of the spectrum with Mad Max mode.",
      "According to Tesla's release notes, this profile allows higher speeds and more frequent lane changes than Hurry mode. The update has sparked mixed reactions. Some Tesla fans praise it for making driving feel more natural.

      "The Mad Max setting isn't new. Tesla first introduced it in 2018 for the original Autopilot system. At the time, Elon Musk described it as ideal for handling aggressive city traffic. The name, borrowed from the post-apocalyptic movie series, immediately drew attention for its bold tone.",
      "Now, the feature is back in Tesla's latest FSD version. Within hours of release, drivers reported seeing cars equipped with Mad Max mode rolling stop signs and driving over the speed limit. These early reports highlight how the mode may behave more assertively than before.",
      "Why Tesla brought back its Mad Max mode",
      "Bringing back Mad Max mode may serve several purposes for Tesla. It helps demonstrate the company's continuous development of FSD software while appealing to drivers who prefer faster, more decisive movement in traffic. It also acts as a signal that Tesla is still chasing the goal of Level 4 autonomy, even though its system remains classified as Level 2, requiring constant driver supervision.",
      "Tesla owners can access Mad Max mode through the car's settings under Speed Profiles.\u00a0 (Chesnot/Getty Images)",
      "For Tesla, this feature shows confidence in its progress. For observers, it raises concerns about timing. With multiple investigations and lawsuits in progress, many expected Tesla to focus on safety rather than on more aggressive driving profiles.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you own a Tesla with Full Self-Driving (Supervised), you can access Mad Max mode through the car's settings under Speed Profiles. This mode provides a more assertive driving experience that includes quicker acceleration, more lane changes, and less hesitation.",
      "However, remember that Tesla's Full Self-Driving system still requires active driver attention. You must keep your hands on the wheel and remain ready to take control at any moment. While the name suggests thrill and speed, safety and awareness should remain your top priority.",

      "Good antivirus software not only blocks viruses but also warns you when a site or email is unsafe. Choose a program that includes phishing detection, real-time web protection and email scanning. These tools can automatically block fraudulent look-alike emails before you even open them.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Identity monitoring services keep watch over the dark web and alert you if your personal information, such as your email address, password, or credit card number, appears in stolen data. If scammers gain access to this information, they often use it to create realistic phishing attempts, like the fake American Express \"account restricted\" email. Early detection through identity monitoring allows you to take action, such as changing passwords, freezing credit, or alerting your bank before real damage occurs.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Legitimate companies like American Express will never ask for full account numbers, passwords, or security codes by email. Familiarize yourself with how real messages from your bank look and sound. If something feels off, forward the message to the company's official fraud department and delete it immediately.",
      "If a phishing attack installs malware on your computer, it can lock or delete files. Keep secure backups on an external drive or a trusted cloud service. That way, even if scammers target your system, you will not lose access to your information.",
      "If an email feels wrong, it probably is. Your intuition is one of your strongest defenses against scams. Combine it with these habits to stay ahead of cybercriminals and keep your personal and financial information safe.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Phishing scams are becoming more advanced, but your awareness is your best defense. When you know how to spot fake emails and stay calm under pressure, you protect both your money and your peace of mind. So next time you get an \"urgent\" message about your account, ask yourself: Would your bank really contact you this way?",

      "How the fake nude images were created and shared",
      "When she was 14, the plaintiff posted a few photos of herself on social media. A male classmate used an AI tool called ClothOff to remove her clothing in one of those pictures. The altered photo kept her face, making it look real.",
      "The fake image quickly spread through group chats and social media. Now 17, she is suing AI/Robotics Venture Strategy 3 Ltd., the company that operates ClothOff. A Yale Law School professor, several students and a trial attorney filed the case on her behalf.",

      "The legal fight against deepfake abuse",
      "States across the U.S. are responding to the rise of AI-generated sexual content. More than 45 states have passed or proposed laws to make deepfakes without consent a crime. In New Jersey, creating or sharing deceptive AI media can lead to prison time and fines.",

      "Why legal experts say this case could set a national precedent",
      "Experts believe this case could reshape how courts view AI liability. Judges must decide whether AI developers are responsible when people misuse their tools. They also need to consider whether the software itself can be an instrument of harm.",
      "The lawsuit highlights another question: How can victims prove damage when no physical act occurred, but the harm feels real? The outcome may define how future deepfake victims seek justice.",
      "Is ClothOff still available?",
      "Reports indicate that ClothOff may no longer be accessible in some countries, such as the United Kingdom, where it was blocked after public backlash. However, users in other regions, including the U.S., still appear able to reach the company's web platform, which continues to advertise tools that \"remove clothes from photos.\"",

      "Phishing scams target every kind of institution, whether it's a hospital, a big tech firm or even a fast-food chain. Educational institutions aren't an exception, especially in 2025, when attackers are actively directing their efforts toward them. Universities across the U.S. are facing a new type of cybercrime where attackers are targeting staff to hijack salary payments. Researchers have discovered that since March 2025, a hacking group known as Storm-2657 has been running \"pirate payroll\" attacks, using phishing tactics to gain access to payroll accounts. Let's talk more about this attack and how you can stay safe.",

      "SCAMMERS NOW IMPERSONATE COWORKERS, STEAL EMAIL THREADS IN CONVINCING PHISHING ATTACKS",
      "How does the university payroll scam work",
      "According to Microsoft Threat Intelligence, Storm-2657 primarily targets Workday, a widely used human resources platform, though other payroll and HR software could be at risk as well. The attackers begin with highly convincing phishing emails, carefully crafted to appeal to individual staff members. Some messages warn of a sudden campus illness outbreak, creating a sense of urgency, while others claim that a faculty member is under investigation, prompting recipients to check documents immediately. In some cases, emails impersonate the university president or HR department, sharing \"important\" updates about compensation and benefits.",
      "Phishing scams are evolving fast, and now universities have become prime targets for payroll theft. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "These emails contain links designed to capture login credentials and multi-factor authentication (MFA) codes in real time using adversary-in-the-middle techniques. Once a staff member enters their information, the attackers can access the account as if they were the legitimate user. After gaining control, the hackers set up inbox rules to delete Workday notifications, so the victims do not see alerts about changes. This stealthy approach allows the attackers to modify payroll profiles, adjust salary payment settings and redirect funds to accounts they control, all without raising immediate suspicion.",
      "COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY DATA BREACH HITS 870,000 PEOPLE",
      "Hackers are exploiting universities at scale",
      "The hackers don't stop at a single account. Once they control one mailbox, they use it to spread the attack further. Microsoft reports that from just 11 compromised accounts at three universities, Storm-2657 sent phishing emails to nearly 6,000 email addresses at 25 institutions. By using trusted internal accounts, their emails appear more legitimate, increasing the likelihood that recipients will fall for the scam.",
      "To maintain access over time, the attackers sometimes enroll their own phone numbers as MFA devices, either through Workday profiles or through Duo MFA. This gives them persistent access, allowing them to approve further malicious actions without needing to phish again. Combined with inbox rules that hide notifications, this strategy lets them operate undetected for longer periods.",
      "Microsoft emphasizes that these attacks don't exploit a flaw in Workday itself. Instead, they rely on social engineering, the absence of strong phishing-resistant MFA and careful manipulation of internal systems. In essence, the threat comes from human behavior and insufficient protection, not software bugs.",

      "Protecting yourself from payroll and phishing scams isn't complicated. By taking a few careful steps, you can make it much harder for attackers to gain access to your accounts or personal information.",
      "The more information scammers can find about you, the easier it is to craft convincing phishing messages. Services that remove or monitor personal data online can reduce exposure, making it harder for attackers to trick you with targeted emails.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

Don't click links or download attachments unless you are 100% sure they are legitimate. Even small mistakes can give attackers access to your accounts.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If an email mentions salary changes or requires action, call or email the HR office or the person directly, using contact information you already know. Phishing emails are designed to create panic and rush decisions, so taking a moment to verify can stop attackers in their tracks.",
      "Never reuse passwords across multiple accounts. Scammers often try to use credentials stolen from other breaches. A password manager can help you generate strong passwords and store them securely, so you don't have to remember dozens of different combinations.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords, and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "The Storm-2657 attacks show that cybercriminals are targeting trust, not software. Universities are appealing because payroll systems handle money directly, and staff can be manipulated through well-crafted phishing.

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "More than 1 million patients have been affected by a data breach involving SimonMed Imaging, one of the country's largest outpatient radiology and medical imaging providers. The breach came to light after a cyberattack compromised sensitive patient data, with reports indicating that ransomware operators may have been behind the incident. What makes this case particularly concerning is the scale of the attack and the type of information stolen, which could easily be misused for financial or identity fraud.",

      "What happened at SimonMed Imaging",
      "In January 2025, SimonMed Imaging was alerted by one of its vendors about a potential security incident. The following day, the company noticed suspicious activity on its own network. The company says in response, it reset passwords, enforced two-factor authentication and tightened endpoint security while cutting off third-party vendor access.",
      "Unfortunately, the attackers had already gained access. Between Jan. 21 and Feb. 5, 2025, cybercriminals exfiltrated sensitive data belonging to around 1.2 million individuals. The Medusa ransomware group later claimed responsibility, alleging they had stolen more than 200 GB of data, including patient IDs, financial records and medical scans.",
      "DISCORD CONFIRMS VENDOR BREACH EXPOSED USER IDS IN RANSOM PLOT",
      "SimonMed Imaging discovered suspicious network activity in January 2025, prompting an immediate security response and system lockdown. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The attackers reportedly demanded 1 million dollars to delete the stolen files, or 10,000 dollars per day to delay publishing. SimonMed was later removed from the Medusa leak site, which could suggest a ransom payment, although the company has not confirmed this. In the aftermath, SimonMed brought in cybersecurity experts to investigate and has offered complimentary credit monitoring services to affected individuals.",
      "COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY DATA BREACH HITS 870,000 PEOPLE",
      "Hackers linked to the Medusa ransomware group stole data from 1.2 million patients, including IDs, financial details and medical scans. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What data got exposed in the SimonMed breach",
      "While SimonMed's official filing described the exposed data as names and other data elements, the ransomware group's claims suggest a much broader leak. According to the attackers, the stolen dataset included identity documents, payment details, medical reports, account balances and raw imaging scans (via BleepingComputer).",
      "Such information is extremely valuable on dark web marketplaces. Identity details and medical records are often sold in bulk to fraud operators who use them to commit financial scams, insurance fraud, or obtain prescription drugs. Medical breaches are harder to recover from because you cannot reset or replace a medical history or a government ID scan the same way you can change a password.",
      "We reached out to SimonMed for comment, but did not hear back before our deadline.",
      "DELIVERY GIANT'S DATA BREACH EXPOSES 40,000 PERSONAL RECORDS",
      "After the breach, SimonMed hired cybersecurity experts, tightened defenses and offered free credit monitoring to affected individuals.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to stay protected",
      "Even though the company is offering free credit monitoring, leaked data often circulates long after an incident is closed publicly. That is why it is important to take additional precautions on your end to reduce the long-term impact of this breach and future-proof your personal security.",
      "People-search sites collect personal records and make them publicly accessible. Data removal services handle outreach and removals on your behalf, which reduces your exposed footprint online. With less information easily available, it becomes harder for attackers to assemble a complete identity profile for scams.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "If you have ever interacted with SimonMed or any related platform, change your passwords immediately. Avoid reusing old passwords across different accounts. A password manager helps generate strong credentials and stores them securely so you do not have to remember them manually. This reduces the risk of one breach affecting multiple accounts.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Enabling 2FA adds an important layer of verification to your accounts. Even if someone gets hold of your password, they will not be able to log in without the code delivered to your phone or app. It is one of the simplest and most effective security upgrades you can make.",
      "Modern malware includes remote access tools and silent monitoring modules that can stay hidden before launching an attack. Strong antivirus software can detect unusual behavior, protect against ransomware and alert you in real time if something attempts to access your data without permission. This is no longer just about traditional virus protection but active threat monitoring.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware and potentially access your private information is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Regularly review your bank statements, insurance records and medical billing activity. Cybercriminals often test stolen information with small, easily overlooked transactions before moving to larger fraud attempts. Catching and reporting these early can prevent a much bigger loss.",
      "Because breaches involving medical providers often expose sensitive identifiers, an identity protection service can be useful. These services scan dark web listings, alert you when your information appears in leaked databases and assist with recovery if fraud occurs. Some plans include legal support and help with credit restoration.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "After a major breach, attackers often launch phishing campaigns that reference the affected company to appear legitimate. Be skeptical of emails or texts mentioning SimonMed or credit monitoring, especially if they request payment or personal verification. Staying aware of current scams and keeping your software updated adds a strong layer of defense.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The SimonMed Imaging breach is another reminder that cyberattacks on healthcare providers are becoming more frequent and far more invasive. Once data is taken, it can circulate indefinitely across criminal networks. Taking protective steps early, including monitoring your identity and reducing your exposed data online, can help you stay ahead of potential misuse.",

These aren't physical gold bars or coins; they're digital tokens tied to the price of gold and stored on blockchain networks. While WEEX operates as a legitimate platform, scammers often exploit the name of real exchanges to sound credible. They'll encourage victims to \"trade gold\" through what seems like an official account but actually directs them to fake sites or wallets designed to steal money.",
      "Why this could be a scam",
      "John's experience shows several red flags. The conversation began with a friendly invitation, then quickly shifted to a financial pitch. That's a classic move in online relationship scams. The younger person builds an emotional connection, then uses that trust to promote an \"opportunity.\" Scammers often promise guaranteed profits or claim they'll \"help you trade\" to make the process sound easy.",

      "Real investments always involve risk. Watch out for anyone who pressures you to act quickly or says the deal is \"private.\" Those urgency tactics are designed to keep you from thinking clearly.",

By blending romance with financial advice, these criminals make their victims believe they're building both trust and wealth. Protect yourself by treating every unexpected text with caution. If the conversation moves toward money, crypto, or gold trading, that's your cue to stop responding.

      "Turning moon dust into homes",
      "Skyeports has developed a way to transform lunar dust, known as regolith, into durable glass that can be shaped into massive spheres. Using a microwave furnace, the regolith melts and expands like a bubble before cooling into a hard, transparent shell. These spheres could one day serve as living and working spaces for astronauts.",

      "The planned glass spheres go far beyond simple shelters. They are designed as self-sustaining ecosystems. The glass can repair small cracks caused by micrometeorites or moonquakes, and built-in solar panels will allow each habitat to generate its own energy.",
      "Inside, temperature layers could create condensation to support plant growth. This would produce oxygen, water and food, making each sphere a self-contained life-support system.",
      "The science behind the glass sphere design",
      "The spherical shape is more than a design choice. It evenly distributes pressure, giving the structure incredible strength. By adding elements like titanium, magnesium and calcium, the glass becomes even tougher and stronger than steel.",
      "Dr. Martin Bermudez, CEO of Skyeports, shared that current prototypes are only a few inches wide, but future spheres could stretch up to 1,640 feet across. His long-term vision is a network of glass cities connected by transparent bridges across the lunar landscape.",

If all goes well, tests on the lunar surface could happen within the next few years.",
      "What this means for you",

      "Malware targeting Android devices has grown increasingly sophisticated. From fake banking apps to phishing campaigns, attackers are finding new ways to trick you into giving up sensitive data.",
      "One of the newest threats comes in the form of malicious apps that appear legitimate but can take full control of your device.

      "How Klopatra infects devices",
      "The malicious VPN and streaming app is called Mobdro Pro IP TV + VPN, and it was recently discovered by researchers at Cleafy. Once you install the app, it drops a malware strain called Klopatra. It's a new and highly sophisticated Android malware currently being used in active campaigns targeting financial institutions and their customers.",
      "THIS CHROME VPN EXTENSION SECRETLY SPIES ON YOU",
      "Fake VPN apps can hide dangerous malware that steals your data and money. (iStock)",
      "At first glance, the app looks like a free streaming platform offering high-quality channels, which makes it appealing to Android users. Once installed, though, it deploys a banking Trojan and a remote-access tool that give attackers full control over the infected device. With that level of access, criminals can steal your banking credentials and even carry out fraudulent transactions without your knowledge.",
      "The infection chain is carefully planned. It starts with social engineering, tricking you into downloading and installing the app from outside the official Play Store. From there, Klopatra bypasses Android's built-in protections and reaches deep into the system to gain persistence and control.",

Millions rely on them to bypass geographic restrictions, protect sensitive communications or simply browse more securely. Yet not all VPNs are trustworthy. Various studies have proved that popular commercial VPNs have alarming shortcomings. Some use protocols that are not designed to protect privacy, obscure ownership or fail to encrypt traffic properly.",
      "When fake apps like Mobdro are combined with these weaknesses, users are left exposed. Criminals exploit both the popularity of VPNs and the prevalence of pirated streaming services to distribute malware effectively.

      "Only download VPNs, streaming services and apps from Google Play, Apple App Store or the official developer's website. Avoid links in forums, social media messages or emails promising free content.",
      "Carefully review what access an app requests. If it asks for control over your device, settings or accessibility services unnecessarily, do not install it. Legitimate VPNs rarely require full device control.",

The two governments are negotiating a trade framework aimed at expanding investment, coordinating supply chains and setting new standards for digital and industrial policy.

      "At the same time, Haggard warned that economic policy differences could pose new challenges. \"Domestic economic policy in South Korea has traditionally been a source of friction but only peripherally because of the relatively small historical investment level into South Korea. As Korea's economy becomes more global and its companies become global leaders beyond their exports, differences in economic policy could become more troublesome to the bilateral relationship.\"",
      "He added that tighter regulation of foreign investment \"would likely cause frictions with the United States as the two countries seek to sign and implement a trade deal.\"",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Some of President Donald Trump\u2019s aides have advised him against shifting the U.S. position on independence for Taiwan to favor China, according to four people with knowledge of the discussions, ahead of his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week.",
      "The aides have privately expressed concern that Trump, who is pushing to reach a sweeping trade deal with China, may choose to ignore their advice, the people with knowledge of the discussions said. They said they worry that Trump could walk away from long-standing U.S. policy on Taiwan or more subtly shift the U.S. position by framing it with new language.",
      "\u201cEveryone is holding their breath,\u201d one of the people with knowledge of the discussions said.",
      "Follow live updates here.",
      "Administration officials have told Trump to expect Xi to seek a public declaration from him that the United States \u201copposes\u201d Taiwan\u2019s independence, the people with knowledge of the discussions said. Xi has for months pushed for a shift in the U.S. position on Taiwan from the current one, which is that the United States does \u201cnot support\u201d its independence, to saying the United States \u201copposes\u201d it.",
      "While many Americans might see that as a different way of saying the same thing, were Trump to say the United States opposes Taiwan\u2019s independence or even that independence is not a good idea at this time, it would send shock waves across Asia and be seen as a huge gift to Xi.",
      "Openly expressing opposition to Taiwan\u2019s independence would be seen as moving the United States from a neutral position on the issue to clearly standing on the side of China. For decades, U.S. administrations have adopted a policy of strategic ambiguity toward Taiwan, known as the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, and presidents have taken the public position of not supporting its independence.",
      "A White House official told NBC News: \u201cPresident Trump has repeatedly affirmed that his Taiwan policy has not changed. President Trump leads on all foreign policy \u2014 he always puts forward deals that put the American people first.\u201d",
      "Asked what the Trump administration\u2019s policy on Taiwan\u2019s independence was, a senior State Department official said, \u201cThe policy on Taiwan hasn\u2019t changed one bit.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s as consistent as it\u2019s been for decades,\u201d the official said Monday.",
      "China sees democratic and self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that must be reunited with the mainland by military force if necessary. Taipei rejects Beijing\u2019s claims of sovereignty and seeks to maintain its de facto independence even if it is not formally recognized by most countries.",
      "\u201cThe Taiwan question is at the core of China\u2019s core interests, and the first red line that cannot be crossed in China-US relations,\u201d Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said by email when he was asked for comment.",
      "\u201cThere is but one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China\u2019s territory. This is a consensus of the international community and a political commitment made by the U.S. to China,\u201d Liu said.",
      "Taiwanese officials are also uneasy about the upcoming Trump-Xi meeting and have expressed their own concerns to State Department officials that Trump could abandon Taiwan to secure a win from the meeting, one of the people familiar with the discussions said.",
      "Asked by reporters about Taiwan\u2019s apprehension, Secretary of State Marco Rubio brushed the concerns aside.",
      "\u201cWhat people are worried about is we\u2019re going to get some trade deal where we\u2019re going to get favorable treatment on trade in exchange for walking away from Taiwan,\u201d Rubio said Saturday en route to Asia for this week\u2019s meetings. \u201cNo one is contemplating that.\u201d",
      "Taiwan\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry took to social media soon after, expressing its appreciation to Rubio for \u201creaffirming no one is contemplating walking away from Taiwan.\u201d",

Organizers from the Milan-Cortina bid were taking notes from inside the closing ceremony, readying for a turn they have been waiting for since 2019, when the IOC selected their bid over a joint bid by Stockholm-\u00c5re in Sweden.",
      "That Milan wanted the Olympics, despite the challenges of cost, logistics and infrastructure that have driven many other potential host cities away, did not surprise John Foot, a professor of modern Italian history at Bristol University in the U.K., whose research has included Italian sports.",
      "Cortina hosted the 1956 Winter Olympics, and elite skiers have long favored competing in the city. American skier Lindsey Vonn said its inclusion as a venue was partly responsible for bringing her out of retirement to try to make a fifth Olympics.",
      "\"There's something special about Cortina that always pulls me back,\" Vonn said.",
      "Foot said it was likely that organizers in the city of more than a million \u2014 which sits in a wide, flat plane \u2014 had seen how hosting the 2006 Winter Olympics had helped spur Turin from an industrial to a post-industrial period of growth, in part thanks to a boost in tourism. Milan has a reputation as the economic engine of Italy because of its deep ties to fashion, industry and business, and for hosting six games during soccer\u2019s 1990 World Cup, but it's not known as being a cold-weather city, Foot said. He could not recall whether Milan had an ice rink during his 20 years living there.",
      "\u201cIt always has been a crossroads city because it\u2019s very well positioned for Europe,\u201d Foot said.",
      "The last time northern Italy attracted such global prominence was in 2020, for far different reasons. More than two weeks after the country\u2019s first Covid-related death in late February, in Lombardy, the region that includes Milan, all sporting events in the country were put on hold. In 2022, one research team estimated that the pandemic was responsible for more than 165,000 excess deaths in Italy. That number had risen to more than 188,000 by 2023.",
      "Milan was able to rebound more quickly economically than other major cities in Italy, Foot said. But the spotlight in February won\u2019t be on Milan alone. Milan will host only ice hockey, speed skating, figure skating and short track, a fraction of the 116 medal events during the games.",
      "The rest will be spread out across a wide area requiring a five-hour drive between Livigno, just across the Swiss border, to Cortina. It takes approximately four hours to drive from Milan to Livigno, and an hour longer to go from Milan to Cortina. Even the venues that will open the games (San Siro) and close them (Verona) are a nearly two-hour drive apart. U.S. officials repeatedly have asked fans to be patient, and realistic, if thinking of traveling between venues.",
      "The U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee is \u201cdoing their best to make it feel like just a normal Olympic experience, even if athletes are separated by a few hours or multiple hours, and we\u2019re not necessarily able to have that same close-knit village experience with all different sports,\u201d Knight said. \u201cThat was definitely a high-priority item when we were talking with them and different athlete reps, is to feel that Team USA is really important, and to feel that energy from other athletes competing, to feel connected.\u201d",
      "Winter Games are often spread out because of the need for both mountain venues and cities big enough to host a large amount of visitors, but the sheer distance in Italy could pose security risks, said Jules Boykoff, a political scientist at Pacific University and former member of the U.S. under-23 national soccer team who has written extensively about the Olympics.",
      "Nicole Deal, the chief of security for the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, said the \u201cdecentralized\u201d geography has led the committee to work with the State Department to ensure there is enough security around U.S. athletes.",
      "Armin Z\u00f6ggeler, who earned medals in luge while representing Italy in six consecutive Olympics from 1994 through 2014, and assisted in the Milan-Cortina bid, acknowledged that the distance was \"definitely a logistical challenge.\" But he called it \"a small price to pay when you think about what it means for the future of these locations.\"",
      "\"The athletes are really excited to finally experience \u2018normal\u2019 Olympic Games again after what happened in 2022,\u201d Z\u00f6ggeler said. \u201cBack then, it was sad to see so many restrictions and empty venues. Northern Italy has such a rich winter sports tradition, and I know all the athletes will feel that energy during the Games. For the Italian team, having the Olympics at home is one of the greatest opportunities you can get in your career. I still remember Torino 2006 very well and I hope the athletes in 2026 can feel something similar. The support from the Italian fans, the 'Tifosi,' is something truly special.",
      "\"I\u2019m excited for the world, but especially the athletes, to see that passion again.\"",
      "If the upcoming Olympics feel like the first \"normal\" Winter Games since 2018, then some of the issues facing them also feel typical to Boykoff, who called concerns over overspending, gentrification and environmental impacts typical for Olympic host cities.",
      "In the spring, Milan organizers announced a budget of about $1.9 billion, more than $100 million more than previously estimated, though that total did not take into account the cost of building a new hockey arena in Milan or rebuilding a sliding center in Cortina that had been used in the 1956 games. Rebuilding the sliding track required felling around 800 trees, which drew protests from environmental groups, and also concern from competitors that it would not open in time. When tests of the sliding track began this fall, however, it drew strong reviews.",
      "What remains concerningly unresolved, however, is whether a new hockey arena in Milan will be ready to host a competition that will see NHL players take part for the first time since 2014. The chief executive of Milan\u2019s local organizing committee, Andrea Varnier, said the \u201ctimeline is very tight,\u201d according to The Associated Press.",
      "In July, prosecutors in Milan alleged that corruption was behind the city\u2019s soaring real estate values, including the construction of an Olympic village. The mayor denied wrongdoing to the city\u2019s council. A court dismissed the accusations in September. But others have apparently viewed the Olympics as a chance to exploit; two men were arrested this month on charges of trying to illegally obtain public works contract and control nightlife and drug dealing in Cortina, according to prosecutors in Venice.",
      "The Olympics could very well be a \u201c17-day party\u201d in Italy, Boykoff said. If it does, it will be a strong opening act for the tenure of Coventry, a former Olympic swimmer from Zimbabwe who is only months into running the IOC.",
      "\u201cThere are real prickly issues and controversial issues around the exclusion of trans athletes, the handing of the Olympics to dictatorships with principles that absolutely don\u2019t chime with the principles enshrined in the Olympic Charter, so I don\u2019t envy her at all,\u201d Boykoff said. \u201cI think she\u2019s walking into a very difficult situation, and Italy and the Milano-Cortina Olympics is her first chance to really put her own original stamp on the Olympic Games.\u201d",
      "Hall, the freestyle skier, donned a sweatshirt bearing the Italian and U.S. flags Tuesday as he described his excitement in defending his gold medal in locale he knows well. Before he moved to Utah when he was 16, Hall, whose mother is Italian, grew up skiing the Alps. In 100 days, he expects to see a large number of aunts, uncles and cousins who live in Italy cheering him on in Livigno, up close.",
      "\"She's got a huge Italian fam,\" Hall, now 27, said of his mother. \"So they're all pulling up.\""

      "Her prediction was right. Hours later, the high school senior would go viral for her fast-acting bravery and earn a name within Eilish\u2019s fandom: The \u201cred bandana girl.\u201d",
      "At the concert, Eilish stepped down from the stage and walked through the crowd, greeting fans with smiles and high-fives. Then came a shocking moment: Eilish\u2019s outstretched arm was yanked by concertgoer. He pulled her into the crowd on the other side of the barricade.",
      "The concertgoer has not been identified. The Miami police Department said in a police department that the individual was \u201cejected\u201d from the venue, NBC News reported. There are no criminal charges pending, police said.",

      "But she wasn\u2019t the only person who had captured the moment. Videos of Saint-Surin confronting the man started to circulate on social media, giving her the nickname \"red bandana girl.\"",
      "Fans found her TikTok account and jumped her following from 60 to about 700,000. Singer-songwriter FINNEAS, who is also Billie\u2019s older brother, posted on his Instagram story on Oct. 10, \u201cRed bandana girl from last night\u2019s show rules.\u201d",
      "Saint-Surin realized she\u2019d gone viral at her high school\u2019s pep rally. Her \u201cmind started to crumble\u201d thinking of her followers. But the attention excited her, too. \u201cI\u2019m like yes, FINNEAS sees that I don\u2019t play about your sister,\u201d she says.",
      "Stubhub ended up inviting Saint-Surin to Eilish\u2019s Oct. 10 show, where she says she made eye contact with Eilish from the other side of the barricade. On Night 3, which she also attended, she says Eilish smiled at her. At the concerts, Saint-Surin got recognition of her own from fans who had seen the viral video.",

      "Looking back, Saint-Surin reflects on concert etiquette, especially at at time when behavior like concertgoers throwing things at performers is a trend. She hopes the moment encourages people to \u201cenforce more respect (toward) an artist when they\u2019re performing.\u201d",
      "As for what made her the type of person who would intervene when she sees \"disrespect,\" in her words?",
      "\u201cMama definitely raised me right, yes,\u201d she says."

      "Extending the length of your daily walks can benefit your heart, new research suggests.",
      "In a study conducted among healthy adults, people who accumulated most of their daily steps in bouts of 15 minutes or longer had significantly lower risks of heart disease and death nearly a decade later than those who got in several shorter walks throughout the day. The study was published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.",
      "What\u2019s more, adults who had been less active in the past and went on longer walks showed the greatest health gains.",
      "An international team of scientists looked at the daily movements of 33,560 adults aged 62 on average and living in the U.K., using information collected from 2013 through 2015 in a medical research database called the UK Biobank. For three to seven days, participants wore an accelerometer on their wrist that recorded their physical activity.",
      "Researchers divided the people into four groups, based on how they logged most of their steps each day: in bouts shorter than five minutes, five to less than 10 minutes, 10 to less than 15 minutes and 15 minutes or longer. The largest group \u2014 42.9% of participants \u2014 fell into the under-five-minute category.",
      "After about 9\u00bd years of follow up, the researchers found that people who had walked in spurts of 15 minutes or longer had the lowest likelihood of dying during the study period, while people who took walks shorter than five minutes had the highest risk.",
      "People who walked in longer bouts also had lower risks of heart disease during the follow-up period, with risk increasing as walk duration shortened.",
      "Co-lead study author Borja del Pozo Cruz, a professor and researcher in the department of sports sciences at Universidad Europea de Madrid, calls the four walk durations \u201cdoses.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a clear dose response,\u201d del Pozo Cruz said. \u201cThe longer the bout, the better it is for the different health outcomes that we analyzed.\u201d",
      "The decision to study people\u2019s health via step accumulation patterns, as opposed to total number of steps or intensity of physical activity, was intentional, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to translate; everyone understands steps,\u201d del Pozo Cruz said. \u201cEveryone can essentially measure steps with their smartwatches or smartphones or pedometers or whatever. We thought focusing on steps would be much more impactful because their translation is immediate.\u201d",
      "Forget \u2018exercise snacks\u2019 and 10,000 steps a day",
      "The notion that adults should strive for 10,000 steps a day is more a marketing ploy to sell fitness trackers than a scientific guideline, according to Steven Riechman, a professor in the department of kinesiology and sport management at Texas A&M University, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.",
      "Riechman said that the body goes through a number of adaptations as it shifts from rest mode to exercise mode \u2014 changes that take a bit of time. That could explain why people who walked in bouts shorter than five minutes didn\u2019t see as strong health gains, he said.",
      "\u201cYou need to get all the systems engaged and fully operational, and that\u2019s where the health benefits come from,\u201d Riechman said. \u201cThe one I particularly thought of, [which] the article did not mention, is that the increase in body temperature is probably not going to occur in less than five minutes of walking.\u201d",
      "Despite mixed research on the health benefits of 10,000 steps a day, the study considered people who achieved an average daily step count under 8,000 to be \u201csuboptimally active.\u201d All study participants logged fewer than 8,000 steps a day, and those who logged fewer than 5,000 were deemed sedentary. The median activity of all participants was 5,165 steps a day.",
      "The link between longer walking bouts and lower risks of early death and heart disease was more notable among sedentary participants, researchers found. Within this group, people who walked in bouts shorter than five minutes had a 5.13% risk of death during the study period, compared to a 0.86% risk for people who walked in bouts exceeding 15 minutes. Their risk of developing heart disease during the decade-long study period was 15.39% and 6.89%, respectively.",
      "\u201cYou have big returns from zero to something,\u201d Riechman said. \u201cThen you keep getting benefits, but they\u2019re just lower and lower. By the time you get to 10,000 [steps], you\u2019re not accumulating too many more benefits.\u201d",
      "The study is at odds with previous research that touts the merits of \u201cexercise snacks,\u201d or spurts of physical activity lasting less than five minutes. For instance, a study published earlier this month in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that exercise snacks improved the fitness levels of physically inactive adults. However, that study defined short spurts as structured, moderate-to-vigorous activity. The short spurts in del Pozo Cruz\u2019s study, on the other hand, included the unstructured, low-intensity steps one might accumulate throughout the course of the day.",
      "\u201cEvery step counts,\u201d according to the American Heart Association, a mantra Riechman supports. Some physical activity is always better than none.",
      "\u201cGetting out and getting some of the steps, for sure, there\u2019s definitely a benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, you\u2019re just not optimizing the benefits.\u201d",
      "\u2018Never too late\u2019 to start walking",
      "The study had several limitations, including that 97% of participants were white.",
      "Another research constraint is that participants\u2019 walking patterns represent a snapshot in time, and people\u2019s exercise habits may fluctuate over the years. Even so, the study\u2019s large sample size likely stabilized such variation, said Carmen Swain, director of the health and exercise science program at the Ohio State University, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research.",
      "One of the study\u2019s biggest strengths, she said, is participants\u2019 average age: 62. It\u2019s a time of life when people may assume they\u2019re past the point of lowering their risk of heart disease and early death.",
      "\u201cYou can start [walking] at any age; it\u2019s not too late,\u201d Swain said. \u201cThe physiological adaptations that occur for a 20-year-old are also going to happen for a 60-year-old.\u201d",
      "Yes, a 60-year-old may already bear underlying signs of heart disease, she said, which is why it\u2019s even more important for older adults to maintain a walking regimen.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s often a challenge for this population to start because they haven\u2019t done it for so long,\u201d said Swain, who lectures her students on the power of walking. \u201cThere has to be motivation.\u201d",
      "With heart disease being the No. 1 killer of men and women in the U.S., Swain hopes the heart-health benefits of walking will be motivation enough.",
      "\u201cWalking is so democratic. You can just do it wherever you want, whenever you want, however you want,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good form of exercise.\u201d",
      "CORRECTION (Oct. 28, 2025, 11:12 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated Steven Riechman's title. He is professor, not an associate professor."

    "story": [
      "Russia says it has successfully tested an experimental weapon that sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie: a nuclear-powered cruise missile with unlimited range, whose low-flying, terrain-hugging and loitering capabilities could evade American missile defenses and drop atomic bombs anywhere on Earth.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Sunday that the Burevestnik \u2014 meaning \u201cstorm petrel\u201d (a type of sea bird) \u2014 was \u201cindeed a unique weapon that no other country possesses.\u201d",
      "The development has drawn concern internationally, with President Donald Trump saying Monday it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d to be conducting such tests when Russia should be focusing on peace talks with Ukraine.",
      "But many Western experts have questioned the value of the missile, which is code-named \u201cSkyfall\u201d by NATO. Some say it doesn\u2019t do anything Russia can\u2019t do already \u2014 while others ridicule it as a waste of money. There are also safety concerns that the mini-reactor that powers the missile could spark a radiation catastrophe.",
      "\u201cThe main reason that no one else has tried to build something like this is that it doesn\u2019t really have any use,\u201d Pavel Podvig, a senior researcher at the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, told NBC News.",
      "The weapon is instead \u201clargely political,\u201d according to Podvig, who is based in Geneva and runs the Russian Nuclear Forces Project. \u201cIt was important for the Kremlin, I think, that this is unique and something no one else has done before.\u201d",
      "Trump pointed out Monday that there are other ways to deliver a nuclear warhead.",
      "\u201cWe have a nuclear submarine, the greatest in the world, right off their shores,\u201d he told reporters aboard Air Force One. So a missile \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to go 8,000 miles,\u201d he added.",
      "\"We test missiles all the time,\" he said. \"They're not playing games with us, and we're not playing games with them either.\"",
      "The Kremlin said it saw no reason why the test would \u201cstrain relations between Moscow and Washington,\u201d already complicated by the shelved Putin-Trump summit.",
      "The test was announced Sunday by Putin and Gen. Valery Gerasimov, Russia\u2019s chief of the general staff, who appeared together in a video wearing camouflage fatigues.",
      "Gerasimov told the president the missile had flown for 15 hours and covered 8,700 miles during a test last Tuesday \u2014 a record but not the limit of its range, he said.",
      "Gerasimov spoke of its \u201cassured accuracy against highly protected targets at any range\u201d and said it had \u201ca high capability to evade missile-defense and air-defense systems.\u201d",
      "This was the first time the missile had conducted \u201ca many-hour flight,\u201d Gerasimov added. But the Burevestnik is far from new, having been announced by Putin in March 2018.",
      "It uses a reactor \u2014 essentially a \u201cminiature nuclear power plant\u201d \u2014 to heat air to temperatures of almost 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit, which powers a ramjet engine that could keep it flying for days, according to a 2019 report by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, an American nonprofit group.",
      "The U.S. and Soviet Union both looked into developing the technology during the Cold War but abandoned it because of the concerns highlighted by experts today.",
      "Those fears were realized in 2019. An offshore explosion in the Russian Arctic killed five scientists and spiked radiation in a nearby city. Experts and later the U.S. government said it was likely a failed Burevestnik test.",
      "Norway said Monday that last week's test was carried out from an archipelago in the Barents Sea. \u201cWe can confirm that Russia has conducted a new test launch of the long-range cruise missile Skyfall (Burevestnik) on Novaya Zemlya,\u201d Vice Adm.

    "story": [
      "Hurricane Melissa, which made landfall in both Jamaica and Cuba in the last two days, followed what has unfortunately become a familiar pattern for major storms in a warming world.",
      "The most catastrophic storms \u2014 those with the most intense winds and soaking rains \u2014 were once rare, but they are becoming more likely because of climate change. And similarities are emerging among these powerful hurricanes\u2019 behavior and timing, too.",
      "Before Melissa hit Jamaica as a Category 5 monster, it churned over especially warm waters \u2014 as did other hurricanes over the past decade. This allowed it to strengthen at blistering pace, becoming the most powerful of this year\u2019s Atlantic season and tying the record for strongest landfall ever in the Atlantic.",
      "Then the storm slowed to a crawl, giving it more time to dump rain on Jamaica, another hallmark of hurricanes on a warming planet. Melissa\u2019s timing, too, was notable: It formed late in the season \u2014 hurricane activity has typically been thought to peak in early September \u2014 as ocean heat lingered into the fall.",
      "Taken together, this behavior makes Melissa a kind of poster child for the new normal of hurricanes, experts said.",
      "\u201cThese storms aren\u2019t the same storms as a couple decades ago,\u201d said Shel Winkley, a meteorologist at the nonprofit research group Climate Central.",
      "It\u2019s a shift with life-or-death consequences \u2014 one that forecasters and officials in storm-prone areas are now watching closely.",
      "Intensifying in a hurry",
      "One of Melissa\u2019s most eye-opening characteristics is how remarkably fast it intensified. In just 18 hours, it exploded from a tropical storm into a Category 4 Sunday, before reaching Category 5 strength early Monday.",
      "Climate change is increasing the risk of this \u201crapid intensification\u201d pattern, which the National Hurricane Center defines as an increase in sustained wind speeds of at least 35 mph over 24 hours.",
      "In Melissa\u2019s case, Winkley said, unusually warm sea-surface temperatures in the Caribbean and high levels of moisture in the atmosphere caused an \u201cextreme rapid intensification.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten really good at forecasting and understanding when hurricanes are going to make a big boost in intensity, but with Melissa, it even exceeded the best forecast that we can make for it in terms of wind speed,\u201d he said.",
      "Winkley added that the storm passed over Caribbean waters that were 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than usual \u2014 conditions that climate change made up to 700 times more likely.",
      "Two-and-a-half degrees Fahrenheit may not sound like a lot when it comes to a giant hurricane, but small temperature differences can really make a big impact,\u201d Winkley said.",
      "Many other recent storms have undergone rapid intensification. Last year, Hurricane Milton\u2019s wind speed increased by 90 mph in roughly 25 hours, and in 2022 Hurricane Ian went through two rounds of rapid intensification before making landfall in Florida. The list goes on: Hurricanes Idalia in 2023, Ida in 2021 and Harvey in 2017 all underwent rapid intensification, too.",
      "Fewer hurricanes, higher impact",
      "In the past 35 years, the number of hurricanes and tropical cyclones that form annually has been decreasing.",
      "\u201cWe find that the number of hurricanes globally, including typhoons, has gone down significantly since 1990,\u201d said Phil Klotzbach, an atmospheric scientist who studies hurricanes at Colorado State University.",
      "But that overall decrease is largely due to a drop in cyclone activity in the Pacific, Klotzbach said; Atlantic hurricane activity has risen, primarily as a result of a decades-long trend toward La Ni\u00f1a, a seasonal circulation pattern that tends to weaken the high-altitude winds that discourage hurricane formation.",
      "\u201cLa Ni\u00f1a is good for the Atlantic if you like hurricanes,\u201d Klotzbach said.",
      "When hurricanes do develop, they\u2019re more likely to turn into major storms as the seas warm.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen an increase of those reaching Category 4 and 5,\u201d Klotzbach said.",
      "Melissa was the third Category 5 hurricane this year \u2014 the first time in two decades that more than two storms of such power have formed in the same season.",
      "Zachary Handlos, an atmospheric scientist at Georgia Tech University, said that although warmer seas in the future will be more conducive to hurricanes, a warmer atmosphere will force changes to the high-altitude winds that can prevent or destroy hurricanes. These winds could strengthen in some locations and weaken in others, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a very straightforward answer.\u201d",
      "How these trends will play out remains an active area of research and scientific dispute.",
      "A longer hurricane season",
      "It\u2019s not lost on experts that the strongest hurricane of the season hit just days before Halloween.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re pretty late into the season at this point. Things should be starting to wind down,\u201d said Derrick Herndon, a researcher in the Tropical Cyclone Research Group at the University of Wisconsin.",
      "The Caribbean has always been a hotspot for powerful, late-season hurricanes, but they\u2019re becoming even more likely, Klotzbach said \u2014 he recently submitted research showing the trend for peer review. At the same time, hurricane data in the era of satellite observations (from 1971 to 2022) suggests that hurricane season is beginning earlier in the year, too.",
      "The fall hurricane pattern has been fueled by the long-term trend toward the La Ni\u00f1a pattern, Klotzbach added, which itself is likely the result of a combination of climate change and natural variability.",
      "La Ni\u00f1a weakens high-altitude winds at a time when Caribbean waters are still hot, setting the stage for storms in late October and early November, he said: \u201cIt loads the dice toward these robust hurricanes.\u201d",
      "Hurricane Melissa was exacerbated by warmer-than-usual waters off Jamaica\u2019s southern coast.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to get a really intense hurricane in the Atlantic, it\u2019s going to probably be in this part of the world,\u201d Herndon said.",
      "In the past, such a storm would typically have churned up cold water from below the surface and stifled its own growth, according to Andy Hazelton, a hurricane modeler and associate scientist with the University of Miami\u2019s Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies. But this year, ocean heat is elevated both at the surface and as deep as 200 feet below, he said, so Melissa simply churned up more heat and energy.",
      "Storms are stalling",
      "Just before or after landfall, hurricanes are now more likely to stall and dump immense amounts of rain, according to a study published last year. Other research suggests their forward speed has gotten slower overall, though this remains a topic of debate.",
      "Hurricane Melissa followed the pattern, stalling off the coast of Jamaica as it continued to build intensity. On Tuesday morning, the day of its first landfall, the storm was moving at just around 2 mph. Forecasters expected up to 30 inches of rainfall in parts of Jamaica, which is more than a third of its annual average.",
      "Scientists have not reached a consensus about why some storms are moving more slowly, but some have theorized that it\u2019s because climate change has weakened atmospheric circulation patterns.",
      "Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was a dramatic example of the consequences of such stalling: When it parked over Houston, the storm dropped about 5 feet of rain in some locations. The pattern is particularly problematic because a warmer atmosphere can absorb and deliver more rainfall.",
      "\u201cFor every 1 degree Fahrenheit of warming, the atmosphere can hold onto 4% more moisture,\u201d Winkley said. \u201cWarmer oceans not only boost the intensity of hurricanes, but it allows for more evaporation, so it\u2019s putting more of that rain-making moisture into the atmosphere for these hurricanes to absorb and then unleash.\""

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Some of President Donald Trump\u2019s aides have advised him against shifting the U.S. position on independence for Taiwan to favor China, according to four people with knowledge of the discussions, ahead of his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week.",
      "The aides have privately expressed concern that Trump, who is pushing to reach a sweeping trade deal with China, may choose to ignore their advice, the people with knowledge of the discussions said. They said they worry that Trump could walk away from long-standing U.S. policy on Taiwan or more subtly shift the U.S. position by framing it with new language.",
      "\u201cEveryone is holding their breath,\u201d one of the people with knowledge of the discussions said.",
      "Follow live updates here.",
      "Administration officials have told Trump to expect Xi to seek a public declaration from him that the United States \u201copposes\u201d Taiwan\u2019s independence, the people with knowledge of the discussions said. Xi has for months pushed for a shift in the U.S. position on Taiwan from the current one, which is that the United States does \u201cnot support\u201d its independence, to saying the United States \u201copposes\u201d it.",
      "While many Americans might see that as a different way of saying the same thing, were Trump to say the United States opposes Taiwan\u2019s independence or even that independence is not a good idea at this time, it would send shock waves across Asia and be seen as a huge gift to Xi.",
      "Openly expressing opposition to Taiwan\u2019s independence would be seen as moving the United States from a neutral position on the issue to clearly standing on the side of China. For decades, U.S. administrations have adopted a policy of strategic ambiguity toward Taiwan, known as the \u201cOne China\u201d policy, and presidents have taken the public position of not supporting its independence.",
      "A White House official told NBC News: \u201cPresident Trump has repeatedly affirmed that his Taiwan policy has not changed. President Trump leads on all foreign policy \u2014 he always puts forward deals that put the American people first.\u201d",
      "Asked what the Trump administration\u2019s policy on Taiwan\u2019s independence was, a senior State Department official said, \u201cThe policy on Taiwan hasn\u2019t changed one bit.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s as consistent as it\u2019s been for decades,\u201d the official said Monday.",
      "China sees democratic and self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that must be reunited with the mainland by military force if necessary. Taipei rejects Beijing\u2019s claims of sovereignty and seeks to maintain its de facto independence even if it is not formally recognized by most countries.",
      "\u201cThe Taiwan question is at the core of China\u2019s core interests, and the first red line that cannot be crossed in China-US relations,\u201d Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said by email when he was asked for comment.",
      "\u201cThere is but one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China\u2019s territory. This is a consensus of the international community and a political commitment made by the U.S. to China,\u201d Liu said.",
      "Taiwanese officials are also uneasy about the upcoming Trump-Xi meeting and have expressed their own concerns to State Department officials that Trump could abandon Taiwan to secure a win from the meeting, one of the people familiar with the discussions said.",
      "Asked by reporters about Taiwan\u2019s apprehension, Secretary of State Marco Rubio brushed the concerns aside.",
      "\u201cWhat people are worried about is we\u2019re going to get some trade deal where we\u2019re going to get favorable treatment on trade in exchange for walking away from Taiwan,\u201d Rubio said Saturday en route to Asia for this week\u2019s meetings. \u201cNo one is contemplating that.\u201d",
      "Taiwan\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry took to social media soon after, expressing its appreciation to Rubio for \u201creaffirming no one is contemplating walking away from Taiwan.\u201d",
      "Abigail Williams, Courtney Kube, Carol E. Lee and Monica Alba reported from Washington and Katherine Doyle from Tokyo."

      "Canada is on track to lose its measles elimination status as an outbreak that began a year ago continues to spread.",
      "The United States could follow in the coming months.",
      "The Canadian outbreak began in October 2024 in New Brunswick, a province on the country\u2019s eastern seaboard. As of Tuesday, more than 5,000 cases had been reported. Two babies have died.",
      "Canada eliminated measles in 1998. The U.S. followed two years later, in 2000.",
      "There are multiple criteria for losing an official measles elimination status, including the declines in vaccination rates observed in both countries.",
      "But the most significant factor is having ongoing measles transmission for a full year.",
      "\u201cTo really say that a country has lost the status, it takes 12 months of continuous transmission with the same genotype and the same strain of the virus,\u201d said Daniel Salas, an immunization expert with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).",
      "Canada hit that mark this week.",
      "PAHO, which is part of the World Health Organization, is the group charged with determining whether a country in North, South or Central America has eliminated measles. It is set to convene next week in Mexico City to analyze measles data through the end of October.",
      "If a country loses its measles elimination status, \u201ca corrective action plan will be requested to guide efforts to regain elimination,\u201d according to a PAHO spokesman.",
      "It\u2019s highly unlikely that the U.S. will lose its elimination status during the upcoming meeting, Salas said, because the ongoing outbreak began in January.",
      "In the U.S., at least 1,618 measles cases have been logged so far this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The outbreak that threatens the U.S. elimination status began in West Texas in late January. More than 800 people in Texas and New Mexico have been infected, and the outbreak has spread to other states. Three people died, including two young girls.",
      "It will take time to analyze whether ongoing spread in Arizona, Utah and South Carolina is linked to the West Texas outbreak.",
      "The elimination of measles in the U.S. and Canada \u201cwas a huge achievement,\u201d Salas said. \u201cWhen we say that we sustain the elimination as a region, we are also acknowledging each country for their efforts.\u201d",
      "The possibility of elimination status in Canada is \u201ca wake-up call that we need to do better in vaccinating our general public so we don\u2019t have outbreaks like this,\u201d Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Toronto, said in an interview this week with CTV Television Network in Toronto.",
      "The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is extraordinarily effective, according to the CDC. Two doses, usually given around ages 1 and 5, are 97% effective at preventing infection."

      "Two suspects with histories of jewel thefts had been tracked for days after their DNA was recovered from the museum and were arrested Saturday shortly before one of them was set to board a flight out of the country, a police official told NBC News.",
      "The breakthrough came a week after robbers broke into the Galerie d\u2019Apollon, threatening guards and drilling into display cases before escaping on scooters with eight of France\u2019s crown jewels worth an estimated $102 million.",
      "A major police operation has been underway to track down the thieves, who were captured fleeing on camera. But there was still no sign of the jewels themselves.",
      "Police said DNA samples discovered at the crime scene helped identify the suspects.",

      "\"And that allowed my colleagues from the forensic team to find these DNA traces,\" he said.",
      "Ronde added that the two arrested suspects are men in their 30s, who had prior convictions and were known to police as having previously targeted jewelry stores.",
      "They are both from Aubervilliers, a suburb in northeast Paris, Ronde said. He said police decided to move in on Saturday when it became clear that one suspect was planning to flee to Algeria. He was arrested at Charles de Gaulle airport 40 minutes before the flight was due to take off.",
      "While police can hold suspects for up to 48 hours without charge, in organized crime investigations like this one, detention can be extended to 96 hours.",
      "\"I think there is going to be more arrests quickly,\" said Robert Wittman, a former FBI art crime investigator.",
      "He added that the arrest of the first suspects would allow police to gather more evidence through searches of their homes and cellphone data.",
      "While investigators worry that the thieves may melt down or dismantle the jewels to sell them off as soon as possible, there remains hope that the stolen artifacts can be recovered intact.",
      "Wittman said the thieves may have good reason to preserve the jewels rather than destroy them right away.",
      "\"In places like France, and Europe, they can use those to get out of jail free,\" he said, adding that destroying the jewels would leave the thieves with no \"bargaining tools\" if they were arrested.",
      "Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said that investigators continued to search for the stolen jewels and the remaining suspects but that it was \"too early\" to provide the public with any more detail.",
      "\"I will release additional information at the end of this period of police custody,\u201d she said, adding that she did not want to hinder the investigation.",

U.S. and Chinese delegations were meeting in Malaysia over the weekend to find a way forward after Trump threatened new tariffs of 100% on Chinese goods and other trade limits starting Nov. 1 in response to China\u2019s expanded export controls on rare earth minerals and related technologies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not the U.S. president coming to Asia to meet the multilateral schedule; it\u2019s the U.S. president coming to Asia and then bending the multilateral schedule around his schedule,\u201d Cha said, noting that Trump is skipping the U.S.-ASEAN leaders meeting, the East Asia Summit and formal APEC sessions.",
      "Even so, Cha said, regional leaders are eager to engage.",
      "\u201cEverybody still wants to cut a deal with the U.S. president,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all want tariff relief, and they will try to make a deal to achieve that.\u201d",
      "During the meeting with Xi, Trump said he plans to raise the issue of fentanyl, accusing China of failing to curb the flow of precursor chemicals, and a senior administration official said China\u2019s purchases of Russian oil will also be on the table. Trump said he also expects to discuss Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy that Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot to talk about with President Xi, and he has a lot to talk about with us,\u201d Trump said Friday, adding that he expects \u201ca good meeting\u201d even as he has intermittently threatened to call it off over trade frictions, including China\u2019s halt to purchases of U.S. soybeans.",
      "Both leaders want the optics and tactical aspect of this meeting to go well, a person familiar with the meeting planning said.",
      "But analysts urged caution about what a leader-level encounter can deliver.",
      "\u201cDuring Trump\u2019s first term, high-level exchanges with China did not prevent him from later taking a harder line,\u201d said Sun Chenghao, a fellow at Tsinghua University\u2019s Center for International Security and Strategy. \u201cSo the symbolic value of summit diplomacy should not be overstated.\u201d",
      "Earlier this week, a senior administration official pushed back on speculation that Trump could reprise his 2019 encounter with North Korea\u2019s Kim, when he made a surprise visit to the demilitarized zone that separates the two Koreas in an effort to revive nuclear talks that had collapsed. Trump said before leaving Washington on Friday that he \u201cwould like\u201d to meet with Kim, but was unsure whether it would happen on this trip.",
      "Kim says he will negotiate only if the U.S. recognizes North Korea as a nuclear power, and he has only further strengthened his weapons programs since Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "\u201cI think they are sort of a nuclear power,\u201d Trump said as he began his journey to Asia on Friday, perhaps paving the way for a possible meeting. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of nuclear weapons, I\u2019ll say that.\u201d"

      "TOKYO \u2014 As Japan tries to placate President Donald Trump amid contentious trade talks, officials may be eyeing an icon of American manufacturing that has virtually no presence there: The Ford F-150 pickup truck.",
      "Trump, who is visiting the key U.S. ally next week as part of his first trip to Asia since returning to office, has long criticized the lack of American vehicles sold in Japan, citing what he believes are non-tariff barriers.",
      "Japanese auto brands such as Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi and Subaru are ubiquitous in the United States, where Japan exported over 1.37 million vehicles last year, according to the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA). Cars are Japan\u2019s top export to the U.S., though according to JAMA most Japanese cars sold there are actually assembled in North America.",
      "By contrast, Japanese brands account for more than 90% of new cars sold in Japan, which imported fewer than 17,000 American vehicles last year, according to the Japan Automobile Importers Association.",
      "The Trump administration has been pushing Japan to buy more American cars, including as part of a trade deal announced in July that imposed a 15% tariff on Japanese autos and auto parts. A joint statement on the agreement published last month said Japan would allow vehicles built and certified for safety in the U.S. to be sold in the country without additional testing.",
      "In August, Trump suggested that there would soon be a market in Japan for American cars, specifically the Ford F-150.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re taking the very beautiful Ford 150, which does very well and I\u2019m sure will do very well there,\u201d he told CNBC. The model has long been the best-selling vehicle in America, according to industry outlets.",
      "Reuters reported this week that Ford F-150s were part of a purchase package being finalized to present to Trump during talks in Tokyo next week, citing two sources with knowledge of the preparations. It said the trucks might be used in Japan as snow plows.",
      "Local media in Japan have also said the government is considering buying the trucks.",
      "Japanese officials have not confirmed the reports, and the new trade minister, Ryosei Akazawa, was not asked about them at his first news conference on Friday.",
      "Akazawa, who was previously Japan\u2019s lead trade negotiator with the U.S., said earlier this month that while Trump\u2019s frequent mentions of the Ford F-150 suggested they were a \u201cfavorite\u201d of his, he did not have information to share on any potential purchases by the Japanese government.",
      "Despite the advocacy by Trump, large, expensive American cars have long been a hard sell in Japan, where roads are typically smaller and narrower than their American counterparts.",
      "\u201cFully-sized pickups simply wouldn\u2019t fit on Japanese roads and into the standard pay parking lots,\u201d Mike Smitka, a member of GERPISA, an international network dedicated to the global automobile industry, told NBC News.",
      "Many of the vehicles sold in Japan are mini or \u201ckei\u201d cars that are far smaller and more fuel efficient than the ones produced by American automakers. They are required by law to be no more than about 11.2 feet long and 4.9 feet wide, compared with the F-150 which is typically more than 17 feet long and 6.6 feet wide.",
      "European vehicles are also far more popular in Japan than American ones, accounting for more than 200,000 imports last year. The top-selling European car brand in Japan is Mercedes-Benz.",
      "\u201cUnlike European car companies, Ford and General Motors (GM) don\u2019t have dedicated port facilities or dealerships,\u201d Smitka said in emailed comments. \u201cThey\u2019d be very expensive to import, expensive to market, and because there\u2019s no network, expensive to service.\u201d",
      "Ford did not respond to an emailed request for comment. In 2016, the company said that it would close all operations in Japan, saying it had struggled to gain market share and saw \u201cno reasonable path to profitability.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t try to sell pickups because they understand the market,\u201d Smitka said.",
      "Arata Yamamoto reported from Tokyo, and Jay Ganglani from Hong Kong."
