      "As if a movie about sharks wasn\u2019t scary enough, the filmmakers behind \u201cDangerous Animals\u201d have upped the screams by adding what every thriller should demand \u2014 a serial killer",
      "As if a movie about sharks wasn't scary enough, the filmmakers behind \u201cDangerous Animals\u201d have upped the screams by adding what every thriller needs \u2014 a serial killer.",
      "While that may sound like very dangerous moviemaking, the result is actually taut and well crafted, a worthy birthday present to \u201cJaws,\u201d celebrating its 50th anniversary this summer.",
      "\u201cDangerous Animals\u201d stars Jai Courtney as an Australian boat captain who likes feeding his female customers to sharks and videotaping it, while also offering little brainy speeches about the nature of makos, mosquitos or sailfish while toying with his prey.",
      "He meets what seems like his match in Hassie Harrison's Zephyr, an American antisocial surf queen who lives in a van and refuses to be tied down. \u201cThere was nothing for me on land,\u201d she says. She's kind of a handful for any serial killer, For instance, she can pick locks with the underwire from a bikini top.",
      "Nick Lepard's screenplay is muscular and satisfying, with nods to \u201cJaws,\u201d of course, but also to \u201cPoint Break,\u201d \u201cHannibal\u201d and even the song \u201cBaby Shark.\u201d He says he was inspired to write \u201cDangerous Animals\u201d by seeing a surfboard bag and imagining it carrying a body, which says something about how Lepard's mind works, though we're not judging.",
      "Director Sean Byrnes has a super ability to build dread and his scenes are crisp without being exploitative. The movie was shot on Queensland\u2019s Gold Coast, but may take a bite out of the region's shark cage diving fleets. I'm looking twice even before taking showers now.",
      "Zephyr and the serial killer play an engaging game of chess for most of the movie, if by chess is meant she's fighting to stay alive by wriggling out of handcuffs and running or swimming away and he's determined for her to be shark food.",
      "\u201cOh, you're a fighter. I love fighters. It makes for a better show,\u201d he says, biting into the scenery almost as viciously as the sharks chomp on chum.",
      "He also does that thing that all serial killers do \u2014 saying he and his victim are similar. \u201cYou're hard as nails. Like me. You and me, we're sharks,\u201d he tells her. She tells him to stop talking so much and calls him ocean scum.",
      "The music department has a fun wink with the soundtrack. One scene uses Steve Wright's \u201cEvie (Part One)\u201d \u2014 in which the singer begs his love to let her hair hang down \u2014 as the serial killer makes mementos out of his victims' hair. Another moment, astonishingly, plays Etta James' \u201cAt Last,\u201d the ultimate wedding song, just as the bad guy finally captures his quarry inches from rescue.",
      "The setting of a boat in the middle of the Coral Sea unlocks a delicious new home for terror. Sealable hatches and no one for miles means screaming is no good. And the serial killer has weaponized Vegemite.",
      "One thing Zephyr has up her sleeve is a boy, smitten after a meet-cute in which she tries to shoplift ice cream. He's played by the hunky Josh Heuston and they're perfect for each other but she resists until she's snatched by our nasty boat captain. But even though she blew him off, her boy is suspicious about her disappearance and is on the hunt.",
      "\u201cDangerous Animals,\u201d thankfully, doesn't try to be more than it is, although the quite beautiful images of sharks sliding through the ocean show, naturally, that we are the species that inspired the title. After all, sharks don't see a surfboard bag and wonder if they can put a body in it.",
      "\u201cDangerous Animals,\u201d an IFC Films release in theaters Friday, is rated R for \u201cstrong, bloody violent content, grisly images, sexuality, language and brief drug use.\u201d Running time: 98 minutes. Three stars out of four.",

      "NEW YORK -- Kimberly Belflower knew \u201cJohn Proctor is the Villain\u201d needed its final cathartic scene to work \u2014 and, for that, it needed Lorde's \u201cGreen Light.\u201d",
      "\u201cI literally told my agent, \u2018I would rather the play just not get done if it can\u2019t use that song,\u2019\u201d the playwright laughed. She wrote Lorde a letter, explaining what the song meant, and got her green light.",
      "Starring Sadie Sink, the staggering play about high schoolers studying \u201cThe Crucible\u201d as the #MeToo movement arrives in their small Georgia town, earned seven Tony nominations, including best new play \u2014 the most of any this season. It\u2019s among a group of Broadway shows that have centered the stories of young people and attracted audiences to match.",
      "Sam Gold\u2019s Brooklyn-rave take on \u201cRomeo + Juliet,\u201d nominated for best revival of a play and led by Kit Connor and Rachel Zegler with music from Jack Antonoff, drew the youngest ticket-buying audience recorded on Broadway, producers reported, with 14% of ticket purchasers aged 18-24, compared to the industry average of 3%.",
      "The shows share some DNA: pop music (specifically the stylings of Antonoff, who also produced \u201cGreen Light\u201d), Hollywood stars with established fanbases and stories that reflect the complexity of young adulthood.",
      "\u201cIt was very clear that young people found our show because it was doing what theater\u2019s supposed to do,\u201d Gold said. \u201cBe a mirror.\u201d",
      "The themes \u201cJohn Proctor\u201d investigates aren't danced around (until they literally are). The girls are quick to discuss #MeToo's impact, intersectional feminism and sexual autonomy. Their conversations, true to teenage girlhood, are laced with comedy and pop culture references \u2014 Taylor Swift, Beyonc\u00e9, \u201cTwilight,\u201d and, of course, Lorde.",
      "Fina Strazza, 19, portrays Beth, a leader who is whip-smart and well-intentioned \u2014 but whose friendships and belief system are shaken by the play's revelations.",
      "\u201cYou have so much empathy and are so invested in her, but she still has these mishaps and slip-ups that young people often have,\u201d said Strazza, nominated for best featured actor in a play. Some audience members have given her letters detailing how Beth helped them forgive themselves for how they handled similar experiences.",
      "The script is written in prose, with frequent line breaks and infrequent capital letters. Director Danya Taymor, nominated for best direction of a play a year after winning a Tony for another teenage canon classic, \u201cThe Outsiders, \u201d was drawn to that rhythm \u2014 and how Belflower's depiction of adolescence captured its intensity, just as S.E. Hinton had.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something about the teenage years that is so raw,\u201d Taymor said. \u201cNone of us can escape it.\u201d",
      "During his Tony-winning production of \u201cAn Enemy of the People,\u201d Gold found himself having conversations with young actors and theatergoers about climate change, politics and how \u201ctheater was something that people their age and younger really need in a different way, as the world is becoming so addicted to technology,\u201d he said.",
      "That conjured \u201cRomeo and Juliet.\u201d The original text \u201chas it all in terms of what it means to inherit the future that people older than you have created,\u201d Gold said.",
      "Building the world of this show, with an ensemble under 30, was not unlike building \u201cAn Enemy of the People,\u201d set in 19th century Norway, Gold said: \u201cI think the difference is that the world that I made for this show is something that a very hungry audience had not gotten to see.\u201d",
      "Fans, Gold correctly predicted, were ravenous. Demand ahead of the first preview prompted a preemptive extension. Word (and bootleg video) of Connor doing a pullup to kiss Zegler made the rounds. \u201cMan of the House,\u201d an Antonoff-produced ballad sung by Zegler mid-show, was released as a single. With the show premiering just before the U.S. presidential election, Voters of Tomorrow even registered new voters in the lobby.",
      "Audiences proved willing to pay: Average ticket prices hovered around $150. Cheaper rush and lottery tickets drew lines hours before the box office opened. Every week but one sold out.",
      "\u201cThe show was initially really well sold because we had a cast that appealed to a really specific audience,\u201d said producer Greg Nobile of Seaview Productions. \u201cWe continued to see the houses sell out because these audiences came, and they were all over online talking about the ways in which they actually felt seen.\u201d",
      "Thomas Laub, 28, and Alyah Chanelle Scott, 27, started Runyonland Productions for that very reason.",
      "\u201cWe both felt a lot of frustration with the industry, and the ways that we were boxed out of it as students in Michigan who were able to come to New York sparingly,\u201d Laub said. Runyonland was launched in 2018 with the premise that highlighting new, bold voices would bring change.",
      "This spring, Scott, known for playing Whitney in HBO\u2019s \u201cSex Lives of College Girls,\u201d acted off-Broadway in Natalie Margolin's \u201cAll Nighter.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was standing onstage and looking out and seeing the college kids that I was playing,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI was like, \u2018I respect you so much. I want to do you proud. I want to show you a story that represents you in a way that doesn\u2019t belittle or demean you, but uplifts you.\u2019\u201d",
      "Co-producing \u201cJohn Proctor,\u201d Scott said, gave Runyonland the opportunity to target that audience on a Broadway scale. Belflower developed the show with students as part of a The Farm College Collaboration Project. It's been licensed over 100 times for high school and college productions. The Broadway production's social and influencer marketing is run by 20-somethings, too.",
      "Previews attracted fans with a $29 ticket lottery. While average prices jumped to over $100 last week (still below the Broadway-wide average), $40 rush, lottery and standing room tickets have sold out most nights, pushing capacity over 100%. The success is validating Runyonland's mission, Laub said.",
      "\u201cAlyah doesn\u2019t believe me that I cry every time at the end,\u201d Laub said. Scott laughs. \u201cI just want to assure you, on the record, that I do indeed cry every time.\u201d",
      "The final scene of \u201cJohn Proctor\u201d is a reclamation fueled by rage and \u201cGreen Light.\u201d Capturing that electricity has been key to the show's marketing.",
      "\u201cThe pullup (in \u2018Romeo + Juliet\u2019) is so impactful because it's so real. It's like so exactly what a teenage boy would do,\u201d Taymor said. \u201cI think when you see the girls in \u2018John Proctor\u2019 screaming ... it hits you in a visceral way.\u201d That screaming made the Playbill cover.",
      "\u201cIn my opinion, the look and feel of that campaign feels different from a traditional theatrical campaign, and it feels a lot closer to a film campaign,\u201d Laub said. The show's team indeed considered the zeitgeist-infiltrating work of their sister industries, specifically studios like Neon and A24.",
      "In May, \u201cJohn Proctor is the Villain\u201d finished its second \u201cspirit week\u201d with a school spirit day. Earlier events included an ice cream social \u2014 actors served Van Leeuwen \u2014 a silent disco and a banned book giveaway. For those not in their own school's colors, the merch stand offered T-shirts, including one printed with the Walt Whitman-channeling line said by Sink's Shelby: \u201cI contain frickin' multitudes.\u201d",
      "Julia Lawrence, 26, designed the shirt after the show's team saw her TikTok video reimagining their traditional merch into something more like a concert tee.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just so incredible to bring Gen Z into the theater that way, especially at a time when theater has never been more important,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cIn a world that\u2019s overpowered by screens, live art can be such a powerful way to find understanding.\u201d",

      "The annual Summertime Ball will be held at Wembley Stadium on Sunday, June 15.",
      "She told her social media audience that she felt compelled to share her diagnosis.",
      "\u201cI just wanted to be open and share it,\u201d she said. \u201cOne, because, selfishly, I do not talk about it enough. I\u2019m not processing it because I\u2019m working so hard. I also know how much sharing in the past has helped me with other people giving me their love and support and also their own stories. I\u2019m an open book. It breaks my heart that so many people are going through so much similar and worse \u2013 that\u2019s the bit that kills me.\u201d",
      "The Grammy-nominated Jessie J has long been celebrated for her robust soprano and R&B-informed pop hits, like the 2014 collaboration with Nicki Minaj and Ariana Grande, \u201cBang Bang,\u201d and 2011's \u201cDomino.\u201d",

      "So vividly drawn is Stephen King\u2019s fiction that it\u2019s offered the basis for some 50 feature films",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Stephen King \u2019s first editor, Bill Thompson, once said, \u201cSteve has a movie camera in his head.\u201d",
      "So vividly drawn is King\u2019s fiction that it\u2019s offered the basis for some 50 feature films. For half a century, since Brian De Palma\u2019s 1976 film \u201cCarrie,\u201d Hollywood has turned, and turned again, to King\u2019s books for their richness of character, nightmare and sheer entertainment.",
      "Open any of those books up at random, and there\u2019s a decent chance you\u2019ll encounter a movie reference, too. Rita Hayworth. \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain.\u201d Sometimes even movies based on King\u2019s books turn up in his novels. That King\u2019s books have been such fodder for the movies is owed, in part, to how much of a moviegoer their author is.",
      "\u201cI love anything from \u2018The 400 Blows\u2019 to something with that guy Jason Statham,\u201d King says, speaking by phone from his home in Maine. \u201cThe worst movie I ever saw was still a great way to spend an afternoon. The only movie I ever walked out on was \u2018Transformers.\u2019 At a certain point I said, \u2018This is just ridiculous.\u2019\u201d",
      "Over time, King has developed a personal policy in how he talks about the adaptations of his books. \u201cMy idea is: If you can\u2019t say something nice, keep your mouth shut,\u201d he says.",
      "The most notable exception was Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201cThe Shining,\u201d which King famously called \u201ca big beautiful Cadillac with no engine inside.\u201d But every now and then, King is such a fan of an adaptation that he\u2019s excited to talk about it. That\u2019s very much the case with \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d Mike Flanagan\u2019s new adaptation of King\u2019s novella of the same name published in the 2020 collection \u201cIf It Bleeds.\u201d",
      "In \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d which Neon releases in theaters Friday (nationwide June 13), there are separate storylines but the tone-setting opening is apocalyptic. The internet, like a dazed prize fighter, wobbles on its last legs before going down. California is said to be peeling away from the mainland like \u201clike old wallpaper.\u201d",
      "And yet in this doomsday tale, King is at his most sincere. \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d the book and the movie, is about what matters in life when everything else is lost. There is dancing, Walt Whitman and joy.",
      "\u201cIn \u2018The Life of Chuck,\u2019 we understand that this guy\u2019s life is cut short, but that doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t experience joy,\u201d says King. \u201cExistential dread and grief and things are part of the human experience, but so is joy.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s telling that when King, our preeminent purveyor of horror, writes about doom times, he ends up scaling it down to a single life. While darkness and doom have, and probably always will, mark his work, King \u2014 a more playful, instinctual, genre-skipping writer than he\u2019s often credited as \u2014 \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d is a prime example of King, the humanist.",
      "\u201cAn awful lot of people assume, because he writes so much stuff that\u2019s so scary, they kind of forget the reason his horror works so well is he\u2019s always juxtaposing it with light and with love and with empathy,\u201d says Flanagan, who has twice before adapted King (\u201cDoctor Sleep,\u201d \u201cGerald\u2019s Game\u201d) and is in the midst of making a \u201cCarrie\u201d series for Amazon.",
      "\u201cYou forget that \u2018It\u2019 isn\u2019t about the clown, it\u2019s about the kids and their friendship,\" adds Flanagan. \u201c\u2018The Stand\u2019 isn\u2019t about the virus or the demon taking over the world, it\u2019s ordinary people who have to come together and stand against a force they cannot defeat.\u201d",
      "King, 77, has now written somewhere around 80 books, including the just released \u201cNever Flinch.\u201d The mystery thriller brings back King\u2019s recent favorite protagonist, the private investigator Holly Gibney, who made her stand-alone debut in \u201cIf It Bleeds.\u201d It\u2019s Gibney\u2019s insecurities, and her willingness to push against them, that has kept King returning to her.",
      "\u201cIt gave me great pleasure to see Holly grow into a more confident person,\u201d King says. \u201cShe never outgrows all of her insecurities, though. None of us do.\u201d",
      "\u201cNever Flinch\u201d is a reminder that King has always been less of a genre-first writer than a character-first one. He tends to fall in love with a character and follow them through thick and thin.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always happy writing. That\u2019s why I do it so much,\u201d King says, chuckling. \u201cI\u2019m a very chipper guy because I get rid of all that dark stuff in the books.\u201d",
      "Dark stuff, as King says, hasn\u2019t been hard to come by lately, he grants. The kind of climate change disaster found in \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d King says, often dominates his anxieties.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re creeping up little by little on being the one country who does not acknowledge it\u2019s a real problem with carbon in the atmosphere,\u201d King says. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy. Certain right wing politicians can talk all they want about how we\u2019re saving the world for our grandchildren. They don\u2019t care about that. They care about money.\u201d",
      "On social media, King has been a sometimes critic of President Donald Trump, whose second term has included battles with the arts, academia and public financing for PBS and NPR. Over the next four years, King predicts, \u201cCulture is going to go underground.\u201d",
      "In \u201cNever Finch,\u201d Holly Gibney is hired as a bodyguard by a women\u2019s rights activist whose lecture tour is being plagued by mysterious acts of violence. In the afterward of the book, King includes a tribute to \u201csupporters of women\u2019s right to choose who have been murdered for doing their duty.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re not going to like that,\u201d King says of right-wing critics.",
      "The original germ for \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d had nothing to do with current events. One day in Boston, King noticed a drummer busking on Boylston Street. He had the vision of a businessman in a suit who, walking by, can\u2019t resist dancing with abandon to the drummer\u2019s beat.",
      "King, a self-acknowledged dancer (though only in private, he notes), latched onto a story that would turn on the unpredictable nature of people, tracing the inner life of that imagined passerby. In the film, he\u2019s played by Tom Hiddleston. Chuck first appears, oddly, on a billboard that haunts and confuses a local teacher (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who's struggling to get his students to care about literature or education with the possible end of the world encroaching.",
      "It\u2019s a funny but maybe not coincidental irony that many of the best King adaptations, like \u201cStand By Me\u201d and \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption,\" have come from the author\u2019s more warm-hearted tales. \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d which won the People\u2019s Choice Award last fall at the Toronto International Film Festival, is after a similar spirit.",
      "When King reached out about attending the TIFF world premiere, Flanagan was shocked. The last time King had done that for one of his own adaptations was 26 years ago, for \u201cThe Green Mile.\u201d That movie, like \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\u201d were box-office disappointments, King recalls, a fate he's hoping \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d can avoid.",
      "\u201cHe views this movie as something that\u2019s a bit precious,\u201d says Flanagan. \u201cHe\u2019s said a few things to me in the past about how earnest it is, how this is a story without an ounce of cynicism.

      "\u201cWicked\u201d star Cynthia Erivo will release her sophomore solo album on Friday",
      "NEW YORK -- It began as it always should, with her voice.",
      "The second solo album from Cynthia Erivo, fresh off a herculean press run with the success of the first \u201cWicked\u201d film, was always meant to be \u201cvocal-focused,\u201d she told The Associated Press recently. It may be the understatement of a lifetime: to know her is to know her instrument \u2014 that range, the notes few else can hit but many attempt.",
      "And Erivo's new soulful album, the evocatively titled \u201cI Forgive You,\" hits the mark.",
      "In the studio, that meant using her vocals \u201cas the pads, as the stacking,\u201d like an artist might with a guitar or piano. \u201cThe meat of each of the pieces that you listen to is the voice,\u201d she says, \u201cSo that you can hear the lyrics, you can hear the song, you can hear the emotion in it,\u201d she explains. The other instruments, too, were performed live. \"Everything you hear in there is real and tangible.\u201d",
      "For that reason \u2014 and other expressions of autonomy take across the album \u2014 she says it felt like her first. For the listener, it evokes a real feeling of intimacy.",
      "Erivo spoke to the AP about \u201cI Forgive You,\u201d life after \u201cWicked\" and the forthcoming \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d and the ways in which acting, singing and writing inform one another.",
      "This interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "ERIVO: This album is a collection of stories and songs that are both personal for things that are happening now, things that have happened in the past, and I think some of which I have had to forgive people for. And honestly, some of which I\u2019ve had to forgive myself for. And I loved the idea of calling it this title, because it\u2019s a simple concept, but not an easy one. And not one that we as humans are very good at, often.",
      "A part of me was feeling, like, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if people had to keep repeating the words, 'I forgive you?'\u201d So even if you\u2019re finding it difficult to say this album will give you the permission to actually say the words, even if you\u2019re not quite ready.",
      "ERIVO: The concept of being a work in progress \u2014 who still gets scared of things, who still has to deal with things \u2014 that won\u2019t ever necessarily stop. It might get quiet, but that feeling doesn\u2019t necessarily always go away. I just wanted to be honest, and I think that \u201cReplay\u201d was probably the first song that I put out was because I felt like it was sort of a reintroduction to the inner part of me that most people might not really know.",
      "But it\u2019s also a tricky song in that it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s kind of upbeat, and if you actually listen, you hear that there\u2019s like a person who\u2019s a little bit fragile, a person whose trying to figure some things out, a person who\u2019s been through some things, who\u2019s dealt with things, who has abandonment issues, who has fear, who an inferiority complex sometimes, who wants to help everyone, who wants to save everyone, but gets it wrong.",
      "Those are human, human things that I want to share.",
      "ERIVO: No apprehension about writing it, a little apprehension about sharing it, because it\u2019s honest. But once it\u2019s done, what can you do? It\u2019s time to share.",
      "ERIVO: They feed each other. When I sing, I feel free and I feel open, which means that when I go and act \u2014 because I\u2019ve given myself that experience \u2014 the want to close off again sort of goes away. So, when I\u2019m on a set, I\u2019m as open as I am when I am singing. I\u2019m waiting to receive whatever I\u2019m getting from my counterpart or whoever\u2019s opposite me so I can actually listen. Because the act of writing and singing actually is also the act of listening.",
      "ERIVO: I had a sort of level of anonymity that I think I got used to and I really kind of enjoyed. That isn\u2019t necessarily there anymore, which is still really lovely because people are kind and sweet, and I\u2019m really grateful for it. But that\u2019s an adjustment, to realize that you can\u2019t just walk into a store and no one will know who you are, or you can\u2019t get on a plane, and no one will there you are. That\u2019s a new thing that I didn\u2019t expect or wasn't seeking.",
      "ERIVO: We have a couple pickups and then we\u2019re done.",
      "ERIVO: I\u2019m so proud of it. We spent a lot of time on it. We worked really, really hard on it. There was no stone unturned on it because I love what I do, and I love music, and I loved making it.",
      "So just know that this was made with a lot of love.",

      "Getting to call a Stanley Cup Final for the third time on national television would qualify as the top moment of the year for most announcers.",
      "For TNT's Kenny Albert, it is another accomplishment in a year that has been filled with many, especially over the past nine months.",
      "Wednesday's Game 1 between the Florida Panthers and Edmonton Oilers will be Albert's 1,483rd call in hockey, football or baseball for a national network. He moved past his father, the legendary Marv Albert, into fourth place among North American announcers during last Wednesday's Game 5 of the Eastern Conference final between Florida and Carolina.",
      "\u201cTo be listed along with some of the all-time greats who I watched growing up and then got to know a lot of them personally, it\u2019s a proud moment when you see that you\u2019re included in that group,\u201d Albert said. \u201cMy schedule definitely is a bit of a jigsaw puzzle between the various sports and networks, but very fortunate to work for and with so many great people.\u201d",
      "Albert surpassed the 500 games mark in both the NFL and NHL within a six-month period.",
      "He became the first NFL play-by-play announcer to reach 500 games on one network last October when the Philadelphia Eagles hosted the Cleveland Browns in a game televised by Fox. He has been with Fox Sports since its beginning in 1994.",
      "He surpassed 500 national NHL games on Dec. 18 when the Philadelphia Flyers faced the Detroit Red Wings on TNT. Albert has been TNT's top hockey announcer since it got the rights in 2021.",
      "All told, Albert has done 534 NHL, 512 NFL, 421 baseball and 15 NBA games on a national broadcast or cable network. That is on top of his other duties as New York Rangers radio voice and backup for New York Knicks television games on MSG Network.",
      "Albert's versatility to do a plethora of different sports was something he picked up from his father. Even though Marv Albert's signature sport was the NBA, he also did the NFL and NHL along with hosting the baseball pregame show during the late 1980s on NBC.",
      "\u201cI've always loved the variety,\u201d Kenny Albert said.",
      "For all of the aforementioned accomplishments, though, the highlight of Albert's year so far was calling Alex Ovechkin's 895th NHL goal on April 6 to break Wayne Gretzky's career record. Albert's call during the second period, when the Washington Capitals star set the record against the New York Islanders, relayed excitement while also mentioning the goal number and then going silent so that the crowd and scenes from the crowd could take over.",
      "\u201cIn a championship situation or big moment, I don't usually write something out, but I do throw some words around in my mind just to be ready,\u201d Albert said. \"I was thinking something with his nickname, the Great Eight, the great Gretzky. When he tied the record, Joe Beninati (the Capitals TV announcer) used something similar to that, so I wanted to shift over to something else and not use some of the same words he did.",
      "\u201cWhen it happened, it just came out naturally. I mentioned No. 895 and then I just got out of the way. It was very important after the call to just lay out and let the production folks do their thing. Let the pictures and sound tell the story.\u201d",
      "According to TV database research compiled by Un/Necessary Sports Research, the late Bob Cole, who called the games for CBC\u2019s \u201cHockey Night in Canada\u201d for 50 years, leads the way at 1,722 (all hockey) games; followed by Dick Stockton, who did basketball, baseball and football for CBS and Fox, with 1,544; and Canadian play-by-play announcer Chris Cuthbert with 1,539. Cuthbert, the current lead voice for \u201cHockey Night in Canada\u201d will surpass Stockton if the Stanley Cup Final goes six games.",
      "Kevin Harlan is sixth at 1,477 and should surpass Marv Albert (1,481) for fifth during Week 5 of the upcoming NFL season.",
      "This will be the 11th Stanley Cup Final for Albert, including eight on radio, but the first where he has called a rematch from the previous year. This is the first final rematch since the Detroit Red Wings and Pittsburgh Penguins in 2009 and the second over the past 40 years.",
      "\u201cIt has a chance to be one of the all-time great championship series,\" Albert said. \"These same teams played a scintillating seven-game series last June. Star power on both sides. Edmonton attempting to win Canada\u2019s first Cup since 1993. Florida looking to repeat. Can Connor McDavid match Wayne Gretzky and Sidney Crosby and win his first Stanley Cup against the team that beat his club in the Cup Final the year before? I can\u2019t wait.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "British writer Bernardine Evaristo has won the Women\u2019s Prize Outstanding Contribution Award for her \u201ctransformative impact on literature.\u201d",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Bernardine Evaristo doesn't like boundaries.",
      "For the Booker Prize -winning novelist, rules about genre, grammar or what a working-class biracial woman can achieve are all to be challenged and swept away.",
      "Evaristo was announced Wednesday as recipient of the 100,000-pound ($135,000) Women\u2019s Prize Outstanding Contribution Award for her \u201ctransformative impact on literature and her unwavering dedication to uplifting under-represented voices.\"",
      "Evaristo, 66, received the prize both for her work to help promote women and writers of color, and for writing that takes in poetry, a memoir and seven novels including the Booker-winning \u201cGirl, Woman, Other.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just go wherever my imagination takes me,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to write the kind of novels that would take you on a predictable emotional or moral journey.\u201d",
      "Evaristo had already explored autobiographical fiction, historical settings and alternate realities when she won the Booker in 2019 for \u201cGirl Woman, Other,\u201d a polyphonic novel told from the point of view of a dozen characters, largely Black women, with widely varying ages, experiences and sexualities.",
      "She was the first woman of African heritage to be awarded the prize, which was founded in 1969 and has a reputation for transforming writers\u2019 careers.",
      "When she won, Evaristo was 60 and had been a writer for decades. She says the recognition \u201ccame at the right time for me.\u201d",
      "\u201cMaybe I wouldn\u2019t have handled it so well if I was younger,\u201d she told The Associated Press at her London home. \u201cIt changed my career \u2013- in terms of book sales, foreign rights, translation, the way in which I was viewed as a writer. Various other opportunities came my way. And I felt that I had the foundations to handle that.\u201d",
      "Evaristo\u2019s house on a quiet suburban street is bright and comfortable, with wooden floors, vibrant textiles and a large wooden writing desk by the front window. Large photos of her Nigerian paternal grandparents hang on one wall. Her work often draws on her roots as the London-born child of a Nigerian father and white British mother.",
      "Like much of Evaristo\u2019s work, \u201cGirl, Woman, Other\u201d eludes classification. She calls it \u201cfusion fiction\u201d for its melding of poetry and prose into a novel that relishes the texture and rhythm of language.",
      "\u201cI kind of dispense with the rules of grammar,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I have 12 full stops in the novel.\u201d",
      "If that sounds dauntingly experimental, readers didn\u2019t think so. \u201cGirl, Woman, Other\u201d has sold more than 1 million copies and was chosen as one of Barack Obama\u2019s books of the year.",
      "Evaristo traces her love of poetry to the church services of her Catholic childhood, where she soaked up the rhythms of the Bible and sermons, \u201cwithout realizing I was absorbing poetry.\u201d",
      "When she started writing novels, the love of poetry remained, along with a desire to tell stories of the African diaspora. One of her first major successes, \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s Babe,\u201d is a verse novel set in Roman Britain.",
      "\u201cMost people think the Black history of Britain only began in the 20th century,\u201d Evaristo said. \u201cI wanted to write about a Black presence in Roman Britain -\u2013 because there was a Black presence in Roman Britain 1,800 years ago.\u201d",
      "Another novel, \u201cBlonde Roots,\u201d is set in an alternative historical timeline in which Africans have enslaved Europeans, and was nominated for a major science-fiction award.",
      "\u201cMr Loverman,\u201d which centers on a closeted gay 70-something Antiguan Londoner, was an attempt to move beyond cliched images of Britain\u2019s postwar Caribbean immigrants. It was recently made into a BBC television series starring Lennie James and Sharon D. Clarke.",
      "Her latest award is a one-off accolade marking the 30th anniversary of the annual Women\u2019s Prizes for English-language fiction and nonfiction.",
      "Women\u2019s Prize founder Kate Mosse said Evaristo\u2019s \u201cdazzling skill and imagination, and her courage to take risks and offer readers a pathway into diverse and multifarious worlds over a 40-year career made her the ideal recipient.\u201d",
      "Evaristo, who teaches creative writing at Brunel University of London, plans to use the prize money to help other women writers through an as-yet undisclosed project.",
      "She has long been involved with projects to level the playing field for under-represented writers, and is especially proud of Complete Works, a mentoring program for poets of color that she ran for a decade.",
      "\u201cI set that up because I initiated research into how many poets of color were getting published in Britain at that time, and it was under 1%\u201d of the total, she said. A decade later, it was 10%.",
      "\"It really has helped shift the poetry landscape in the U.K.,\" she said.",
      "Evaristo followed \u201cGirl, Woman, Other\u201d with \u201cManifesto,\u201d a memoir that recounts the stark racism of her 1960s London childhood, as well as her lifelong battle for creative expression and freedom.",
      "If Evaristo grew up as an outsider, these days she is ensconced in the arts establishment: professor, Booker winner, Officer of the Order of the British Empire, or OBE, and president of the 200-year-old Royal Society of Literature.",
      "That milestone -\u2013 she\u2019s the first person of color and the second woman to head the RSL -\u2013 has not been trouble-free. The society has been ruffled by free speech tows and arguments over attempts to bring in younger writers and diversify its ranks -\u2013 moves seen by some as watering down the accolade of membership.",
      "Evaristo doesn\u2019t want to talk about the controversy, but notes that as figurehead president she does not run the society.",
      "She says Britain has come a long way since her childhood but \u201cwe have to be vigilant.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe country I grew up in is not the country I\u2019m in today,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve made a lot of progress, and I feel that we need to work hard to maintain it, especially in the current political climate where it feels as if the forces are against progress, and proudly so.",
      "\u201cWorking towards an anti-racist society is something that we should value, and I hope we do, and that we don\u2019t backslide too much.\u201d",

      "Joss was best known as the voice of John Redcorn, a Native American character on the popular \u201cKing of the Hill\u201d animated series, which ran for 13 seasons from 1997 to 2008. A reboot of the show, which Joss had already worked on, is set to start in August.",
      "Joss also had a recurring role on the television show \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d playing Chief Ken Hotate. He appeared in two episodes of the series \u201cTulsa King\u201d in 2022.",
      "Joss' childhood home, where he still lived, burned down in January. He lost all his belongings and his three dogs were killed in the blaze. A GoFundMe account had been set up to help Joss and his husband, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, get back on their feet.",
      "\u201cWe may have lost our home, but not our hope. We\u2019re moving forward with love, humor, and a little elbow grease\u2026and we\u2019re incredibly grateful for every ounce of support,\u201d Joss said in a May 14 Facebook post in which he indicated he was in Los Angeles looking for a new home.",
      "By the end of May, Joss was back in Texas, and on Saturday, he took part in a live music performance in Austin, located about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northeast of San Antonio.",
      "Sigfredo Ceja Alvarez, 56, is accused by police of confronting Joss and his husband as they were checking their mail at the burned-down home Sunday night.",
      "In a statement, de Gonzales alleged that when Ceja Alvarez opened fire, Joss pushed his husband out of the way and saved his life.",
      "Ceja Alvarez was charged with murder. Court records indicate he was freed Monday on a $200,000 bond.",
      "Ceja Alvarez\u2019s attorney, Alfonso Otero, did not immediately return a call or an email seeking comment.",
      "Robert Rios, a friend of Joss\u2019, told TV station KSAT that Joss and Ceja Alvarez were neighbors and the two had argued for years.",
      "Actor Chris Pratt, who worked with Joss on \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d fondly remembered the actor in an Instagram story on Monday. Both actors had also appeared in the 2016 remake of \u201cThe Magnificent Seven.\u201d",
      "\u201cDamn. RIP Jonathan. Always such a kind dude,\u201d Pratt wrote. \u201cSad to see. Prayers up. Hug your loved ones.\u201d",
      "In a Facebook post, San Antonio-based Our Lady of the Lake University, Joss\u2019 alma mater, called him \u201ca trailblazer in his field. His work and advocacy have left a lasting impact, and his legacy will continue to inspire.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou were more than a character \u2014 you were a storyteller, a dreamer, and a force that will never be forgotten,\u201d comedian Roy Alex Gomez, who was a friend of Joss, wrote in a Facebook post.",

      "A federal judge sentenced disbarred celebrity lawyer Tom Girardi to seven years and three months in prison for embezzling tens of millions of dollars from his clients, including several with severe physical injuries and families of people killed in acc...",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A federal judge sentenced disbarred celebrity lawyer Tom Girardi to seven years and three months in prison on Tuesday for embezzling tens of millions of dollars from his clients, including several with severe physical injuries and families of people killed in accidents.",
      "U.S. District Judge Josephine L. Staton also ordered Girardi, 86, to pay a $35,000 fine and $2.3 million in restitution to former clients. A jury in August found him guilty of four counts of wire fraud, and he could have been sentenced to up to 80 years in prison.",
      "Girardi is the estranged husband of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\u201d star Erika Jayne and appeared on the show himself dozens of times between 2015 and 2020.",
      "He was once among the most prominent lawyers in the nation, often representing victims of major disasters against powerful companies. One lawsuit against California\u2019s Pacific Gas and Electric utility led to a $333 million settlement and was portrayed in the 2000 Julia Roberts film \u201cErin Brockovich.\u201d",
      "But his law empire collapsed, and he was disbarred in California in 2022 over client thefts.",
      "Girardi has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and issues with his memory led another court to put him in a conservatorship under his brother. But on Monday, Staton ruled that he was mentally competent to be sentenced, just as she had previously found him mentally competent to stand trial.",
      "The judge had allowed him to remain free until his sentencing but ordered him to surrender to authorities by July 17.",
      "An email to Girardi\u2019s attorney seeking comment on the conviction was not immediately answered.",
      "Former clients who testified against Girardi at his trial included an Arizona woman whose husband was killed in a boat accident and victims who were burned in a 2010 gas pipeline explosion in San Bruno, south of San Francisco.",
      "Prosecutors played jurors voicemails in which Girardi gave a litany of false reasons money that a court had awarded could not be paid, including tax and debt obligations and judge authorizations. He frequently told them, \u201cDon't be mad at me.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Don't bother asking Kara Young which one of her roles is her favorite. They're all her favorite.",
      "\u201cEvery single time I\u2019m doing a show, I feel like it is the most important thing on the planet,\u201d she says. \u201cI don't have a favorite. It\u2019s like this: Every, every single project has held its own weight.\u201d",
      "Right now, the weighty project on her mind is Broadway's celebrated \u201cPurpose,\u201d Branden Jacobs-Jenkins\u2019 drawing-room drama at the Helen Hayes Theater about an accomplished Black family revealing its hypocrisy and fault lines during a snowed-in gathering.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much in this play,\u201d says Young, who plays an outsider who witnesses the implosion. \u201cLike a lot of the great writers, he creates these universes in a line or the space between the words.\u201d",
      "\u201cPurpose\u201d is set in the Jasper family\u2019s living room in an upper-middle-class neighborhood in Chicago. The patriarch is Pastor Solomon Jasper, a Civil Rights legend, and his steely wife, Claudine.",
      "They are reuniting with their two sons \u2014 Junior, a disgraced former state senator, recently released after serving a prison sentence for embezzling funds, and Naz, who fled divinity school and is now a nature photographer.",
      "Young plays Aziza, a Harlem-bred social worker who has been close friends with Naz but didn't know anything about his family. \u201cThis kind of thing never happens to me! I never meet famous people and you\u2019ve been famous this whole time?\u201d she screams.",
      "Her awe quickly fades as sibling jealousies, parental frustrations, past sins and the pressures of legacy come tumbling out over a fraught dinner. There is some slapping.",
      "\u201cWe are so susceptible to get angry with the people we love the most,\u201d says Young. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in the less than 12 hours of them being together for the first time in two years, they\u2019re sitting down and having dinner, and all of these things come up, as they often do.\u201d",
      "Young's work has earned her a Tony Award nomination and a chance to make history. Already the first Black person to be nominated four times consecutively, if she wins, she\u2019ll be the first Black performer to win two Tonys in a row.",
      "Young made her Broadway debut in 2021 in \u201cClyde\u2019s,\u201d was in \u201cCost of Living\u201d the next year and co-starred opposite Leslie Odom Jr. in 2024's \u201cPurlie Victorious: A Non-Confederate Romp Through the Cotton Patch,\u201d winning a Tony.",
      "Jacobs-Jenkins calls Aziz in his script a \u201cdeeply perceptive person and empathetic\u201d and that could also apply to Young, She says she closely identifies with her character in \u201cPurpose,\u201d \u2014 they're both Harlem-bred advocates for others, hoping to make the planet better.",
      "\u201cI feel connected to that core of her,\u201d says Young. \u201cEvery single play I've done since my 10-minute play festivals, I\u2019m always like, \u2018Wow, this feels like this can change the world,\u2019 you know? And I feel like at the core of Aziza, that\u2019s how she feels. She wants to change the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cPurpose,\u201d directed by Phylicia Rashad, also stars LaTanya Richardson Jackson, Harry Lennix, Jon Michael Hill, Alana Arenas and Glenn Davis.",
      "Hill, who as Naz also earned a Tony nomination for best lead male actor in a play, calls Young \u201cthe heart and joy of our little family over there at the Helen Hayes.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe enters the building and she just makes time for everyone and is genuinely excited to see people and hear about how they\u2019re doing,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve really never seen anyone have as much room in their consciousness and their being for everyone she encounters. She approaches every day with joy and curiosity and enthusiasm.\u201d",
      "If there's one story that shows who Young is, it would be from the day of the Met Gala, which she and cast members of \u201cPurpose\u201d were invited, along with its playwright. That same day, Jacobs-Jenkins won the Pulitzer Prize for drama.",
      "Young found out while getting her makeup done and began screaming. When she got to the gala \u2014 a look-at-me moment, if there ever was one \u2014 she was a walking advertisement for the play. \u201cI told everybody, \u2018You have to come and see this play. He just won a Pulitzer!\u2019\u201d",
      "Hill was right behind her and smiling as Young made connections and introductions. \u201cShe was just going up to everyone and introducing us and talking about our show and trying to get folks in the door.\u201d",
      "Young made her 2016 stage debut in Patricia Ione Lloyd\u2019s play \u201cPretty Hunger\u201d at the Public Theater, a play about a 7-year-old Black girl who didn't know she was Black. The playwright told her she wrote it with Young in mind.",
      "\u201cIone Lloyd is one of the people who really made me see myself as an artist,\u201d she says. \u201cShe\u2019s the one that kind of set a path for me in a really beautiful way.\u201d",
      "Next up for Young is the movie \u201cIs God Is,\u201d which playwright Aleshea Harris is directing from her own 2018 stage play. Sterling K. Brown, Vivica A. Fox and Janelle Mon\u00e1e are in the cast.

      "After that, who knows? \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s next, but I can\u2019t wait, whatever that is,\u201d she says. \u201cIf something comes along, it\u2019s about jumping into the next thing. If there\u2019s life in me, I got to live it.\u201d",

      "The content has drawn a mix of praise from fans for working with local nonprofits to support previously unfunded projects and pushback from critics who accused Donaldson of exploiting vulnerable people for clickbait \u201cinspiration porn.\u201d Campaigns have involved treating rheumatic heart disease in Nigeria and protecting endangered animals in Kenya. Other examples include building wells in countries across Africa and covering the cost of cataract surgery for 1,000 people.",
      "The call also signals Donaldson\u2019s continued philanthropic presence after comments suggesting he would get \u201cless hate\u201d if he stepped away from philanthropy altogether.

      "One evening while watching the Oort Cloud scene, scientists noticed something strange projected onto the planetarium's dome.",
      "\u201cWhy is there a spiral there?\u201d said Jackie Faherty, an astrophysicist who leads the museum\u2019s educational programs and helped put together the planetarium show.",
      "The inner section of the Oort Cloud, made of billions of comets, resembled a bar with two waving arms, similar to the shape of our Milky Way galaxy.",
      "Scientists had long thought the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, warped by the push and pull of other planets and the Milky Way itself. The planetarium show hinted that a more complex shape could lie inside.",

      "The discovery, relying on data on how celestial objects move and using simulations, will be difficult to confirm with observations. But knowing more about the orbits of distant comets could give scientists some clues, Izidoro said.",
      "While putting together the planetarium show, the museum's experts weren't expecting a window into the universe's inner workings. The show, narrated by actor Pedro Pascal, features many vivid scenes that may capture audiences more than the Oort Cloud, said the museum's Jon Parker \u2014 including an ongoing merge of the Sagittarius mini galaxy with the Milky Way.",

      "When he was first asked to lead the Broadway hit musical \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d director and choreographer Christopher Gattelli loved it, but refused to work on the big, splashy opening number",
      "NEW YORK -- When he was first asked to helm the Broadway hit musical \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d director and choreographer Christopher Gattelli loved it, but refused to work on the big, splashy opening number. It was just too delicious.",
      "\u201cWhen they sent it to me, I was cooking and I burnt dinner because my mind was spinning,\" he says. \"I was, like, \u2018This is a gift. I will never get an opening number like this again.\u2019\u201d",
      "So Gattelli worked out everything else about how to put Robert Zemeckis\u2019 1992 comic cult classic onto a stage and only then turned to the big, brassy song, \u201cFor the Gaze,\u201d a winking valentine to gay men, punning along the way.",
      "\u201cI was able to do the show and then have my full brain on that number because I knew the potential of what it could be,\u201d he says.",
      "What Gattelli crafted is an opening number for the ages, led by Megan Hilty: There are mid-song costume changes, dance breaks, chorus boys hoisting Hilty, spangly jumpsuits and tuxedos, high-kicking Vegas showgirls with feather headdresses, a body double doing somersaults, a rainbow flag of top-hatted dancers, and Hilty doing a Liza Minnelli cameo, all ending with the grand finale of Hilty as Judy Garland's Dorothy from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d complete with a little stuffed dog.",
      "\u201cI heard the pocket in that song, and I was like, \u2018I know there\u2019s a giant laugh there. I can hear giant laughs, what\u2019s that giant laugh?'\u201d says Gattelli. \u201cWhat\u2019s the biggest gay reference? Then I literally I just worked backwards.\u201d",
      "That number telegraphs to the audience exactly what to expect for the rest of the night \u2014 a perfectly rehearsed, lushly costumed, silly, self-aware comedy.",
      "\u201cOnce we hit \u2018For the Gaze,\u2019 the audience knows exactly what the show is,\" he says. \"And then I think they\u2019re in for the ride.\u201d",
      "The work on \u201cFor the Gaze\u201d has helped Gattelli see his show earn 10 Tony Award nominations, including one for his Broadway debut as a director and another for his choreography.",
      "The musical is based on the film, which starred Meryl Streep as a self-centered actor and Goldie Hawn as her suffering-in-the-shadows writer friend. Their mutual desperate measures for achieving eternal youth turn comically grotesque. Hilty plays the Streep role, while Jennifer Simard plays the Hawn one.",
      "\u201cIt felt like just the perfect fit for what I do and what I love to do,\" Gattelli says. \"I love comedy and I love to direct comedy and I love to do these big splashy numbers. It felt like everything I\u2019ve been itching to do.\u201d",
      "Gattelli \u2014 who was a dancer in the original \u201cCats\u201d \u2014 has been a mainstay on Broadway of late, able to choreograph such venerable works as \u201cThe King and I\u201d and \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d but also irreverent musicals as \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants\u201d and the jukebox variety, like \u201cThe Cher Show.\u201d",
      "He made his directing debut off-Broadway in 2011 with \u201cSilence!\u201d a parody musical of \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs,\u201d complete with a chorus of dancing lambs running across the stage.",
      "Lowe Cunningham, lead producer of \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d saw it in Los Angeles and later asked Gattelli about the experience, how he collaborated and his approach to the work. She was impressed by his openness to all ideas and his caring.",
      "\u201cI think first and foremost, his talent is clear and it\u2019s been out there in the world of choreography for a long time. He is innovative, he does things other people aren\u2019t doing, but the other thing is that he\u2019s renowned as being an incredibly kind human being,\u201d she says.",
      "Gattelli, who won a 2012 Tony for choreographing \u201cNewsies the Musical\u201d \u2014 one of his show-stopping moments was dancers sliding on newspapers \u2014 was brought in relatively late to \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d only a year and half before opening on Broadway.",
      "\u201cIt was a great lesson in trusting your instincts,\u201d he says. \u201cThey said, \u2018We want a lush, opulent, sexy, magical sparkling evening.\u2019 And we just started taking big swings.\u201d",
      "It started with \u2014 of all things \u2014 the curtain. The audience filing into the theater is greeted by a purple, royal fabric. \u201cWhen people walk in, they immediately feel like that it\u2019s lush and sexy and mysterious.\u201d",
      "The musical is filled with very funny special effects that are decidedly low-tech. At one point, the two leading ladies are replaced by two men duking it out in dresses and wigs. The audience roars at the deception and Gattelli even advised one of the male combatants not to shave his arm hair.",
      "\u201cThe audience is in on the joke,\u201d he says. \u201cI love that they go on that ride with us. They\u2019re laughing with us. We\u2019re all laughing together and it feels good.\u201d",
      "One scene from the movie needed a lot of planning to make it on stage: The tumble down the elegant mansion stairs by Hilty's character. Hollywood CGI magic would have to be replicated by Broadway ingenuity.",
      "\u201cThe people that know the movie and the fans especially are going to go, \u2018How are they going to do it?\u2019 It was keeping me up at night forever because we tried everything,\u201d says Gattelli.",
      "The creative team \u2014 which also included set designer Derek McLane, lighting designer Justin Townsend and sound designer Peter Hylenski \u2014 decided to make it a dance punctuated by sound effects.",
      "Warren Yang \u2014 an actor with a gymnastics background \u2014 wears Hilty's outfit and a wig as he tumbles slowly, acrobatically and theatrically down the stairs, somersaulting as thunder sounds crash and we hear what seems like bones cracking. (The stairs were made of the rubber Neoprene for safety.)",
      "\u201cThere are very simple techniques that make a big impact,\u201d says Gattelli. \u201cI just went back to it\u2019s a beautiful, lush, gorgeous show, but, at the core, it\u2019s just theatrical magic and stagecraft.\u201d",

      "\u201cLilo & Stich\u201d and \u201cMission: Impossible\u2014The Final Reckoning\u201d dominated the box office charts again after fueling a record-breaking Memorial Day weekend. Theaters in the U.S. and Canada had several new films to offer this weekend as well, including Sony\u2019s family friendly \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d and the A24 horror movie \u201cBring Her Back. \u201d According to studio estimates Sunday, it added up to a robust $149 million post-holiday weekend that\u2019s up over 120% from the same timeframe last year.",
      "Disney\u2019s live-action hybrid \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d took first place again with $63 million from 4,410 locations in North America. It was enough to pass \u201cSinners\u201d to become the second-highest grossing movie of the year with $280.1 million in domestic ticket sales. Globally, its running total is $610.8 million. \u201cSinners,\u201d meanwhile, is still going strong in its seventh weekend with another $5.2 million, bumping it to $267.1 million domestically and $350.1 million globally.",
      "The eighth \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d movie also repeated in second place, with $27.3 million from 3,861 locations. As with \u201cLilo & Stitch,\u201d that's down 57% from its opening. With $122.6 million in domestic tickets sold, it\u2019s performing in line with the two previous installments. But with a reported production budget of $400 million, profitability is a ways off. Internationally, it added $76.1 million (including $25.2 million from China where it just opened), bringing its global total to $353.8 million.",
      "\u201cThis is the year of longterm playability,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore\u2019s senior media analyst. \u201cThe currency of word of mouth and the strong hold is more important than opening weekend dollars.\u201d",
      "Leading the newcomers was Sony\u2019s \u201cKarate Kid: Legends,\u201d with an estimated $21 million from 3,809 locations. The movie brings Jackie Chan and Ralph Macchio together to train a new kid, the kung fu prodigy Li Fong ( Ben Wang ). Chan starred in a 2010 reboot of the 1984 original, while Macchio has found a new generation of fans in the series \u201cCobra Kai,\u201d which just concluded a six-season run.",
      "Reviews might have been mixed, but opening weekend audiences gave the PG-13 rated film a strong A- CinemaScore and 4.5 stars on PostTrak. It also only cost a reported $45 million to produce and has several weeks until a new family-friendly film arrives. \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d opened earlier internationally and has a worldwide total of $47 million.",
      "Fourth place went \u201cFinal Destination: Bloodlines,\u201d which earned $10.8 million in its third weekend. The movie is the highest-grossing in the franchise, not accounting for inflation, with $229.3 million globally.",
      "The weekend\u2019s other big newcomer, \u201cBring Her Back\u201d rounded out the top five with $7.1 million from 2,449 screens. Starring Sally Hawkins as a foster mother with some disturbing plans, the film is the sophomore feature of twin filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou, who made the 2023 horror breakout \u201cTalk to Me.\u201d It earned a rare-for-horror B+ CinemaScore and is essentially the only new film in the genre until \u201c28 Years Later\u201d opens on June 20.",
      "A new Wes Anderson movie, \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d also debuted in New York and Los Angeles this weekend, where it made $270,000. It expands nationwide next weekend.",
      "The summer box office forecast remains promising, though there\u2019s a long way to go to get to the $4 billion target (a pre-pandemic norm that only the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d summer has surpassed). The month of May is expected to close out with $973 million \u2013 up 75% from May 2024, according to data from Comscore.",

      "Canada\u2019s wildfire season is off to an intense start",
      "While images of wildfires capture their ferocity, data can provide insight into how bad a fire season is.",
      "Such is the case with two graphics, powered by satellite data, that showcase a Canadian wildfire season off to a wild \u2014 and scary \u2014 start.",
      "Twice a day a NASA satellite sends images to the ground, giving a real-time view of where fires are burning. This is especially useful for remote areas where no sensors are stationed.",
      "As of Tuesday that satellite had picked up four times as many fire hot spots across Canada than is typical for early June. That\u2019s more than any year since the satellite began transmitting in 2012, except 2023, according to data from Global Forest Watch.",
      "Though the satellite has recorded thousands of hot spots so far this year, that does not mean there are actually that many active fires. Each hot spot could be detected repeatedly over the course of days. And because each detection is about the size of 26 football fields, it can represent part of a much larger blaze, said James MacCarthy, wildfire research manager at Global Forest Watch.",
      "Based on data from the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, about 200 fires are actively burning in Canada and have consumed about 7,700 square miles (19,900 square kilometers) of terrain, most of it in the last week.",
      "Only 2023 saw such high numbers so early in Canada's fire season, which runs from April through October. That year wildfires burned a record 67,000 square miles \u2014 more than twice the surface area of Lake Superior, the largest of the Great Lakes.",
      "Taken together, the hot spots and acres burned mean 2025 is the second-worst start to the season in years.",
      "\u201cA warm and dry finish to May and early June has created a significant fire season,\u201d said Liam Buchart, a fire weather specialist with the Canadian Forest Service.",
      "The weather conditions are made more likely by climate change and encourage wildfires to start. That means even though 90% of wildfires in Manitoba this year have been human-caused, according to the provincial government, climate change helps enable their spread.",
      "\u201cClimate change is creating the conditions that make it more likely that human-caused fires are going to spread, or even start,\u201d MacCarthy said. \u201cIt might be a human starting it, but it\u2019s going to spread quickly because now there\u2019s hot and dry conditions that are occurring more frequently and more intensely than they have in the past.\u201d",
      "The hot and dry weather is likely to to continue for at least the next week across Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, according to Natural Resources Canada. The agency\u2019s forecasts also call for \u201ca warmer and drier than normal July and August for large portions of Canada,\u201d Buchart said.",
      "\u201cThe remainder of the fire season looks to remain above normal, especially over the northern prairie provinces and southern British Columbia,\u201d he said.",

      "Measles was eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, and the vaccine is safe and highly effective. Public schools nationwide require two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine before kindergarten, but the number of children with non-medical exemptions from those requirements hit an all-time high in the 2023-2024 school year. Health experts say community-level vaccination needs to be at 95% or higher to prevent outbreaks.",
      "The Johns Hopkins study looked at 2,066 counties across 33 states, comparing kindergarten vaccination rates averaged over school years from 2017-2020 to averages from 2022-2024. Where kindergarten data wasn\u2019t available, the researchers used a comparable rate.",

      "Texas has logged 742 measles cases since late January, most in West Texas.",

      "Terry County (60 cases) and Yoakum County (20 cases) dropped below the 95% threshold for herd immunity after the pandemic, to 93.7% and 91.8% respectively.",
      "Lubbock County \u2014 which has seen 53 cases and is the closest metro area to Gaines County \u2014 was just below 95% before the pandemic, but dropped three percentage points after to 91.8%.",
      "El Paso County on the border of Mexico has had the third-most measles cases in Texas this year with 57. Its vaccination rate is higher than 95% but saw a 2.1 percentage-point decline to 96.5%.",
      "Counties with outbreaks in Kansas include Gray with 25 cases, Haskell with 11 and and Stevens with seven.",

      "Haskell County dropped 18 percentage points to 65%. And Stevens County dropped 0.5 percentage points to 90.5%.",
      "Colorado's outbreak, which is linked to an international flight that landed at the Denver airport in mid-May, involves six cases: five in state residents and one out-of-state traveler.",
      "Two people who got measles live in Arapahoe County in the Denver metro, where the vaccination rate dropped 3.5 percentage points to 88.4%. Three others live in El Paso County, home to Colorado Springs, where the vaccination rate dropped 3.8 percentage points to 80% post-pandemic.",

      "It might start when you realize you can\u2019t hear the doorbell, or certain ringtones",
      "NEW YORK -- My first tip-off were the little things, the high-pitched little things: the doorbell and ringtones my kids could hear but I could not.",
      "Then it was the garbled-sounding conversations, and the accompanying annoyance of having to ask people to repeat themselves. Or worse, giving up and just playing along without being able to follow everything that was being said.",
      "Even then, I stalled for years before finally going through the process of getting a hearing aid. How do you even begin? Will it look clunky and make me feel like a dinosaur? And the cost!",
      "Getting a hearing test, and confirmation that I needed a hearing aid, was just the beginning.",
      "The doctor handed me a list of places I could go to get fitted. I made some calls and narrowed it down to the places that took my insurance and my zero-interest health care credit card.",
      "The first couple places were demoralizing: I walked in, was told it\u2019d be $7,000 for the \u201cbest\u201d option (they mysteriously didn\u2019t happen to have any other options handy), then marched right back out the door, utterly discouraged.",
      "I started asking friends and neighbors whether they wore a hearing aid, or knew anyone at all with a hearing aid, and could point me to a good audiologist.",
      "It took a lot of poking around, but I found one \u2014 and it made all the difference.",
      "I\u2019ve been wearing my hearing aids for several months now, and they are as easy as slipping on a pair of glasses, are almost invisible, have reconnected me with the world, and, as crazy as this may sound, they bring me joy.",
      "After talking with a few audiologists around the country, it turns out that my experience is pretty typical.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of people who stall before getting one,\u201d says Meagan P. Bachmann, director of audiology at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist, in North Carolina.",
      "\u201cHearing is important because it connects us with people,\u201d she says. \u201cMultiple studies show that not hearing can affect your ability to connect with others and participate in life, so you have to think of it in terms of overall health. Maybe you no longer go to family events, or you don\u2019t understand your doctor. People start to withdraw. A lot of people come in because it\u2019s gotten so bad that it is impacting their relationships.\u201d",
      "To speed up the process and make it less frustrating, here\u2019s what the pros recommend:",
      "1. Get tested, take the results seriously, and know that many if not most hearing aids these days are small, nearly invisible, rechargeable, and pretty easy to wear and maintain. And believe it or not, hearing aids can be fun \u2014 these days, there are colors to choose from and ways to bejewel them. One company, Deafmetal, makes jazzy-looking \u201csafety rings\u201d to help keep hearing aids in place.",
      "2. Shop for an expert audiologist. Look for someone who takes your insurance or any sort of medical credit card you might have, or has a payment plan of some kind, if needed. This is a world at the awkward juncture of consumerism and medical care, but a good audiologist should come across as a medical provider, not a salesperson. And a good audiologist should take the time to work with you to find a hearing aid that meets your individual needs, and also fits your budget.",
      "A good place to start is often with your doctor; with the American Academy of Audiologists, which lists providers on its website; or by word of mouth.",
      "\u201cAlthough all hearing aids are amplifiers, not everybody needs the same thing,\u201d says Bachmann. \u201cFitting a hearing aid is an art. It changes the acoustics, and everyone is different. You want someone who listens to your lifestyle needs. Do you have a lot of difficulty with noise? Are you mostly in quiet situations? How much technology do you need, and what kind?\u201d",
      "Greta Stamper, an audiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, agrees. \u201cHearing loss is not a one-time thing. It\u2019s a chronic health condition. It should be a partnership between you and your audiologist,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s someone asking you what you\u2019re looking for and how it\u2019s going. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressured or pushed.\u201d",
      "3. A note on cost. Although hearing aids can be pricey, there are affordable options, and a good audiologist should be able to let you try out options at several price points. Insurance often covers much of the cost, and there are ways to pay for the remaining cost in installments. Also, avoidance has pretty high costs as well, audiologists say, and the longer the wait, the harder it may be to solve the problem with a hearing aid. Although there are cheaper hearing aids at big box stores, Bachmann warns that it\u2019s good to check with your audiologist before taking that route. \u201cSome of those hearing aids are locked, so that you\u2019re not allowed to have them programmed by an outside audiologist,\u201d she says.",
      "Remember, says Stamper, that hearing aids are an investment, and usually last between five and six years.",
      "4. Know your rights. \u201cWe select what is the most likely to be successful, and if it doesn\u2019t work out you come back and do something else,\u201d says Stamper. She said most states mandate a trial period. In some cases, hearing-aid companies also cover the cost of multiple visits to your audiologist while you are getting used to your new hearing aid and get training in how to use and maintain it.",
      "5. Embrace the process, and expect it to take a little time and a few expert tweaks. Audiologists say your brain needs time to adjust to a hearing aid, and that hearing-aid settings should be adjusted little by little as your brain adapts to them.",
      "\u201cA big misconception is that you can just wear them a couple hours a day. Your brain does better with it if you use them most of the day. Your brain needs to adapt to hearing sounds it hasn't heard for a while, and it takes the brain awhile to relearn how to process all those sounds,\u201d says Stamper.",
      "6. Be realistic. \u201cAlthough hearing aids can be enormously beneficial, they may not give you back your normal hearing,\u201d says Stamper. Depending on the situation, there might be limitations to what a hearing aid can do.",
      "\u201cIt might just be lots of improvement in the key areas in which you\u2019re struggling,\u201d said Stamper.",
      "Using hearing aids is a process, the audiologists say, and although it requires some patience, it can be well worth the journey.",

    "story": [
      "A federal investigation has found that a Texas hospital that repeatedly sent a woman who was bleeding and in pain home without ending her nonviable, life-threatening pregnancy violated the law",
      "WASHINGTON -- A Texas hospital that repeatedly sent a woman who was bleeding and in pain home without ending her nonviable, life-threatening pregnancy violated the law, according to a newly released federal investigation.",
      "The government's findings, which have not been previously reported, were a small victory for 36-year-old Kyleigh Thurman, who ultimately lost part of her reproductive system after being discharged without any help from her hometown emergency room for her dangerous ectopic pregnancy.",
      "But a new policy the Trump administration announced on Tuesday has thrown into doubt the federal government's oversight of hospitals that deny women emergency abortions, even when they are at risk for serious infection, organ loss or severe hemorrhaging.",
      "Thurman had hoped the federal government's investigation, which issued a report in April after concluding its inquiry last year, would send a clear message that ectopic pregnancies must be treated by hospitals in Texas, which has one of the nation's strictest abortion bans.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want anyone else to have to go through this,\u201d Thurman said in an interview with the Associated Press from her Texas home this week. \u201cI put a lot of the responsibility on the state of Texas and policy makers and the legislators that set this chain of events off.\u201d",
      "Women around the country have been denied emergency abortions for their life-threatening pregnancies after states swiftly enacted abortion restrictions in response to a 2022 ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court, which includes three appointees of President Donald Trump.",
      "The guidance issued by the Biden administration in 2022 was an effort to preserve access to emergency abortions for extreme cases in which women were experiencing medical emergencies. It directed hospitals \u2014 even ones in states with severe restrictions \u2014 to provide abortions in those emergency cases. If hospitals did not comply, they would be in violation of a federal law and risk losing some federal funds.",
      "On Tuesday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency responsible for enforcing the law and inspecting hospitals, announced it would revoke the Biden-era guidance around emergency abortions.",
      "The law, which requires doctors to provide stabilizing treatment, was one of the few ways that Thurman was able to hold the emergency room accountable after she didn't receive any help from staff at Ascension Seton Williamson in Round Rock, Texas in February of 2023, a few months after Texas enacted its strict abortion ban.",
      "Emergency room staff observed that Thurman's hormone levels had dropped, a pregnancy was not visible in her uterus and a structure was blocking her fallopian tube \u2014 all telltale signs of an ectopic pregnancy, when a fetus implants outside of the uterus and has no room to grow. If left untreated, ectopic pregnancies can rupture, causing organ damage, hemorrhage or even death.",
      "Thurman, however, was sent home and given a pamphlet on miscarriage for her first pregnancy. She returned three days later, still bleeding, and was given an injected drug intended to end the pregnancy, but it was too late. Days later, she showed up again at the emergency room, bleeding out because the fertilized egg growing on Thurman\u2019s fallopian tube ruptured it. She underwent an emergency surgery that removed part of her reproductive system.",
      "CMS launched its investigation of how Ascension Seton Williamson handled Thurman\u2019s case late last year, shortly after she filed a complaint. Investigators concluded the hospital failed to give her a proper medical screening exam, including an evaluation with an OB-GYN. The hospital violated the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, which requires emergency rooms to provide stabilizing treatment to all patients. Thurman was \u201cat risk for deterioration of her health and wellbeing as a result of an untreated medical condition,\u201d the investigation said in its report, which was publicly released last month.",
      "Ascension, a vast hospital system that has facilities across multiple states, did not respond to questions about Thurman\u2019s case, saying only that it is \u201cis committed to providing high-quality care to all who seek our services.\u201d",
      "Doctors and legal experts have warned abortion restrictions like the one Texas enacted have discouraged emergency room staff from aborting dangerous and nonviable pregnancies, even when a woman's life is imperiled. The stakes are especially high in Texas, where doctors face up to 99 years in prison if convicted of performing an illegal abortion. Lawmakers in the state are weighing a law that would remove criminal penalties for doctors who provide abortions in certain medical emergencies.",
      "\u201cWe see patients with miscarriages being denied care, bleeding out in parking lots. We see patients with nonviable pregnancies being told to continue those to term,\u201d said Molly Duane, an attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights that represented Thurman. \u201cThis is not, maybe, what some people thought abortion bans would look like, but this is the reality.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration routinely warned hospitals that they need to provide abortions when a woman\u2019s health was in jeopardy, even suing Idaho over its state law that initially prohibited nearly all abortions, unless a woman\u2019s life was on the line.",
      "But CMS\u2019 announcement on Tuesday raises questions about whether such investigations will continue if hospitals do not provide abortions for women in medical emergencies.",
      "The agency said it will still enforce the law, \u201cincluding for identified emergency medical conditions that place the health of a pregnant woman or her unborn child in serious jeopardy.\u201d",
      "While states like Texas have clarified that ectopic pregnancies can legally be treated with abortions, the laws do not provide for every complication that might arise during a pregnancy.

      "Thurman worries pregnant patients with serious complications still won't be able to get the help they may need in Texas emergency rooms.",
      "\u201cYou cannot predict the ways a pregnancy can go,\u201d Thurman said. \u201cIt can happen to anyone, still. There\u2019s still so many ways in which pregnancies that aren\u2019t ectopic can be deadly.\u201d",

      "The fact that the COVID-19 vaccine is not available for newborn babies is shielding a group of prisoners on Georgia\u2019s death row from execution",
      "ATLANTA -- The fact that the COVID-19 vaccine is not available for newborn babies is shielding a group of prisoners on Georgia's death row from execution.",
      "Executions in Georgia were halted during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the state attorney general's office entered into an agreement with lawyers for people on death row to set the terms under which they could resume for a specific group of prisoners. At least one of those conditions, having to do with the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine, has not been met, and seeking an execution date for a prisoner covered by the agreement would breach the agreement, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Shukura Ingram ruled.",
      "The agreement includes three conditions that had to be met before executions could be set for the affected prisoners: the expiration of the state\u2019s COVID-19 judicial emergency, the resumption of normal visitation at state prisons and the availability of a COVID-19 vaccine \u201cto all members of the public.\u201d Once those conditions were met, the state agreed to give three months' notice before pursuing an execution warrant for one of the prisoners covered by the agreement and six months' notice for the rest.",
      "The state has argued that the agreement should no longer apply, contending the conditions have been met. But defense attorneys say it's still valid because the vaccine isn't yet available to infants under 6 months old, and visitation at state prisons has not returned to normal.",
      "Ingram's ruling, issued Friday, addressed only the vaccination question. She plans to handle the visitation issue separately.",
      "Ingram wrote that the state's arguments \u201call boil down to an attempt to rewrite the Agreement.\u201d The state is \u201c(u)nhappy with the language it drafted\u201d and wants to change it so that the condition would be satisfied once vaccines are available to \u201cmost members of the public.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut courts cannot rewrite contracts to relieve a party of their regrets,\u201d she wrote. She ruled that the agreement is \u201cbinding and enforceable,\u201d that the vaccination condition hasn't been met and that seeking an execution warrant before the requirements have been met would breach the agreement.",
      "The state attorney general's office plans to appeal, a spokesperson said Tuesday.",
      "Ingram noted that the Food and Drug Administration has approved clinical trials for infants under 6 months old, and newborns receive other vaccines. That shows it is possible for the COVID-19 vaccine to ultimately be available for that age group, and the state should have foreseen that that could take years, she wrote.",
      "Experts for both sides had testified that it was probable that the COVID-19 vaccine would eventually become available to babies under the age of 6 months, Ingram wrote.",
      "That was before Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was appointed U.S. health secretary. Kennedy last week announced that COVID-19 vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women. A few days later, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website, which had said those groups should get the shots, was revised to say the vaccinations \u201cmay\u201d be given to those groups.",
      "The agreement covers fewer than 10 of the 34 people currently on Georgia's death row.",
      "While Georgia stopped carrying out executions during the pandemic, death penalty cases continued to wind their way through the court system, and as people exhausted their appeals, they became eligible for execution.",
      "A committee of a judicial task force on COVID-19 in early 2021 instructed lawyers for people on death row and the state attorney general\u2019s office to come up with terms under which executions could safely resume. The two sides reached the agreement in April 2021.",
      "The agreement only applied to people on death row whose requests to have their appeals reheard were denied by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals while the judicial emergency was in place. The agreement was to remain in effect through Aug. 1, 2022, or one year from the date on which the conditions were met \u2014 whichever was later.",
      "The legal fight arose from a lawsuit filed when officials set a May 2022 execution date for Virgil Delano Presnell Jr. The Federal Defender Program, which represents Presnell, said the state had violated the agreement because the conditions hadn\u2019t all been met.",
      "Based on that argument, a Fulton County Superior Court judge halted the execution less than 24 hours before it was to take place, and the Georgia Supreme Court ruled in December 2022 that the agreement was a binding contract.",
      "People on death row who are not covered by the agreement have since become eligible for execution. One of them, Willie James Pye, was put to death in March 2024.",

    "story": [
      "A judge says the federal Bureau of Prisons must keep providing hormone therapy to hundreds of transgender inmates following an executive order signed by President Donald Trump that led to a disruption in medical treatment",
      "WASHINGTON -- The federal Bureau of Prisons must continue providing hormone therapy and social accommodations to hundreds of transgender inmates following an executive order signed by President Donald Trump that led to a disruption in medical treatment, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.",
      "U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said in his ruling a federal law prohibits prison officials from arbitrarily depriving inmates of medications and other lifestyle accommodations that the bureau's own medical staff has deemed appropriate.",
      "The judge said the transgender inmates who sued to block Trump\u2019s executive order are trying to lessen the personal anguish caused by their gender dysphoria, the distress that a person feels because their assigned gender and gender identity don\u2019t match.",
      "\u201cIn light of the plaintiffs\u2019 largely personal motives for undergoing gender-affirming care, neither the BOP nor the Executive Order provides any serious explanation as to why the treatment modalities covered by the Executive Order or implementing memoranda should be handled differently than any other mental health intervention,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "The Bureau of Prisons is providing hormone therapy to more than 600 inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria. The bureau doesn\u2019t dispute that gender dysphoria can cause severe side effects, including depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts, the judge said.",
      "The Republican president\u2019s executive order required the bureau to revise its medical care policies so that federal funds aren\u2019t spent \u201cfor the purpose of conforming an inmate\u2019s appearance to that of the opposite sex.\u201d",
      "Lamberth\u2019s ruling isn\u2019t limited to the plaintiffs named in the lawsuit. He agreed to certify a class of plaintiffs consisting of anyone who is or will be incarcerated in federal prisons.",
      "The lawsuit\u2019s named plaintiffs include Alishea Kingdom, a transgender woman who was prescribed hormone therapy injections and approved to receive social accommodations, including women\u2019s undergarments and cosmetics. Kingdom was denied her hormone shot three times after Trump signed his order, but she had it restored roughly a week after she sued. Her access to feminine undergarments hasn\u2019t been restored, according to the judge\u2019s ruling.",
      "\u201cIn Ms. Kingdom\u2019s case, there is no indication at all that the BOP means to leave her hormone therapy in place long-term; indeed, as noted above, she was informed by BOP personnel that the decision to resume her treatment was a consequence of this litigation itself, raising the specter that her treatments might be discontinued as soon as the litigation has concluded,\u201d Lamberth wrote.",
      "Trump\u2019s order also directed the Bureau of Prisons to ensure that \u201cmales are not detained in women\u2019s prisons.\u201d In February, however, Lamberth agreed to temporarily block prison officials from transferring three incarcerated transgender women to men\u2019s facilities and terminating their access to hormone therapy.",
      "The judge said there's no evidence Trump or prison officials considered the harm the new polices could do to transgender inmates.",
      "\u201cThe defendants argue that the plaintiffs have not alleged irreparable harm because they are all currently receiving hormone medications. But it suffices to say that all three plaintiffs\u2019 access to hormone therapy is, as best the Court can tell, tenuous,\u201d Lamberth wrote.",
      "The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from the Transgender Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "Lamberth, a senior judge, was nominated to the bench by President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, in 1987.",

      "A law firm says the number of former rugby players taking legal action against sports governing bodies on claims they suffered brain injuries during their careers has grown to more than 1,000",
      "The number of former rugby players taking legal action against sports governing bodies on claims they suffered brain injuries during their careers has grown to more than 1,000, a British law firm said on Monday.",
      "Rylands Garth, based in London, said more than 520 ex-players from rugby union and rugby league joined the lawsuit by Friday last week, which was the deadline for new applicants set by a court ahead of a hearing in July and before the case potentially goes to trial next year.",
      "It takes the total number of players who are part of the lawsuit to approximately 1,100, Rylands Garth said in a statement.",
      "The former players contend, according to Rylands Garth, that \u201crugby governing bodies failed to take reasonable action to protect them from the impacts of concussive and sub-concussive blows during their playing careers, despite knowing of the risks.\u201d",
      "Claimants are seeking compensation from World Rugby, the English Rugby Football Union and Welsh Rugby Union \u2014 governing bodies in 15-a-side rugby \u2014 and the English Rugby Football League and British Amateur Rugby League Association \u2014 from 13-a-side rugby league \u2014 for lost earnings, medical bills and care costs associated with their injuries, the firm said.",
      "\u201cRylands Garth is also calling for urgent and substantive reform of the game to better protect the safety of current and future players \u2014 including the creation of an independent brain health ombudsman for the sport,\u201d it said.",
      "Among those to have previously joined the class action was World Cup-winning former England hooker Steve Thompson, former New Zealand prop Carl Hayman and former Wales flanker Alix Popham.",
      "\u201cThis surge in claimants exposes the deep-rooted issues in rugby,\u201d Rylands Garth said, adding: \"Players continue to play almost all-year round, with many elite players soon to embark on extremely physical summer tours across the rugby world. We will continue to fight for justice for those who gave so much to the game.\u201d",
      "In a joint statement issued by World Rugby, the RFU and the WRU, the governing bodies said they \u201care aware of the latest update shared by the claimants\u2019 legal representatives with the final number of claimants.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe now await full details of their diagnosis and the claims being made. Our thoughts are with any former player facing challenges.",
      "\u201cAcross the game, we continue to build on a strong foundation of world-leading initiatives designed to make rugby union as safe as possible.\"",
      "That includes \u201csmart mouthguard technology in the elite game, trials of lower tackle height in the community game, and the continued rollout of brain health services to support former players.\u201d",
      "Rylands Garth said it also represents approximately 130 former soccer players who are taking similar legal action against soccer governing bodies. The next court hearing for the soccer case is due on June 26.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Emery Eversoll and her mother shared a good laugh when Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that some autistic children will never write poems.",
      "The 16-year-old\u2019s bedroom is full of notebooks featuring her prose. Sometimes, she quietly recites poetry to get through an outburst of anger. Her mother began suspecting she may have autism, in part, because she had memorized every word from a favorite book by age 2.",
      "Still, this Kansas family is optimistic about Kennedy\u2019s plans to launch a broad-based study of what causes autism, the complex developmental disorder that impacts the brain and causes delays in language or learning, social withdrawal and an unusual need for routine. Kennedy has vowed to identify some of the causes of autism, which has been studied for decades, by September.",
      "Kennedy has said autism \u201ddestroys families.\u201d He said children with autism \u201cwill never pay taxes, they\u2019ll never hold a job, they\u2019ll never play baseball, they\u2019ll never write a poem, they\u2019ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.\u201d",
      "His comments and his plan to swiftly study its causes, have splintered a community of millions of people living with autism. For some, they were an overdue recognition of the day-to-day difficulties for families with autistic loved ones. To others, Kennedy deeply misrepresented the realities of their disability, provoking concern about his ability to handle a sweeping assessment of the disorder.",
      "Some worry, too, that Kennedy has spent years suggesting that vaccines might cause autism, despite decades of scientific research that shows no such link.",
      "Ohio father Scott Copeland, himself autistic and a parent to two autistic children, does not trust that Kennedy will conduct a legitimate study.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be like standing up and saying you\u2019re going to have the cure for cancer in six months,\u201d said Copeland, who's 56. \u201cAngry isn\u2019t a sufficient word.\u201d",
      "While announcing plans to study the causes of autism, Kennedy described a grim life for those who have to cope with it.",
      "For Kelly Van Den Berghe, Kennedy\u2019s comments reflect a painful reality for the son she loves. The Massachusetts mom of five has an 18-year-old son, Daniel, who has profound autism.",
      "Daniel cannot speak, although a tablet helps him communicate. He frequently punches himself so hard that he\u2019s at risk for fracture or concussion. About a decade ago, doctors recommended he enter a full-time residential facility for his safety. It took years for his mother to agree to that, and, even now, tears well up in her eyes as she talks about that decision.",
      "\u201cMy child, I do truly believe, that if he were able to tell us, he would not want autism because this has not affected him in a positive way,\u201d Van Den Berghe said. \u201cSo, for me, having someone finally recognize my son and his population is amazing.\u201d",
      "The Eversolls viewed Kennedy\u2019s comments that way, too. Emery Eversoll struggles with fits of anger. Loud noises can bug her. And clothes can feel weird, especially jeans or socks, which often need to be worn inside out.",
      "\u201cIt is hard if your child has any kind of thing that they have to work through or deal with that\u2019s extra,\u201d said Jessica Eversoll. \u201cJust like if your child had lost their hand, it\u2019s still the same child, but they\u2019re going to have struggles navigating the world around them.\u201d",
      "Eileen Lamb knows those struggles well. She was diagnosed with autism after she started noticing signs a decade ago that her first son, Charlie, may have autism.",
      "Days in Austin, Texas, can be daunting with Charlie, younger brother Jude, a 9-year-old who also has autism, and a 2-year-old sister, Billie.",
      "At 12, Charlie still requires constant supervision, especially with his habit of eating non-food items; last year he swallowed a screw. At night, she monitors Charlie with a video camera, a motion detector and a tent-like safety bed to make sure that he does not bang his head or try to eat the walls. On a blog, Eileen Lamb shares therapy tips, family wins \u2014 like taking all three kids to a little league soccer game \u2014 and mourns some of the milestones that Charlie has missed.",
      "Lamb said it\u2019s unlikely Charlie will ever play baseball or go on a date \u2014 as Kennedy said last month when describing autism \u2014 but she also doesn\u2019t only view her child\u2019s limitations.",
      "\u201cI see where he was going with his comments,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cBut I also think that\u2019s not how you measure the value of our children\u2019s lives. The language we use matters.\u201d",
      "Copeland, the Ohio father, also believes his 21-year-old son fit Kennedy\u2019s description of autism. His son is non-verbal, lives at home and requires around-the-clock care because he doesn\u2019t sense danger.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s comments, however, made it clear to Copeland that he\u2019s had little experience with the disorder.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate people presenting themselves as experts when they don\u2019t know a damn thing about something,\u201d he said.",
      "Kennedy has described autism as a \u201cpreventable disease.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s rattled families that see a clear-cut answer for the cause of autism: genetics. Scientists, too, have concluded that genetics play a significant factor.",
      "Ashley Seliquini, a 40-year-old mom and speech pathologist living in Greensboro, North Carolina, can clearly see the connections in her family. She and her 5-year-old daughter have both been diagnosed with the disorder. Both sometimes lose their ability to speak. Her daughter, too, gets overwhelmed by loud noises.",
      "\u201cYou see it run in families,\u201d Seliquini said. \u201cSometimes the parents are not aware that they are autistic. After their child gets diagnosed they go, \u2018Oh, my goodness, I\u2019m autistic, too.\u2019\u201d",
      "Doctors and medical experts have attributed the rise in autism cases \u2014 about 1 in 31 U.S. kids are now diagnosed with it \u2014 to increased awareness, especially around milder forms of the disorder.",
      "Kennedy has flatly rejected that explanation.",
      "Both he and President Donald Trump have suggested that vaccines could be to blame for rising rates of autism, despite longstanding research that says otherwise. The National Institutes of Health has identified other environmental risk factors such as prenatal exposure to pesticides or air pollution, extreme prematurity or parents who conceive at an older age.",
      "Last week, Kennedy said in an interview with CNN that the health department would start awarding grants to a team of 15 scientists who will study autism, although he has provided no details about who will lead the studies.",
      "Eileen Lamb hopes that the studies do not look into vaccines because researchers have already firmly concluded there is no link. Instead, she'd like to see a focus on ways to support families like hers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just about what\u2019s the cause but how do we help,\u201d she said.",
      "For Van Den Berghe, Kennedy\u2019s study may hold answers she\u2019s wrestled with since Daniel was diagnosed many years ago. She\u2019s aware that research has found no link between vaccines and autism, but she\u2019s still not convinced. Daniel\u2019s severe reaction to the shots all those years ago is the only thing she can point to as a cause; no one else in her family has been diagnosed with autism.",
      "\u201cWhy did this happen to him?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been searching for years and years and years.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In Uganda, where more than 40% of the population live in extreme poverty, many families live in homes with dirt floors",
      "JINJA, Uganda -- Simon Tigawalana dreamed for years of doing something about the dirt floors in his small house, blaming them for making his family sick. But in a rural area in one of the world's poorest countries, making them over with concrete was simply out of reach.",
      "Then a company called EarthEnable approached him to offer an alternative: a clay-based earthen floor that could give him a durable, sealed floor for less than half the cost of concrete. Tigawalana now has the new floor in two rooms and hopes to add it soon in the last room.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that we now have a decent home and can also comfortably host visitors,\" said Tigawalana, a 56-year-old father of 16. \"Ever since we got a clay floor my kids no longer get cough and flu that used to come from the dust raised while sweeping the dirt floors.\u201d",
      "EarthEnable, which seeks to upgrade housing across Africa, has been promoting and installing the clay-based floors in Uganda since 2017. Besides eliminating dust that can irritate breathing, they're credited with reducing infestations of jiggers \u2014 a parasitic flea that can burrow into the skin and lead to pain, itching and infection. Uganda's health ministry says poor hygiene due to dirt floors contributes to such infestations.",
      "\u201cOur floors help to prevent pathogens and other illnesses linked to dust floors, since most of these families can\u2019t afford hospital care,\u201d said Noeline Mutesi, a sales and marketing manager for EarthEnable.",
      "The first step in building the floor is digging and leveling the surface. Then murram \u2014 local red soil rich in iron and aluminum oxides \u2014 is mixed with sand and water and then compacted. After two weeks of drying time, masons use wooden floats to smooth and further compact the surface. Next is pasting: applying a fine clay screed to further smooth the surface and prepare it for a final sealant, a flaxseed-based varnish that hardens into a durable plastic-like resin.",
      "A typical floor costs around 240,000 Uganda shillings (about $65), which Earth Enable says is about 70% cheaper than concrete. Buyers can pay in installments. EarthEnable, a U.S.-based nonprofit, operates for-profit subsidiaries in Uganda, Rwanda and Kenya, and says any profits are invested into startup costs in new markets as well as research and development.",
      "EarthEnable said it's installed about 5,000 floors in Uganda, more than 39,000 in Rwanda and more than 100 in Kenya. The company also does wall plastering to help reduce dust, moisture and insect infestations common in mud homes.",
      "In Jinja, the company's program employs more than 100 masons from within the community. Many are disadvantaged boys who have dropped out of school because they can't afford fees, said Alex Wanda, a construction officer at the company.",
      "\u201cWe focus on employing these young village boys that we train in skills to build these earthen floors, thus creating for them employment opportunities,\u201d Wanda said in an interview.",
      "About 42% of Ugandans live in extreme poverty. Its Bureau of Statistics says the country has a housing deficit of 2.6 million units, and it's growing. The country needs to add 300,000 housing units per year to make up the deficit, mainly in rural areas, where many Ugandans live and where housing quality and availability remain pressing concerns.",
      "The company also touts the clay floors as a more sustainable alternative to concrete, which besides being more expensive generates major carbon emissions in production.",
      "The cement industry is one of Uganda's biggest contributors to carbon emissions, accounting for about 628,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2023, its highest recorded level. More broadly, building and construction accounts for 37% of global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Uganda, like much of the rest of the world, has seen a rise in extreme weather events made more likely by climate change, including flooding and prolonged drought.",
      "\u201cInitiatives like this are crucial in the global effort to decarbonize the construction sector,\u201d said Penina Atwine, a program officer at the Uganda-based organization Environmental Alert. \u201cSuch innovative local solutions that address both climate change and social needs like EarthEnable\u2019s model could inspire similar approaches across the globe.\"",
      "In the village of Budima, Rehema Namukose spent most of her family's savings to build a house. She couldn't afford a cleaner floor until she worked through EarthEnable to pay for a clay floor in installments. She lives there with her three children and credits the new floor for improving the health of a sickly daughter.",
      "\u201cThis is affordable for my family and will help us maintain hygiene,\u201d she says \u201cWe are now living a better life.\u201d",

      "A ban on disposable vapes has come into force across the U.K. as the British government aims to stem their illegal use by children, reduce litter and prevent the leaking of harmful chemicals into the environment",
      "LONDON -- A ban on disposable vapes came into force across the U.K. on Sunday as the British government aims to stem their use by children, reduce litter and prevent the leaking of harmful chemicals into the environment.",
      "The ban makes it illegal for any retailer \u2014 online or in-store \u2014 to sell vapes, whether they contain nicotine or not. They will still be able to sell reusable vapes.",
      "The crackdown follows the soaring use of disposable vapes in schools and a rising tide of trash as users dispose of the vapes. It is estimated that as many as 5 million disposable vapes are thrown in bins or littered every week across the U.K., rather than being recycled.",
      "A number of countries are seeking to regulate the vape market, which has grown exponentially over the past decade or so. Australia outlawed the sale of vapes outside pharmacies last year in some of the world\u2019s toughest restrictions on electronic cigarettes, while Belgium became the first European Country to ban the use of disposable vapes at the start of this year. California has been at the forefront of bringing in new regulations in the U.S.",
      "The U.K.'s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said usage among young people remained too high, and the ban would \u201cput an end to their alarming rise in school playgrounds and the avalanche of rubbish flooding the nation\u2019s streets.\u201d",
      "Also known as single-use vapes, disposable vapes are non-refillable and unable to be recharged, and are typically thrown away with general waste or just thrown on the street. Even when they are recycled, they need to be taken apart by hand, while their batteries are a fire risk to recycling facilities and can leak harmful chemicals into the environment and potentially harming wildlife.",
      "Businesses were given six months to prepare for the change by selling any existing stock. Rogue traders who continue to sell them risk a fine of 200 ($260) in the first instance, followed by an unlimited fine or jail time for repeat offending.",
      "The U.K. Vaping Industry Association said its members had moved quickly to comply with the June 1 deadline, but warned of \u201cserious unintended consequences\u201d emanating from too much regulation.",
      "\u201cWe are concerned that this ban will encourage former smokers who have already transitioned from cigarettes, which kill 220 people every day in the U.K, to return to combustible tobacco or opt for unregulated vapes,\" said its director general, John Dunne.",
      "Separately, the British government is legislating to potentially restrict the packaging, marketing and flavors of e-cigarettes.",

      "ROME -- French scientist Etienne-Emile Baulieu, best known as the inventor of the abortion pill, died on Friday aged 98 at his home in Paris, his institute said in a statement.",
      "Both a doctor and a researcher, Baulieu was known around the world for the scientific, medical and social significance of his work on steroid hormones.",
      "\u201cHis research was guided by his attachment to the progress made possible by science, his commitment to women\u2019s freedom, and his desire to enable everyone to live better, longer lives,\u201d the Institut Baulieu said in the statement posted on its website.",
      "Born Etienne Blum in Strasbourg on Dec. 12, 1926, he took the name \u201c\u00c9mile Baulieu\u201d when he joined the French Resistance against the Nazi occupation at the age of 15.",
      "An endocrinologist with a doctorate in medicine completed in 1955 and one in science eight years later, in 1963 Baulieu founded a pioneering research unit working on hormones at INSERM, the French institute for health and medical research. He remained as head of the unit until 1997.",
      "He is best known for his development, in 1982, of RU 486, the so-called \u201cabortion pill\u201d that changed the lives of millions of women throughout the world, offering them the possibility of voluntary medical termination of pregnancy, in physical and psychological safety.",
      "The Institut Baulieu said it was \u201ca non-invasive method, less aggressive and less delayed than surgery,\u201d noting that following his discovery the researcher faced fierce criticism and even threats from opponents of women's abortion rights.",
      "\u201cEven today, access to this method is opposed, banned in some countries, and is currently being challenged in the United States, where it is the most widely used abortion method,\u201d the institute added.",
      "Baulieu\u2019s research into DHEA, a hormone whose secretion and anti-aging activity he had discovered, led him to work on neurosteroids -- or steroids of the nervous system. He also developed an original treatment to combat depression, for which a clinical trial is currently underway in several university hospitals.",
      "In 2008, he founded the Institut Baulieu to understand, prevent and treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.",
      "Honored with the grand crosses of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur (legion of honor) and the Ordre national du M\u00e9rite (national order of merit), he was elected to the French Academy of Sciences in 1982, which he chaired in 2003 and 2004.",
      "He was a member of the national advisory committee on life sciences and health (1996-2002) and received numerous awards, both in France and abroad.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to Baulieu in a post on X, calling him \u201ca beacon of courage\u201d and \u201ca progressive mind who enabled women to win their freedom.\u201d",
      "\u201cFew French people have changed the world to such an extent,\u201d he added.",
      "After the death of his first wife, Yolande Compagnon, he remarried, to Simone Harari Baulieu. He is survived by three children, eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren, his institute said.",

      "Attorneys for a woman who sued Kentucky seeking to restore the right to an abortion have dropped their challenge to the state's near-total ban on the procedure.",
      "The attorneys filed a motion Friday to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit, but did not give a reason for seeking to drop the case. The lawsuit had been filed last year in state court in Louisville on behalf of a woman who was seven weeks pregnant at the time and identified only by the pseudonym Mary Poe to protect her privacy.",

      "\u201cPeople have the right to control their own bodies without government interference, and we will never stop fighting to restore abortion access in Kentucky,\u201d said Amber Duke, executive director of the ACLU of Kentucky. \u201cWe are strategizing our next steps in this fight.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit was challenging Kentucky\u2019s near-total trigger law ban and a separate six-week ban, both of which were passed by Republican legislative majorities. The trigger law took effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",

      "Americans are losing an array of people and programs dedicated to keeping them healthy",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Americans are losing a vast array of people and programs dedicated to keeping them healthy. Gone are specialists who were confronting a measles outbreak in Ohio, workers who drove a van to schools in North Carolina to offer vaccinations and a program that provided free tests to sick people in Tennessee.",
      "State and local health departments responsible for invisible but critical work such as inspecting restaurants, monitoring wastewater for new and harmful germs, responding to outbreaks before they get too big \u2014 and a host of other tasks to protect both individuals and communities \u2014 are being hollowed out.",
      "\u201cNobody wants to go swim in a community pool and come out of it with a rash or a disease from it. Nobody wants to walk out their door and take a fresh breath of air and start wheezing,\" said Lori Tremmel Freeman, executive director of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.",
      "But local health officials say they now have no choice but to do a lot less of it. The Trump administration is cutting health spending on an unprecedented scale, experts say, including pulling $11 billion of direct federal support because the pandemic is over and eliminating 20,000 jobs at national health agencies that in part assist and support local public health work. It\u2019s proposing billions more be slashed.",
      "Together, public health leaders said, the cuts are reducing the entire system to a shadow of what it once was, threatening to undermine even routine work at a time when the nation faces the deadliest measles outbreak since at least the 1990s, rising whooping cough cases and the risk that bird flu could spread widely among people.",
      "The moves reflect a shift that Americans may not fully realize, away from the very idea of public health: doing the work that no individual can do alone to safeguard the population as a whole. That's one of the most critical responsibilities of government, notes James Williams, county executive in Santa Clara County, California. And it goes beyond having police and fire departments.",
      "\"It means not having babies suffering from diseases that you vanquished. It means making sure that people have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information and decisions that help their longevity,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt means having a society and communities able to actually prosper, with people living healthy and full lives.\u201d",
      "Just outside a Charlotte, North Carolina, high school in March, nurse Kim Cristino set out five vaccines as a 17-year-old girl in ripped jeans stepped onto a health department van. The patient barely flinched as Cristino gave her three shots in one arm and two in the other to prevent diseases including measles, diphtheria and polio.",
      "Like many other teens that morning, the girl was getting some shots years later than recommended. The clinic\u2019s appearance at Independence High School gave her a convenient way to get up to date.",
      "\u201cIt lessens the barriers for parents who would have to be taking off from work and trying to get their kids to a provider,\u201d Cristino said.",
      "The vaccinations also help the community around her. The teen won\u2019t come down with a life-threatening disease and the whole community is protected from outbreaks \u2014 if enough people are vaccinated.",
      "The Mecklenburg County department, with \"Protecting and Promoting the Public\u2019s Health\u201d emblazoned on its van, is similar to other U.S. health departments. They run programs to reduce suicides and drug overdoses, improve prenatal health and help people stop smoking. They educate people about health and test for and treat diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis. Some, including Mecklenburg, operate medical and dental clinics too.",
      "\u201cYou come to work every day and think: What\u2019s going to be my challenge today? Sometimes it\u2019s a new disease,\u201d said Raynard Washington, Mecklenburg\u2019s director. \u201cThat\u2019s why having a backbone infrastructure is so important.\u201d",
      "What they do is cost-effective, experts have found. For every dollar spent on childhood immunizations, the country is estimated to save $11; on tobacco cessation, $2-$3; on asthma control, $70.",
      "Critical care can be glamorous \u2014 surgeons, cardiologists and cancer doctors can pull off breathtaking medical feats to save lives at the last possible moment. Prevention work is low key. It\u2019s impossible to identify who was saved because, if it goes well, the person never knows when they\u2019ve fended off a mortal threat with the invisible shield of public health.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t appreciate it,\u201d said Dr. Umair Shah, former health director for Washington state. \u201cTherefore, they don\u2019t invest in it.\u201d",
      "State health departments are funded by a varying mix of federal and state tax money. Some states deliver services in a centralized way while others provide resources to local departments, which generally also get money from counties, cities or towns. Some large cities get direct federal funding for their health departments.",
      "Mecklenburg \u2014 a large department with around 1,000 workers serving 1.2 million people \u2014 has an annual budget of around $135 million, while some metro hospitals have operating expenses in the billions. About 70% of the department's budget comes from local funds, which helps fill gaps in state and federal money. But Mecklenburg is still strapped for cash and resources.",
      "At times, employees work 12- to 14-hour days, especially during outbreaks. Nurse Carmel Jenkins recalled responding to mpox exposures at a day care center \u2014 arriving before 5:30 a.m. to alert the children\u2019s parents and working late into the evening.",
      "\u201cEven though there may be limited resources, we still have a service to provide,\u201d said Jenkins, a director of clinical services for the department. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind going above and beyond to be able to do that.\u201d",
      "In March, the Trump administration pulled $11 billion from state and local health departments without warning under the leadership of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and public health critic. The cuts abruptly ended COVID-era grants, which had also been approved for non-COVID work including vaccination and disease detection, tracking and testing.",
      "A week later, thousands of people were laid off at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many had worked closely with state and local health departments to provide information, grants and other support.",
      "The sudden, one-two punch delivered a serious blow to the system, public health leaders said in interviews, court filings and public testimony.",
      "A Kennedy spokesman said in an email that America remains unhealthy compared with other developed nations and HHS is reorganizing what he said were \u201cbroken systems\u201d and reprioritizing resources to \u201ccentralize programs and functions that will improve our service to the American people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese cuts are not about abandoning public health \u2014 they\u2019re about reforming it,\u201d spokesman Andrew Nixon said, adding: \u201cWe reject the implication that HHS has turned its back on urgent health threats.\u201d",
      "HHS justified the grant cancellations by saying the money was for COVID and the pandemic is over. But most of the cuts were in areas that are especially important given today\u2019s health threats. The biggest chunk, more than $8.9 billion, involved epidemiology and laboratory capacity related to infectious diseases, while another $2 billion was related to immunizations. In some places, the cuts are on hold due to a federal judge\u2019s order in a lawsuit by states. But elsewhere, cuts are continuing.",
      "In Mecklenburg, for example, 11 community health workers lost their jobs, meaning less outreach to groups like the Hispanic community. All eight employees dedicated to the mobile vaccine program were laid off.",
      "In Columbus, Ohio \u2014 one of several communities in Republican-led states suing over the cuts \u2014 the health department had to lay off nine disease intervention specialists. This left it operating at 25% capacity in its disease tracing and investigation work just as it prepared to address a measles outbreak.",
      "Kansas City, Missouri, will not be able to do its own testing for infectious diseases because the cut came just as the city was about to buy $500,000 worth of equipment. And Nashville had to end a program offering free flu and COVID tests and cancel plans to buy a van to deliver vaccinations.",
      "The cities complained the cuts had created \u201csevere budget uncertainty\u201d and forced them to redirect their limited resources \u201cto respond to the resulting chaos.\u201d",
      "CDC staff cuts are also having a ripple effect on state and local departments. Children who are deaf or hard of hearing will no longer benefit from an early intervention program run by states after everyone who worked on the program at CDC was laid off. The team in the Office on Smoking and Health, which funds state tobacco hotlines that help people quit, was let go.",
      "So was the CDC team that worked to reduce drownings, partly through funding low-cost swimming lessons in local communities. Drownings kill 4,000 people a year in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe experts who know the things that can be done to help prevent the No. 1 cause of death from children ages 1 to 4 have been eliminated,\u201d Connecticut state health commissioner Dr. Manisha Juthani told a Democratic congressional hearing in April, referring to drownings.",
      "She said the abrupt and disorganized nature of the cuts leaves her department scrambling as officials try to understand what is being cut and to close important programs on the federal government\u2019s impractical timelines.",
      "\u201cThe current uncertainty puts lives at risk,\u201d she said.",
      "The new cuts are especially damaging because health departments are funded differently than other government agencies meant to protect the public: Funding pours in during emergencies and slows to a relative trickle when they subside. Mecklenburg\u2019s Washington notes the contrast with fire departments, which are kept ready at all times, not scrambling to find firefighters and fire trucks when houses are already burning.",
      "With health departments, \u201cthere\u2019s a long-established pattern of boom-and-bust funding,\u201d said Dr. Steven Stack, Kentucky\u2019s public health commissioner and past president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.",
      "A temporary surge of money during the pandemic allowed some health departments to expand and strengthen programs. In Alabama, the influx of COVID money allowed the state to reopen a health department in largely rural Coosa County that closed a decade ago due to a lack of money.

      "The nation\u2019s top public health agency has posted new recommendations that healthy children and pregnant women may \u2014 but no longer should \u2014 get COVID-19 vaccinations",
      "NEW YORK -- The nation's top public health agency posted new recommendations that say healthy children and pregnant women may get COVID-19 vaccinations, removing stronger language that those groups should get the shots.",
      "The change comes days after U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that COVID-19 vaccines will no longer be recommended for healthy children and pregnant women.",
      "But the updated guidance on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website sends a more nuanced message, saying shots \u201cmay\u201d be given to those groups.",
      "\u201cThe announcement from earlier this week sounded like CDC was going to fully withdraw any statement that could be construed as a recommendation for these vaccines in these populations,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher. \u201cIt's not as bad as it could have been.\"",
      "Kennedy announced the coming changes in a 58-second video posted on the social media site X on Tuesday. No one from the CDC was in the video, and CDC officials have referred questions about the announcement to Kennedy and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "On Thursday, the CDC updated its website. The agency said that shots may be given to children ages 6 months to 17 years who do not have moderate or severe problems with their immune systems. Instead of recommending the shots, the CDC now says parents may decide to get their children vaccinated in consultation with a doctor.",
      "A subtle update to a CDC page on the adult immunization schedule indicated a similar change for the recommendation for pregnant women, excluding them from the routine recommendation made for other adults.",
      "\u201cThe old COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children under 18 and for pregnant women have been removed from the CDC vaccine schedule,\u201d a HHS spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe CDC and HHS encourage individuals to talk with their healthcare provider about any personal medical decision.\"",
      "That kind of recommendation, known as shared decision-making, still means health insurers must pay for the vaccinations, according to the CDC. However, experts say vaccination rates tend to be lower when health authorities use that language and doctors are less emphatic with patients about getting shots.",
      "Childhood vaccination rates for COVID-19 are already low \u2014 just 13% of children and 23% of adults have received the 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine, according to CDC data.",
      "Talk of changing the recommendations has been brewing. As the COVID-19 pandemic has waned, experts have discussed the possibility of focusing vaccination efforts on people 65 and older \u2014 who are among those most as risk for death and hospitalization.",
      "A CDC advisory panel is set to meet in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are suggesting shots for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice to get vaccinated. A committee work group has endorsed the idea.",
      "But Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine advocate before becoming health secretary, decided not to wait for the scientific panel\u2019s review.",
      "The new vaccine recommendation changes, their timing and the way there were announced have created confusion that can be \"incredibly harmful to the success of vaccination programs,\u201d Schwartz said.",
      "\u201cIt would be understandable if the public is completely baffled in terms of what the federal government thinks and what the science suggests ... about the evidence for the safety and value of these vaccines,\u201d he added.",

      "Carlos Alcaraz has been wearing nasal strips in some matches since last season",
      "PARIS -- If more tennis players find themselves breathing easier, it might just be thanks to Carlos Alcaraz.",
      "The four-time Grand Slam champion, whose bid for a second consecutive French Open title was scheduled to continue with a third-round match Friday night, has often worn a nasal strip in matches since last season \u2014 although not during his first two contests at Roland-Garros this week \u2014 and the sport's other athletes took note.",
      "After all, if Alcaraz finds something useful on the court, their thinking goes, maybe it makes sense to give the adhesive bands a shot.",
      "\u201cI saw Carlos playing in it,\u201d said 18-year-old Mirra Andreeva, a semifinalist in Paris last year and the No. 6 women's seed this time. \u201cI\u2019d be pretty interested to try and see if there is really a difference. If he plays matches in it, then probably there is.\u201d",
      "At the 2024 season-ending ATP Finals last November, Alcaraz said: \u201cIt is something that I\u2019m going to wear more often. I could recover better between points.\u201d",
      "Once associated with Pro Football Hall of Famer Jerry Rice and soccer stars like Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar, the bands, which essentially look like a Band-Aid worn across the bridge of the nose, are popping up on tennis courts \u2014 sometimes out of necessity, sometimes out of curiosity.",
      "They are designed to open the nostrils slightly, making it easier to breathe through the nose. Originally marketed to reduce snoring, they\u2019re being embraced to enhance air intake during physical exertion.",
      "The idea is simple: Better breathing could mean better oxygen intake.",
      "In practice, the science is less convincing.",
      "In 2021, Brazilian academic Ricardo Dinardi reviewed more than 600 studies on nasal strips and found they didn\u2019t make a real difference in how much air athletes took in, their heart rate or how strenuous exercise felt.",
      "\u201cThe effect on athletic performance is mostly placebo,\u201d Dinardi said. \u201cBut in elite sports, even perceived benefits can count.\u201d",
      "Three-time major finalist Casper Ruud, who wore the strips in matches earlier this year, knows the evidence is shaky. But he still liked using them \u2014 both on the court and while sleeping. Like Alcaraz, Ruud did not wear one in Paris before his second-round exit.",
      "But he has been testing a prototype of a different version.",
      "\u201cI tried out a device that\u2019s very early in development. It will be a bit more comfortable to wear, because it\u2019s inside the nose and it looks like I have this bullring under,\u201d said Ruud, who was the runner-up at Roland-Garros to Rafael Nadal in 2022 and Novak Djokovic in 2023. \u201cIt will return, don\u2019t worry.\u201d",
      "For other players, like Nicol\u00e1s Jarry, the strips are more than a trend \u2014 they\u2019re a necessity. After nasal surgery in 2020, the Chilean still needed help to draw air into his nose, so he puts them on for every practice and every match he plays.",
      "\u201cWithout it, I cannot breathe. My nostrils shut when I try,\u201d he said, inhaling to demonstrate for a reporter. \u201cOthers don\u2019t have that issue and still use them.\u201d",
      "Jarry definitely has noticed a recent spike in interest among players. He said that even though he's worn the strips for years, including at this French Open, other competitors on tour never asked about them \u2014 until Alcaraz started wearing one last year, sometimes in black, sometimes in pink.",
      "\u201cOthers have asked me, and many are trying it,\" said Jarry, who sported a beige-colored strip in Paris. \"But before him? Nothing.\u201d",
      "There are those, like 2024 US Open runner-up Jessica Pegula, who are tempted to try.",
      "\u201cI have a horrible deviated septum. I can\u2019t really breathe out of one side of my nose,\" said Pegula, who will play 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova in the third round Saturday. \u201cMaybe I should start wearing one.\u201d",
      "She admits, though, that the aesthetic aspect might be a deal-breaker.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\" Pegula said with a smile, \u201cif I have the confidence to rock one.\u201d",

      "The Brazilian archaeologist who discovered hundreds of prehistoric cave paintings in northeastern Brazil has died",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Ni\u00e8de Guidon, the Brazilian archaeologist known for discovering hundreds of prehistoric cave paintings in northeastern Brazil and for her research challenging theories of ancient human presence in the Americas, died Wednesday at 92, the Serra da Capivara National Park announced.",
      "Guidon first documented the red ocher cave paintings in the semi-arid state of Piaui in the 1970s. These ancient artworks, made with natural pigments such as iron oxides and charcoal, depict deer and capybaras, but also scenes of everyday life including hunting, childbirth, dancing and kissing.",
      "Guidon fought for the preservation of the area, leading to the establishment of the Serra da Capivara National Park in 1979. In 1991, UNESCO recognized the nearly 130,000-hectare park, with its sprawling valleys, mountains, and plains, as a world cultural heritage site.",
      "Guidon\u2019s discoveries shook traditional theories on when and how humans arrived on the American continent, according to a 2024 statement by Brazil\u2019s National Council for Scientific and Technological Development.",
      "It was previously believed that humans had reached the Americas approximately 13,000 years ago via the Bering Strait between Siberia and Alaska.",
      "Based on the exploration of archaeological sites in Piaui \u2014 which uncovered 15,000-year-old human bones, cave paintings estimated to be around 35,000 years old and evidence of fires dating back 48,000 years \u2014 Guidon argued that humans had arrived on the American continent from Africa via the sea, and much earlier than previously believed, the statement said.",
      "The Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation and the National Institute of Historical and Artistic Heritage commended Guidon\u2019s contributions in a joint statement Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIf Serra da Capivara is today recognized as one of the most important concentrations of archaeological sites in the world, with a profound impact on the debate and understanding of the history of human occupation of the Americas, it is above all thanks to Ni\u00e8de Guidon\u2019s vision and tireless defense of science and culture,\u201d they said.",
      "\u201cProfessor Ni\u00e8de is one of those unforgettable figures who have inscribed their name in our history,\u201d Mauro Pires, president of the Chico Mendes Institute, was quoted as saying, describing her contribution to global archaeology as immeasurable.",
      "\u201cBrazilian science is saddened by the passing of Ni\u00e8de Guidon, who helped us understand the origins of man in the American continent,\u201d Brazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said in a statement.",
      "Guidon was born in the interior of Sao Paulo state in 1933. She graduated in Natural History from the University of Sao Paulo in 1959, before moving to France to pursue her studies. She completed her doctorate at Paris\u2019 Sorbonne University in 1975, after presenting a thesis on the cave paintings in Piaui state.",
      "Guidon went on to found the Foundation Museum of the American Man, a non-profit dedicated to the cultural and natural heritage of Serra da Capivara National Park, which she led between 1986 and 2019.",
      "\u201cFor decades, she and her team fought to secure funding and infrastructure for the park, firmly standing against government neglect,\u201d the nonprofit said on Wednesday, adding that her work was marked by \u201cpassion, persistence, and a generous vision of science as a tool for social transformation.\u201d",
      "In 2024, Brazil\u2019s National Council of Scientific and Technological Development asked Guidon about the obstacles she faced as a woman and a scientist.",
      "\u201cI never worried about people\u2019s opinions about me,\" she said. \u201cI worked hard, created a very qualified team, and history was made.\u201d",

Prosecutors sought to charge her with illegal enrichment and jail her for six months pending trial.",

      "Earlier, defense attorney Pedro Cruz, surrounded by reporters in the courthouse, said he disagreed with the decision to seal the case. He said prosecutors had done so \u201cbecause they fear they made an unfounded accusation.\u201d",

      "The Health Ministry said 686,061 babies were born in Japan in 2024, a drop of 5.7% on the previous year and the first time the number of newborns had fallen below 700,000 since records began in 1899.",
      "The decline comes about 15 years faster than the government prediction. Last year's figure is about one-quarter of the peak of 2.7 million births in 1949 during the postwar baby boom.",
      "The data in a country of rapidly aging and shrinking population adds to concern about the sustainability of the economy and national security at a time it seeks to increase defense spending.",
      "Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has described the situation as \u201ca silent emergency\u201d and has promised to promote more flexible working environment and other measures that would help married couples to balance work and parenting, especially in rural areas where family values tend to be more conservative and harder on women.",
      "The Health Ministry's latest data showed that Japan's fertility rate \u2014 the average number of babies a woman is expected to have in her lifetime \u2014 also fell to a new low of 1.15 in 2024, from 1.2 a year earlier. The number of marriage was slightly up, to 485,063 couples, but the downtrend since the 1970s remains unchanged.",
      "Experts say the government measures have not addressed a growing number of young people reluctant to marry, while focusing largely on couples already married and plan to have or already had children.",
      "The younger generation are increasingly reluctant to marry or have children due to bleak job prospects, a high cost of living and a gender-biased corporate culture that adds extra burden only on women and working mothers, experts say.",
      "A growing number of women also cite pressure to change their surnames to that of their husband as part of their reluctance to marry. Under a civil law, couples must choose either surname to legally marry, a rule traditionally has caused women to abandon their maiden names.",
      "Japan's population of about 124 million people is projected to fall to 87 million by 2070, by when 40% of the population will be over 65.",

      "A trial of six men over an arson attack at an east London business that supported Ukraine\u2019s war effort against Russia has begun, with prosecutors arguing that the evidence against them was \u201coverwhelming.\u201d",
      "LONDON -- The trial has started of six men accused of arson at an east London business with links to Ukraine\u2019s war effort against Russia, with prosecutors saying Wednesday that the evidence against them was \u201coverwhelming.\u201d",
      "At the start of the trial at London's Central Criminal Court, which is better known as the Old Bailey, prosecutors said the March 20, 2024 attack was planned by agents of Russia's Wagner mercenary group, which the British government has deemed a terrorist organization.",
      "Prosecutors said the Wagner Group recruited four men \u2014 Jakeem Rose, 23, Ugnius Asmena, 20, Nii Mensah, 23 and Paul English, 61 \u2014 who have been charged with setting fire to the industrial unit in Leyton, in the east of the capital, which supplied StarLink satellite equipment to Ukraine.",
      "An additional two other men \u2014 Ashton Evans, 20, and Dmitrijus Paulauskas, 23 \u2014 are facing charges that they withheld information about upcoming terrorist attacks.",
      "The court was told that around 1 million pounds ($1.35 million) worth of damage was caused by the blaze. Prosecutors also said there were plans for similar attacks on two other businesses in the upmarket London neighborhood of Mayfair \u2014 a wine shop called Hedonism and a restaurant called Hide. Both are owned by an unidentified Russian dissident who has been vocal in his criticism of President Vladimir Putin and the war in Ukraine. He has, prosecutors said, driven aid trucks from the U.K. to Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThis was deliberate and calculated criminality, at the behest of foreign influence,\" said prosecutor Duncan Penny. \"In the case of these defendants at the time of the fire they may have been ignorant of that influence and the motive may have been financial \u2013 good old-fashioned greed. For others, however, it appears to have been both political and ideological.\u201d",
      "Jurors heard the attack was orchestrated by Dylan Earl, 20, and Jake Reeves, 23, who have already admitted aggravated arson on behalf of the Wagner Group. Earl has also admitted to plotting to set fire to the two Mayfair businesses.",
      "Earl, he said, was the \u201carchitect\u201d of the attack and had come into contact with the Wagner Group via a channel on the Telegram messaging app.",
      "\u201cIt appears that Dylan Earl expressed a willingness to undertake \u2018missions\u2019 of which the Leyton arson attack was the first,\u201d said Penny. \u201cIt is apparent that Dylan Earl knew he was acting against Ukrainian, and for Russian, interests.\u201d",
      "Earl was the first person to be charged under the U.K.'s National Security Act 2023, which created new measures to combat espionage, political interference and benefiting from foreign intelligence services. It also gave authorities additional powers to search and seize property and detain and arrest suspects.",
      "Penny said the evidence against those facing charges was \u201coverwhelming\u201d and that CCTV, traffic cameras and phone evidence will be presented to the jury. He said one of the suspects, Mensah, filmed the arson attack on his mobile phone and livestreamed it on FaceTime.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday dismissed Russia\u2019s ceasefire proposal as \u201can ultimatum\u201d and renewed his call for direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin to break the deadlock over the war, which has dragged on for nearly 3\u00bd years.",
      "Both sides exchanged memorandums setting out their conditions for a ceasefire for discussion at Monday's direct peace talks between delegations in Istanbul, their second meeting in just over two weeks. Both sides have established red lines that make any quick deal unlikely.",
      "Zelenskyy said that the second round of talks in Istanbul was no different from the first meeting on May 16. Zelenskyy described the latest negotiations in Istanbul as \u201ca political performance\u201d and \u201cartificial diplomacy\u201d designed to stall for time, delay sanctions and convince the United States that Russia is engaged in dialogue.",
      "\u201cThe same ultimatums they voiced back then \u2014 now they just put them on paper ... Honestly, this document looks like spam. It\u2019s spam meant to flood us and create the impression that they\u2019re doing something,\u201d Zelenskyy said in his first reaction to the Russian document.",
      "He added that the 2025 talks in Istanbul carry \u201cthe same content and spirit\u201d as the fruitless negotiations held in the Turkish city in the early days of the war.",
      "The Ukrainian leader said that he sees little value in continuing talks at the current level of delegations. Defense Minister Rustem Umerov led the Ukrainian delegation in Istanbul, while Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to Putin, headed the Russian team.",
      "Zelenskyy said he wants a ceasefire with Russia before a possible summit meeting with Putin, possibly also including U.S. President Donald Trump, in an effort to remove obstacles to a peace settlement. The U.S. has led a recent diplomatic push to stop the full-scale invasion, which began on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "\u201cWe are proposing \u2026 a ceasefire before a leaders\u2019 summit,\u201d with the U.S. acting as a mediator, Zelenskyy told a media briefing in Kyiv.",
      "\u201cWhy a ceasefire before the leaders\u2019 meeting? Because if we meet and there is no mutual understanding, no willingness or vision on how to end this, then the ceasefire would end that same day. But if we see readiness to continue the dialogue and take real steps toward de-escalation, then the ceasefire would be extended with U.S. mediation guarantees,\u201d he said.",
      "Ukraine is ready to meet at any time from next Monday at a venue such as Istanbul, the Vatican or Switzerland, Zelenskyy said.",
      "A second round of peace talks on Monday between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Istanbul lasted just over an hour and made no progress on ending the war. They agreed only to swap thousands of their dead and seriously wounded troops.",
      "Also, a new prisoner exchange with Russia could take place over the weekend, Zelenskyy said.",

      "BRUSSELS -- The war in Ukraine and the existential threat that Russia poses to European security has dominated NATO\u2019s agenda in each of the summits the military alliance has held since Moscow launched its invasion in 2022.",
      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has sat at the head of NATO\u2019s table and been uniformly praised for his leadership. Ukraine\u2019s place within the ranks of the world\u2019s biggest military organization seemed assured once the war was over.",
      "But three weeks before U.S. President Donald Trump and his NATO counterparts gather in the Netherlands, it remained unclear whether Zelenskyy would even get a seat, or how much support Ukraine might win in the final summit communique.",
      "Asked on Wednesday about Ukraine\u2019s role at the top-level meeting on June 24-25 in The Hague, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said only that it \u201cwill be discussed and on the agenda.\u201d",
      "Ahead of previous summits, NATO envoys have a labored to craft statements that encompass Ukraine\u2019s \u201cirreversible path to membership,\u201d with enduring pledges of support, while insisting that Russia poses the greatest threat to NATO security.",
      "Asked whether Zelenskyy would be invited this time, Rutte said that the meeting program would be available soon. A NATO-Ukraine Council -\u2013 standard fare at recent summits -\u2013 will not be held, so it\u2019s unclear how he would take part if he was.",
      "Invited to comment on Ukraine\u2019s covert weekend drone attack in Russia -\u2013 described as the most significant of the war by some officers and experts -\u2013 Rutte said: \u201cI take note,\u201d underlining only that the drones had hit military targets.",
      "Responding to a similar question on Wednesday, Matthew Whitaker, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, said: \u201cThis war needs to come to an end.\u201d He said Trump \u201cfeels very strongly about that\u201d and sees no military solution to end the war.",
      "What is clear is that Trump will take center-stage in The Hague, along with his demand that all 32 NATO allies invest 5% of gross domestic product on their defense. Zelenskyy should not be allowed to steal the limelight.",
      "\u201cA new defence investment plan will be at the heart of the NATO summit in The Hague,\u201d said Rutte, speaking on the eve of a meeting of the organization\u2019s defense ministers at its Brussels headquarters.",
      "He said this should involve \u201ca huge increase in defense spending to make sure that we can keep ourselves safe, not only now, but also in the future.\u201d Rutte said defense companies \u201cneed to know that we are spending more\u201d so they will ramp up production.",
      "Whitaker said that the 5% target \u201cis not going to be a pledge \u2014 this is going to be a commitment.\u201d He said that the U.S. wants to see concrete plans, budgets and timelines from European allies and Canada on how they intend to get there.",
      "He told reporters that the defense industries of NATO allies \u201cmust outpace\u201d Russia. He added: \"We have no choice. Let me be clear: the time is now.\u201d",
      "NATO's members are weighing a demand from Rutte that they each spend 3.5% of GDP on defense by 2032, plus a further 1.5% on military-related infrastructure projects, such as roads, bridges, airfields and ports.",
      "Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Italy, Luxembourg, Montenegro, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain are not yet spending 2%, though Spain expects to reach that goal this year.",
      "Without a strong show of support for Ukraine at the summit -\u2013 and the acknowledgement that Russia remains NATO\u2019s biggest security threat -\u2013 some member nations may struggle to convince voters of the need to boost defense spending at the expense of other budget demands.",

      "ATHENS, Greece -- Four former senior fire service and civil protection officials were jailed in Greece Wednesday after being found guilty for failing to mount a proper evacuation in a wildfire that killed more than 100 people outside Athens in 2018. A former fire chief, his deputy, and head of a disaster coordination center were each sentenced to serve five years in prison for causing loss of life though negligence, along with a former director of the government's civil protection agency. The July 23, 2018, fire swept through the seaside area of Mati, east of Athens, forcing residents into a chaotic attempt to escape \u2014 either by car through a dense forest or fleeing into the sea. The court in Athens ruled that the officials had failed to organize an orderly evacuation. The defendants were initially found guilty in a trial that concluded last year and not jailed, but a senior prosecutor challenged the verdict, leading to a retrial. Greece is battling an increasing number of serious wildfires annually, which are blamed by authorities on the effects of climate change.",

      "An Australian woman on trial for the triple murder of her estranged husband's relatives and the attempted murder of another has told the Supreme Court in the state of Victoria that she carefully planned the July 2023 lunch where her dinner guests were ...",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Before Erin Patterson\u2019s in-laws and their relatives arrived at her home for lunch, she bought pricey ingredients, consulted friends about recipes and sent her children out to a movie.",
      "Then, the Australian woman served them a dish containing poisonous death cap mushrooms \u2014 a meal that was fatal for three of her four guests.",
      "Whether that was Patterson\u2019s plan is at the heart of a triple murder trial that has gripped Australia for nearly six weeks.",
      "Prosecutors in the Supreme Court case in the state of Victoria say the accused lured her guests to lunch with a lie about having cancer, before deliberately feeding them toxic fungi.",
      "But her lawyers say the tainted beef Wellington she served was a tragic accident caused by a mushroom storage mishap. She denies murdering her estranged husband\u2019s parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and their relative, Heather Wilkinson.",
      "The mother of two also denies attempting to murder Heather\u2019s husband Ian Wilkinson, who survived the meal. In a rare step for a defendant charged with murder, Patterson chose to speak in her own defense at her trial this week.",
      "On Wednesday, she spoke publicly for the first time about the fateful lunch in July 2023 and offered her explanations on how she planned the meal and didn't become sick herself.",
      "No one disputes that Patterson, 50, served death cap mushrooms to her guests for lunch in the rural town of Leongatha, but she says she did it unknowingly.",
      "Patterson said Wednesday she splurged on expensive ingredients and researched ideas to find \u201csomething special\u201d to serve. She deviated from her chosen recipe to improve the \u201cbland\u201d flavor, she said.",
      "She believed she was adding dried fungi bought from an Asian supermarket from a container in her pantry, she told the court.",
      "\"Now I think that there was a possibility that there were foraged ones in there as well,\u201d she told her lawyer, Colin Mandy. Patterson had foraged wild mushrooms for years, she told the court Tuesday, and had put some in her pantry weeks before the deaths.",
      "Patterson, who formally separated from her husband Simon Patterson in 2015, said she felt \u201churt\u201d when Simon told her the night before the lunch that he \u201cwasn\u2019t comfortable\u201d attending.",
      "She earlier told his relatives that she'd arranged the meal to discuss her health. Patterson admitted this week that she never had cancer \u2014 but after a health scare, she told her in-laws she did.",
      "In reality, Patterson said she intended to have weight loss surgery. But she was too embarrassed to tell anybody and planned to pretend to her in-laws that she was undergoing cancer treatment instead, she said.",
      "\u201cI was ashamed of the fact that I didn\u2019t have control over my body or what I ate,\u201d a tearful Patterson said Wednesday. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell anybody, but I shouldn\u2019t have lied to them.\u201d",
      "The accused said she believes she was spared the worst effects of the poisoned meal because she self-induced vomiting shortly after her lunch guests left. She had binged on most of a cake and then made herself throw up \u2014 a problem she said she had struggled with for decades.",
      "Patterson also said she believes she had eaten enough of the meal to cause her subsequent diarrhea. She then sought hospital treatment but unlike her lunch guests, she quickly recovered.",
      "At the hospital where her guests' health was deteriorating, her estranged husband asked her about the dehydrator she used to dry her foraged mushrooms, she said.",
      "\u201cIs that how you poisoned my parents?\u201d she said Simon Patterson asked her.",
      "Growing afraid she would be blamed for the poisoning and that her children would be taken from her, Patterson said she later disposed of her dehydrator. She told investigators she\u2019d never owned one and hadn\u2019t foraged for mushrooms before.",
      "While still at the hospital, she insisted she'd bought all the mushrooms at stores even though she said she knew it was possible that foraged mushrooms had accidentally found their way into the meal.",
      "She was too frightened to tell anyone, Patterson said.",
      "Also later, Patterson said she remotely wiped her cell phone while it sat in an evidence locker to remove pictures of mushrooms she\u2019d foraged.",
      "Prosecutors argued in opening their case in April that she poisoned her husband\u2019s family on purpose, although they didn't suggest a motive. She carefully avoided poisoning herself and faked being ill, they said.",
      "The trial continues on Thursday with Patterson's cross-examination by the prosecutors. If convicted, she faces life in prison for murder and 25 years for attempted murder.",

      "BANGKOK -- A hungry wild elephant caused havoc in a grocery store in Thailand on Monday when he strolled in from a nearby national park and helped himself to food on the shelves.",
      "Videos of the incident showed the huge male elephant, known as Plai Biang Lek, briefly stopping in front of the shop, located next to a main road near the Khao Yai National Park in northeastern Thailand, before ducking his whole body inside.",
      "The elephant stopped in front of the shop\u2019s counter, calmly snatching and chomping snacks, and did not flinch as the national park workers tried to shoo him away.",
      "The elephant later backed out of the shop still holding a bag of snacks with his trunk. He left little damage behind, except mud tracks on the floor and the ceiling of the shop.",
      "In a video posted on social media, Kamploy Kakaew, the shop owner, appeared amused as she described the moment the elephant rifled her shop. She said he ate about nine bags of sweet rice crackers, a sandwich and some dried bananas she had bought that morning.",
      "Kamploy said the elephant left without hurting anyone after getting his snacks.",
      "Danai Sookkanthachat, a volunteer park worker familiar with the elephant, said Plai Biang Lek, who is about 30 years old, is a familiar sight in the area and has been known to enter people\u2019s houses in search of food. This was the first time he had seen him going into a grocery store.",

      "Security was tight Wednesday around Beijing's Tiananmen Square, where weeks of student-led protests shook the party in 1989. Under then-leader Deng Xiaoping, the military was sent in to end the protest on the night of June 3-4. Using live ammunition, soldiers forced their way through crowds on the streets that tried to block them from reaching the square. Hundreds and possibly thousands of people were killed, including dozens of soldiers.",

The group also demanded compensation for the families and a legal case against those responsible for the deaths.",

      "Lee won\u2019t have much time to negotiate with Washington before July 9, when Trump\u2019s 90-day pause in global reciprocal tariffs is set to expire, potentially exposing South Korean products to 25% tax rates.",
      "Although a U.S. federal court recently ruled that Trump lacks authority to impose his planned tariffs, the White House has appealed, leaving the outcome uncertain. Trump has also pushed for product-specific tariffs on key sectors like autos and semiconductors, which make up a major share of South Korean exports. Trump could also seek a broader deal requiring Seoul to pay significantly more for the 28,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea to deter North Korean threats.",
      "While Seoul\u2019s previous government had aimed to reach a \u201cpackage\u201d deal with Trump by early July, Lee has preached patience on tariffs, saying it would be against national interests to obsess with an early agreement.",
      "In his inaugural address, Lee promised to reopen a communication channel with North Korea to ease tensions. But prospects for the early resumption of dialogue between the rival Koreas are dim, as North Korea has been constantly rejecting dialogue offers by South Korea and the U.S. since 2019, when talks between Washington and Pyongyang collapsed over disagreements on economic sanctions.",
      "North Korea\u2019s priority in foreign policy is now firmly Russia, which has received thousands of North Korean troops and large amounts of military equipment in recent months for its warfighting in Ukraine.",
      "During campaigning, Lee acknowledged that it would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d to arrange a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un anytime soon, though it\u2019s something he will seek. Lee said he would support Trump\u2019s efforts to restart nuclear diplomacy with Kim, saying that improved ties between Pyongyang and Washington could allow aid projects for the impoverished North that will likely require South Korean support.",
      "Lee nominated former Unification Minister Lee Jong-seok, a dove who espouses reconciliation with North Korea, as his spy chief. The nomination likely reflects Lee Jae-myung\u2019s hopes to revive inter-Korean dialogue, given the behind-the-scene roles of the National Intelligence Service played to reach out to Pyongyang under the past liberal governments.",
      "However, many experts also note that Lee Jae-myung does not share the same level of Korean nationalist zeal as his liberal predecessors, and they question how firmly he would stick to his appeasement approach if provocative actions by North Korea, such as high-profile missile tests or border incursions, undermine public support for his policy at home.",
      "Lee was previously accused by his critics of tilting toward Pyongyang and Beijing and away from Washington and Tokyo. He once slammed a U.S. missile defense system in South Korea as a source of tensions and likened strengthening U.S.-Japan ties  to a 1905 Washington-Tokyo agreement that he said eventually helped Japan colonize the Korean Peninsula.",
      "But Lee has recently refrained from making similar contentious comments, instead repeatedly pledging to pursue pragmatic diplomacy. He has vowed to enhance South Korea\u2019s alliance with the U.S. and their trilateral cooperation with Japan, while also emphasizing the need to reduce tensions with North Korea and avoid frictions with China and Russia.",
      "While Lee may eventually take steps to improve ties with North Korea and China \u2014 relations that deteriorated under Yoon, who prioritized the U.S. and Japan \u2014 experts say Lee is unlikely to take drastic actions that might undermine the alliance with Washington or negatively impact South Korea's financial markets.",
      "Lee has stated that he will address thorny historical disputes with Japan separately from matters of security, trade, and other issues. However, many experts believe he is unlikely to completely reverse the progress made in Seoul-Tokyo relations in recent years. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Wednesday that he hopes to hold summit talks with Lee \u201cas early as possible\u201d and expressed a desire to further strengthen bilateral ties.",
      "Long accused by critics of being a divisive populist, Lee pledged unity throughout his campaign, vowing not to target conservatives and calling for an end to South Korea\u2019s deep political polarization and a return to dialogue and compromise.",
      "However, he has also pledged a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding Yoon\u2019s martial law stunt \u2014 a saga that could continue to overshadow Lee\u2019s presidency and spark tensions with conservatives, especially as the ousted conservative faces a high-stakes criminal trial on rebellion charges punishable by death or life imprisonment.",
      "While Yoon defended his martial law decree as a necessary response to what he called the Democratic Party\u2019s abuse of its legislative majority to obstruct his agenda, that same majority now gives Lee a far more favorable environment to advance his policies. Conservatives have voiced concern that this could give Lee partially unchecked power and enable him to advance legislation that shields his presidency from his own legal troubles.",
      "Lee faces five separate trials on corruption and other charges, but the hearings were suspended ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election. While South Korea\u2019s constitution shields sitting presidents from most criminal prosecution aside of rebellion or treason, it doesn\u2019t clearly state whether this protection extends to preelection indictments. The Democrats have been pushing to revise the criminal procedure law to keep Lee\u2019s trials suspended during his term, drawing criticism from conservatives.",

      "More than 20,000 residents are being evacuated from part of Cologne\u2019s city center to defuse World War II bombs",
      "COLOGNE, Germany -- More than 20,000 residents were being evacuated from part of Cologne's city center on Wednesday as specialists prepared to defuse three unexploded U.S. bombs from World War II that were unearthed earlier this week.",
      "Even 80 years after the end of the war, unexploded bombs dropped during wartime air raids are frequently found in Germany.",
      "Disposing of them sometimes entails large-scale precautionary evacuations such as the one on Wednesday, though the location this time was unusually prominent and this is Cologne's biggest evacuation since 1945. There have been bigger evacuations in other cities.",
      "Authorities on Wednesday morning started evacuating about 20,500 residents from an area within a 1,000-meter (3,280-foot) radius of the bombs, which were discovered on Monday during preparatory work for road construction. They were found in the Deutz district, just across the Rhine River from Cologne's historic center.",
      "As well as homes, the area includes 58 hotels, nine schools, several museums and office buildings and the Messe/Deutz train station. It also includes three bridges across the Rhine \u2014 among them the heavily used Hohenzollern railway bridge, which leads into Cologne's central station and is being shut during the defusal work itself. Shipping on the Rhine will also be suspended.",
      "The plan is for the bombs to be defused during the course of the day. When exactly that happens depends on how long it takes for authorities to be sure that everyone is out of the evacuation zone.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Images from the election of South Korea's new president, liberal Lee Jae-myung, are everything you\u2019d expect to see in one of the world\u2019s most vibrant democracies.",
      "Peaceful. Orderly. And, because this is South Korea, compulsively eye-catching, with crowds singing raucously along to blaring K-pop, dancers bouncing in closely choreographed sequences, and color-coordinated outfits for the two front-runners and their supporters \u2014 blue for Lee, who was inaugurated Wednesday for a single, five-year term, red for the distant runner-up, conservative Kim Moon Soo.",
      "What the pictures don\u2019t capture is the absolute turmoil of the past six months, making Tuesday one of the strangest \u2014 and, possibly, most momentous -- election days since the country emerged in the late 1980s from decades of dictatorship.",
      "Since Dec. 3, South Koreans have watched, stunned, as an extraordinary sequence of events unfolded: Then-South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law, a first since the dictatorship. In response, lawmakers, leaping fences and jostling with heavily armed soldiers, elbowed their way into a besieged parliament to vote the declaration down. Yoon was then impeached and removed from office and now, just two months after his fall, another president has taken office.",
      "Here is a look at Lee\u2019s victory, the startling events that set up the election, and the challenges Lee faces to heal a nation split along a host of political and social fault lines.",
      "They are, in a way, older than the nation.",
      "The Korean Peninsula was initially divided into a Soviet-backed north and U.S.-backed south after World War II. The states formalized the division in 1948, and the 1950-53 Korean War made it permanent, dividing the rivals along the Demilitarized Zone, one of the most heavily armed borders in the world.",
      "But the tensions go beyond geography. During the long fight for democracy during South Korea's dictatorships, several fractures arose that persist today: the contentions between liberals and conservatives, but also gaps between rich and poor, old and young and men and women.",
      "Since the end of dictatorship, over and over the country has seen its democracy tested.",
      "By its own leaders.",
      "By its antagonistic neighbor to the north.",

      "Preceding Tuesday\u2019s election, thousands of protesters took to the streets, both supporting the deposed Yoon and denouncing him.",
      "\u201cAbove all, the president must bring unity among a divided and confused public, which was caused by the martial law declaration,\u201d Park Soo Hyun, a 22-year-old student, said Wednesday.",
      "Lee's party has a majority in parliament that will presumably allow the new president a freer hand in pushing through liberal legislation, including more funding for welfare programs and policies to address high living costs, joblessness and corruption.",
      "Typically, liberals like Lee have been more wary of South Korea's traditional allies, the United States and Japan, than conservatives. They have also often looked for reconciliation with North Korea.",
      "The United States sees South Korea as a crucial buttress against China and Russia and North Korea\u2019s growing nuclear capabilitie s. The South hosts nearly 30,000 U.S. troops.",
      "Lee, however, will have to find a way to keep his liberal base happy while managing the relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has threatened Seoul with tariffs and has generally been lukewarm about the importance of the alliance.",
      "Lee has also been dogged by a raft of corruption cases, and it\u2019s not yet clear how much of a drag those will be on his presidency.",
      "\"I will make sure there is no more military coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, in which the power entrusted by the people would never be used to intimidate people,\u201d Lee said in his victory speech early Wednesday morning, referring to the martial law decree.",
      "Experts say it's a little of both. The last half-year has worsened already raw divisions, even as it highlighted the underlying strength of a rough-and-tumble democratic process.",
      "\u201cFierce ideological divisions still infuse politics, which could impede South Korea\u2019s chances to grow into a truly mature democracy,\" Duyeon Kim, a visiting professor at Yonsei University in Seoul, wrote recently for the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "But Tuesday\u2019s vote and Wednesday\u2019s inauguration signaled a return to a more normal democracy.",
      "And even the crisis itself showed the resiliency of South Korea's institutions.",
      "A crowd helped lawmakers get past troops and into parliament to overturn the martial law decree. The soldiers who carried out Yoon\u2019s orders did so without enthusiasm and didn\u2019t use force against the people, John Delury, a Korea expert and visiting professor at John Cabot University, said Tuesday.",
      "Korean democracy is in the people\u2019s hands, he said, not any one person\u2019s, even the new president's. Lee \u201centers office with a strong mandate. But he is not the savior of democracy,\" said Delury. \"Korean people saved it themselves. Now they are entrusting him not to do any more damage to it for the next five years.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Students from around the world say being an international student in American today comes with feelings of fear, anxiety and insecurity that have made them more cautious in their daily lives",
      "To attract the brightest minds to America, President Donald Trump proposed a novel idea while campaigning: If elected, he would grant green cards to all foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so sad when we lose people from Harvard, MIT, from the greatest schools,\u201d Trump said during a podcast interview last June. \u201cThat is going to end on Day One.\u201d",
      "That promise never came to pass. Trump\u2019s stance on welcoming foreign students has shifted dramatically. International students have found themselves at the center of an escalating campaign to kick them out or keep them from coming as his administration merges a crackdown on immigration with an effort to reshape higher education.",
      "An avalanche of policies from the Trump administration \u2014 such as terminating students\u2019 ability to study in the U.S., halting all new student visa interviews, moving to block foreign enrollment at Harvard \u2014 have triggered lawsuits, countersuits and confusion for international students who say they feel targeted on multiple fronts.",
      "In interviews, students from around the world described how it feels to be an international student today in America. Their accounts highlight pervasive feelings of fear, anxiety and insecurity that have made them more cautious in their daily lives, distracted them from schoolwork and prompted many to cancel trips home because they fear not being allowed to return.",
      "For many, the last few months have forced them to rethink their dreams of building a life in America.",
      "Markuss Saule, a freshman at Brigham Young University-Idaho, took a recent trip home to Latvia and spent the entire flight back to the U.S. in a state of panic.",
      "For hours, he scrubbed his phone, uninstalling all social media, deleting anything that touched on politics or could be construed as anti-Trump.",
      "\u201cThat whole 10-hour flight, where I was debating, \u2018Will they let me in?\u2019 \u2014 it definitely killed me a little bit,\u201d said Saule, a business analytics major. \u201cIt was terrifying.\u201d",
      "Saule is the type of international student the U.S. has coveted. As a high schooler in Latvia, he qualified for a competitive, merit-based exchange program funded by the U.S. State Department. He spent a year of high school in Minnesota, falling in love with America and a classmate who is now his fiancee. He just ended his freshman year in college with a 4.0 GPA.",
      "But the alarm he felt on that flight crushed what was left of his American dream.",
      "\u201cIf you had asked me at the end of 2024 what my plans were, it was to get married, find a great job here in the U.S. and start a family,\u201d said Saule, who hopes to work as a business data analyst. \u201cThose plans are not applicable anymore. Ask me now, and the plan to leave this place as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "Saule and his fiancee plan to marry this summer, graduate a year early and move to Europe.",
      "This spring the Trump administration abruptly revoked permission to study in the U.S. for thousands of international students before reversing itself. A federal judge has blocked further status terminations, but for many, the damage is done. Saule has a constant fear he could be next.",
      "As a student in Minnesota just three years ago, he felt like a proud ambassador for his country.",
      "\u201cNow I feel a sense of inferiority. I feel that I am expendable, that I am purely an appendage that is maybe getting cut off soon,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s policies carry a clear subtext. \u201cThe policies, what they tell me is simple. It is one word: Leave.\u201d",
      "A concern for attracting the world\u2019s top students was raised in the interview Trump gave last June on the podcast \u201cAll-In.\u201d Can you promise, Trump was asked, to give companies more ability \u201cto import the best and brightest\" students?",
      "\u201cI do promise,\u201d Trump answered. Green cards, he said, would be handed out with diplomas to any foreign student who gets a college or graduate degree.",
      "Trump said he knew stories of \u201cbrilliant\u201d graduates who wanted to stay in the U.S. to work but couldn\u2019t. \u201cThey go back to India, they go back to China\u201d and become multi-billionaires, employing thousands of people. \u201cThat is going to end on Day One.\u201d",
      "Had Trump followed through with that pledge, a 24-year-old Indian physics major named Avi would not be afraid of losing everything he has worked toward.",
      "After six years in Arizona, where Avi attended college and is now working as an engineer, the U.S. feels like a second home. He dreams of working at NASA or in a national lab and staying in America where he has several relatives.",
      "But now he is too afraid to fly to Chicago to see them, rattled by news of foreigners being harassed at immigration centers and airports.",
      "\u201cDo I risk seeing my family or risk deportation?\u201d said Avi, who asked to be identified by his first name, fearing retribution.",
      "Avi is one of about 240,000 people on student visas in the U.S. on Optional Practical Training \u2014 a postgraduation period where students are authorized to work in fields related to their degrees for up to three years. A key Trump nominee has said he would like to see an end to postgraduate work authorization for international students.",
      "Avi\u2019s visa is valid until next year but he feels \u201ca massive amount of uncertainty.\u201d",
      "He wonders if he can sign a lease on a new apartment. Even his daily commute feels different.",
      "\u201cI drive to work every morning, 10 miles an hour under speed limit to avoid getting pulled over,\u201d said Avi, who hopes to stay in the U.S. but is casting a wider net. \u201cI spend a lot of time doomscrolling job listings in India and other places.\u201d",
      "Vladyslav Plyaka came to the U.S. from Ukraine as an exchange student in high school. As war broke out at home, he stayed to attend the University of Wisconsin.",
      "He was planning to visit Poland to see his mother but if he leaves the U.S., he would need to reapply for a visa. He doesn\u2019t know when that will be possible now that visa appointments are suspended, and he doesn\u2019t feel safe leaving the country anyway.",
      "He feels grateful for the education, but without renewing his visa, he\u2019ll be stuck in the U.S. at least two more years while he finishes his degree. He sometimes wonders if he would be willing to risk leaving his education in the United States \u2014 something he worked for years to achieve \u2014 if something happened to his family.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard because every day I have to think about my family, if everything is going to be all right,\u201d he said.",
      "It took him three tries to win a scholarship to study in the U.S. Having that cut short because of visa problems would undermine the sacrifice he made to be here. He sometimes feels guilty that he isn\u2019t at home fighting for his country, but he knows there\u2019s value in gaining an education in America.",
      "\u201cI decided to stay here just because of how good the college education is,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it was not good, I probably would be on the front lines.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Bulgaria has the green light to join the euro next year and become the 21st member of the European Union's currency union",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- European Union officials gave the green light Wednesday for Bulgaria to become the 21st member of the euro currency union,, a key EU project aimed at deepening the ties between member countries.",
      "The Balkan country of 6.4 million people is to make the switch from its national currency, the lev, to the euro on Jan. 1.",
      "Here are basic facts about the currency union, also called the eurozone, and how countries join it.",
      "The euro is a shared currency and monetary system launched in 1999 when 11 EU member countries irrevocably fixed their currencies to the euro as an accounting currency, then swapped out the national notes and coins in 2002.",
      "The EU established the European Central Bank to handle monetary policy and set interest rate benchmarks for member countries, similar to the role of the U.S. Federal Reserve in the U.S.",
      "Countries must meet four criteria: low inflation, keeping deficits and debt under control, low long-term interest rates and a stable exchange rate between their currency and the euro. Countries must go through a two-year \u201cwaiting room\u201d in which their currency does not fluctuate excessively against the euro. The process is meant to demonstrate that their economies are sustainably converging with that of the eurozone.",
      "Once the European Commission determines that requirements have been met, the member governments of the EU decide by what's called a qualified majority vote. Approval needs a minimum of 55% of member states representing at least 65% of the EU population.",
      "After joining, countries face rules limiting debt and deficits. Those rules are intended to keep countries from running large deficits that could undermine the euro.",
      "The European Commission ruled Wednesday that Bulgaria has met the requirements, seconded by an opinion from the ECB. The matter now goes to a vote at a meeting of EU finance ministers slated for July 8. EU officials say the vote is a done deal.",
      "Bulgaria is unusual in that it pegged its currency, the lev, to the euro right from the beginning of monetary union in 1999, even before it joined the European Union in 2007. Bulgaria also has very low levels of debt, only 24.1% of annual economic output. That is well below the 60% level set in the economic criteria for eurozone membership. The last step was getting inflation below the benchmark of 2.8%, or no more than 1.5% higher than the average of the three lowest eurozone members.",
      "There were concerns about the level of corruption and money laundering in the EU's poorest country. The commission and the ECB found however that Bulgaria has made progress in those areas.",
      "The most recent Eurobarometer poll carried out by the EU showed that 50% of Bulgarians were opposed and 43% in favor. Reasons include fears of inflation, distrust of official institutions in a country that has had seven governments in four years, and widespread misinformation on social media.",
      "The issue has been taken up by pro-Russian nationalist politicians who argue for keeping the national currency. President Rumen Radev stoked anti-euro forces with a proposal for a referendum, which was rejected by parliament. Misinformation included false claims that the euro would allow EU officials to confiscate dormant bank accounts or use a digital euro to control people.",
      "On Jan.1, only euros will be dispensed from cash machines, though both currencies will circulate in cash for a month. After that, lev notes can be exchanged at banks for 12 months and for an unlimited time at the Bulgarian national bank.",
      "In theory, the euro brings means lower interest rates for business and consumers and eases cross-border trade within the eurozone. Companies no longer have to engage in currency exchange transactions or worry that exchange rate shifts will erode their profits or holdings. Travelers no longer have to pay commissions at an exchange booth or on their credit card bill when vacationing or on a business trip to another EU country.",
      "Member countries get a seat on the ECB\u2019s rate-setting council and so have a voice in eurozone-wide monetary policy.",
      "Countries that join lose some authority over their own economy. They give up their ability set their own interest rates, and face restrictions on government spending and deficits, though those rules have proved flexible in practice. And they can no longer gain competitiveness relative to other countries by allowing their currency's exchange rate to devalue.",
      "Bitter memories remain of the debt and economic crisis that shook the eurozone in 2010-2015. After Greece admitted its deficit and debts were much larger than previously reported, it wound up defaulting on its debts and market turmoil spread to other eurozone countries.",
      "Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain, and Cyprus were bailed out with loans by the other eurozone governments, in return for strict austerity measures that impacted many ordinary people including government workers and retirees.",
      "ECB President Mario Draghi is credited with defusing the eurozone crisis in 2012 by saying that the central bank would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro. The ECB then said it could intervene in bond markets to support countries hit by turmoil, a safeguard that calmed markets even though it was never used.",
      "Later other backstops were added, including a eurozone bailout fund and moving banking oversight from sometimes-lax national supervisors to the ECB.",
      "Countries agree to join the euro as part of joining the EU, but not all have made the effort to meet the economic requirements. There is no time window to join.",
      "Denmark was granted an opt out, while Sweden rejected the euro in a 2003 referendum despite not having an opt out and has no target date to join. Other non-members are Czechia, Hungary, Poland and Romania.",
      "Officials in Poland, the biggest non-member, have shown little interest in joining despite acknowledging the obligation to join someday. The winner of Sunday's presidential election, Karol Nawrocki, campaigned on keeping the zloty currency.",
      "The country's economy has grown strongly without euro membership, doubling in size over the past two decades as its standard of living has almost caught up with Western Europe since emerging from communist rule in 1989.",

      "The contract between the dominant power company CEZ, where the Czech state has a majority stake, and KHNP was due to be signed on May 7 but EDF lodged a legal challenge at the regional court in the second-largest Czech city of Brno after the Czech anti-monopoly office dismissed its complaint about the tender.",
      "The regional court said on May 6 that the deal could not be signed before it rules on the EDF case, because then there would be no way to change it even if the French company won.",
      "CEZ and KHNP challenged that.",

      "Labubu, the plush toy from China\u2019s Pop Mart is a social media darling, but the toothy little monsters are not an overnight success",
      "Labubu, the plush toy from China's Pop Mart is a social media darling, but the toothy little monsters are far from an overnight success. Having appeared a decade ago, Labubus may have finally cemented their place in the collectible toy market for years to come.",
      "The Labubu, by artist and illustrator Kasing Lung, first appeared with pointed ears and pointy teeth, in three picture books inspired by Nordic mythology in 2015.",
      "In 2019 Lung struck a deal with Pop Mart, a company that caters to toy connoisseurs and influencers, to sell Labubu figurines. But it wasn't until Pop Mart started selling Labubu plush toys on key rings in 2023 that the toothy monsters suddenly seemed to be everywhere, including in the hands of Rihanna, Kim Kardashian and NBA star Dillon Brooks. K-pop singer Lisa of Blackpink began posting images of hers for her more than 100 million followers on Instagram and on TikTok, where Labubu pandemonium has broken out.",
      "There are 1.4 million #Labubu TikTok posts and counting, videos of fans unboxing them, showing styles inspired by them, and of course, Labubu cosplay.",
      "Fans have latched on to Labubu\u2019s mashup of play and fashion, making them accessories on handbags, backpacks and belts, or hanging them from car mirrors.",
      "\u201cThe character has evolved into a collectible and style symbol, resonating with fans who connect with its quirky aesthetic and unique backstory,\u201d Emily Brough, Popmart\u2019s head of IP licensing in the Americas, said.",
      "Labubu has been a bonanza for Pop Mart. Its revenue more than doubled in 2024 to 13.04 billion yuan ($1.81 billion), thanks in part to its elvish monster. Revenue from Pop Mart's plush toys soared more than 1,200% in 2024, nearly 22% of its overall revenue, according to the company's annual report.",
      "Aside from their ability to pique the interest of toy aficionados and fashionistas, Labubu latched on to the blind box phenomenon, where the purchaser doesn't know exactly which version of the plush toy they'll get.",
      "And Pop Mart made sure there is a Labubu for everyone, regardless of income. Most are priced in a wide rage between $20 and $300, with certain collaborations or limited editions priced higher, according to Brough.",
      "Unlike many toys, Labubu devotees include a large number of adults. Buyers ages 18 and over drove a year-over-year increase of more than $800 million in the U.S. toy market in 2024, according to market research firm Circana. Adult shoppers, mostly female, bought the toys for themselves. In 2025's first quarter, toy sales for those ages 18 and over rose 12% from the prior-year period. At $1.8 billion, adults also accounted for the highest spending among all age groups in the quarter.",
      "Like many retailers, Pop Mart is actively monitoring negotiations between the U.S. and just about every one of its trading partners as prices may be impacted. The situation with China is at the forefront, with President Donald Trump saying on Friday that the country \u201cviolated\u201d an agreement with the United States on trade talks.",
      "Right now Pop Mart, whose products are manufactured across Asia, says that it is continuously scaling production and expanding distribution across its online shop, retail stores and blind box vending machines to meet increasing demand.",
      "Short supply has led to long lines at stores and at least one physical fight at a shopping center in the United Kingdom. Pop Mart said in an Instagram post late last month that it was temporarily suspending all in-store and blind box machine sales in the U.K. Peter Shipman, head of Europe, said in a Facebook post that the company is currently working on a new method to distribute toys to stores.",
      "Resellers have become problematic and many Labubu fans are still willing to pay exorbitant price markups.",
      "Kena Flynn was at The Grove shopping center in Los Angeles recently when she stumbled upon some Labubus being sold at a kiosk. Flynn said in a TikTok on Sunday that the prices were \u201creally bad,\u201d but her boyfriend bought two anyway.",
      "\u201cAt a certain point, you can\u2019t buy them,\u201d Flynn said in her video. \u201cI just want a Labubu and I cannot buy one from Pop Mart, so here we are.\u201d",
      "Looking to keep up with the overwhelming demand, Pop Mart says it's on track for 50 more retail locations in the U.S. by the end of the year. That'll give shoppers more chances to hunt for Labubus, as Pop Mart says it's planning multiple new Labubu releases tied to seasonal moments and holidays throughout the rest of the year.",

He said ongoing technical meetings between EU and U.S. negotiators in Washington would be soon followed by a video conference between himself and Greer to then \"assess the progress and charter the way forward.\u201d",
      "Brussels and Washington are unlikely to reach a substantive trade agreement in Paris. The issues dividing them are too difficult to resolve quickly.",
      "President Donald Trump regularly fumes about America\u2019s persistent trade deficit with the European Union, which was a record $161 billion last year, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.",
      "Trump blames the gap between what the U.S. sells and what it buys from Europe on unfair trade practices and often singles out for criticism the EU\u2019s 10% tax on imported cars. America\u2019s was 2.5% until Trump raised it to 25% in April. The EU has argued its purchases of U.S. services, especially in the technology sector, all but overcome the deficit.",

      "Trump and his advisers consider VATs unfair protectionism because they are levied on U.S. products. But VATs are set at a national level, not by the EU, and apply to domestic and imported products alike, so they have not traditionally been considered a trade barrier. There is little chance governments will overhaul their tax systems to appease Trump.",

      "China imposed a one-child policy in 1979 amid worries about overpopulation. But as the country faces growing concerns about the long-term economic and societal challenges of an aging population, it has been slowly easing the policy to allow a second child and then a third child in 2021, but with little success at boosting birthrates.",

      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Top Trump administration officials \u2014 fresh off touring one of the country's largest oil fields in the Alaska Arctic \u2014 headlined an energy conference led by the state's Republican governor on Tuesday that environmentalists criticized as promoting new oil and gas drilling and turning away from the climate crisis.",
      "Several dozen protesters were outside Gov. Mike Dunleavy's annual Alaska Sustainable Energy Conference in Anchorage, where U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin were featured speakers. The federal officials were continuing a multiday trip aimed at highlighting President Donald Trump's push to expand oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in the state.",
      "The trip has included meetings with pro-drilling groups and officials, including some Alaska Native leaders on the petroleum-rich North Slope, and a visit to the Prudhoe Bay oil field near the Arctic Ocean that featured selfies near the 800-mile (1,287-kilometer) trans-Alaska oil pipeline.",
      "Calls for additional oil and gas drilling \u2014 including Trump\u2019s renewed focus on getting a massive liquefied natural gas project built \u2014 are \u201cfalse solutions\u201d to energy needs and climate concerns, protester Sarah Furman said outside the Anchorage convention hall, as people carried signs with slogans such as \u201cAlaska is Not for Sale\u201d and \u201cProtect our Public Lands.\u201d",
      "\"We find it really disingenuous that they\u2019re hosting this conference and not talking about real solutions,\u201d she said.",
      "Topics at the conference, which runs through Thursday, also include mining, carbon management, nuclear energy, renewables and hydrogen. Oil has been Alaska\u2019s economic lifeblood for decades, and Dunleavy has continued to embrace fossil fuels even as he has touted other energy opportunities in the state.",
      "Another protester, Rochelle Adams, who is Gwich\u2019in, raised concerns about the ongoing push to allow oil and gas drilling on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Gwich\u2019in leaders have said they consider the coastal plain sacred, as caribou they rely on calve there. Leaders of the I\u00f1upiaq community of Kaktovik, which is within the refuge, support drilling as economically vital and have joined Alaska political leaders in welcoming Trump's interest in reviving a leasing program there.",
      "\u201cWhen these people come from outside to take and take and take, we are going to be left with the aftereffects,\u201d Adams said, adding later: \u201cIt's our health that will be impacted. It\u2019s our wellness, our ways of life.\u201d",
      "Zeldin, during a friendly question-and-answer period led by Dunleavy, said wildlife he saw while on the North Slope didn't appear \u201cto be victims of their surroundings\u201d and seemed \u201chappy.\u201d",
      "Burgum, addressing a move toward additional drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, said wildlife and development can coexist. His agency during the Alaska trip announced plans to repeal Biden-era restrictions on future leasing and industrial development in portions of the petroleum preserve that are designated as special for their wildlife, subsistence or other values.",
      "Wright bristled at the idea of policy \"in the name of climate change\u201d that he said would have no impact on climate change. Stopping oil production in Alaska doesn't change demand for oil, he said.",

      "Joining for part of the U.S. officials' trip were representatives from Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Taiwan and United Arab Emirates. Asian countries are being courted to sign onto the Alaska gas project, which has floundered for years to gain traction amid cost and other concerns. The project, as proposed, would include a nearly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline that would funnel gas from the North Slope to port, with an eye largely on exports of liquefied natural gas.",

      "Glenfarne Alaska LNG LLC, which has taken a lead in advancing the project, on Tuesday announced expressions of interest from a number of \u201cpotential partners.\" Costs surrounding the project \u2014 which have been pegged around $44 billion for the pipeline and other infrastructure \u2014 are in the process of being refined before a decision is made on whether to move forward.",

      "The White House has officially asked Congress to claw back $9.4 billion in already approved spending",
      "WASHINGTON -- The White House on Tuesday officially asked Congress to claw back $9.4 billion in already approved spending, taking funding away from programs targeted by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "It's a process known as \u201crescission,\u201d which requires President Donald Trump to get approval from Congress to return money that had previously been appropriated. Trump's aides say the funding cuts target programs that promote liberal ideologies.",
      "The request, if it passes the House and Senate, would formally enshrine many of the spending cuts and freezes sought by DOGE. It comes at a time when Musk is extremely unhappy with the tax cut and spending plan making its way through Congress, calling it on Tuesday a \u201cdisgusting abomination\u201d for increasing the federal deficit.",
      "White House budget director Russ Vought said more rescission packages and other efforts to cut spending could follow if the current effort succeeds.",
      "\u201cWe are certainly willing and able to send up additional packages if the congressional will is there,\u201d Vought told reporters.",
      "Here's what to know about the rescissions request:",
      "The request to Congress is unlikely to meaningfully change the troublesome increase in the U.S. national debt. Tax revenues have been insufficient to cover the growing costs of Social Security, Medicare and other programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the government is on track to spend roughly $7 trillion this year, with the rescission request equaling just 0.1% of that total.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at Tuesday's briefing that Vought \u2014 a \u201cwell-respected fiscal hawk,\u201d she called him \u2014 would continue to cut spending, hinting that there could be additional efforts to return funds.",
      "\u201cHe has tools at his disposal to produce even more savings,\u201d Leavitt said.",
      "Vought said he can send up additional rescissions at the end of the fiscal year in September \u201cand if Congress does not act on it, that funding expires.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons why we are not putting all of our expectations in a typical rescissions process,\u201d he added.",
      "A spokesperson for the White House Office of Management and Budget, speaking on condition of anonymity to preview some of the items that would lose funding, said that $8.3 billion was being cut from the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development. NPR and PBS would also lose federal funding, as would the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, also known as PEPFAR.",
      "The spokesperson listed specific programs that the Trump administration considered wasteful, including $750,000 to reduce xenophobia in Venezuela, $67,000 for feeding insect powder to children in Madagascar and $3 million for circumcision, vasectomies and condoms in Zambia.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., complimented the planned cuts and pledged to pass them.",
      "\u201cThis rescissions package reflects many of DOGE\u2019s findings and is one of the many legislative tools Republicans are using to restore fiscal sanity,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cCongress will continue working closely with the White House to codify these recommendations, and the House will bring the package to the floor as quickly as possible.\u201d",
      "Members of the House Freedom Caucus, among the chamber\u2019s most conservative lawmakers, said they would like to see additional rescission packages from the administration.",
      "\u201cWe will support as many more rescissions packages the White House can send us in the coming weeks and months,\u201d the group said in a press release. \u201cPassing this rescissions package will be an important demonstration of Congress\u2019s willingness to deliver on DOGE and the Trump agenda.\u201d",
      "Sen. Susan Collins, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, gave the package a less optimistic greeting.",
      "\u201cDespite this fast track, the Senate Appropriations Committee will carefully review the rescissions package and examine the potential consequences of these rescissions on global health, national security, emergency communications in rural communities, and public radio and television stations,\u201d the Maine lawmaker said in a statement.",
      "The White House's request to return appropriated funds is meant to comply with the 1974 Impoundment Control Act. That law created the process by which the president can formally disclose to Congress the appropriated money it intends to not spend. Congress generally has 45 days to review and approve the request, but Vought is arguing that the end of the fiscal year would enable the administration to bypass a vote.",
      "The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group, said in a 2018 backgrounder that the Senate can pass rescission packages with a simple majority, instead of the 60 votes needed to overcome a possible filibuster. Between 1974 and 2000, presidents requested $76 billion worth of rescissions and Congress approved $25 billion.",
      "Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, said in an emailed statement that the Trump administration was already \u201cillegally impounding additional funds,\u201d as withholding money has \u201calways been illegal without explicit Congressional approval.\u201d",
      "On CNN on Sunday, Vought insisted that the Trump administration was complying with the law, but it simply had a different view of the law relative to some Democrats.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not breaking the law,\u201d Vought said. \u201cEvery part of the federal government, each branch, has to look at the Constitution themselves and uphold it, and there\u2019s tension between the branches.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve said Tuesday that Wells Fargo is no longer subject to harsh restraints the Fed placed on the bank in 2018 for having a toxic sales and banking culture.",
      "It's a win for Wells Fargo, which has spent nearly a decade trying to convince the public and policymakers that it had changed its ways.",
      "\"We are a different and far stronger company today because of the work we\u2019ve done,\u201d said Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf in a statement. Scharf also announced that each of the 215,000 employees at Wells Fargo would receive a $2,000 award for turning the bank around.",
      "Wells Fargo used to have a corporate culture where it placed unreasonable sales goals on its branch employees, which resulted in employees opening up millions of fake accounts in order to meet those goals. Wells' top executives called its branches \u201cstores\u201d and employees were expected to cross-sell customers into as many banking products as possible, even if the customer did not want or need them.",
      "After an investigation by The Los Angeles Times in 2016, Wells Fargo shut down its sales culture and fired much of its leadership and board of directors. The fake accounts scandal cost Wells Fargo billions of dollars in fines and lost business, and permanently tarnished its reputation, particularly because the scandal broke only a few years after the Great Recession and financial crisis. It was later revealed that Wells Fargo opened up roughly 3.5 million accounts that were not wanted or needed by customers.",
      "Wells Fargo, once thought to be the best run bank in the country, was now the poster child of the worst practices of banking in decades.",
      "In order to push Wells to fix itself, the Federal Reserve took the unusual step of placing Wells Fargo in a program where the bank could grow no larger than it was in 2018. No bank had previously been placed into such a program, known as an asset cap. The Fed required Wells to fix it culture and redo its entire risk and compliance departments in order to address its problems.",
      "Since taking over in 2019, Scharf's goal has been to convince the Federal Reserve that Wells Fargo had fixed its toxic banking practices. With the asset cap removed, the bank can now pursue more deposits, new accounts and take on additional investment banking businesses by holding additional securities on its balance shet.",

      "His turbulent life climaxed, as Lee, 60, the candidate of the main liberal Democratic Party, was elected as South Korea's new president to succeed his conservative archrival Yoon Suk Yeol, who was ousted over his stunning imposition of martial law.",
      "There are both hopes and fears about Lee's win. Supporters think he's an able leader who can get things done and fix the country's deep-rooted economic inequality and corruption. But critics say Lee will likely oppress political opponents and intensify a domestic division.",
      "Here's a look at Lee, whose single, five-year presidency begins on Wednesday:",
      "After graduating from an elementary school, Lee had to work at various factories in Seongnam, a city near Seoul, because his family couldn\u2019t afford his secondary education.",
      "At a factory manufacturing baseball gloves, he had his left forearm crushed by a press machine, getting a permanent arm disability. Lee said he suffered beating at his factories and hated encountering a girl who was a neighbor when he helped his garbage collector father's work at a traditional market.",
      "Despaired, Lee tried to kill himself twice, both unsuccessfully. He later got back on his feet and entered Seoul's Chung-Ang University with a full scholarship, before he became a human rights lawyer.",
      "\u201cHopes and ordeals always come together. The roles of ordeals are not getting people to surrender, but testing how serious and desperate their hopes are,\u201d Lee said in a memoir published in 2017.",
      "Lee later entered politics and became Seongnam mayor and governor of Gyeonggi province. Once a political outsider, Lee rose to prominence in 2016 after he made a series of fiery street speeches criticizing then conservative President Park Geun-hye, who was later removed from office over a corruption scandal.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s seize her with our hands and consign her to history,\" Lee said during one rally in December 2016.",
      "Many of his comments have since sharply polarized South Koreans.",
      "Lee vilified South Korea's conservative establishment as greedy \u201cfake conservatives.\" He slammed a U.S. missile defense system in South Korea as a source of tensions and likened strengthening U.S.-Japan ties to a 1905 Washington-Tokyo agreement that he said helped Japan colonize the Korean Peninsula later.",
      "Lee's proposal of giving a universal basic income to all citizens have invited accusations that he's a populist.",
      "In 2022, he lost the hotly contested presidential election to Yoon. In 2024, Lee was attacked by a man who told investigators that he wanted to kill Lee to prevent him from becoming president.",
      "Recently, Lee has made few contentious or radical comments on foreign policy and security issues, and rather has promised to pursue pragmatic diplomacy.",
      "He's repeatedly described South Korea's alliance with the U.S. as the foundation of the country's foreign policy and stressed the need to maintain a trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo security partnership.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to what Lee said in the past, we don't know whether he made such comments only to appeal to his supporters or whether they showed his true nature,\u201d said Shin Yul, a politics professor at Seoul\u2019s Myonggi University.",
      "The major issues that Lee will immediately face is U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war and other \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies, and North Korea's advancing nuclear program. They are both vital issues for South Korea, but many experts say there isn't much diplomatic room for South Korea to maneuver in to produce major changes in its favor in both matters.",
      "Paik Wooyeal, a professor at Seoul\u2019s Yonsei University, said that Trump is \u201ctoo overwhelming and dominant,\u201d so that whoever is in South Korean leadership, the country's dealings with the U.S. won't be much different. He said that foreign policy advisers for Lee would also know that North Korea won't voluntarily give up its nuclear weapons.",
      "Lee comes to office under the shadow of his own legal troubles.",
      "He stands accused in five trials over corruption and other charges, and at one point, some of his legal battles threatened his bid for presidency.",
      "Lee celebrated in March when the Seoul High Court overturned a suspended prison sentence against him for violating the election law during the 2022 race. But he fumed in May when the Supreme Court quashed that ruling and sent the case back to the high court, citing a strong likelihood of his guilt. Hearings at the high court were eventually postponed until after the election.",
      "Had his conviction been finalized, Lee would have been barred from running for president.",
      "Other trials center around his roles in dubious development projects and illegal money transfers to North Korea, and his alleged misuse of official funds and persuading of a witness to commit perjury.",
      "Lee's five trials will likely stop as South Korea\u2019s constitution prevents a sitting president from being charged with most crimes. But his rivals will take issue with it, because the constitution doesn't clearly state whether a president can be convicted for crimes in which indictments came before taking up office.",
      "Lee\u2019s Democratic Party, which holds a majority in the National Assembly, has been pushing to revise the criminal procedure law to suspend ongoing criminal trials involving a sitting president until the end of their term. Conservatives have harshly lambasted the move.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Lee vowed not to pursue a vendetta against conservatives. However, he has also called for a thorough investigation into Yoon and his inner circle over rebellion allegations.",
      "Lee's opponents worry he could use those investigations to clamp down on Yoon associates and prosecutors who he thinks orchestrated inquiries involving his criminal charges.",
      "Yoon's martial law stunt intensified a domestic divide.",
      "Declaring martial law, Yoon portrayed Lee's party as \u201canti-state\u201d forces influenced by North Korea and China. He has also endorsed baseless election fraud theories to discredit the liberals\u2019 legislative majority, prompting his angry supporters to pour onto the streets with \u201cStop the Steal\u201d signs. Anti-Yoon activists and citizens, for their part, also rallied for weeks to demand his immediate dismissal.",
      "With liberals remaining in control of the legislature, Lee faces a far more favorable environment to advance his policies. Conservatives have voiced concern that Lee and the Democratic Party will wield virtually unchecked power to pass legislation previously blocked by Yoon\u2019s administration, including bills aimed at strengthening protections for labor unionists against corporate lawsuits and shielding farmers from volatile rice prices.",

    "story": [
      "Colombia\u2019s wind energy plans in La Guajira are faltering as major companies exit and projects remain stalled",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Colombia\u2019s ambitious plans for wind energy development, especially in the resource-rich La Guajira region, are facing serious setbacks as major companies pull out and projects stall, industry experts say.",
      "Margarita Nieves, director of the Colombian Offshore Wind Research Network, told The Associated Press that despite large targets \u2014 including 1.1 gigawatts awarded in a 2019 auction \u2014 only two wind farms are partially operating today, with a combined capacity of less than 32 megawatts.",
      "Colombia\u2019s Mining and Energy Planning Unit estimates the country could generate up to 18 gigawatts of wind energy \u2014 nearly double the nation\u2019s current installed electricity capacity of 20 gigawatts.",
      "Several companies brought equipment and infrastructure to Colombia around 2021 before securing permits, but parks remain unbuilt. Key obstacles include limited grid connection infrastructure in La Guajira, recent regulatory changes that reduce financial returns and complex social and leadership challenges.",
      "Colombia, Latin America\u2019s third-most populous country, has pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. President Gustavo Petro, the country\u2019s first leftist leader, presents himself as an environmentalist and advocate of a just energy transition. Yet Colombia remains deeply reliant on fossil fuels \u2014 oil is its top export and a major source of government revenue.",
      "In 2023, Italian multinational Enel withdrew from the Windpeshi onshore wind energy project in La Guajira. By late 2024, EDP Renewables canceled two major projects, Alpha and Beta, two large-scale onshore wind farms in the same region. In May, Colombian state-owned oil company Ecopetrol acquired nine solar and wind energy projects from Norway\u2019s Statkraft, marking the European firm\u2019s exit from the country. The portfolio spans La Guajira, Sucre, Cordoba, Caldas, and Magdalena, with a combined potential capacity of 1.3 gigawatts. Only one project is currently operational, with others expected to come online between 2026 and 2027.",
      "The move is part of Ecopetrol\u2019s broader energy transition strategy to reduce reliance on oil and gas and meet net-zero goals by 2050. However, challenges like regulatory delays, governance concerns, and potential impacts on Colombia\u2019s fiscal stability raise questions about the transition\u2019s pace and economic effects.",
      "Nieves warned that the situation is \u201cvery concerning,\u201d with only two of over 20 planned projects advancing. She stressed the need to speed up regulatory processes, improve consultations with Indigenous communities \u2014 notably the Wayuu in La Guajira \u2014 and ensure sufficient electrical infrastructure.",
      "\u201cColombia has more than 20 years of delay in wind energy,\u201d Nieves said. \u201cBrazil, in contrast, has built over 1,300 onshore wind farms in the last two decades and is a top global turbine producer.\"",
      "The wind energy projects were part of Colombia\u2019s just energy transition, aiming to replace fossil fuels with renewables while supporting vulnerable groups like Indigenous peoples. The region is home to Cerrejon, one of the largest open-pit coal mines in the world and a major player in Latin America\u2019s mining sector, which has been in operation since 1985. The mine has just nine years left in its life span, and its closure, without alternative plans in place, will deal a significant blow to the region\u2019s economy.",
      "For Samuel Lanao, head of La Guajira\u2019s environmental authority, the main reason several licensed renewable energy projects are being sold off is because companies struggle with deep-rooted social tensions, particularly during the prior consultation process with local Indigenous communities. Lanao said confrontations have emerged between firms and residents, derailing expectations of development.",
      "\u201cThis has been a major blow to La Guajira,\u201d he said, \u201cas there were high hopes for economic and social progress through these projects.\u201d",
      "The Wayuu people, a seminomadic Indigenous group in the arid La Guajira region of northern Colombia and Venezuela, remain divided over wind energy development. While some have welcomed the economic support offered by companies building turbines on their ancestral lands, many others have raised concerns over environmental and cultural impacts, and a lack of meaningful prior consultation, in what is one of Colombia\u2019s poorest regions.",
      "Diego Patron, manager of the Jemeiwaa Ka\u2019I wind project, a large-scale wind farm cluster in La Guajira, acknowledged the pioneering nature of Colombia\u2019s early wind efforts, which began in a regulatory vacuum without clear institutional frameworks.",
      "\u201cThese foundational projects faced a steep institutional and territorial learning curve, resulting in the loss of key strategic projects,\u201d Patron said. \u201cHowever, their legacy now forms the cornerstone for new initiatives.\"",
      "Patron believes that barriers around legitimate Wayuu community representation, environmental permitting, and contract resolutions have been overcome, creating more stable conditions.\u201d",
      "Patron said misinformation deepened tensions and unfairly damaged firms like EDP that, he says, aimed to support communities.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump wants his \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d bill of tax breaks and spending cuts on his desk to be signed into law by the Fourth of July, and he's pushing the slow-rolling Senate to make it happen sooner rather than later.",
      "Trump met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune at the White House early this week and has been dialing senators for one-on-one chats, using both the carrot and stick to nudge, badger and encourage them to act. But it's still a long road ahead for the 1,000-page-plus package.",
      "\u201cHis question to me was, How do you think the bill's going to go in the Senate?\u201d Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said about his call with Trump. \u201cDo you think there's going to be problems?\u201d",
      "It's a potentially tumultuous three-week sprint for senators preparing to put their own imprint on the massive Republican package that cleared the House late last month by a single vote. The senators have been meeting for weeks behind closed doors, including as they returned to Washington late Monday, to revise the package ahead of what is expected to be a similarly narrow vote in the Senate.",
      "\u201cPassing THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL is a Historic Opportunity to turn our Country around,\u201d Trump posted on social media. He urged them Monday \u201cto work as fast as they can to get this Bill to MY DESK before the Fourth of JULY.\u201d",
      "But Trump's high-octane ally, billionaire Elon Musk, lambasted the package \u2014 and those voting for it.",
      "\u201cThis massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,\u201d Musk posted on his site X, as some lawmakers have expressed reservations about the details. \u201cShame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.\u201d",
      "Thune, like House Speaker Mike Johnson, has few votes to spare from the Senate's slim, 53-seat GOP majority. Democrats are waging an all-out political assault on GOP proposals to cut Medicaid, food stamps and green energy investments to help pay for more than $4.5 trillion in tax cuts \u2014 with many lawmakers being hammered at boisterous town halls back home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be nice if we could have everybody on board to do it, but, you know, individual members are going to stake out their positions,\u201d Thune said Tuesday.",
      "\u201cBut in the end, we have to succeed. Failure\u2019s not an option.\u201d",
      "At its core, the package seeks to extend the tax cuts approved in 2017, during Trump's first term at the White House, and add new ones the presidents campaigned on, including no taxes on tips and others. It also includes a massive build-up of $350 billion for border security, deportations and national security.",
      "To defray the lost tax revenue to the government and avoid piling onto the nation's $36 trillion debt load, Republicans want reduce federal spending by imposing work requirements for some Americans who rely on government safety net services. Estimates are 8.6 million people would no longer have health care and nearly 4 million would lose Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program benefits, known as SNAP.",
      "The package also would raise the nation's debt limit by $4 trillion to allow more borrowing to pay the bills.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump's bill \"is ugly to its very core.\u201d",
      "Schumer said Tuesday it's a \u201clie\u201d that the cuts won't hurt Americans. \u201cBehind the smoke and mirrors lies a cruel and draconian truth: tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy paid for by gutting health care for millions of Americans,\" said the New York senator.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is expected to soon provide an overall analysis of the package's impacts on the government balance sheets, particular rising annual deficits. But Republicans are ready to blast those findings from the congressional scorekeeper as flawed.",
      "Trump Tuesday switched to tougher tactics, deriding the holdout Republican senators to get on board.",
      "The president laid into Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, the libertarian-leaning deficit hawk who has made a career of arguing against government spending. Paul wants the package's $4 trillion increase to the debt ceiling out of the bill.",
      "\u201cRand votes NO on everything, but never has any practical or constructive ideas. His ideas are actually crazy (losers!).\u201d Trump posted.",
      "Paul seemed unfazed. \u201cI like the president, supported the president,\u201d the senator said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t in good conscience give up every principle that I stand for and every principle that I was elected upon.\u201d",
      "The July 4th deadline is not only aspirational for the president, it's all but mandatory for his Treasury Department. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned Congress that the nation will run out of money to pay its bills if the debt ceiling, now at $36 trillion, is not lifted by mid-July or early August to allow more borrowing. Bessent has also been meeting behind closed doors with senators and GOP leadership.",
      "Thune acknowledged Tuesday that lifting the debt ceiling is not up for debate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s got to be done,\u201d the South Dakota senator said.",
      "The road ahead is also a test for Thune who, like Johnson, is a newer leader in Congress and among the many Republicans adjusting their own priorities with Trump's return to the White House.",
      "While Johnson has warned against massive changes to the package, Thune faces demands from his senators for adjustments.",
      "To make most of the tax cuts permanent \u2014 particularly the business tax breaks that are the Senate priorities \u2014 senators may shave some of Trump's proposed new tax breaks on automobile loans or overtime pay, which are policies less prized by some senators.",
      "There are also discussions about altering the $40,000 cap that the House proposed for state and local deductions, known as SALT, which are important to lawmakers in high-tax New York, California and other states, but less so among GOP senators.",
      "\u201cWe're having all those discussions,\u201d said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., another key voice in the debate.",
      "Hawley is a among a group of senators, including Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who have raised concerns about the Medicaid changes that could boot people from health insurance.",
      "A potential copay of up to $35 for Medicaid services that was part of the House package, as well as a termination of a provider tax that many states rely on to help fund rural hospitals, have also raised concerns.",
      "\u201cThe best way to not be accused of cutting Medicaid is to not cut Medicaid,\u201d Hawley said.",
      "Collins said she is reviewing the details.",
      "There's also a House provision that would allow the auction of spectrum bandwidth that some senators oppose.",

      "A Spanish government minister tells The Associated Press that Spain has sent a message with its recent crackdown on Airbnb",
      "MADRID -- MADRID (AP) \u2014 Spain 's government wanted to send a message last month with its crackdown on Airbnb: that the Spanish economy and its housing market are not a \u201cfree for all\" that value profits over the rule of law, a minister told The Associated Press on Tuesday.",
      "The government ordered Airbnb to remove almost 66,000 holiday rentals from the platform which it said had violated local rules by failing to list license numbers, listing the wrong license number or not specifying the apartment's owner. Airbnb is appealing the move.",
      "Spain is one of the world\u2019s most visited countries. Last year, the Southern European nation of 49 million received a record 94 million international visitors.",
      "But a housing affordability problem that is particularly acute in cities such as Madrid and Barcelona has led to growing antagonism against short-term holiday rentals. Airbnb is perhaps the best-known and most visible actor.",
      "The Spanish government says the two are related: the rise of Airbnb and other short-term rental companies, and rising rents and housing costs.",
      "\u201cObviously there is a correlation between these two facts,\u201d Consumer Rights Minister Pablo Bustinduy told the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s not a linear relation, it\u2019s not the only factor affecting it, there are many others, but it is obviously one of the elements that is contributing.\u201d",
      "A recent Bank of Spain report said the country has a shortfall of 450,000 homes. In the tourist hot spots of the Canary and Balearic Islands, half the housing stock is tourist accommodations or properties owned by nonresidents, the report said.",
      "\u201cTourism is for sure a vital part of the Spanish economy. It\u2019s a strategic and very important sector. But as in every other economic activity, it must be conducted in a sustainable way,\" Bustinduy said. \u201cIt cannot jeopardize the constitutional rights of the Spanish people. Their right to housing, but also their right to well-being.\u201d",
      "The country has seen several large protests that have drawn tens of thousands of people to demand more government action on housing. Homemade signs including one that read \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods\u201d at a recent march in Madrid point to the growing anger.",
      "\u201cA balance must be found between the constitutional rights of the Spanish people and economic activities in general,\" Bustinduy said.",
      "Regional governments in Spain are also tackling the issue. Last year, Barcelona announced a plan to close down all of the 10,000 apartments licensed in the city as short-term rentals by 2028 to safeguard the housing supply for full-time residents.",
      "Airbnb said that while its appeal goes through the courts, no holiday rentals would be immediately taken down from the site.",
      "In response to Spain's order, Airbnb has said the platform connects property owners with renters but it doesn't have oversight obligations, even though it requires hosts to show that they are compliant with local laws.",
      "Bustinduy said Spain's recent action reflects a desire in Spain, but also elsewhere, to hold tech companies like Airbnb to account.",
      "\u201cThere is a battle going on about accountability and about responsibility,\u201d Bustinduy said. \u201cThe digital nature of these extraordinarily powerful multinational corporations must not be an excuse to fail to comply with democratically established regulations.\u201d",
      "Bustinduy, who belongs to the governing coalition's left-wing Sumar party, dismissed the idea that the Spanish government's action toward Airbnb could discourage some tourists from visiting.",
      "\u201cIt will encourage longer stays, it will encourage responsible tourism and it will preserve everything that we have in this wonderful country which is the reason why so many people want to come here,\" he said.",
      "The minister also took a shot at low-cost airlines. Spain has pushed against allowing such airlines to charge passengers for hand baggage. Last year, it fined five budget airlines, including RyanAir and easyJet, a total of $179 million for charging for hand luggage.",
      "\u201cThe principle behind these actions is always the same: preserving consumer rights,\u201d Bustinduy said. \u201cPowerful corporations, no matter how large, have to adapt their business models to existing regulations.\u201d",

      "Inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro fell to 1.9% in May from 2.2% in April, helping clear the way for more interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- Inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro fell to 1.9% in May from 2.2% in April, clearing the way for more rate cuts from the European Central Bank to support growth in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff offensive.",
      "Lower energy prices helped bring consumer prices in May to below the ECB's 2% target for the first time since September. Increasing signs that inflation is back under control after a painful outbreak in 2021-23 leaves room for the ECB to turn its attention to worries about the impact of a slew of new import taxes on EU goods in the US that threaten to slow Europe's export-oriented economy.",
      "Reductions in the ECB's benchmark rate, currently at 2.25%, lower borrowing costs throughout the economy, making it easier to buy things on credit and stimulating economic activity and investment. Higher rates combat inflation, but for the moment that battle appears to have been won.",
      "The ECB's rate-setting council meets on Thursday under bank President Christine Lagarde to determine the next step on rates. Analysts expect a cut of a quarter percentage point and for Lagarde to indicate that at least one more cut is possible at future meetings.",
      "Trump has raised tariffs on steel, aluminum and autos from almost all trading partners to 25%, and has now said he will raise the rate to 50% on steel, as well as proposing a 20% tariff on all European Union goods. That last tariff has been paused ahead of a July 14 deadline pending negotiations with EU officials. Worries about the impact of tariffs on growth led the European Union's executive commission to cut its growth forecast for the 20 euro member countries this year to 0.9% from 1.3% in its fall 2024 forecast.",

      "British utility Thames Water says a U.S. investment firm has dropped a rescue bid for the debt-burdened company",
      "LONDON -- British water and sewage utility Thames Water said Tuesday that a U.S. investment firm has dropped a rescue bid for the debt-burdened company.",
      "Thames Water said private equity company KKR decided not to make a bid and its status as preferred bidder had lapsed. The utility said it is talking to \u201csenior creditors\u201d about an alternative money-raising plan.",
      "\u201cWhilst today\u2019s news is disappointing, we continue to believe that a sustainable recapitalization of the company is in the best interests of all stakeholders and continue to work with our creditors and stakeholders to achieve that goal,\u201d Thames Water chairman Arian Montague said.",
      "The cash-strapped company, which provides water and sewage services to 16 million people in and around London, has teetered on the edge of insolvency under about 19 billion pounds ($26 billion) in debt. The utility received court approval in March for 3 billion pounds in emergency funding to keep it from falling into government administration.",
      "KKR\u2019s withdrawal makes it more likely the British government will have to nationalize the company, at least temporarily.",
      "Environment Secretary Steve Reed said the government was \u201cmonitoring the situation,\u201d but \u201cThames (Water) itself remains stable.\u201d",
      "Thames Water is the focus of nationwide anger over sewage spills that have fouled lakes, rivers and beaches at a time when water and sewage companies are hiking bills to modernize aging systems and cope with the demands of climate change and population growth.",
      "Last week the company was fined almost 123 million pounds ($166 million) for releasing sewage into rivers and streams while paying dividends to its shareholders.",
      "Consumers and politicians have criticized the company, arguing Thames Water created its own problems by paying overly generous dividends to investors and high salaries to executives while failing to invest in pipelines, pumps and reservoirs.",
      "Company executives say the fault lies with regulators, which kept bills too low for too long, starving the company of vital cash to fund improvements.",

      "The iconic Goodyear airships are taking a victory lap over the skies of an Ohio city this week.",
      "The Akron-based tire company is celebrating the 100th anniversary of \u201cPilgrim,\u201d its first blimp to take flight just outside of the city on June 3, 1925.",
      "Goodyear began experimenting with vessels that would be lighter than aircraft in the early 1900s, and the dirigibles have since become a lasting and iconic symbol of the corporate brand. For some, it evokes nostalgia, while for others it offers a glimpse into a larger-than-life part of advertisement history.",
      "Here is a by-the-numbers look at Goodyear airships over time:",
      "Goodyear establishes an Aeronautics Department to build lighter-than-air aircrafts, and by 1912 the company had built its first balloon.",
      "In 1930, the \u201cDefender\u201d blimp became the first airship in the world to carry a lit neon sign so the company\u2019s name could be seen after dark.",
      "Goodyear began making airships for the U.S. Navy in 1917, and its first blimp \u2014 the first commercial non-rigid airship flown using helium \u2014 launched years later, becoming a marketing tool.",
      "From 1942 to 1944, the company built more than 150 airships for the Navy to serve in World War II, flying patrol over warships on the seas with zero reported loss of ships when a blimp was on watch.",
      "The Goodyear Blimp has been a regular at major sporting events since flying above the 1955 Rose Bowl. A few years later, it became a service vehicle for television coverage while simultaneously functioning as a highly visible advertising platform.",
      "Since that time, blimps have undergone wholesale changes and improved dramatically: steering technology; safety innovations; high-definition cameras; aerial views captured with specialized systems that compensate for movement during filming, resulting in stable and smooth footage footage; and much quieter rides thanks to relocated engines and propellers.",
      "There currently are four Goodyear Blimps \u2014 the three in the U.S. and one in Friedrichshafen, Germany.",
      "Today\u2019s Goodyear Blimps are semi-rigid dirigibles, meaning they have an internal frame as compared to previous eras of blimps that could be fully deflated. In 2014, Goodyear transitioned to the New Technology semi-rigid airship platform designed to allow for improved maneuverability and speed.",
      "The Goodyear Blimp is 246 feet long (75 meters), which would cover about 80% of a football field. It is 58 feet (18 meters) high and holds three Olympic-sized swimming pools' worth of helium.",
      "Goodyear gets helium for its blimps from multiple sources. Because helium is a finite resource, the company purifies its helium every six to eight weeks to extend its life.",
      "The blimp travels more than 100 days per year, with trips ranging anywhere from three days to three weeks. A crew of nearly 20 people travel with the airship whenever it is touring. Today\u2019s Goodyear Blimps fly between 1,000 and 1,500 feet (305 meters and 457 meters) in the air and travel at speeds up to 73 miles per hour (117 kilometers per hour).",
      "There currently are fewer blimp pilots in the world than astronauts, according to Goodyear, which has 10 full-time pilots. To serve in that job, you must have a commercial pilot license followed by approximately 250 hours of training to earn an additional lighter-than-air airship rating from the Federal Aviation Administration.",
      "The blimp has covered more than 2,500 events and taken more than 500,000 passengers for rides, according to Goodyear. Former President Ronald Reagan might be the most famous passenger, but it was rapper Ice Cube who raised the blimp\u2019s street cred when he included a line about it in his 1992 song titled \u201cIt Was A Good Day.\u201d",

      "Gabrielle Cuccia calls herself a \u201cMAGA girl\u201d who made no secret of her support for President Donald Trump, even as she got a job covering the Pentagon for the One America News Network",
      "Assigned to cover the Pentagon for the conservative outlet One America News Network, Gabrielle Cuccia didn't pretend to be an unbiased reporter. She describes herself as \u201ca MAGA girl\u201d who is unapologetically defiant in her support of President Donald Trump.",
      "Yet days after publicly criticizing a Trump appointee, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Cuccia found herself out of a job.",
      "In taking to Substack last week to express a personal opinion about a figure she covers, Cuccia did something that would be frowned upon in many legacy newsrooms. The message that she was sent, however, is most likely to resound in places where opinion is fine \u2014 but only a certain variety.",
      "Cuccia's lengthy Substack post, \u201cThe Secretary of Defense-ive,\u201d was posted three days after Hegseth issued new rules that banned reporters from accessing large areas of the Pentagon without being watched by his minders.",
      "She criticized him for limiting freedom of movement in the name of national security.",
      "\u201cThe Pentagon wants to paint a picture that journalists are freely roaming classified spaces, sneaking into (secure areas), and leaking top-secret information,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd that is simply not true. There are security cameras everywhere, protocols in place and quite frankly, it would be painfully obvious if a reporter was in a space they didn't belong.\u201d",
      "Cuccia said the real leaks from the Pentagon have come from Hegseth's own team and other senior officials. Hegseth, a former Fox News personality, was embarrassed in March when The Atlantic magazine's editor-in-chief was mistakenly included in a Signal chat in which the defense secretary discussed upcoming military strikes.",
      "She criticized Hegseth for not yet holding a media briefing at the Pentagon.",
      "\u201cThe Commander-in-Chief welcomes the hard questions ... and yes, even the dumb ones,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhy won't the Secretary of Defense do the same?\u201d",
      "Three days after her Memorial Day Substack post, Cuccia said her Pentagon access badge was revoked. \u201cBy Friday,\" she said, \u201cI was out of a job.\u201d",
      "The Defense Department did not pull Cuccia's credentials, according to a Defense official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel issues. Cuccia said OAN told her the Substack piece had been \u201cput on their radar,\u201d but she wouldn't say by who. She wouldn't speak further about what her employer told her, and OAN president Charles Herring told The Associated Press that it does not discuss personnel issues.",
      "\u201cWhen a reporter asks inconvenient questions about government overreach, the response should be accountability \u2014 not silence, and certainly not separation,\u201d Cuccia said.",
      "Traditionally, the legacy media does not want its journalists expressing opinions about people they cover, since it calls into doubt their ability to report without bias. But exceptions are often made in cases where media access is at issue, said Tom Rosenstiel, a journalism professor at the University of Maryland.",
      "The New York Times, for example, institutionally called upon Joe Biden to meet more often with journalists when he was president. The Pentagon Press Association said Hegseth\u2019s restrictions were a direct assault on the freedom of the press.",
      "One America News Network makes no secret of its allegiance to Trump. When Matt Gaetz's nomination as Trump's attorney general fell apart following the election, OAN quickly signed him up as a contributor. OAN faced lawsuits \u2014 and negotiated settlements \u2014 for its promotion of Trump's false theories that he did not lose the 2020 election.",
      "When Hegseth earlier this year evicted several news organizations from their Pentagon workspaces and gave more room to friendly outlets, Cuccia was assigned space formerly held by NBC News. Before Hegseth aide Sean Parnell's only media briefing, Cuccia said Hegseth's team reached out to her in advance to find out what questions she wanted to ask, something that would never be done for most media outlets.",
      "If OAN is responsible for removing Cuccia, it's a \u201ctake no quarter position,\u201d Rosenstiel said. \u201cThere is no room, if you're on the team, to say anything that is negative.\u201d",
      "He said he'd be interested to see if any representatives from pro-Trump media outlets defend her. \u201cAre they silent, or do they rally to her in any way?\u201d he asked. Trump, in the past, has frequently criticized Fox News Channel for saying anything on the air that he deemed negative.",
      "Part of Cuccia's Substack post sounded almost prescient about what might happen to her, when she reminisced about the energy of the early Make America Great Again movement. Questioning government then, she noted, was a point of pride.",
      "\u201cSomewhere along the way, we as a collective decided \u2014 if anyone ever questioned a policy or person within the MAGA movement \u2014 that they weren't MAGA enough,\" she wrote. \"That they were deep state, that they couldn't be trusted, that they didn't love America as much as we do and that ... to put it bluntly, they sucked.\u201d",

      "Tom Thibodeau\u2019s firing brought back some of the confusion and chaos the New York Knicks had seemingly left behind",
      "NEW YORK -- Tom Thibodeau's firing brought back some of the confusion and chaos the New York Knicks had seemingly left behind.",
      "After an era of stability and more success than they had enjoyed in a quarter of a century, the Knicks opened a coaching search few could have predicted when they fired Thibodeau on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWhen I first saw it, I thought it was one of those fake AI things. No way. There\u2019s no way possible,\u201d Indiana Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said.",
      "Coaching searches weren't unusual in New York for much of the 2000s, but the Knicks weren't winning then. This time, they had just reached the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 25 years before losing to Carlisle's team, and were an early favorite to do it again next year. So changing course brought swift and strong reaction from a fan base that seemed satisfied.",
      "Who decided Thibodeau had to go? And why?",
      "\u201cThat seemed like an unfortunate call that the boss made, certainly for him,\u201d tennis Hall of Famer John McEnroe, a Knicks fan, said while calling the French Open quarterfinals for TNT.",
      "But which boss?",
      "Direct answers may not come. Knicks leadership, from owner James Dolan to team president Leon Rose, doesn't do interviews with the reporters who cover the team. So the only hint may have come in the team's statement announcing the firing, in which Rose said the organization was \u201csingularly focused on winning a championship for our fans.\u201d",
      "That means the view was that Thibodeau was good enough to get the Knicks close but not all the way.",
      "Rose was friends with Thibodeau long before hiring him in 2020 and giving him a three-year contract extension last summer. So immediate speculation was that Dolan, who at times has been viewed as meddlesome and unpopular with his team's fans, must have ordered the ouster. But a person with knowledge of the decision, speaking to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because details were to remain private, said Rose made the call with Dolan's approval.",
      "Rose conducted a thorough search five years ago, even though Thibodeau had been viewed as a favorite because of his relationship both to Rose and the organization as an assistant to Jeff Van Gundy in the late 1990s and early 2000s.",
      "Van Gundy has returned to coaching as an assistant with the Clippers, if the Knicks wanted to gauge interest in a reunion. Michael Malone, who led Denver to the 2023 NBA title, is another former Knicks assistant who is available, as is Johnnie Bryant, who was beaten out Wednesday by Jordan Ott for Phoenix's head coaching position.",
      "Rick Pitino, Dan Hurley and John Calipari are all big names with ties to the New York area if Rose wanted to go the college route, and the retired Jay Wright coached current Knicks players Jalen Brunson, Josh Hart and Mikal Bridges on national championship teams at Villanova. Brunson's father, Rick, was an assistant on Thibodeau's staff, if Rose wanted to promote the team captain's father.",
      "The Knicks had 12 different coaches between the time Van Gundy resigned early in the 2001-02 season and Thibodeau's hiring, and they won just one playoff series. Thibodeau won four in the last three seasons.",
      "McEnroe thought that earned Thibodeau another year, a common reaction to his firing. The Knicks decided otherwise, sending Rose into a search with much higher consequences than last time.",
      "Back then, on the heels of seven straight losing seasons, he just needed a coach who could win some games. Now he needs one who can deliver a championship.",
      "\u201cI mean, I\u2019m not really in that situation, but the thing I can say is Thibs did a lot for New York,\" said Thunder center Isaiah Hartenstein, who played in New York last season. \u201cHe did a lot just building that culture over there. So I think I have a lot of respect for him.\u201d",

Speaking to Fox Sports 1 earlier Wednesday, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver \u2014 who has talked about such a game on multiple occasions \u2014 was asked if U.S. vs. the world is possible.",
      "\u201cYes,\u201d Silver said.",
      "Silver addressed the idea on March 27 as well at the league's most recent board of governors meeting, when he revealed that the NBA was scrapping the All-Star mini-tournament format that was used this season.",
      "At that time, the AP reported that the 2026 game \u2014 to be played Feb. 15 in Inglewood, California, just past the midpoint of the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics \u2014 will be moved from its traditional prime-time Sunday night slot to one that starts on Sunday afternoon. That's happening because the game will be aired on NBC under the terms of the new 11-year media rights deals that kick in next season. NBC is also the Olympic broadcaster in the U.S.",

      "The move comes on the heels of a popular tournament, the 4 Nations Face-off, that essentially took the place of the NHL All-Star Game this year, as well as strong competition at the Paris Olympics, where the Americans won a fifth consecutive gold medal by rallying past Nikola Jokic and Serbia in the semifinals, then topping host France and Victor Wembanyama in the title game \u2014 behind a barrage of late 3-pointers from Stephen Curry.",
      "\u201cWhat better time to feature some form of USA against the world?\u201d Silver said on FS1. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure what the format will be yet. I obviously paid a lot of attention to what the NHL did, which was a huge success. ... But also, going back, last summer, our Olympic competition was a huge success.\u201d",
      "There is one big challenge regarding any U.S.-vs.-world format. About 70% of NBA players are American, while 30% are international, so it would in theory be easier for an international player to make the All-Star team \u2014 if the rosters are the same size.",
      "International players, when asked at this year's All-Star Game if they would want a U.S.-vs.-world matchup, sounded enthusiastic.",
      "\u201cI would love to. My opinion is that it\u2019s more purposeful,\u201d Wembanyama said back in February. \u201cThere\u2019s more pride in it. More stakes.\u201d",
      "Added Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo, who's from Greece: \u201cI would love that. Oh, I would love that. I think that would be the most interesting and most exciting format. I would love that. For sure, I\u2019d take pride in that. I always compete, but I think that will give me a little bit more extra juice to compete.\u201d",
      "The latest format for the All-Star Game \u2014 a four-team, three-game mini-tournament in San Francisco with the first team to 40 points winning each \u2014 was a miss. It came after years of the league asking players for a more competitive game.",
      "The 211-186 final score at Indianapolis in 2024 was the last straw, and the league \u2014 for one year, anyway \u2014 thought the tournament was the answer.",

      "In these NBA Finals, a team is four wins away from getting the last laugh",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- In these NBA Finals, a team is four wins away from getting the last laugh.",
      "Ask anyone on the Oklahoma City Thunder and Indiana Pacers if they're still fueled by doubters, and the answer is probably going to be an immediate \u201cyes.\u201d Thunder star and NBA MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander went 11th in his draft. Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton went 12th in his. Both sides have undrafted players in their rotation.",
      "Here they are: The NBA Finals, which start Thursday night in Oklahoma City. The Thunder have, by far, the NBA's best record this season. The Pacers have the league's second-best record since Jan. 1, including playoffs. And both teams have rolled through the postseason, going 12-4 in the first three rounds.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll continue to tell you guys in certain moments that it doesn\u2019t matter what people say, but it matters \u2014 and I enjoy it,\" Haliburton said. \"I think the greats try to find external motivation as much as they can and that\u2019s something that\u2019s always worked for me.\u201d",
      "It's not like more motivation is needed. Not for the next couple of weeks, anyway. Indiana is chasing its first NBA title. Oklahoma City \u2014 technically \u2014 is also seeking its first; the franchise won a championship when it played in Seattle in 1979. These are teams that combined to win 49 games just three seasons ago, and now they're the last two standing.",
      "\u201cStaying true to who we are is the reason why we\u2019re here,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \u201cWe\u2019d be doing ourselves a disservice if we changed or tried to be something we're not once we got here. We\u2019ve had success doing so. If we want to keep having success, we have to be who we are. It\u2019s organic. It\u2019s nothing we have to think about or force. It\u2019s just who we are, no matter the moment.\u201d",
      "The Thunder are enormous favorites in the series, according to BetMGM Sportsbook, and understandably so. They're 80-18 including the regular season and postseason, plus went 29-1 in the regular season against the Eastern Conference and have more double-digit wins \u2014 61 and counting \u2014 than any team in any season in NBA history.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of work cut out for us,\u201d Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cA lot of our guys have been through a lot of situations where they\u2019ve been underdogs in the past. It\u2019s simply going to come down to us being able to play our game at the best possible level. We\u2019re going to need to take care of the ball because these guys turn people over at an historic rate, and we\u2019re going to have to make some shots.\u201d",
      "The Thunder want no part of hearing this series will be easy. The way Indiana \u2014 a No. 4 seed in the East \u2014 got through Giannis Antetokounmpo and Milwaukee in Round 1, a top-seeded Cleveland team in Round 2 and New York in Round 3 and never faced an elimination game has captured Oklahoma City's full attention.",
      "\u201cTheir attack is very simple. The theoretical way to stop it is simple,\u201d Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. \u201cIn reality it\u2019s very difficult to do, as you can see from the way that they\u2019ve really had their way with everybody. ... They pump a 99 mph fastball at you. You can prepare all you want for that. When you\u2019re in the batter\u2019s box, it\u2019s different when it\u2019s time to hit it.\u201d",
      "The Thunder are the youngest team to make the NBA Finals in 48 years, according to data provided by the league. With an average age of about 25 years and seven months, they're the youngest finalist since Portland in 1977.",
      "That said, hearing about it is getting, well, old.",
      "\u201cYoung or not, when you can learn from whatever situation you\u2019re thrown in, that makes you better,\u201d Thunder guard Jalen Williams said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why we\u2019re here in this moment.\u201d",
      "There will be a Game 1 in Oklahoma City on Thursday night \u2014 and a Game 2 on Thursday night as well.",
      "At Paycom Center, there's Game 1 of the NBA Finals. And Devon Park, about a 15-minute drive away from the Thunder home floor, will play host to Game 2 of the Women's College World Series between Texas and Texas Tech that same night.",
      "If the softball facility \u2014 which will be the site of games at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics \u2014 is filled, that means about 32,000 people will be watching championship games in Oklahoma City on Thursday.",
      "There are four players on these teams with previous NBA Finals experience.",
      "Indiana\u2019s Pascal Siakam averaged 19.8 points in six games with Toronto, helping the Raptors win the title in 2019. Oklahoma City\u2019s Alex Caruso averaged 6.3 points in six games with the Los Angeles Lakers, helping them past Miami in the bubble finals of 2020.",
      "Indiana\u2019s Thomas Bryant got in one game of Denver\u2019s 2023 finals win over Miami, and the Pacers\u2019 Aaron Nesmith played for Boston in the Celtics\u2019 loss to Golden State in the 2022 finals.",

      "Sanders had the best throw of the day during organized team activities when he zipped a pinpoint pass to tight end Caden Davis in the back of the end zone during a 7-on-7 red zone drill. Whether or not Davis got both feet in before going out of bounds was up for debate on social media.",
      "However, Sanders was the only one of Cleveland's four quarterbacks not to take a snap with the first-team offense during 11-on-11 drills. He did take second-team snaps, but slipped and fell on the first play.",
      "Offensive coordinator Tommy Rees lauded Sanders for his work ethic on what some still see as a steep learning curve for the fifth-round pick.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s really put in a lot of work as all those guys are, but you could tell on the mental side of the game and learning the system and calling it and having that rhythm to it, he\u2019s put a lot of work and time and effort into that. And then when you do that, the game starts to slow down and you can focus on finding completions. And he\u2019s done a nice job of that as camp\u2019s progressed,\u201d Rees said.",
      "With three young quarterbacks in camp \u2014 third-round pick Dillon Gabriel, Sanders and fourth-year pro Kenny Pickett \u2014 Rees said a large amount of the offense has been installed while keeping a close eye on the growth and progression of all three.",
      "\u201cDefinitely pushing them and pushing where we want them to go, but also being cognizant of, hey, we want them to go out there with confidence and making sure that it\u2019s beneficial to how they\u2019re learning and the way they\u2019re going,\u201d Rees said.",
      "Joe Flacco and Pickett remain the front-runners to be under center on Sept. 7 when the Browns open against the Cincinnati Bengals. The amount of snaps all four will get during the first two weeks of training camp remain fluid.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to find ways to be creative and make sure they all have opportunities to develop and put their best foot forward. And when the time comes, we will continue to push guys forward as they earn it,\u201d Rees said.",
      "The amount of snaps all four will receive during the three days of next week's mandatory minicamp also have to be determined.",
      "When it comes to who may win the starting job, Rees can see valid arguments for any of the four at this stage of the competition.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re so early in the process and in evaluating it. I think we have a good group of guys that will continue to push one another and by the time September rolls around, we\u2019ll be ready to go,\u201d he said.",

      "EDMONTON, Alberta -- Zach Hyman said Wednesday his right wrist got dislocated late last round, an injury that is sidelining one of the Edmonton Oilers' most valuable forwards for the Stanley Cup Final against the Florida Panthers.",
      "Hyman sported a brace on his right arm after undergoing surgery last week to repair the damage caused by a hit from Dallas' Mason Marchment in Game 4 of the Western Conference final.",
      "\u201cI knew it wasn\u2019t good when I got hit,\u201d Hyman said. \u201cRight away, I just felt my wrist kind of go on me. ... Quickly realized when I saw the doctors it\u2019s something that needed surgery and something that I wasn\u2019t going to be able to play through.\u201d",
      "Hyman memorably said after the Oilers' Game 7 loss to Florida last year that he believed they would be back in the final. In a cruel twist of fate, his teammates are, but the 33-year-old winger is not able to play in the series.",
      "Win it for Hyman has quickly becoming a rallying cry for Edmonton.",
      "\u201cMissing him is big; he\u2019s a huge piece of this team,\u201d veteran Adam Henrique said.\" His physicality, net-front presence, in the locker room \u2014 all those sorts of things. Just a great person, so we\u2019re certainly going to miss him on the ice but he\u2019ll be there and we\u2019ll certainly fight for him.\"",
      "Oilers players video-called Hyman after beating the Stars without him in Game 5 of the West final to move on to compete for the Stanley Cup again. He said that meant the world to him.",
      "\u201cIt caught me off guard,\u201d Hyman said. \u201cI was crying. It was really emotional. You just feel so much a part of the team and for them to do that in that moment meant a lot.\u201d",
      "Hyman is expected to be around the team throughout the final, flying to Florida and providing whatever insight and moral support he can without lacing up his skates. He called it \u201cacting like I\u2019m playing but obviously not.\u201d",
      "\u201cSome things in life you can\u2019t control,\u201d Hyman said, \u201cand this is one of them.\u201d",
      "The Panthers are mostly healthy, but they ruled out A.J. Greer for Game 1 of the Cup final with an undisclosed injury. Jesper Boqvist takes his place in the lineup.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important that, fortunately for us, it\u2019s not his first time in the playoffs, so he hasn\u2019t been sitting for a long time and he\u2019s had some pretty good success when he\u2019s come in,\u201d coach Paul Maurice said of Greer. \u201cAnd he fits. He\u2019s spent time with all of those players. There\u2019s nothing new for him, so he can come in and just play.\u201d",
      "Edmonton is getting a key player back with Connor Brown expected to be back after missing two games because of injury. Coach Kris Knoblauch called the strong two-way winger a game-time decision, while Brown declared himself good to go and all signs pointed to nothing standing in the way of a return.",

      "Jeff Skinner, who played more than 1,000 regular-season NHL games in his career before making his Stanley Cup Playoff debut in the series opener in the first round and then got scratched until replacing Hyman against Dallas, appears to be out to make room for Brown.",

The seventh of the eight coaching vacancies filled this offseason \u2014 Muse's hiring leaves the Boston Bruins as the only club still searching \u2014 is walking into a job that will require patience, prodding and maybe a bit of politicking to thrive.",
      "Dubas said the team met with \u201cmany candidates\u201d before deciding on Muse, who has spent the last half-decade as an assistant at the NHL level. Muse also has a track record as a cultivator of talent and served as the head coach of USA Hockey\u2019s National Team Development Program from 2020-23.",
      "\u201cWhat separated Dan was his ability to develop players, win at all levels where he has been a head coach and his consistent success coaching special teams in the NHL,\u201d Dubas said. \u201cFrom his success in developing college and junior players, to his impactful work with veteran players during his time in the NHL, Dan has shown a proven ability to connect with players at all stages of their careers and help them to reach their potential.\u201d",
      "Muse has been part of coaching staffs that have won titles at multiple levels. He was an assistant at Yale when the Bulldogs claimed the NCAA championship in 2013. He served as the head coach for the Chicago Steel of the United States Hockey League \u2014 the top junior league in the U.S. \u2014 when the Steel captured the Clark Cup in 2017 and helped the U.S. under-18 and under-20 teams win world titles.",
      "When Muse reached the NHL in 2017 with Nashville, he oversaw a penalty-kill unit that was among the league\u2019s best. He produced similar results when he took over a similar role with the Rangers in 2023.",
      "\u201cHis overall body of work, attention to detail and vision for our group showed us that he is the best coach to take our team forward,\u201d Dubas said.",
      "The list of players Muse has worked with during his time at USA Hockey includes forward Rutger McGroarty, a 21-year-old now considered the top prospect in the Penguins' system.",
      "Muse's job will be to find a way to mesh McGroarty and the rest of what likely will be a substantial youth movement with a team that for now remains defined by franchise icons Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang.",
      "Crosby signed an extension last fall that could keep him in Pittsburgh for two more seasons. Letang is signed through 2028. Malkin, who turns 39 in August, is about to enter the final season of his contract, with retirement perhaps not far behind.",
      "Dubas has long known this day was coming and has spent a significant chunk of the last 16 months stockpiling draft picks. The Penguins have 30 selections over the next three drafts, including 18 over the first three rounds, though Dubas is likely to turn some of those selections into packages designed to acquire NHL-ready players.",
      "While Pittsburgh should have a little more room under the salary cap to fill out the roster, Dubas is focused on trying to build something sustainable for the long haul rather than a quick fix.",
      "Muse will inherit a team that has serious questions in net, where Tristan Jarry and Alex Nedeljkovic struggled last season, and is in urgent need of depth scoring to complement Crosby and linemates Bryan Rust and Rickard Rakell.",
      "The last time the Penguins hired a coach without NHL head coaching experience, Mike Johnston was fired just over two months into his second season. He was replaced by Sullivan, whose fiery persona \u2014 along with significant help from heady moves made by then-general manager Jim Rutherford \u2014 made Pittsburgh the first team in nearly 20 years to win consecutive Cups.",
      "Sullivan's mandate was clear: Wake the Penguins up. Muse's is, too: Help the franchise successfully navigate the bridge from one generation to the next.",

      "As much as Bryson DeChambeau loves to practice and compete, the U.S. Open champion also appreciates the limited LIV Golf schedule that gives him time to pursue other interests",
      "GAINESVILLE, Va. -- As much as Bryson DeChambeau loves to practice and compete, the U.S. Open champion also appreciates the limited LIV Golf schedule that gives him time to pursue other interests.",
      "DeChambeau arrived at Robert Trent Jones Golf Club for LIV Golf Virginia after a characteristically busy few days that included a round of golf with President Donald Trump and some short-game practice on the South Lawn of the White House.",
      "Now the big-hitting YouTube star turns his attention to the 54-hole LIV event that starts Friday at Robert Trent Jones Golf Club. He said the thick rough and fast greens at RTJ would help prepare him for Oakmont, where he will try next week to win his third U.S. Open after triumphs last year at Pinehurst No. 2 and in 2020 at Winged Foot.",
      "\u201cI think LIV afforded me the opportunity to spend more time thinking, strategizing, getting my body healthy, ready for majors in a pretty unique way,\u201d DeChambeau said Wednesday. \u201cFor me, it was a great thing. I thought there was an opportunity to do other things in life, and look, do I want to win every single tournament I show up to? 100%.\u201d",
      "The RTJ event is the eighth of 14 tournaments this year for the globetrotting, Saudi-funded LIV Golf League. Although PGA Tour players have more freedom to set their own schedules, they typically play more often. For top-ranked Scottie Scheffler, the U.S. Open will be the fourth of five events in a seven-week stretch.",
      "DeChambeau hasn't competed since last month's PGA Championship, won by Scheffler. While DeChambeau was enjoying a friendly round with Trump and posting a YouTube short in which he hit golf balls from the top of a mountain and the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, Scheffler was finishing off his third win of the past month at the Memorial.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been doing some fun side quests, yes, there\u2019s no doubt,\u201d DeChambeau said.",
      "When he does compete, nobody practices harder than DeChambeau. He hit 1,029 range balls \u2014 more than anyone else in the field \u2014 at the Masters, where he finished in a tie for fifth.",
      "The 31-year-old DeChambeau said he developed his practice habits as a teenager, when other junior golfers in California were beating him even though they didn't appear to try as hard.",
      "\u201cIt stemmed from me not being as good as others and then realizing I can only be as good as how hard I work,\u201d DeChambeau said. \u201cSo I just became obsessed with hitting crazy amounts of golf balls.\u201d",
      "Known for trying to optimize his swing and his equipment to produce a consistent ball flight \u2014 a long, high draw \u2014 DeChambeau also spends time practicing the unusual shots he needs to finish off tournaments.",
      "\u201cAs much as I am a robot, and try to swing it as straight as possible and just stable as possible, I still do have to hit cuts and draws and hit weird shots every once in a while,\u201d he said. \u201cGiving myself those opportunities in the bunker, in the bush, whatever, has only aided in my golf career.\u201d",
      "After he shocked the golf world four years ago by winning the PGA Championship at age 50, Phil Mickelson had a moment of honest self-assessment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very possible that this is the last tournament I ever win. Like if I\u2019m being realistic,\u201d Mickelson said on that triumphant Sunday at Kiawah Island.",
      "Mickelson hasn't won since, and while he wasn't eager to reflect Wednesday on a career that includes six major titles and just as many famous near-misses, he indicated his competitive future is limited.",
      "He said he wants to help his teammates on LIV's HyFlyers squad and would step away if he's no longer doing that.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m also going to be 55 in a couple weeks, so I want to be realistic there, too. I want this team to succeed. I don\u2019t want to hold it back,\u201d Mickelson said. \u201cIf I\u2019m holding it back, then it\u2019s time for me to move on and get somebody else in here.\u201d",
      "Mickelson also acknowledged the possibility that Oakmont will be his last U.S. Open. He has a record six runner-up finishes at the national championship, the only major he hasn't won.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a high likelihood that it will be,\u201d Mickelson said, \u201cbut I haven\u2019t really thought about it too much.\u201d",
      "The USGA gave Mickelson a special exemption to the 2021 U.S. Open at Torrey Pines, which he ultimately didn't need because he won at Kiawah a month earlier. Nonetheless, the U.S. Open historically does not grant more than one special exemption to any player, and Mickelson has missed the past three U.S. Open cuts. He remains exempt for the other three majors as a past champion.",

      "Van Ness, the 13th overall pick in the 2023 draft, said he wore a cast on his broken right thumb until about the 10th or 11th week of the 2024 season. Van Ness recorded three sacks last season, none after Thanksgiving.",

      "A year ago, Boisson tore the ACL in her left knee just a week before her home Grand Slam tournament started, preventing her from accepting an invitation to play. On Thursday, she will have the chance to advance to the final.",
      "\u201cIt's incredible, no matter what, given what happened last year and all the difficult moments I went through,\u201d Boisson said during her post-match interview.",
      "The 22-year-old Boisson was largely unknown outside tennis circles before capturing the spotlight in Paris. She is playing in her first Grand Slam main draw and became the first woman to reach the semifinals at her debut major tournament since 1989, when Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati both did it at the French Open.",
      "She is also the youngest French semifinalist at a Grand Slam event since Amelie Mauresmo at Wimbledon in 1999. The last Frenchwoman to win the title at Roland-Garros was Mary Pierce, 25 years ago.",
      "Under the closed roof of court Philippe-Chatrier, Andreeva repeatedly showed her frustration with the crowd, as excited fans chanted \u201cLo\u00efs, Lo\u00efs\u201d between points, waved Tricolor flags, shouted during play, and even applauded the Russian teenager\u2019s errors.",
      "The first set was marked by momentum swings and brilliant shot-making from both players. Boisson twice found herself down a break but fought back each time, using heavy spin and deep groundstrokes to trouble her Russian opponent.",
      "Andreeva grew visibly tense on key points, struggling to maintain her composure and wasting a chance to close out the set when up 5-3. Despite saving three set points and forcing a tiebreaker, she ultimately handed the set to Boisson with two consecutive backhand errors.",
      "Andreeva responded strongly at the start of the second set, racing to a 3-0 lead. But Boisson broke back with a thunderous backhand winner down the line, drawing a roar of approval from the lively crowd.",
      "Andreeva received a warning after netting a routine forehand volley and angrily hitting a ball into the stands. She then argued with the umpire over a call that gave Boisson three break points. Andreeva saved the first one with a forehand winner then double-faulted, and never recovered.",
      "\u201cThe first set was super intense, and I was really struggling at the start of the second, but I managed to regroup and finish like that,\u201d said Boisson, who will make a big jump in the rankings.",
      "Having reached a career high of No. 152 last year before her knee injury, Boisson will climb at least to No. 68 on Monday. And that could be even higher if she manages to pull off a third straight shocker against the No. 2-seeded Coco Gauff in the semifinals.",
      "An unseeded player has reached the French Open final twice in the last four years: eventual champion Barbora Krejcikova in 2021, and Karolina Muchova in 2023.",

      "\u201cWe are very excited about Josele joining the team,\u201d Garcia said in a statement. \u201cPersonally, I have known him since he could pick up a golf club and he has worked with my father as his coach throughout his golf career.\u201d",
      "The 21-year-old Ballester recently concluded his senior season at Arizona State, the alma mater of LIV stars Jon Rahm and Phil Mickelson. He finished third in the PGA Tour University standings, earning him full status on the Korn Ferry Tour, but Golf Channel reported Monday that he declined membership on the PGA Tour's top developmental circuit.",
      "Although he missed the cut at the Masters in April, Ballester had a viral moment when he relieved himself in Rae's Creek on the par-5 13th hole.",
      "Ballester defeated Noah Kent 2 up in the 36-hole U.S. Amateur final at Hazeltine last August. Although he is turning professional, he keeps his spot in next week's U.S. Open at Oakmont as the reigning champion of the USGA's top amateur event.",
      "Ballester joins Abraham Ancer and David Puig alongside Garcia on the Fireballs. Luis Masaveu loses his full-time spot on the team, although he remains in the lineup this week because Puig has a back injury.",
      "Masaveu does not have status on any other tour and he would be banned from competing in PGA Tour events for a year after his final LIV appearance.",

      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Coco Gauff overcame 10 double-faults and the first set she\u2019s dropped in the tournament to beat Madison Keys 6-7 (6), 6-4, 6-1 at the French Open on Wednesday, reaching the semifinals for the third time.",
      "It was a contest filled with plenty of mistakes by both Americans, who each has claimed one major championship. They combined for 101 unforced errors and just 40 winners across more than two hours under a closed roof at Court Philippe-Chatrier on a drizzly, chilly day.",
      "The No. 2-seeded Gauff won the 2023 U.S. Open and was the runner-up at the 2022 French Open. She'll play Thursday for a berth in another Grand Slam final, facing either No. 6 Mirra Andreeva or 361st-ranked French wild-card entry Lo\u00efs Boisson.",
      "\u201cI have a lot more work left to do,\u201d said Gauff, who raised her arms overhead then spread them wide apart after the last point against Keys, \u201cbut I'm going to savor this one today.\u201d",
      "She started particularly poorly against Keys, trailing 4-1 and being a point from a 5-1 deficit. Gauff bowed her head or sighed after some miscues. Then, suddenly, she got going, using her speed and instincts to stretch points until Keys \u2014 the Australian Open champion in January \u2014 missed.",
      "That helped Gauff get within a point of taking that set. But the 21-year-old based in Florida double-faulted three times in the tiebreaker, and soon was headed to the locker room to regroup.",
      "That set was sloppy. Gauff had seven winners to 21 unforced errors. Keys has 12 winners to 28 unforced errors, 19 of which arrived from her powerful forehand.",
      "\u201cI knew that I just had to be able to run today and as soon as the ball came short,\u201d Gauff said, \u201cjust punish her for it.\u201d",
      "Repeatedly, Gauff scrambled this way or that to get her racket on a shot from Keys that against plenty of other players would end the point. And often enough, it worked well, leading to a miss by Keys, who occasionally admonished herself with a slap on her right leg.",
      "\u201cWith her ability to cover the court,\u201d Keys said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to have to win the point multiple times before it\u2019s actually over.\u201d",

      "China will be eliminated from soccer World Cup qualification if it fails to beat Indonesia on Thursday",
      "In April, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited a company that makes humanoid robots. There he floated an idea to fix the country's woeful men's soccer team.",
      "\u201cCan we have robots join the team?\u201d Xi was quoted as saying on the website of Zhiyuan Robotics.",
      "It might be too late. China will be out of World Cup qualifying if it fails to beat Indonesia on Thursday. Even a victory may only delay the departure.",
      "What's the problem? China has 1.4 billion people, the globe's second largest economy and won 40 Olympic gold medals last year in Paris to tie the United States. Why can't it find 11 elite men's soccer players?",
      "The government touches every aspect of life in China. That top-down control has helped China become the largest manufacturer of everything from electronics to shoes to steel.",
      "It has tried to run soccer, but that rigid governance hasn't worked.",
      "\u201cWhat soccer reflects is the social and political problems of China,\" Zhang Feng, a Chinese journalist and commentator, tells The Associated Press. \"It\u2019s not a free society. It doesn't have the team-level trust that allows players to pass the ball to each other without worrying.\u201d",
      "Zhang argues that politics has stalled soccer's growth. And there's added pressure since Xi's a big fan and has promised to resuscitate the game at home. Soccer is a world language with its \u201cown grammar,\u201d says Zhang, and China doesn't speak it.",
      "\u201cIn China, the more emphasis the leader places on soccer, the more nervous the society gets, the more power the bureaucrats get, and the more corrupt they become,\" Zhang adds.",
      "After China defeated Thailand 2-1 in 2023, Xi joked with Srettha Thavisin, the Thai prime minister at the time. \"I feel luck was a big part of it,\u201d Xi said.",
      "The consensus is clear. China has too few quality players at the grass roots, too much political interference from the Communist Party, and there's too much corruption in the local game.",
      "Wang Xiaolei, another prominent Chinese commentator, suggests that soccer clashes with China's top-down governance and the emphasis on rote learning.",
      "\u201cWhat are we best at? Dogma,\" Wang wrote in a blog last year. \u201cBut football cannot be dogmatic. What are we worst at? Inspiring ingenuity, and cultivating passion.\u201d",
      "The latest chapter in China's abysmal men's soccer history was a 7-0 loss last year to geopolitical rival Japan.",
      "\u201cThe fact that this defeat can happen and people aren\u2019t that surprised \u2014 despite the historical animosity \u2014 just illustrates the problems facing football in China,\" says Cameron Wilson, a Scot who has worked in China for 20 years and written extensively about the game there.",
      "China has qualified for only one men's World Cup. That was 2002 when it went scoreless and lost all three matches. Soccer's governing body FIFA places China at No. 94 in its rankings \u2014 behind war-torn Syria and ahead of No. 95 Benin.",
      "For perspective: Iceland is the smallest country to reach the World Cup. Its latest population estimate is almost 400,000.",
      "The website Soccerway tracks global football and doesn't show a single Chinese player in a top European league. The national team's best player is forward Wu Lei, who played for three seasons in Spain's La Liga for Espanyol. The club's majority owner in Chinese.",
      "The 2026 World Cup will have a field of 48 teams, a big increase on the 32 in 2022, yet China still might not make it.",
      "China will be eliminated from qualification if it loses to Indonesia. Even if it wins, China must also beat Bahrain on June 10 to have any hope of advancing to Asia's next qualifying stage.",
      "Englishman Rowan Simons has spent almost 40 years in China and gained fame doing television commentary in Chinese on English Premier League matches. He also wrote the 2008 book \u201cBamboo Goalposts.\u201d",
      "China is benefiting from reforms over the last decade that placed soccer in schools. But Simons argues that soccer culture grows from volunteers, civil society and club organizations, none of which can flourish in China since they are possible challengers to the rule of the Communist Party.",
      "\u201cIn China at the age of 12 or 13, when kids go to middle school, it\u2019s known as the cliff,\u201d he says. \"Parents may allow their kids to play sports when they\u2019re younger, but as soon as it comes to middle school the academic pressure is on \u2014 things like sport go by the wayside.\u201d",
      "To be fair, the Chinese women's team has done better than the men. China finished runner-up in the 1999 Women's World Cup but has faded as European teams have surged with built-in expertise from the men's game. Spain won the 2023 Women's World Cup. China was knocked out early, battered 6-1 by England in group play.",
      "China has been successful targeting Olympic sports, some of which are relatively obscure and rely on repetitive training more than creativity. Olympic team sports like soccer offer only one medal. So, like many countries, China focuses on sports with multiple medals. In China's case it's diving, table tennis and weightlifting.",
      "\u201cFor young people, there's a single value \u2014 testing well,\u201d says Zhang, the commentator and journalist. \"China would be OK if playing soccer were only about bouncing the ball 1,000 times.\"",
      "Li Tie, the national team coach for about two years beginning in January 2020, was last year sentenced to 20 years in prison for bribery and match fixing. Other top administrators have also been accused of corruption.",
      "The graft also extended to the domestic Super League. Clubs spent millions \u2014 maybe billions \u2014 on foreign talents backed by many state-owned businesses and, before the collapse of the housing boom, real-estate developers.",
      "The poster child was Guangzhou Evergrande. The eight-time Super League champions, once coached by Italian Marcello Lippi, was expelled from the league and disbanded earlier this year, unable to pay off its debts.",
      "Zhang says businessmen invested in professional soccer teams as a \u201cpolitical tribute\" and cited Hui Ka-yan. The embattled real estate developer financed the Guangzhou Evergrande Football Club and used soccer to win favor from politicians.",
      "Property giant Evergrande has amassed debts reported at $300 billion, reflective of China\u2019s battered property segment and the general health of the economy.",
      "\u201cChina\u2019s failure at the international level and corruption throughout the game, these are all factors that lead parents away from letting their kids get involved,\u201d says Simons, who founded a youth soccer club called China Club Football FC.",
      "\u201cParents look at what\u2019s going on and question if they want their kids to be involved. It\u2019s sad and frustrating.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Indiana Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder have two of the NBA\u2019s best offenses",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- The Indiana Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder have two of the NBA's best offenses.",
      "But this year's title hopes may swing on the other facet: Who has the better defense?",
      "While both teams made major improvements from last season's respective rosters in the conference finals and conference semifinals, Pacers coach Rick Carlisle, who led Dallas on its only title run in 2010-11 knows just how difficult the challenge can be, especially against Oklahoma City.",
      "\u201cTheir depth of great defenders is staggering,\u201d he said before listing names. \u201c Shai (Gilgeous-Alexander) is a great scorer, but he's also a great competitor. You've got Jalen Williams, you've got (Lu) Dort, you've got (Alex) Caruso, and a bunch of other guys. People talk about (Aaron) Wiggins, Cason Wallace and all these guys are great competitors. And then they've got the rim protection to go along with it.\u201d",
      "That combination helped the Thunder win a league-high 68 regular-season games while earning the top seed in the Western Conference for the second straight year.",
      "Apparently, it was just a warmup. During the franchise's first Finals run since 2012, the Thunder's scoring defense has been even stingier \u2014 allowing just 106.3 points per game compared with 107.6 over the first 82 games \u2014 while yielding fewer than 100 points in half of their 12 postseason wins.",
      "While Indiana has not matched those numbers, they eliminated three teams \u2014 New York, Cleveland and Milwaukee \u2014 that each averaged more than 115 points during the regular season. In 16 playoff games, they held those three teams below their averages 11 times.",
      "Naturally, Thunder coach Mark Daigneault has been taking notes.",
      "\u201cIf you look at this playoff run, you\u2019ll see how challenging they are for their opponents, and the way they defend contributes to their team identity. It\u2019s not just offense,\" he said. \u201cTheir defensive philosophy is very much aligned with their offensive philosophy, so it creates a certain air to the game when you play against them. It is difficult to play against, as you can see from the way that they\u2019ve really run through the Eastern Conference to get here.\u201d",
      "Their rosters were constructed in similar fashions, too.",
      "Both teams are young, rely on deep benches to wear down opponents late and feast on turnovers. The Thunder average a postseason best 21.3 points per game off turnovers while the Pacers are second at 18.5.",
      "But with so much focus on the high-scoring, up-tempo offenses, it's easy to overlook their defenses or worse \u2014 see it as a glaring weakness.",
      "A year ago, Indiana gave up 120.2 points per game in the regular season. This year that number dropped to 115.1, and in the postseason it's down to 113.3.",
      "What changed?",
      "Indiana's top three defenders \u2014 Aaron Nesmith, Andrew Nembhard and Myles Turner \u2014 are all relatively healthy now.",
      "Nesmith missed 2 1/2 months with a sprained left ankle before returning in January and working his way back into game shape. He sprained his right ankle in Game 3 of the conference finals against the New York Knicks but played in each of the final three games.",
      "Nembhard also missed nearly a month early this season with tendinitis in his left knee, and Turner, Indiana's rim protector, has overcome an assortment of nagging injuries.",
      "But Indiana also changed its forcus after getting swept by Boston in 2024.",
      "\u201cLast year, all that was being said was we couldn't win because we didn't guard anybody and all we do is try to outscore people,\u201d two-time All-Star Tyrese Haliburton said. \u201cWe've taken such a big step on the defensive end as a group, and I think the step we made on that end of the floor is why we're here. We've got our work cut out for us (in this series).\u201d",
      "Neither Carlisle nor Daigneault would disclose their defensive assignments entering Game 1 though there's a good chance Nembhard and Nesmith will somehow find themselves pitted against Gilgeous-Alexander, the league MVP, and Williams.",
      "On the flip side, Oklahoma City may deploy its two all-NBA defenders, Williams and Dort, against the combination of Haliburton and Nembhard.",
      "But regardless of the assignments, this is a matchup of wills most believe will determine the next NBA champion.",
      "\u201cAll tests are fun, and we get to do it on the biggest stage any of us have ever played on,\" Williams said. \"So it\u2019ll be a very fun challenge. Like I said, that\u2019s a really good team. Obviously, they\u2019re in the finals for a reason. Nobody just waltzes into the finals. So it\u2019ll be our ultimate test.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Duke's Cooper Flagg is the easy choice to be the No. 1 overall pick in The Associated Press' NBA mock draft",
      "There's little to no drama when it comes to predicting the No. 1 overall pick for this month's NBA draft. Cooper Flagg was earmarked for that spot before ever stepping foot on Duke's campus last fall.",
      "He did nothing to disappoint as a one-and-done college standout, guiding the Blue Devils to the Final Four while becoming only the fourth freshman to be named The Associated Press men's college basketball national player of the year.",
      "The other three? Texas' Kevin Durant in 2007, Kentucky's Anthony Davis in 2012 and Duke's Zion Williamson in 2019. Of that group, Davis and Williamson were No. 1 picks, while Durant was picked No. 2.",
      "Flagg, headlining the AP's NBA mock draft, will fit right in when the first round begins June 25.",
      "Fresh off trading away Luka Doncic, the Mavericks luck into a versatile 6-foot-8, 221-pound forward who can thrive as a scorer ( Atlantic Coast Conference freshman-record 42 points against Notre Dame) or playmaker (team-best 4.2 assists). His length and competitive edge can impact games defensively (team highs of 1.4 steals and 1.4 blocks). And he has an all-around game more advanced than his age with room to develop as he turns 19 in December.",
      "The son of former NBA guard Ron Harper offers size at the point (6-5, 213 pounds) and averaged 19.4 points, 4.6 rebounds and 4.0 assists as a freshman. He could join NBA rookie of the year Stephon Castle in the backcourt for star Victor Wembanyama. Still, there\u2019s an awkward question of how a team with Harper and fellow one-and-done prospect Ace Bailey went just 15-17.",
      "The only benefit to injury-riddled seasons for stars Joel Embiid and Paul George was landing a high pick for a team that still has designs on contending in the Eastern Conference. The 6-4, 193-pound Edgecombe, who turns 20 in July, could help with two-way potential, rim-attacking athleticism and 3-point shooting.",
      "The 6-8 forward is a versatile athlete capable of stretching defenses (five January games with at least four made 3s) and tools to develop defensively. He averaged 17.6 points and 7.2 rebounds, though for a losing team despite featuring Bailey and Harper as the NBA-bound headliners. The Hornets already have 2023 No. 2 overall pick Brandon Miller as a wing forward, so this would bet on talent over position need.",
      "It's a simple selling point for the league's worst team: the 6-5, 190-pound freshman can score. He averaged 19.9 points to lead the Southeastern Conference while shooting 39.7% on 3s. He broke Durant's freshman Longhorns record when he scored 39 points against Arkansas in February.",
      "The Wizards need help in multiple areas after winning 18 games, and the 6-5 guard has shown an all-around floor game. He averaged 15 points, 5.7 rebounds and 4.7 assists as a freshman, including one run of six straight 20-point games including against then-No. 1 Tennessee.",
      "The 6-3, 180-pound combo guard averaged 17.1 points, 4.1 rebounds and 4.1 assists in his lone college season. Highlights included a four-point play to beat a ranked Michigan team, along with scoring 57 points in two SEC Tournament games. But he'll need to improve his outside shot (28.4% on 3s) and add bulk.",
      "With four first-rounders, the Nets could start retooling with the 6-7, 217-pound Knueppel as an efficient scorer who was named ACC Tournament MVP. Knueppel shot 40.6% on 3-pointers and ranked sixth in Division I by shooting 91.4% at the foul line. The freshman also had 10 games with at least four assists to show potential as a secondary playmaker for a Final Four team.",
      "The 7-1, 253-pound South Sudanese big man projects as a rim-protecting lob threat. Maluach had the combine\u2019s biggest wingspan (7-6 3/4) and showed stretches of capably defending guards on switches in his lone college season. He shot 71.2% largely on dunks and putbacks, so he\u2019ll need time to refine a raw offensive game.",
      "The son of former NBA guard Jason Richardson would offer longer-term benefits for a team that finished second in the Western Conference. Richardson is small (6-1, 178) for a combo guard, and he mentioned after a recent workout with Portland that he's working to prove he can play the point. Shooting 41.2% on 3s is enticing regardless.",
      "The sophomore has a strong frame (6-7, 240) that could allow him to work some on the wing and bang inside with a nearly 7-1 wingspan. He contributed as a capable scorer (16.8), rebounder (8.3) and defender (1.3 blocks, 1.5 steals).",
      "The 6-9, 248-pounder earned a spot in March Madness lore by banking in a buzzer-beating runner to beat Colorado State and reach the NCAA Sweet 16. The nimble move illustrated the still-developing upside for a skilled freshman who nearly averaged a double-double (16.5 points, 9.0 rebounds).",
      "The 6-9, 224-pound freshman who helped the Bulldogs return to the NCAAs for the first time in a decade offers versatile upside, though the 19-year-old will need time to get stronger and improve his shooting (29.2% on 3s).",
      "The lanky 6-9, 194-pound forward from France has been honing versatile skills in Germany and turns 19 in December. He has the ability to run the court and attack off the dribble, averaging 12.4 points and 5.3 rebounds in Germany this season.",
      "The 6-7, 215-pound freshman reserve shot 37.1% on 3s and showed defensive potential by averaging a block per game despite playing just 19 minutes a night. He had one of the top max vertical leaps at the combine (39.5 inches).",
      "The 6-9, 263-pound freshman offers a strudy interior presence with a 7-6 wingspan, proving capable of operating in the post or in traffic while also flashing face-up skills. The 19-year-old could help himself by developing his 3-point shot (6 of 37, 16.2%).",
      "The 6-8, 232-pound Fleming increased his output in three college seasons and brings a sturdy frame to the NBA. He averaged 14.7 points, 8.5 rebounds and 1.5 blocks, and has improved his 3-pointing from 31.3% through his first two college seasons to 39% last year. He also had one of the combine's biggest wingspans at better than 7-5.",
      "A top international prospect from Russia, the 19-year-old Demin spent a season at BYU as a playmaker with size (6-9, 199). That could allow teams to run offense through him as a strong passer who had 15 assists against two turnovers in 54 minutes of work during his last two NCAA Tournament games for a Sweet 16 team.",
      "After grabbing Knueppel at eighth, the Nets could further bolster their perimeter with the 6-6, 201-pound lefty from Israel. Saraf has proven adept as a scoring playmaker, averaging 12.8 points and 4.6 assists this season in Germany.",
      "The 6-7, 215-pound McNeeley jumped right in as a freshman starter for the two-time reigning NCAA champion Huskies and projects as a floor-stretching wing, including with 22 points in the NCAAs against eventual champion Florida and a 38-point showing against then-No. 24 Creighton.",
      "The 6-11, 252-pound junior thrived in moving from the Ivy League (Yale) to the Big Ten as a low-post presence, averaging 13.2 points and 9.7 rebounds while ranking among Division I leaders with 15 double-doubles. He also showed the ability to step outside (38 made 3s in 37 games).",
      "The 6-5, 175-pound guard from France is a scoring playmaker and has been regarded as a possible lottery prospect. The 19-year-old had previously drawn recruiting interest from programs like Duke, Alabama and Gonzaga before opting to remain in his home country last year.",
      "The freshman from Canada worked as a top reserve averaging 12.6 points. The 19-year-old Riley has potential as a scorer and passer with size (6-8) as he refines his game and develops physically (186 pounds).",
      "The 6-5, 202-pound Clifford took his time developing as a five-year player, though the 23-year-old is coming off a huge year (18.9 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.4 assists). He also improved his outside shot, going from making 33.8% over three seasons at Colorado to 37.7% on higher volume in two years with the Rams.",
      "The 6-2, 199-pound combo guard was an AP first-team All-American and Final Four's most outstanding player in the Gators' national title run. That included monster tournament performances \u2014 notably the frantic comeback against Texas Tech in the Elite Eight and a career-best scoring effort against Auburn in the Final Four \u2014 that bode well for a gamer who repeatedly rose to the challenge.",
      "The 7-1, 253-pound center from China turns 20 the night of the draft's second round. He has intriguing size (9-3 standing reach, nearly 7-3 wingspan) to go with shooting touch and solid passing in a developing game.",
      "The 6-3, 202-pound senior was an every-game starter while missing just one game during the past three college seasons. His scoring and playmaking ability (19.2 points, 5.9 assists) made him a finalist for last year's Cousy Award presented to college's top point guard.",
      "The 6-5, 213-pound Coward has taken an interesting path. He started his career at Division III Willamette and spent two seasons at Eastern Washington, then played six games at Washington State due to injury and planned to transfer to Duke. But he stayed in the draft after testing well at the combine, including the best wingspan (7-2+) and standing reach (8-10) among guards, a 38.5-inch max vertical leap, and solid shooting-drill showings.",
      "Beringer, who turns 19 in November, projects as a mobile threat who can work in the pick-and-roll and as a lob threat. The French big man needs time to strengthen a lean 6-11, 230-pound frame.",
      "The 19-year-old with a 6-6, 205-pound frame has flashed shooting range and the ability to attack off the dribble. He earned MVP honors after helping the Under-18 Real Madrid team win last year's Euroleague Basketball Adidas Next Generation Tournament (ANGT) in Berlin.",

      "The Orioles tagged Kirby for two runs, one in the first inning on a sacrifice fly by Ram\u00f3n Ur\u00edas and another in the fifth inning on an RBI single by Ryan O\u2019Hearn. Baltimore added two more run in the ninth inning.",

      "Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu are charged with conspiracy, smuggling, making false statements and visa fraud for allegedly bringing the fungus Fusarium graminearum into the U.S. Jian, 33, was booked in a Detroit federal court. Liu, 34, is thought to be in China.",
      "According to the FBI, Liu had small baggies of the fungus stashed in his backpack when he flew to the U.S. last year and, after claiming ignorance about the plant material inside them, said he was planning to use it for research at a University of Michigan lab where Jian worked and where Liu previously worked.",

      "When the threat of wildfires has forced power to be cut in the tourist town of Calistoga, California, on the edge of Napa Valley, it\u2019s meant firing up a bank of noisy, polluting diesel generators",
      "CALISTOGA, Calif. -- For residents of this quaint tourist town on the northern edge of Napa Valley, the threat of wildfire is seldom out of mind. The hillside bears burn scars from a 2020 fire that forced all of Calistoga to evacuate, and the 2017 Tubbs fire that killed 22 people in wine country started just a few miles from downtown.",
      "When fire danger required shutting off transmission lines that might spark a blaze, the town relied on a bank of generators in a popular recreation area that belched choking diesel exhaust and rumbled so loudly it drove people away.",
      "But now Calistoga is shifting to a first-of-its-kind system that combines two clean-energy technologies \u2014 hydrogen fuel cells and batteries \u2014 for enough juice to power the city for about two days. Experts say the technology has potential beyond simply delivering clean backup power in emergencies; they say it's a steppingstone to supporting the electric grid any day of the year.",
      "As the system was undergoing its final tests in late May in an area that includes a dog park, ball fields, community garden and bike trail, residents said they were grateful to be guaranteed clean energy year-round. Lisa Gift, a resident who also serves on the city council, noted Calistoga is already grappling with climate change that is fueling more intense and frequent wildfires.",
      "\u201cContinuing to depend on fossil fuels was simply not sustainable,\u201d Gift said. \"That's what excited me about this. It\u2019s a clean and reliable energy solution that ensures the safety and resilience of our community.\u201d",
      "Energy Vault, an energy storage company based in California, built the new facility that was to come online in early June. Next year, it could be exporting power to the electric grid whenever needed once its application to fully connect is approved.",
      "The installation sits next to where Pacific Gas & Electric used to set up nine mobile generators every year from late spring through fall. Behind a chain-link fence stand six hydrogen fuel cells standing two stories tall made by Plug Power in New York. Water vapor wafted from one of the fuel cells being tested as The Associated Press got an exclusive tour of the site as it was in final testing.",
      "Shipping containers hold two pairs of Energy Vault's lithium-ion batteries. Nearby, a cinder block wall surrounds a massive, double-walled steel tank that holds 80,000 gallons (302,833 liters) of extremely cold liquid hydrogen that gets converted to gas to run the fuel cells.",
      "California utilities, especially PG&E, have had to pay large settlements over igniting wildfires. PG&E began cutting power at times to reduce fire risk in 2018, one of California's deadliest and most destructive wildfire years. It ships diesel generators to about a dozen towns to provide backup power during those periods.",
      "Calistoga, the largest with about 5,000 people, has had its power shut off 10 times. When generators ran, they spewed exhaust with harmful nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide and soot. PG&E considered replacing Calistoga's diesel generators with a natural gas version that would pollute less, but opted instead for Energy Vault's fully clean solution, said Dave Canny, the utility\u2019s vice president for the North Coast Region.",
      "Energy Vault CEO Robert Piconi said other communities, military bases and data centers could all use something similar, but potential customers wanted to see it function first.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a massive proof point with this project,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019ll have a lot of implications for how people think about alternative, sustainable solutions.\"",
      "The fuel cell maker, Plug Power, is planning for these types of products to be its main business in a decade. Energy Vault said it\u2019s buying clean hydrogen, produced with low or no greenhouse gas emissions, to run the fuel cells in Calistoga.",
      "\u201cThis solution is just beautiful,\" said Janice Lin, founder and president of the Green Hydrogen Coalition, a nonprofit that advocates for green hydrogen projects to combat climate change. \"No noise, no emissions. And it\u2019s renewable. It\u2019s dumping diesel.\u201d",
      "Calistoga caters to tourists with a main thoroughfare that emphasizes local shops, restaurants, tasting rooms and art galleries over franchise stories. Residents pride themselves on a smalltown vibe, and say Calistoga isn't posh like much of the rest of Napa Valley.",
      "Some of those residents were concerned at first about the hydrogen, which is flammable and can be explosive. Fire Chief Jed Matcham said the \u201cvery, very large tank\u201d got his attention, too.",
      "He collaborated with Energy Vault on emergency planning and training, and said he's comfortable with the safety measures in place. Energy Vault's batteries also come with alarms, detectors and piping to extinguish a fire.",
      "The next time PG&E turns off the power to the area to prevent wildfires, it will tell Energy Vault when it\u2019s safe to electrify Calistoga. The batteries will get things back up and running, discharging the energy stored inside them to the local microgrid.",
      "Then the hydrogen fuel cells will take over to generate a steady level of power for a longer period. By working in tandem \u2014 the company likened it to the way a hybrid vehicle works \u2014 the batteries and fuel cells are expected to keep the lights on for about 48 hours or longer.",
      "Clive Richardson, who owns downtown's Calistoga Roastery and can typically be found behind the counter, drinking coffee and chatting with customers, said people in Calistoga get on edge when the winds kick up. And he knows what it's like to have to empty out his store when power goes out \u2014 a big hit for a small-business owner.",
      "A year-round clean solution for emergency power gives him a measure of comfort.",
      "\u201cThis will give us far more security than we had before,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic that it\u2019s come. Here we are, little ol\u2019 Calistoga, and we\u2019ve got the first-of-a-kind system that hopefully will be endorsed and go all over the world.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has barred state officials from enforcing a Florida law that would ban social media accounts for young children, while a legal challenge against the law plays out",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A federal judge has barred state officials from enforcing a Florida law that would ban social media accounts for young children, while a legal challenge against the law plays out. U.S. District Judge Mark Walker issued the order Tuesday, blocking portions of the law from taking effect.",
      "The measure was one of the most restrictive bans in the U.S. on social media use by children when Gov. Ron DeSantis signed it into law in 2024. The law would ban social media accounts for children under 14 and require parental permission for their use by 14- and 15-year-olds.",
      "In his order granting the preliminary injunction sought by the groups Computer & Communications Industry Association and NetChoice, Walker wrote that the law is \u201clikely unconstitutional,\u201d but acknowledged that parents and lawmakers have \u201csincere concerns\u201d about social media's effects on kids.",
      "Walker wrote that the prohibition on social media platforms from allowing certain age groups to have accounts \u201cdirectly burdens those youths\u2019 rights to engage in and access speech.\u201d",
      "Also Tuesday, a federal judge in Atlanta heard arguments from NetChoice seeking to block a 2024 Georgia law scheduled to take effect July 1 that would require age verification for social media accounts and require children younger than 16 to get parental permission for accounts. Like in Florida and other states where laws have been blocked, the internet trade group NetChoice argues that the Georgia law infringes on free speech rights, is vague, and overly burdensome.",
      "While siding with the industry groups' claims that the law limits free speech, Walker allowed a provision of the Florida law to go into effect requiring platforms to shut down accounts for children under 16, if their parent or guardian requests it.",
      "Parents \u2014 and even some teens themselves \u2014 are growing increasingly concerned about the effects of social media use on young people. Supporters of the laws have said they are needed to help curb the explosive use of social media among young people, and what researchers say is an associated increase in depression and anxiety.",
      "Matt Schruers, the president and CEO of the industry association CCIA, praised the judge's order blocking the Florida law.",
      "\u201cThis ruling vindicates our argument that Florida\u2019s statute violates the First Amendment by blocking and restricting minors \u2014 and likely adults as well \u2014 from using certain websites to view lawful content,\" he said in a statement. \"We look forward to seeing this statute permanently blocked as a violation of Floridians\u2019 constitutional right to engage in lawful speech online.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier defended the law and the state's efforts to insulate kids from social media at a time when platforms like TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat seem almost impossible to escape.",
      "\u201cFlorida parents voted through their elected representatives for a law protecting kids from the harmful and sometimes lifelong tragic impacts of social media. These platforms do not have a constitutional right to addict kids to their products,\u201d Uthmeier's press secretary Jae Williams said in a statement. \u201cWe disagree with the court\u2019s order and will immediately seek relief in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.\u201d",
      "In Atlanta, NetChoice attorney Jeremy Maltz told U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg that Georgia's law would impermissibly restrict speech by minors, saying that \u201cbefore you share your art, before you share your political information, you need to produce your papers, please.\u201d",
      "Totenberg did not rule Tuesday. But citing rulings against similar laws in other states, she expressed skepticism about Georgia's case, asking Deputy Attorney General Logan Winkles: \u201cWhat makes today different from all other days?\"",
      "Winkles argued the law's requirement of \u201ccommercially reasonable\u201d attempts to verify age could be quite cheap and likened it to banning minors from bars serving alcohol, not restricting their speech.",
      "\u201cThere are things about social media that make it dangerous,\u201d Winkles said. \u201cIt's a place where children are being restricted. It's not about speech.\u201d",

      "They were fine-tuning a scene featuring what's known as the Oort Cloud, a region far beyond Pluto filled with icy relics from the solar system's formation. Comets can hurtle toward Earth from the cloud, but scientists have never glimpsed its true shape.",
      "One evening while watching the Oort Cloud scene, scientists noticed something strange projected onto the planetarium's dome.",
      "\u201cWhy is there a spiral there?\u201d said the museum's Jackie Faherty.",
      "The inner section of the Oort Cloud, made of billions of comets, resembled a bar with two waving arms, similar to the shape of our Milky Way galaxy.",
      "Scientists had long thought the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, warped by the push and pull of other planets and the Milky Way itself. The planetarium show hinted that a more complex shape could lie inside.",

Another one headed toward Earth on Monday could produce more aurora sightings.",
      "Authorities are monitoring for possible disruptions, though the worst is already over. The weekend\u2019s storms may have caused brief disruptions to high-frequency radio, said Erica Grow Cei, a spokesperson with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Auroras could be visible \u2014 especially in darker, rural areas \u2014 in Alaska, Washington, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Maine and northern parts of Idaho, Wyoming, Iowa, New York, Vermont and New Hampshire.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about auroras and how to spot them.",
      "The sun is at the maximum phase of its 11-year activity cycle, making the light displays more common and widespread. Colorful northern lights have decorated night skies in unexpected places and space weather experts say there are more auroras still to come.",
      "Last spring, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades slammed Earth, producing light displays across the Northern Hemisphere. And last fall, a powerful solar storm dazzled skygazers far from the Arctic Circle when dancing lights appeared in unexpected places including Germany, the United Kingdom, New England and New York City.",
      "Aurora displays known as the northern and southern lights are commonly visible near the poles, where charged particles from the sun interact with Earth's atmosphere.",
      "Skygazers are spotting the lights deeper into the United States and Europe because the sun is going through a major facelift. Every 11 years, its poles swap places, causing magnetic twists and tangles along the way.",

      "It turns out that looming collision between our Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies might not happen after all",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- It turns out that looming collision between our Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies might not happen after all.",
      "Astronomers reported Monday that the probability of the two spiral galaxies colliding is less than previously thought, with a 50-50 chance within the next 10 billion years. That\u2019s essentially a coin flip, but still better odds than previous estimates and farther out in time.",
      "\u201cAs it stands, proclamations of the impending demise of our galaxy seem greatly exaggerated,\u201d the Finnish-led team wrote in a study appearing in Nature Astronomy.",
      "While good news for the Milky Way galaxy, the latest forecast may be moot for humanity.",
      "\u201cWe likely won\u2019t live to see the benefit,\" lead author Till Sawala of the University of Helsinki said in an email.",
      "Already more than 4.5 billion years old, the sun is on course to run out of energy and die in another 5 billion years or so, but not before becoming so big it will engulf Mercury, Venus and possibly Earth. Even if it doesn\u2019t swallow Earth, the home planet will be left a burnt ball, its oceans long since boiled away.",
      "Sawala\u2019s international team relied on the latest observations by NASA\u2019s Hubble Space Telescope and the European Space Agency\u2019s Gaia star-surveying spacecraft to simulate the possible scenarios facing the Milky Way and next-door neighbor Andromeda. Both already collided with other galaxies in their ancient past and, according to many, seemed destined for a head-on crash.",
      "Past theories put a collision between the two \u2014 resulting in a new elliptical galaxy dubbed Milkomeda \u2014 as probable if not inevitable. Some predictions had that happening within 5 billion years, if not sooner.",
      "For this new study, the scientists relied on updated galaxy measurements to factor in the gravitational pull on the Milky Way's movement through the universe. They found that the effects of the neighboring Triangulum galaxy increased the likelihood of a merger between the Milky Way and Andromeda, while the Large Magellanic Cloud decreased those chances.",
      "Despite lingering uncertainty over the position, motion and mass of all these galaxies, the scientists ended up with 50-50 odds of a collision within the next 10 billion years.",
      "\u201cThe fate of our Milky Way galaxy is a subject of broad interest \u2014 not just to astronomers,\u201d said Raja GuhaThakurta of the University of California, Santa Cruz, who was not involved in the study,",
      "A full-on collision, he noted, would transform our home galaxy from a disk of stars seen as a milky band of diffuse light across the sky into a milky blob. A harmless flyby of the two galaxies could leave this stellar disk largely undisturbed, thus preserving our galaxy's name.",
      "More work is needed before the Milky Way\u2019s fate can be predicted with accuracy, according to the researchers. Further insight should help scientists better understand what's happening among galaxies even deeper in the cosmos.",
      "While our galaxy\u2019s fate remains highly uncertain, the sun\u2019s future is \u201cpretty much sealed,\" according to Sawala. \u201cOf course, there is also a very significant chance that humanity will bring an end to itself still much before that, without any need for astrophysical help.\"",

      "The 19 people are all believed to have passed away from natural causes between 1871 and 1872 at Charity Hospital, which served people of all races and classes in New Orleans during the height of white supremacist oppression in the 1800s. The hospital shuttered following Hurricane Katrina in 2005.",

      "In 2023, the University of Leipzig in Germany reached out to the City of New Orleans to find a way to return the remains, Guillory said. The University of Leipzig did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "\u201cThe new helicopter is a multi-role, digital instrument that is geared toward the demands of the 21st century,\u201d Palmas told a ceremony at Cyprus\u2019 main Paphos air base.",
      "Two more of the state-of-the-art aircraft will be delivered, while the contract with Airbus allows for the purchase of additional helicopters, said Airbus Senior Vice President for the H145 program Daniela Dudek.",

      "Scientists say 4 billion people, about half the world\u2019s population, experienced at least one extra month of extreme heat because of human-caused climate change from May 2024 to May 2025.",
      "The extreme heat caused illness, death, crop losses, and strained energy and health care systems, according to the analysis from World Weather Attribution, Climate Central and the Red Cross.",
      "\u201cAlthough floods and cyclones often dominate headlines, heat is arguably the deadliest extreme event,\u201d the report said. Many heat-related deaths are unreported or are mislabeled by other conditions like heart disease or kidney failure.",
      "The scientists used peer-reviewed methods to study how much climate change boosted temperatures in an extreme heat event and calculated how much more likely its occurrence was because of climate change. In almost all countries in the world, the number of extreme heat days has at least doubled compared with a world without climate change.",
      "Caribbean islands were among the hardest hit by additional extreme heat days. Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States, endured 161 days of extreme heat. Without climate change, only 48 would have occurred.",
      "\u201cIt makes it feel impossible to be outside,\u201d said Charlotte Gossett Navarro, chief director for Puerto Rico at Hispanic Federation, a nonprofit focused on social and environmental issues in Latino communities, who lives in the San Juan area and was not involved in the report.",
      "\u201cEven something as simple as trying to have a day outdoors with family, we weren\u2019t able to do it because the heat was too high,\" she said, reporting feeling dizzy and sick last summer.",
      "When the power goes out, which happens frequently in Puerto Rico in part because of decades of neglected grid maintenance and damage from Hurricane Maria in 2017, Navarro said it is difficult to sleep. \u201cIf you are someone relatively healthy, that is uncomfortable, it\u2019s hard to sleep ... but if you are someone who has a health condition, now your life is at risk,\u201d Gossett Navarro said.",
      "Heat waves are silent killers, said Friederike Otto, associate professor of climate science at Imperial College London, one of the report\u2019s authors. \u201cPeople don\u2019t fall dead on the street in a heat wave ... people either die in hospitals or in poorly insulated homes and therefore are just not seen,\u201d he said.",
      "Low-income communities and vulnerable populations, such as older adults and people with medical conditions, suffer the most from extreme heat.",
      "The high temperatures recorded in the extreme heat events that occurred in Central Asia in March, South Sudan in February and in the Mediterranean last July would have not been possible without climate change, according to the report. At least 21 people died in Morocco after temperatures hit 118 degrees Fahrenheit (48 degrees Celsius) last July. People are noticing temperatures are getting hotter but don't always know it is being driven by climate change, said Roop Singh, head of urban and attribution at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, in a World Weather Attribution statement.",
      "\u201cWe need to quickly scale our responses to heat through better early warning systems, heat action plans, and long-term planning for heat in urban areas to meet the rising challenge,\u201d Singh said.",
      "City-led initiatives to tackle extreme heat are becoming popular in parts of South Asia, North America, Europe and Australia to coordinate resources across governments and other agencies. One example is a tree-planting initiative launched in Marseille, France, to create more shaded areas.",
      "The report says strategies to prepare for heat waves include monitoring and reporting systems for extreme temperatures, providing emergency health services, cooling shelters, updated building codes, enforcing heat safety rules at work, and designing cities to be more heat-resilient.",
      "But without phasing out fossil fuels, heat waves will continue becoming more severe and frequent and protective measures against the heat will lose their effectiveness, the scientists said.",

      "Google will return to federal court Friday to fend off the U.S. Justice Department's attempt to topple its internet empire at the same time it's navigating a pivotal shift to artificial intelligence that could undercut its power.",
      "The legal and technological threats facing Google are among the key issues that will be dissected during the closing arguments of a legal proceeding that will determine the changes imposed upon the company in the wake of its dominant search engine being declared as an illegal monopoly by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta last year.",
      "Brandishing evidence presented during a recent three-week stretch of hearings, Justice Department lawyers will attempt to persuade Mehta to order a radical shake-up that includes a ban on Google paying to lock its search engine in as the default on smart devices and an order requiring the company to sell its Chrome browser.",
      "Google lawyers are expected to assert only minor concessions are needed, especially as the upheaval triggered by advances in artificial intelligence already are reshaping the search landscape, as alternative, conversational search options are rolling out from AI startups that are hoping to use the Department of Justice's four-and-half-year-old case to gain the upper hand in the next technological frontier.",
      "\u201cOver weeks of testimony, we heard from a series of well-funded companies eager to gain access to Google\u2019s technology so they don\u2019t have to innovate themselves,\u201d Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, wrote in a blog post earlier this month. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t hear was how DOJ\u2019s extreme proposals would benefit consumers.\u201d",
      "After the day-long closing arguments, Mehta will spend much of the summer mulling a decision that he plans to issue before Labor Day. Google has already vowed to appeal the ruling that branded its search engine as a monopoly, a step it can't take until the judge orders a remedy.",
      "While both sides of this showdown agree that AI is an inflection point for the industry's future, they have disparate views on how the shift will affect Google.",
      "The Justice Department contends that AI technology by itself won't rein in Google's power, arguing additional legal restraints must be slapped on a search engine that's the main reason its parent company, Alphabet Inc., is valued at $2 trillion.",
      "Google has already been deploying AI to transform its search engine i nto an answer engine, an effort that has so far helped maintain its perch as the internet's main gateway despite inroads being made by alternatives from the likes of OpenAI and Perplexity.",
      "The Justice Department contends a divestiture of the Chrome browser that Google CEO Sundar Pichai helped build nearly 20 years ago would be among the most effective countermeasures against Google continuing to amass massive volumes of browser traffic and personal data that could be leveraged to retain its dominance in the AI era. Executives from both OpenAi and Perplexity testified last month that they would be eager bidders for the Chrome browser if Mehta orders its sale.",
      "The debate over Google's fate also has pulled in opinions from Apple, mobile app developers, legal scholars and startups.",
      "Apple, which collects more than $20 billion annually to make Google the default search engine on the iPhone and its other devices, filed briefs arguing against the Justice Department's proposed 10-year ban on such lucrative lock-in agreements. Apple told the judge that prohibiting the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own research, and that the ban might even make Google even more powerful because the company would be able to hold onto its money while consumers would end up choosing its search engine anyway. The Cupertino, California, company also told the judge a ban wouldn't compel it to build its own search engine to compete against Google.",
      "In other filings, a group of legal scholars said the Justice Department's proposed divestiture of Chrome would be an improper penalty that would inject unwarranted government interference in a company's business. Meanwhile, former Federal Trade Commission officials James Cooper and Andrew Stivers warned that another proposal that would require Google to share its data with rival search engines \u201cdoes not account for the expectations users have developed over time regarding the privacy, security, and stewardship\u201d of their personal information.",
      "The App Association, a group that represents mostly small software developers, also advised Mehta not to adopt the Justice Department's proposed changes because of the ripple effects they would have across the tech industry.",
      "Hobbling Google in the way the Justice Department envisions would make it more difficult for startups to realize their goal of being acquired, the App Association wrote. \u201cDevelopers will be overcome by uncertainty\u201d if Google is torn apart, the group argues.",
      "Buy Y Combinator, an incubator that has helped create hundreds of startups collectively worth about $800 billion filed documents pushing for the dramatic overhaul of Google, whose immense power has discouraged venture capitalists from investing in areas that are considered to be part of the company's \u201ckill zone.\u201d",
      "Startups \u201calso need to be able to get their products into the hands of users, free from restrictive dealing and self-preferencing that locks up important distribution channels. As things stand, Google has locked up the most critical distribution channels, freezing the general search and search text advertising markets into static competition for more than a decade,\u201d Y Combinator told Mehta.",

      "Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, slammed that proposal during an address on Wednesday, saying it \"contradicts our principle of power by 100%\" and vowing that Iran would not agree to stop enriching uranium on its own soil, calling it \"a key tool in the nuclear program.\"",

      "While the president and his Cabinet officials have repeatedly said Iran would be required to end enrichment activities under the terms of a deal, U.S. officials say that the initial interim proposal -- which is only intended to be a stepping stone to a broader agreement -- did not prohibit Iran from enriching uranium at low levels while a long-term solution to fuel Iran's civilian nuclear energy program could be established.",
      "Trump's post appeared to contradict the position staked out by his negotiators, and although Iran has not yet formally responded to the interim proposal, it remained unclear on Wednesday whether the U.S. would stand by all the terms in its initial offer.",
      "Whether delegations from Iran and the U.S. would meet for a sixth round of nuclear negotiations also remained unclear, although a U.S. official said a possible meeting in the coming days was under discussion.",
      "After holding a phone call with Russian leader Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, Trump signaled that he would look to Moscow to play a greater role in negotiations with Iran.",
      "\"President Putin suggested that he will participate in the discussions with Iran and that he could, perhaps, be helpful in getting this brought to a rapid conclusion,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"It is my opinion that Iran has been slowwalking their decision on this very important matter, and we will need a definitive answer in a very short period of time!\"",

    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to tell medical schools they must offer nutrition courses to students or risk losing federal funding from the DHS.",
    "story": [
      "The health secretary says he will issue the edict within a year",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he plans to tell American medical schools they must offer nutrition courses to students or risk losing federal funding from the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "Speaking at an event in North Carolina in April, Kennedy lamented, \"There's almost no medical schools that have nutrition courses, and so [aspiring physicians] are taught how to treat illnesses with drugs but not how to treat them with food or to keep people healthy so they don't need the drugs.\"",
      "He added, \"One of the things that we'll do over the next year is to announce that medical schools that don't have those programs are not going to be eligible for our funding, and that we will withhold funds from those who don't implement those kinds of courses.\"",
      "The idea, which Kennedy mentioned in passing at an event focused on plastics in the environment, lacks details but has drawn optimism from some nutrition experts who have for years sought ways for medical schools to teach more nutrition content.",
      "An HHS official told ABC News that Kennedy \"is committed to understanding and drastically lowering chronic disease rates and ending childhood chronic disease, which includes fresh thinking on nutrition and over-reliance on medication and treatments.\"",
      "The official did not respond to requests for more information about Kennedy's plan, like whether he would require medical schools to follow a specific curriculum. Nor did the official say whether Kennedy has begun speaking with medical schools about the issue.",
      "A study published in the Journal of Biomedical Education in 2015 surveyed 121 American medical schools in 2012-2013 and found that medical students spend, on average, only 19 hours on required nutrition education over their four years.",
      "This does not account for education during residency or fellowship training after medical school, or continuing medical education required throughout a doctor\u2019s career to maintain a medical license or board certification.",
      "Those numbers have frustrated some nutrition experts, who argue doctors should focus more on preventing diet-driven conditions like obesity and diabetes and less on prescribing drugs that treat the problems.",
      "\"I think there's a great sense of urgency that we have to do something about this,\" said Dr. David Eisenberg, a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who told ABC News that requiring nutrition education at all medical schools is \"long overdue.\"",
      "\"I think the public imagines that physicians are required to know a lot more than they are trained to know about nutrition and giving practical advice about food to patients,\" added Eisenberg.",
      "When presented with Kennedy's threats to withhold funding, some medical schools reached by ABC News said they already offer sufficient nutrition education.",
      "\"We have an extensive nutrition curriculum as part of our medical school training,\" Sarah Smith, a spokeswoman for Weill Cornell Medicine, said in an email.",

      "A spokesperson for the University of North Carolina School of Medicine touted the school's Department of Nutrition, which the spokesperson said is \"recognized as a global leader in research and training, and is unique in that it is the only nutrition department in the U.S. that is situated in both a school of public health and a school of medicine.\"",
      "A representative for the Association of American Medical Colleges, which counts more than 170 medical schools among its members, declined to comment but told ABC News that an e-survey of medical schools the group conducted last year found that every school that responded reported \"covering nutrition content in some form.\"",
      "Still, the 2015 study, conducted by two researchers from the University of North Carolina and one from Harvard, painted a damning picture of the state of nutrition education at America's medical schools.",
      "\"Many US medical schools still fail to prepare future physicians for everyday nutrition challenges in clinical practice,\" the authors wrote.",
      "Dr. Jo Marie Reilly, a professor at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine, told ABC News that since the 2015 study (the most recent \"scoping review\" of medical schools' nutrition offerings, she said), medical schools have gradually begun offering more nutrition education.",
      "The problem, though, according to Reilly, is the absence of a consistent set of standards for medical schools to abide by.",
      "\"Every school has got their own thing,\" she said.",
      "That could be changing: Reilly and Eisenberg are among a group of medical and nutrition experts who last year published proposed recommendations in JAMA Network Open for a national curriculum, which would involve 36 \"nutritional competencies\" for medical students to meet.",
      "\"Nothing before this had said, well here's what we want [medical students] to know, this is what we think we should teach. Now we have those,\" Reilly told ABC News.",
      "\"We're moving in the right direction, but we have quite a ways to go,\" she said.",
      "Kennedy has long spoken of the need to address chronic disease through changes to what Americans eat.",
      "Withholding or withdrawing federal funding from medical schools, if HHS were to do so, would follow similar moves from departments across the new Trump administration.",
      "This spring, HHS was among several departments which canceled grants to Columbia University in protest of what it called the school's \"continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\" The university said it planned to work with the federal government to restore its funding.",

      "CENTCOM's area of responsibility is a key focus for Trump, who vowed on the campaign trail that he would \"quickly restore stability in the Middle East\" and \"return the world to peace.\"",

      "The man, who is gay, was protected from being returned to his home country under a U.S. immigration judge\u2019s order at the time.

The designation allows people who aren\u2019t eligible to enter the U.S. to do so temporarily, often for reasons related to law enforcement or legal proceedings.",
      "An earlier court proceeding had determined that the man risked persecution or torture if returned to Guatemala. But he also feared returning to Mexico, where he says he was raped and extorted while seeking asylum in the U.S., according to court documents.",

The law signed last month by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis also gives campaigns just 10 days instead of the previous 30 to return signed petition forms to local elections officials. Petitioners could also face stiff fines if they don\u2019t return the petitions on time, or send them to the wrong county.",
      "Lawmakers argue that the new restrictions are needed to reform a process they claim has been tainted by fraud. The Republican-controlled Legislature pushed the changes months after a majority of Florida voters supported ballot initiatives to protect abortion rights and legalize recreational marijuana, though the measures fell short of the 60% needed to pass.",
      "Attorneys for the campaigns Florida Decides Healthcare and Smart & Safe Florida have argued the new law makes gathering enough petitions from voters prohibitively expensive and effectively impossible.",
      "In his order, Walker wrote that the new provisions have caused \u201can immediate reduction in protected speech\u201d by constraining the campaigns' ability to collect petitions \u2014 and volunteers' willingness to help. But Walker said the campaigners didn't prove that their free speech rights had been \u201cseverely burdened.\"",

      "Garon Nathaniel Killian, 20, of Lenoir, was arrested Tuesday and accused of one count of attempted first-degree murder related to the shooting in a residential neighborhood about 7 miles (11 kilometers) south of Hickory. Killian remained in the Catawba County jail after a hearing Wednesday before a district court judge who said he could be released awaiting trial if a $200,000 bond was posted. Prosecutors had requested that no bond be allowed, media outlets reported.",
      "Authorities announced at a media briefing later Wednesday that they were seeking to apprehend three additional suspects \u2014 one facing a charge of attempted first-degree murder and two facing a charge of helping someone under age 21 possess alcoholic beverages. Killian also is expected to face additional charges, sheriff\u2019s Maj. Aaron Turk said.",
      "A previous Hickory Police Department press release said Killian and another young man had been charged with several counts \u2014 including attempted first-degree murder and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill \u2014 for an April 6 altercation in a parking lot that led to shots being fired into a crowd. No one was injured.",
      "The Charlotte Observer, citing court records, said that Killian had been free on a $100,000 bond. Killian's attorney now and for the April case didn't respond to phone and email messages Wednesday.",
      "Catawba County Sheriff Don Brown told reporters that he was \u201coutraged\u201d by Wednesday's $200,000 bond.",
      "\u201cI believe he should have never went back on the street after Hickory Police Department charged him with those crimes,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThis is frustrating. It\u2019s infuriating.\u201d",
      "Hickory police Chief Reed Baer also expressed similar concerns.",
      "At least 80 shots were fired beginning early Sunday shortly after midnight in a crime scene that spanned several properties along a neighborhood road, authorities said. People reported running, ducking for cover and scrambling to their cars for safety. FBI agents were still at the scene Wednesday working to determine the trajectories of the bullets that were fired.",
      "Shawn Patrick Hood, 58, of Lenoir, was killed in the gunfire. He was the oldest of the victims, who ranged in age from as young as 16, the sheriff\u2019s office said. Turk said that most of those injured were shot, but he didn't immediately have information Wednesday on whether any of the injured were still in the hospital.",
      "Turk said the investigation has determined that the shooting began from an elevated area in a yard neighboring the house where the party was happening. Other gunfire then erupted around the home, the home's front yard and by the road.",

      "NEW YORK -- Jurors in Harvey Weinstein \u2019s sex crimes retrial are due to start deliberating Thursday, with dozens of witnesses, scores of documents and two days of closing arguments to sift through.",
      "The seven-woman, five-man jury will start its private discussions after getting legal instructions from the judge Thursday morning.",
      "Closing arguments concluded Wednesday, with prosecutor Nicole Blumberg saying the former movie studio boss \u201cheld the golden ticket\u201d to show-business success and used it to sexually assault women who were afraid to cross him.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty to raping a woman in 2013 and forcing oral sex on two others in 2006. Defense lawyer Arthur Aidala told jurors Tuesday that Weinstein had entirely consensual encounters with the women, arguing that they were \u201cusing him\u201d to advance their fledgling careers in entertainment.",
      "Over the last seven years, the case has been seen as something of a crucible for the #MeToo movement. The anti-sexual-misconduct outcry took flight after allegations against Weinstein became public in 2017.",
      "He was later convicted of sex crimes in New York and California. The New York conviction was overturned last year, and the case was sent back for retrial.",
      "The new trial was expanded to include an accuser who wasn't part of the first trial. One of the criminal sex act charges is based on her allegations.",

      "A judge has blocked a private prison operator from housing immigrants facing possible deportation in a shuttered Kansas City area detention center unless it can get a permit from frustrated city officials",
      "LEAVENWORTH, Kan. -- A judge on Wednesday barred a major U.S. private prison operator from housing immigrants facing possible deportation in a shuttered Kansas City area detention center unless it can get a permit from frustrated city officials.",
      "Leavenworth County Judge John Bryant agreed after a packed hearing to grant the city of Leavenworth's request for a temporary restraining order against CoreCivic, one of the nation's largest private prison operators.",
      "CoreCivic had claimed in legal filings that halting the opening of the 1,033-bed facility on the northwest outskirts of the Kansas City area would cost it $4.2 million in revenue each month. City officials said they anticipated the arrival of detainees apprehended by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was imminent under a Trump administration crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Leavenworth isn\u2019t the first city where controversy has surrounded the reopening of a private prison as an ICE detention facility. In Newark, New Jersey, Mayor Ras Baraka sued the state\u2019s top federal prosecutor on Tuesday over his recent arrest on a trespassing charge at a federal immigration detention facility in that state, saying the Trump-appointed attorney had pursued the case out of political spite.",
      "Scott Peterson, the city manager for Leavenworth, said he didn\u2019t know if the case in Kansas marked the first time a municipality had prevailed in court.",
      "\u201cI would point out that maybe the reason we have seen some success here today is this is not about immigration,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cThis is not about private prisons. This is about land use.\u201d",
      "In late 2021, CoreCivic stopped housing pretrial detainees for the U.S. Marshals Service in the Leavenworth facility after then-President Joe Biden called on the Justice Department to curb the use of private prisons. In the months leading up to the closure, the American Civil Liberties Union and federal public defenders urged the White House to speed up the closure, citing inmate rights violations there along with stabbings, suicides and even one homicide.",
      "But with President Donald Trump pushing for mass deportations under a wide-ranging crackdown on illegal immigration, the facility that CoreCivic now calls the Midwest Regional Reception Center is in demand again. It is located just 10 miles (16 kilometers) west of the Kansas City International Airport. As part of his crackdown, Trump has vowed to sharply increase detention beds nationwide from the budgeted 41,000 beds this year.",
      "Tennessee-based CoreCivic initially applied for a special use permit from the city in February but then withdrew that application the next month, arguing in court filings that it didn\u2019t need the permit and that the process would take too long.",
      "\u201cIt became clear to CoreCivic that there was not a cooperative relationship,\u201d said Taylor Concannon Hausmann, an attorney for the private prison operator, speaking in court.",
      "The city sued CoreCivic, the lawsuit claiming that CoreCivic impeded the city police force\u2019s ability to investigate sexual assaults and other violent crimes. The lawsuit contended that the permitting process was needed to safeguard itself from future problems.",
      "\u201cJust follow our rules,\" an attorney for the city, Joe Hatley, said in court. \u201cGo get a permit.\u201d",
      "The first version of the lawsuit, filed in March in federal court, was tossed out in May on technical grounds. But Bryant sided with Hatley in the case refiled the same month in state court, finding that the proper procedures weren't followed.",
      "Concannon Hausmann, CoreCivic's attorney, declined to comment as the crowd filtered out of the courtroom Wednesday. Norman Mallicoat held a sign reading, \u201cCoreCivic Doesn\u2019t Run Leavenworth\u201d as he left.",
      "\u201cI see this as basically a large company trying to bully a small city into getting what it wants and not having to follow the rules and ordinances of the city,\u201d Mallicoat said.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge says the Trump administration must give migrants sent to an El Salvador prison a chance to challenge their removals",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge ruled on Wednesday that the Trump administration must give more than 100 migrants sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador prison a chance to challenge their deportations.",
      "U.S. District Court Chief Judge James Boasberg said that people who were sent to the prison in March under an 18th-century wartime law haven\u2019t been able to formally contest the removals or allegations that they are members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. He ordered the administration to work toward giving them a way to file those challenges.",
      "The judge wrote that \u201csignificant evidence\u201d has surfaced indicating that many of the migrants imprisoned in El Salvador are not connected to the gang \u201cand thus languish in a foreign prison on flimsy, even frivolous, accusations.\u201d",
      "Boasberg gave the administration one week to come up with a manner in which the \"at least 137\" people can make those claims, even while they're formally in the custody of El Salvador. It's the latest milestone in the monthslong legal saga over the fate of deportees imprisoned at El Salvador\u2019s notorious Terrorism Confinement Center.",
      "After Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 in March and prepared to fly planeloads of accused gang members to El Salvador and out of the jurisdiction of U.S. courts, Boasberg ordered them to turn the planes around. This demand was ignored. Boasberg has found probably cause that the administration committed contempt of court after the flight landed. El Salvador President Nayib Bukele posted a taunting message on social media \u2014 reposted by some of Trump's top aides \u2014 that read \u201cOopsie, too late.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled that anyone targeted under the AEA has the right to appeal to a judge to contest their designation as an enemy of the state. Boasberg, in his latest, ruling wrote that he was simply applying that principle to those who'd been removed.",
      "Boasberg said the administration \u201cplainly deprived\u201d the immigrants of a chance to challenge their removals before they were put on flights. Therefore, he says the government must handle the migrants cases now as if they \u201cwould have been if the Government had not provided constitutionally inadequate process.\u201d",
      "The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The administration and its supporters have targeted Boasberg for his initial order halting deportations and his contempt inquiry, part of their growing battle with the judiciary as it puts the brakes on Trump's efforts to unilaterally remake government. The fight has been particularly harsh in the realm of immigration, where Trump has repeatedly said it'd be impossible to protect the country from dangerous immigrants if each one has his or her day in court.",
      "\u201cWe cannot give everyone a trial!\u201d the president posted on his social media site, Truth Social, after the Supreme Court intervened a second time in the AEA saga, halting a possible effort to evade its initial ruling by temporarily freezing deportations from northern Texas.",
      "Boasberg wrote that he accepted the administration's declaration, filed under seal, providing details of the government's deal with El Salvador to house deportees and how that means the Venezuelans are technically under the legal control of El Salvador and not the United States. He added, while noting there is a criminal penalty for providing false testimony, that believing those representations was \u201crendered more difficult given the Government\u2019s troubling conduct throughout this case.\u201d",
      "He also noted parallels with another case where the Trump administration admitted it mistakenly deported a Maryland man to El Salvador and has been ordered by a judge, appellate judges and the U.S. Supreme Court to \u201cfacilitate\u201d his return.",
      "That man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, remains in El Salvador more than two months later.",
      "ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt welcomed Boasberg\u2019s ruling.",
      "\u201cThis is a significant step forward to getting these men the chance to show that they should not ever have been removed under a wartime authority,\u201d Gelernt told reporters in San Diego after a hearing in an unrelated case.",
      "Boasberg's order is only the latest of a blizzard of legal rulings in the sprawling AEA case.",
      "Several judges have temporarily halted deportations under the act in parts of Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania and elsewhere, finding the administration's 24 hour window that it gave detainees to challenge their designation under the act did not meet the Supreme Court's requirement of providing a \u201creasonable\u201d chance to seek relief. Deportations of people in the country illegally can continue in those areas under laws other than the AEA,",
      "Some of the judges in those cases have also found that Trump cannot use the act to target a criminal gang rather than a state, noting that the act has only been invoked three prior times in history \u2014 during the War of 1812 and during World Wars I and II.",
      "The Supreme Court will likely eventually decide those issues. The Trump administration contends that the gang is acting as a shadow arm of Venezuela's government.",

      "The Trump administration is signaling it intends to cut off federal funding for a long-delayed California high-speed rail project plagued by multibillion-dollar cost overruns",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The Trump administration signaled Wednesday that it intends to cut off federal funding for a long-delayed California high-speed rail project plagued by multibillion-dollar cost overruns, following the release of a scathing federal report that concluded there is \u201cno viable path\u201d to complete even a partial section of the line.",
      "Voters first authorized $10 billion in borrowed funds in 2008 to cover about a third of the estimated cost, with a promise the train would be up and running by 2020. Five years beyond that deadline, no tracks have been laid and its estimated price tag has ballooned to over $100 billion.",
      "In a letter to the California High-Speed Rail Authority, which oversees the project, Federal Railroad Administration acting Administrator Drew Feeley wrote that what was envisioned as an 800-mile system connecting the state's major cities has been reduced to a blueprint for \u201ca 119-mile track to nowhere.\u201d",
      "After a $4 billion federal investment, the California agency \u201chas conned the taxpayer ... with no viable plan to deliver even that partial segment on time,\u201d Feeley wrote.",
      "State officials defended what's known as the nation\u2019s largest infrastructure project and said they remain committed to construction, though it's not clear what funding would replace the federal support if it's withdrawn. Feeley noted the FRA could seek repayment of the federal funds but is not proposing to claw back those dollars at this time.",
      "Carol Dahmen, the state authority's chief of strategic communications, said in a statement that the federal conclusions are misguided and \u201cdo not reflect the substantial progress made to deliver high-speed rail in California.\u201d",
      "Dahmen noted that the majority of the funding for the line has been provided by the state and that Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom's budget proposal would extend at least $1 billion a year for 20 years to complete an initial segment of the line.",
      "State officials are focused on a stretch connecting the Central Valley cities of Bakersfield and Merced, which is set to be operating by 2033.",
      "The state agency has about a month to formally respond to the FRA, after which the grants could be terminated.",
      "State Sen. Tony Strickland, a Republican from Huntington Beach who is vice chair of the Transportation Committee, said that \u201ccommonsense has prevailed\" and urged the Legislature's dominant Democrats to redirect the funds from the rail line to lowering gas prices or investing in viable construction projects.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s stop wasting California\u2019s hard-earned taxpayer dollars,\u201d Strickland said.",
      "There is no known source for the billions of dollars that would be needed to complete the line.",
      "California High-Speed Rail Authority CEO Ian Choudri suggested in April that private investors could step in and fill the funding gap for the project that promised nonstop rail service between San Francisco and Los Angeles in under three hours. At the time, he acknowledged that even if funding is secured, it might take nearly two more decades to complete most of that segment.",
      "President Donald Trump \u2014 who canceled nearly $1 billion in federal dollars for the project in his first term \u2014 said in May that his administration will not continue to fund the line. \u201cThat train is the worst cost overrun I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Trump told reporters at the time, calling it \"totally out of control.\u201d",
      "California Democratic U.S. Sens. Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff called the administration's announcement a \u201cdevastating\u201d blow for 21st century transportation and an effort to punish a heavily Democratic state that didn't support the Republican president in the election.",
      "\u201cHigh-speed rail is the future of transportation with the potential to bring customers to new businesses, businesses to new employees and to connect communities hundreds of miles away with affordable and faster transit,\u201d they said in a joint statement.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a statement that Trump also is nominating Air Force Lt. Gen. Dagvin Anderson to head U.S. Africa Command. Anderson would be the first Air Force general to lead the command, which was created in 2007.",
      "Cooper is currently deputy commander of U.S. Central Command and has extensive experience serving and leading troops in the Middle East. The current head of the command, Army Gen. Erik Kurilla, is slated to retire after more than three years in the post.",
      "It is a crucial role as the region has been shaken by conflict, with the Trump administration pushing to broker a ceasefire deal after 20 months of war in Gaza and pressing for an agreement with Iran in negotiations over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program.",
      "A 1989 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, Cooper commanded naval forces in the Middle East for close to three years as the head of the Navy's 5th Fleet in Bahrain.

Jim Mattis, went on to serve as defense secretary. Central Command covers 21 countries across central and south Asia and northeast Africa and has overseen the conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel, Syria and Yemen.",
      "The only Navy officer to ever lead Central Command was Adm. William Fallon, who resigned after a year and retired. At the time, Fallon said he was stepping down due to press reports that suggested he was opposed to then-President George W. Bush's Iran policies. He said the reports were wrong but the perception had become a distraction.",
      "Cooper is a surface warfare officer and served on guided-missile cruisers, destroyers, aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships. He commanded a destroyer and a cruiser.",

He also oversaw the Navy's role in Operation Prosperity Guardian, the U.S.-led coalition created in late 2023 to counter Houthi attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea.",
      "He previously served as commander of Naval Surface Force Atlantic and commander of U.S. Naval Forces Korea. Cooper is the son of a career Army officer and got his master\u2019s degree in strategic intelligence from the National Intelligence University.",
      "Anderson, nominated to lead operations in Africa, is a pilot who has flown the KC-135 tanker, the C-130 transport aircraft and the U-28A surveillance aircraft used largely by special operations forces. He has flown more than 3,400 flight hours, including 738 in combat.",

      "Africa Command is the newest of the Pentagon's geographic commands and covers the bulk of the African continent. Much of the U.S. military's efforts there have focused on combatting extremist groups and training local forces.",

      "Here are things to know about the case:",
      "Morales Reyes immigrated from Mexico in the 1980s, according to his attorney. A married man with three U.S. citizen children, he worked as a dishwasher in Milwaukee.",
      "Federal immigration agents took him into custody last month after he dropped his daughter at school.",
      "Days later Noem blasted his photo on social media, along with an excerpt of a letter he purportedly wrote in English calling for Trump to be shot at a rally. The arrest was held up by the White House and Trump supporters as a success in the administration\u2019s aggressive crackdown on immigration.",
      "But the details quickly unraveled, including the fact that Morales Reyes doesn\u2019t speak English well and can\u2019t write in the language.",
      "On Tuesday, authorities in Wisconsin charged Demetric D. Scott of forging the letter in an effort to blame Morales Reyes, a potential witness against him in a 2023 attack. Scott is accused of knocking Morales Reyes off his bicycle, injuring him with a box cutter and then taking the bike, according to court records.",
      "Court documents said law enforcement officials listened to calls Scott made about the letters and a plot to have someone picked up by immigration agents, all aiming to have the armed robbery and aggravated battery charges dismissed. He also admitted to police that he wrote the letters, documents said.",
      "Scott, who is in the Milwaukee County Jail, is awaiting a July trial. He's due in court on Tuesday on the newer charges, including felony witness intimidation and identity theft.",
      "A message left Tuesday for the state public defender\u2019s office wasn\u2019t immediately returned. Scott's attorneys have previously declined comment.",
      "Earlier this year, Morales Reyes applied for a U visa, which is for people in the country illegally who become victims of serious crimes. The application was pending, according to his attorneys.",
      "Morales Reyes has been detained at Dodge Detention Center in Juneau, which is about 70 miles (112.65 kilometers) north of Milwaukee.",
      "Homeland Security officials have not publicly corrected the information on the presidential threat.",
      "Instead they\u2019ve doubled down on pursuing an immigration case against him. They allege Morales Reyes entered the country illegally at least nine times between 1998 and 2005 and that he has a criminal background.",
      "\u201cThis criminal illegal alien is no longer under investigation for threats against the President, but will remain in ICE custody pending removal proceedings,\u201d DHS said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Morales Reyes is accused of two incidents in 1996, according to his attorneys.",
      "In one he was arrested for damaging property in a hit-and-run but not charged. In another he was ticketed for disorderly conduct and criminal damage after a dispute with his wife. No one was injured, according to his attorney.",
      "Attorneys for Morales Reyes said the information on the threat should be corrected quickly as their client and his family are facing harassment and threats.",
      "\u201cThis administration has jumped quickly to make announcements that they think will play well to their narrative of immigrants being dangerous,\u201d said attorney Cain Oulahan.",
      "Immigrant rights advocates have rallied around Morales Reyes, including a group who stood outside a downtown Chicago immigration court Wednesday ahead of a brief hearing in the deportation case. Several held a large banner that read, \u201cStop Scapegoating Immigrants.\u201d",
      "Morales Reyes, wearing a green jail jumpsuit, appeared via livestream. He spoke through a Spanish interpreter, saying he understood the case.",
      "Oulahan told the judge that he was hoping for a quick resolution, considering the public accusations made against Morales Reyes. He\u2019s seeking for Morales Reyes to be released on bond.",
      "A government attorney told the judge she didn\u2019t have any information about the threat accusation.",
      "Immigration Judge Carla Espinoza said more time was needed to review documents. She set another hearing for June 10.",
      "The situation has been difficult for Morales Reyes and his relatives.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a family man. This has been extremely stressful on him,\u201d said Oulahan. \u201cHe\u2019s very worried.\"",

      "A federal judge has ordered the unsealing of several court documents in the lawsuit over Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u2019s deportation",
      "A federal judge on Wednesday ordered the unsealing of several court documents in the lawsuit over Kilmar Abrego Garcia's deportation, rejecting the Trump administration's arguments that it would risk national security.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland issued her order after media organizations, including The Associated Press, argued the public has a right to access court records under the First Amendment.",
      "Filings unsealed so far offer little information that\u2019s new or unknown publicly. Xinis described one document as \u201crelatively boilerplate.\u201d It was a request by the Trump administration to temporarily halt discovery, an early phase of a lawsuit where parties share evidence.",
      "\u201cIt does not disclose any potentially privileged or otherwise sensitive information for which a compelling government interest outweighs the right to access,\u201d Xinis wrote.",
      "Xinis noted that some documents were public before the court was asked to seal them the next day. Those filings contained a back-and-forth between Abrego Garcia\u2019s attorneys and the U.S. government over efforts to return him from El Salvador.",
      "Trump administration lawyers often objected to answering questions, arguing that they involve state secrets, sensitive diplomatic negotiations and other protected information.",
      "For example, the U.S. attorneys mentioned \u201cappropriate diplomatic discussions with El Salvador.\u201d But they wrote that disclosing the details \u201dcould negatively impact any outcome.\u201d",
      "Xinis also ordered the partial release of a transcript from an April 30 court hearing. Some of it will be reacted to protect potentially classified information.",
      "Wednesday's ruling was unrelated to the Trump administration pending invocation of the state secrets privilege, a legal doctrine often used in military cases. The administration has argued that releasing information about the Abrego Garcia matter in open court \u2014 or even to the judge in private \u2013 could jeopardize national security.",
      "Xinis is yet to rule on the state secrets claim.",
      "Abrego Garcia\u2019s attorneys have argued that the Trump administration has done nothing to return the Maryland construction worker. They say the government is invoking the privilege to hide behind the misconduct of mistakenly deporting him and refusing to bring him back.",
      "Abrego Garcia\u2019s deportation violated a U.S. immigration judge\u2019s order in 2019 that shielded Abrego Garcia from expulsion to his native country. The immigration judge determined that Abrego Garcia faced likely persecution by a local Salvadoran gang that terrorized his family.",
      "Abrego Garcia\u2019s American wife sued over his deportation. Xinis ordered his return on April 4. The Supreme Court ruled on April 10 that the administration must work to bring him back.",
      "President Donald Trumptold ABC News in late April that he could retrieve Abrego Garcia with a phone call to El Salvador\u2019s president. But Trump said he wouldn\u2019t do it because Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, an allegation that Abrego Garcia denies and for which he was never charged.",

    "story": [
      "A bill to reduce how much Pennsylvania school districts have to pay for cyber charter students is advancing in the state Legislature",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- A Democratic-sponsored proposal to limit per-student payments to Pennsylvania's cyber charter schools and make other changes to how they operate narrowly passed the state House on Wednesday over Republican objections that it would imperil the online learning programs.",
      "The 104-98 vote, with only two Republicans in favor, sets down a marker on the perennially contentious issue of school funding as state lawmakers work to complete the coming year's state budget for the fiscal year that starts in July.",
      "The bill's $8,000 limit on how much public school districts would have to reimburse the cyber charters was the central piece of the sprawling legislation and would be a boost to the districts and the property tax payers who bear much of the cost of public education in Pennsylvania. There currently is no cap for the districts' payments to cyber charters, an amount now linked to how much districts spent on their own students in the prior year.",
      "Supporters said changes to the cyber charter rules are widely backed among the state's 500 school boards and that cyber school spending has been the subject of critical reviews, including recently by Republican Auditor General Tim DeFoor.",
      "But opponents defended the existing system as a critical lifeline to the students and families that for various reasons have sought alternatives to traditional schools.",
      "The bill would set annual tuition payments from school districts to cyber charters at $8,000 per student, with potential yearly increases. Special education funding would also see changes.",
      "Cyber charters would not be able to maintain cash balances above 12% of their spending and would not be able to provide payments or gifts to parents as incentives to enroll their children.",
      "The bill would bolster disclosure requirements regarding cyber charters' policies, instructional materials and budgets.",
      "It would bar the state Education Department from approving any additional cyber charter schools through the 2029-30 school year. A new Cyber Charter School Funding and Policy Council would be set up to make recommendations concerning enrollment, governance and funding.",
      "During floor debate Wednesday, Rep. Martina White, a Philadelphia Republican, said the measure will \u201cclose real schools, displace real students, strip families of the very choices that they depend on to give their children a chance at success.\u201d",
      "The moratorium would be highly damaging to cyber charters, said Rep. Craig Williams, a Delaware County Republican.",
      "\u201cYou limit the number of cyber charters now in existence, you choke off its funding, and eventually you can kill cyber charter. Sixty-plus thousand students in our school system, finding another way to learn, and we\u2019re going to choke it off with this bill,\u201d Williams said.",
      "The chair of the House Education Committee, Lehigh County Democratic Rep. Peter Schweyer, enumerated cyber charter spending issues raised in the auditor general's report, including staff bonuses, gift cards, vehicle payments and fuel stipends.",
      "\u201cGift cards?\u201d Schweyer asked his colleagues. \u201cWe would all get in trouble if we were taking gift cards as part of our compensation.\u201d",
      "Leaders of existing public cyber charter schools say the measure would cut their funding by about $450 million or more across the state, with a third of the total reductions targeting special education student reimbursements.",
      "A Democratic analysis put the figure at more than $600 million.",
      "About 65,000 Pennsylvania students currently attend the state's 14 public cyber charter schools, which are public, nonprofit corporations. They do not have to follow all of the requirements mandated of public schools under state law.",
      "Cyber charter school are considered independent public schools, approved to operate with a \u201ccharter\u201d issued by the Education Department. They use technology to provide much of the teaching. Students usually do not need to attend a physical location beyond certain events, such as standardized testing.",
      "The proposal was sent over to the Republican majority state Senate for its consideration. The bill becomes part of a wider negotiations to determine the budget before lawmakers recess for the summer.",

      "Levi Austin Frakes and Charles Ethan Fields were arrested Monday night at their home in Lacey, near Olympia, according to a criminal complaint filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court. Federal court records did not list an attorney for either man.",
      "One of the defendants told investigators they had been stealing equipment from the base for the past two years to sell or trade, and agents found about $24,000 in cash at the home, wrote Special Agent Christopher J. Raguse of the Army Criminal Investigation Division.",
      "The federal complaint charges them with robbery, assault and theft of government property. They also face investigation on state charges of unlawful possession of incendiary devices, short-barreled rifles and a machine gun. Each was being held at the Pierce County Jail on $500,000 bail.",
      "According to the complaint, a soldier entered a building at the Army Ranger compound at Joint Base Lewis-McChord on Sunday night and found two men, partially masked, with a cluster of U.S. Army property around them. The soldier questioned them about what they were doing and told them to pull down their masks, which they did.",
      "A fight ensued, and one of the men brandished a hammer and struck the soldier in the head. The soldier continued to fight despite losing a large amount of blood and managed to get control of the hammer \u2014 at which point, one of the men pulled a knife. The soldier then let them go, the complaint said.",
      "During the fight, one of the men dropped his hat. It said \u201cFields\u201d on the inside. Using base entry logs and surveillance video, investigators determined that Fields and Frakes had entered Lewis-McChord together about an hour before the attack, investigators said.",
      "Additionally, the wounded soldier, who required hospital treatment, told investigators that he asked around his unit about the name Fields after finding it on the hat. The soldier learned that Fields had been assigned to the Ranger Battalion around 2021, and he was able to identify him as one of the attackers based on photos shown to him by others in his unit, the complaint said.",
      "The complaint did not include details of Frakes' military service.",
      "The FBI executed a search warrant at a home shared by the defendants on Monday and arrested them. Agents found rifles positioned at the upstairs windows, the complaint said.",
      "Authorities said agents seized about 35 firearms at the home, including short barrel rifles and an MG42 machine gun \u2014 a type typically supported with a bipod and which was used by German troops during World War II.",
      "Other seized gear included grenade launchers, Army-issued explosives, body armor, ammunition and ballistic helmets, authorities said.",

      "Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear is stepping up his efforts to guarantee preschool access for every 4-year-old in the state",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Democratic Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear stepped up his efforts Wednesday to guarantee preschool access for every 4-year-old in the state, offering assurances his plan would reap widespread benefits \u2014 improving student performance while bolstering employment and family incomes.",
      "Having been stymied by the state's GOP-supermajority legislature in recent years when he pitched his universal pre-K plan, Beshear kicked off a campaign in hopes of building grassroots support. It comes about seven months before lawmakers convene in January for their 2026 session, which could be the term-limited governor's last realistic chance to turn his ambitious preschool plan into law. The 2026 session will be highlighted by work to pass the state's next two-year budget.",
      "Beshear, a two-term governor seen as a potential presidential candidate in 2028, said every child \u201cdeserves a good start\u201d by ensuring they are prepared for kindergarten. The Bluegrass State is falling short of that goal, he said, pointing to statistics showing more than half of Kentucky children are unprepared for their first day of kindergarten, creating an achievement gap that's difficult to overcome.",
      "\u201cScripture tells us that children are a gift from God,\" Beshear said during his campaign-style stop in Louisville. \"And I believe that we have a responsibility as adults to build a better state for every single one of them. We all know that we can do this with pre-K for all. Let\u2019s finally get this done.\u201d",
      "Nearly two-thirds of Kentucky's 120 counties lack sufficient child care to serve every family that needs it, the governor said. Workforce participation rates tend to be lower in counties with fewer childcare options, Beshear's administration said.",
      "\u201cKentucky will never reach its potential if our children\u2019s zip code determines their place in the world by the first day of kindergarten,\u201d said Democratic Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman, a former public school teacher and administrator. \u201cThe time for pre-K is now.\u201d",
      "The benefits of his pre-K proposal would be much broader and would include increasing the state's workforce by enabling more parents to go back to work, Beshear said. And it would help ease the financial burden on parents with young children, he said.",
      "\u201cAmerican families right now are struggling, struggling to pay the bills, and child care is a big part of that,\" Beshear said. \"Pre-K for all could ease the financial burden facing our hardworking families and make paying those bills not just a little but a lot easier.\u201d",
      "Beshear on Wednesday did not delve into how much state-funded preschool would cost, but he pointed to a study indicating every $1 invested in pre-K generates $10 cycling through the state economy.",
      "Leading up to the 2024 legislative session, Beshear's budget plan included $172 million each year of the following two-year budget cycle to provide preschool for 4-year-olds. Beshear has said the expense is \u201cmore than affordable,\u201d amounting to a fraction of the massive surplus in the state's budget reserve trust fund. That preschool proposal and others like it have made no headway with GOP lawmakers.",
      "Guaranteeing preschool access should be nonpartisan, Beshear said Wednesday. He said that some 18 states \u2014 including some run by Republicans \u2014 offer pre-K access for all 4-year-olds.",
      "Beshear and other top members of his administration planned events in Kentucky's biggest media markets over the coming days to promote the preschool plan.",
      "In another sign he's stepping up the public campaign for his pre-K proposal, Beshear issued an executive order creating an advisory committee that will hold statewide public meetings on the issue. The committee \u2014 made up of people with backgrounds in education, workforce development and business \u2014 will make a written report to the governor this fall detailing its findings and recommendations.",

      "Officials in the Georgia school district where four people were killed in a September school shooting are considering a property tax increase to pay for school-based police officers",
      "WINDER, Ga. -- Officials in the Georgia school district where four people were killed in a September shooting at Apalachee High School are considering a property tax increase to pay for school-based police officers.",
      "Barrow County Superintendent Dallas LeDuff told school board members Tuesday that the tax increase would be necessary because county government has informed the school district that it will no longer pay for sheriff's deputies, local news outlets reported.",
      "The school district and Barrow County Commission have been splitting the price of deputies assigned as school resource officers since 2017. That number was originally 12, rose to 16 in 2024, and then to 24 after the shooting. That would place at least two officers in the district\u2019s high schools and at least one officer in every other school, although officials haven\u2019t yet been able to hire 24 deputies.",
      "County commissioners sent a letter to LeDuff last month saying county government will for now pay half only 12 salaries, and eventually stop paying any of the costs.",
      "\u201cWhat they would like to see happen is that we as a school system be responsible for funding 100% of all direct and indirect costs for all 24 officers that we are staffing now, along with future officers we might add,\u201d LeDuff said.",
      "The superintendent said the district will cover whatever the officers cost, calling it \u201dnonnegotiable.\u201d The district has been under intense local pressure since the shooting to improve security, agreeing to install weapons detectors at its high schools and middle schools this year after months of community outcry.",
      "\u201cEspecially in light of Sept. 4, I am deeply concerned with the Board of Commissioners\u2019 underlying notion that 2,000-plus Barrow County school system employees and over 15,000 Barrow County students are no longer included in their definition of public safety,\u201d Barrow County school board member Kayla Hendrix said. \u201cPerhaps we need to ask the county commissioners who qualifies under their definition of public safety.\u201d",
      "Officials have said the believe a quick response by officers at Apalachee prevented more victims. The Sept. 4 shooting killed teachers Richard \u201cRicky\u201d Aspinwall, 39, and Cristina Irimie, 53, and students Mason Schermerhorn and Christian Angulo, both 14. Another teacher and eight more students were wounded, seven of them hit by gunfire. Colt Gray, then a 14-year-old freshman, has been indicted as an adult for murder and other crimes.",
      "Barrow County commissioners wrote in their letter that voters had approved a plan to exempt some senior citizens from paying school property taxes and that the county therefore believes it is inappropriate to use property taxes collected for county government to subsidize school expenses.",
      "\u201cIt is imperative that Barrow County government ensure that no county general fund dollars \u2014 for which there is no senior exemption \u2014 are dedicated to areas that would otherwise be funded by school taxes and the associated millage rate,\u201d county spokesperson Brian Stewart said.",
      "Paying the expenses for next year would cost the school district more than $1 million. The district\u2019s proposed property tax increase would cost the owner of a $100,000 property about $20 a year.",
      "The issue could come up at a county commission meeting next week. William Philip said he plans to go to that meeting to protest the decision.",
      "\u201cThis is a serious issue. This has to do with our kids\u2019 safety,\u201d Philip said. \u201cBad politics. Horrible politics. A lot of parents can\u2019t wait to go to the commissioners meeting and see.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Labor Department has cut back on the inflation data it collects because of the Trump administration's government hiring freeze, raising concerns among economists about the quality of the inflation figures just as they are being closely watched for the impact of tariffs.",
      "The department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which produces the monthly consumer price index, the most closely watched inflation measure, said Wednesday that it is \u201creducing sample in areas across the country\u201d and stopped collecting price data entirely in April in Lincoln, Nebraska, and Provo, Utah. It also said it has stopped collecting data this month in Buffalo, New York.",
      "In an email that the BLS sent to economists, viewed by The Associated Press, the agency said that it \u201ctemporarily reduced the number of outlets and quotes it attempted to collect due to a staffing shortage\u201d in April. The reduced data collection \u201cwill be kept in place until the hiring freeze is lifted.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump froze federal hiring on his first day in office and extended the freeze in April until late July, suggesting future inflation reports will also involve less data collection.",
      "The cutbacks have intensified worries among economists that government spending cuts could degrade the federal government's ability to compile key economic data on employment, prices, and the broader economy. The BLS also said last month that it will no longer collect wholesale prices in about 350 categories for its Producer Price Index, a measure of price changes before they reach the consumer.",
      "The cutbacks are also occurring at a time of heightened uncertainty about the economy and the impact of Trump's sweeping tariffs on hiring, growth and inflation.",

    "story": [
      "The United States has vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution demanding an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza because it\u2019s not linked to the release of hostages",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- The United States on Wednesday vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution demanding an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza because it was not linked to the release of hostages, saying it would embolden Hamas militants.",
      "All 14 other members of the council voted in favor of the resolution, which described the humanitarian situation in Gaza as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d and called on Israel to lift all restrictions on the delivery of aid to the 2.1 million Palestinians in the territory.",
      "The resolution before the U.N.'s most powerful body also did not fulfill two other U.S. demands: It did not condemn Hamas\u2019 deadly attack in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which ignited the war, or say the militant group must disarm and withdraw from Gaza.",
      "Acting U.S. Ambassador Dorothy Shea, speaking to the council immediately before the vote, said the resolution would undermine the security of Israel. a close U.S. ally, and diplomatic efforts to reach a ceasefire \u201cthat reflects the realities on the ground.\"",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the resolution would only have empowered Hamas. \u201cHamas could end this brutal conflict immediately by laying down its arms and releasing all remaining hostages,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "Israel\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon thanked the United States for refusing to abandon the hostages. He said the resolution\u2019s failure to make the release of hostages a condition for a ceasefire would have put all the pressure on Israel and handed Hamas \u201ctime, leverage and political cover.\u201d",
      "But the U.S. veto of the resolution \u2014 its fifth since the start of the war \u2014 was roundly criticized by other members of the council, who accused the United States of providing Israel with impunity.",
      "The Chinese ambassador to the U.N. said Israel's actions have \u201ccrossed every red line\u201d of international humanitarian law and seriously violated U.N. resolutions. \u201cYet, due to the shielding by one country, these violations have not been stopped or held accountable,\" Ambassador Fu Cong said.",
      "Britain\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Barbara Woodward, a usual U.S. ally, lashed out at Israel. \u201cThis Israeli government\u2019s decisions to expand its military operations in Gaza and severely restrict aid are unjustifiable, disproportionate and counterproductive, and the U.K. completely opposes them,\u201d she said.",
      "Pakistan's Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad said the U.S. veto \"will be remembered as a complicity, a green light for continued annihilation. A moment where the entire world was expecting action. But yet again, this council was blocked and prevented by one member from carrying out its responsibility.\u201d",
      "Slovenia\u2019s U.N. Ambassador Samuel \u017dbogar, the coordinator for the council's 10 elected members, stressed that it was never the intention to provoke a veto and therefore the resolution focused on the humanitarian crisis and the urgent need for unimpeded access to deliver aid.",
      "\u201cStarving civilians and inflicting immense suffering is inhumane and against international law,\u201d he told the council after the vote. \u201cNo war objective can justify such action. We had hoped and expected that this was our shared understanding.\u201d",
      "Palestinian U.N. Ambassador Riyad Mansour said Palestinians are now urging governments to take \u201creal measures\u201d to pressure Israel to get out of Gaza before it implements what he called an Israeli plan \u201cto destroy our people.\"",
      "And in the coming days, he said, the Palestinians will head to the 193-member General Assembly, where there are no vetoes, with a similar humanitarian-focused resolution. Unlike in the Security Council, assembly resolutions are not legally binding, though they are seen as a barometer of world opinion.",
      "The U.S. vetoed the last Security Council resolution on Gaza in November, under the Biden administration, also because the ceasefire demand was not directly linked to the release of all hostages. Similarly, the current resolution demands those taken by Hamas and other groups be released, but it does not make it a condition for a truce.",
      "President Donald Trump's administration has tried to ramp up its efforts to broker peace in Gaza after 20 months of war. However, Hamas has sought amendments to a U.S. proposal that special envoy Steve Witkoff has called \u201ctotally unacceptable.\u201d",
      "The vote followed a decision by an Israeli and U.S.-backed foundation to pause food delivery in Gaza after health officials said dozens of Palestinians were killed in a series of shootings this week. Israel and the United States say the new system was designed to prevent Hamas from stealing aid previously distributed by the U.N.",
      "The United Nations has rejected the new system. The U.N. says its distribution system worked very well during the March ceasefire and is carefully monitored.",
      "Gaza is almost completely reliant on international aid because Israel\u2019s offensive has destroyed nearly all food production capabilities. Israel imposed a blockade on supplies into Gaza on March 2, and limited aid began to enter again late last month after pressure from allies and warnings of famine.",
      "The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and abducting 251. They are still holding 58 hostages, a third of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.",
      "Israel\u2019s military campaign has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which doesn\u2019t say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants.",
      "The ministry is led by medical professionals but reports to the Hamas-run government. Its toll is seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts, though Israel has challenged its numbers.",

      "\u201cUnder federal law, schools cannot provide benefits to illegal aliens that they do not provide to U.S. citizens,\u201d said Attorney General Pam Bondi said. \u201cThe Justice Department will relentlessly fight to vindicate federal law and ensure that U.S. citizens are not treated like second-class citizens anywhere in the country.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Even if you're not a regular \"Family Guy\" viewer, you've probably heard the show's iconic theme song. The song is largely the creation of Seth MacFarlane, whose love of animation may only be rivaled by his love for big, jazzy tunes. In fact, he's even got a semi-regular gig at the Vibrato Grill Jazz Club in Bel Air, Calif., singing songs from the Great American Songbook.",
      "But one thing he doesn't seem to love, considering he's lived his life in the public eye, is a certain kind of attention. He says sometimes getting in front of a crowd (or even our \"Sunday Morning\" cameras) doesn't quite come naturally.",
      "He is, he admits, an introvert. \"Oh, hell yeah. Yeah. I don't even wanna be here!\" he said.",
      "In fact, he says he sometimes has to resort to liquid courage. \"I think I had like four scotches before I walked out on stage at the Oscars,\" he said, referring to his hosting gig in 2013. \"I do get, yeah, I definitely get nervous.\"",
      "You might know MacFarlane as the voice of Peter, Brian Griffin and Stewie on the show \"Family Guy\" that he created more than two decades ago. In 1999, MacFarlane became the youngest showrunner in Hollywood history. And less than a decade later, with three network shows on the air, he became Hollywood's highest-paid writer-producer.",
      "But back in college, MacFarlane's first love was singing. \"My sister, at the time, was going to the Boston Conservatory of Music for musical theater,\" he said. \"She has a beautiful singing voice. And I had got it into my head that I was going to maybe go to grad school for musical theater as well. So, I applied and got in. And I was all set to go to their grad program. And I got this offer from Hanna-Barbera to come do an animated short for a series that they were developing. And so, I just had to take it, moved out to California. But there was an instant there where I could have kind of diverged into a completely different career and never, you know, never even thought about something called 'Family Guy.'\"",
      "MacFarlane loved film scores as a college student and to this day he uses a live orchestra to score his TV shows.\u00a0 \"It's the one part that I don't really understand, even to this day,\" he said. \"There's still something mysterious about how a composer sits down to write, and then a couple weeks later walks in front of an orchestra, plops down these charts, and they all play it. And you hear this insane, magical sound. That still eludes me.\"",
      "Frank Sinatra Jr, and Stewie and Brian (Seth MacFarlane), perform \"At Frank Sinatra's Restaurant (Jr.)\" from \"Family Guy\":",
      "For his latest album, \"Lush Life: The Lost Sinatra Arrangements\" (out this week), MacFarlane and Joel McNeely (his composer for \"American Dad!\" and \"The Orville\") combed through the Sinatra Family archives for songs that had been arranged for Sinatra but never fully recorded. For McNeely, the process was almost like speaking to the ghosts of the greatest arrangers in popular music, the men who helped make Sinatra's voice shine.",
      "McNeely showed an arrangement by Nelson Riddle: \"This was the first one we read when we had a sight-reading session at Fox. We got an orchestra together just to see what was there, you know, because there was nothing to reference. But all this time later, these little black pencil dots on paper, there's his voice brought back to life. I mean, it was chilling.\"",
      "So, what exactly does an arranger do? \"Frank Sinatra, there's a recording of him saying that the arrangers could be in a sense a recording secretary, taking the vision of the artist and interpreting it into this,\" McNeely said.",
      "MacFarlane said, \"You take a song like 'Fly Me to the Moon,' for example, which I think was originally a ballad. [Here], it's the same song, but it's a completely different animal.\"",
      "McNeely says MacFarlane is preserving the essential legacy of the American Songbook through his recordings and the music of the TV show \"Family Guy.\" But what about the legacy of \"Family Guy\"? MacFarlane has some thoughts: \"When I started the show \u2013 this is the conversation that, like, tortures me at night! \u2013 when I started the show, my attitude was, it doesn't matter, none of it matters. It's like, It's funny? Let's do it.",
      "\"And the older I've gotten, I look back at shows that we've done, and I'm like, Gosh, I guess it's a little more complicated than that, isn't it? Comedy and jokes do have an impact. I have to figure out a way to maintain what the show is, and maintain the thing that people love. But at the same time, recognize that, like, all right, I am analyzing it now in a different way than I did when I was younger.\"",
      "If it's true that you're nobody 'till somebody loves you, then thanks to \"Family Guy\"'s legion of fans, Seth MacFarlane, it turns out, is a very big somebody indeed.",
      "Seth MacFarlane performs \"Give Me the Simple Life,\" from his album \"Lush Life: The Lost Sinatra Arrangements\":",
      "CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated that Joel McNeely was the composer and arranger for \"Family Guy.\" He was in fact the composer for two other Seth MacFarlane series, \"American Dad!\" and \"The Orville.\"",

      "McDonald received the nomination for her portrayal of Mama Rose in the latest Broadway revival of \"Gypsy.\" If she wins this Sunday, she'll make history as the performer with the most Tonys ever.",
      "Before she discovered the stage, McDonald described herself as a hyperactive kid who would express her emotions frequently.",

      "Those emotions are on full display as Mama Rose, a character based on the real-life mother of famed burlesque entertainer Gypsy Rose Lee. It is currently being shown at the Majestic Theatre. In the musical, Mama Rose is an intense stage mom.",

So then that was my first sort, like, emotional dive into Rose.\"",
      "McDonald is the first Black woman to portray Mama Rose on Broadway. Director George C. Wolfe guided her interpretation of what Rose would be experiencing in the 1920s and 30s, with not one word of the original script changed.",
      "\"George talks a lot about Rose's obsession with the kids becoming stars is because being a star protects you in some way. You got star money, you could eat. You got star money, maybe you won't be lynched,\" McDonald explained. \"And so she as a single woman at this time, abandoned three times by her husbands, abandoned by her mother, not really treated all that well by her father, she's tryin' to protect these babies.\"",

      "\"One thing that a lotta singers do is humming. Just like (humming), you're doing things like that just to sort of and people do that, whether you're singing or not. It's good just to sort of make sure that everything's sort of moving and healthy. And you know, to do it eight times a week,\" she said.",
      "Inspiring the next generation",

You know what I mean? 'Cause I can't, you know, as I see how dirty my closet is, and the fact that I have not done laundry in four weeks.\"",

      "Walt Disney Co. is laying off hundreds of employees as part of a cost-cutting measure, CBS News has confirmed.",
      "\"As our industry transforms at a rapid pace, we continue to evaluate ways to efficiently manage our businesses while fueling the state-of-the-art creativity and innovation that consumers value\u202fand expect from Disney,\" a spokesperson said in an email to CBS News on Monday. \"As\u202fpart of this ongoing work,\u202fwe have identified opportunities to operate more efficiently and are eliminating a limited number of positions today.\"",
      "Disney did not confirm the exact number of employees being dismissed, but indicated the cuts will be across several of the entertainment giant's units, including film and television marketing; TV publicity; casting and development; and corporate financial operations.",
      "\"We have been surgical in our approach to minimize the number of impacted employees,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "This most recent round of layoffs follows cuts in March, when Disney let go 200 employees across ABC and its entertainment TV networks, according to Bloomberg News. The Burbank, California, company eliminated an even larger share of employees in April 2023, when it cut 7,000 positions as it underwent a \"significant transformation,\" CEO Bob Iger said at the time.",
      "Disney owns a bevy of companies across entertainment and media, including ESPN, ABC Entertainment, ABC News, Marvel, Disney+ and Hulu.",
      "Disney shares were down 0.4% Monday afternoon following the layoff announcement.",
      "The downsizing comes less than a month after the company\u00a0reported $23.6 billion in revenue in Q2, a 7% increase from the same period the year prior.",
      "\"Overall, we remain optimistic about the direction of the company and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year,\" Igor said in a statement following\u00a0the earnings report.",

    "story": [
      "Philadelphia's mayor honored actor and producer Quinta Brunson with a key to the city Wednesday in a ceremony dedicating a separate mural at Brunson's alma mater, which inspired her show\u00a0Abbott Elementary.",
      "The producer, writer and comedian gazed at the shiny key handed to her by Mayor Cherelle Parker and quipped: \"Wow! I want to ask the question on everybody's mind: What does it open?\"",
      "Brunson used the ceremony held at Andrew Hamilton School to celebrate the power of public education, public schoolteachers and music and arts education. Her parents and siblings were in attendance, along with Joyce Abbott, the teacher who inspired the name of the show's fictional school, the \"real life Gregory\" and other teachers and classmates.",
      "The mural, titled Blooming Features, was created by artist Athena Scott with input from Brunson and Hamilton students and staff. Its brightly colored depictions of real people from the school wrap around the outside of the school's red brick facade.",
      "Brunson described taking inspiration from the murals painted along her subway route as a kid, especially when she saw one of her own teachers featured. She said she hopes this mural has the same effect.",
      "The actor said she nixed an initial mock-up brought to her by ABC that featured actors from the Emmy Award-winning show in favor of actual community members \u2014 because \"that's how you know there is a future.\"",
      "\"You don't need to see famous people on the wall. You need to see you on the wall,\" she said. \"Painted, beautiful. We are beautiful. It makes a difference. It made a difference for me, so I know even if it makes a difference for just one child, that one child matters.\"",
      "Jane Golden, executive director of Mural Arts Philadelphia, said she was thrilled when Brunson featured her organization on an episode of the show. Philadelphia is ranked No. 1 in the nation for its murals.",
      "\"When people visit Philadelphia, they are struck by the works of art that grace the sides of buildings in every single neighborhood of the city,\" she said. \"For us, this is a matter of equity. It's great to have world class galleries and museums \u2014 that's wonderful \u2014 but the fact that everyone everywhere can walk out the door and see large-scale works of public art that represent them, like the school here, that is awesome.\"",

      "Thunberg, who became an internationally famous climate activist after organizing massive teen protests in her native Sweden, had been due to board a previous Freedom Flotilla ship last month.",
      "That attempt to reach Gaza by sea, in early May, failed after another of the group's vessels, the \"Conscience,\" was attacked by two alleged drones while sailing in international waters off the coast of Malta.",
      "The group blamed Israel for the attack, which damaged the front section of the ship, in the latest confrontation over efforts to send assistance to the Palestinian territory devastated by nearly 19 months of war.",
      "The Israeli government says the blockade is an attempt to pressure Hamas to release hostages it took during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the conflict. Hamas-led militants assaulted southern Israel that day, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Hamas is still holding 58 hostages, 23 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "In response, Israel launched an offensive that has killed over 52,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians. Israel's bombardment and ground operations have destroyed vast areas of the territory and left most of its population homeless.",
      "The Flotilla group was only the latest among a growing number of critics to accuse Israel of genocidal acts in its war in Gaza. Israel vehemently denies the allegations, saying its war is directed at Hamas militants, not Gaza's civilians.",

    "summary": "Former President Bill Clinton and author James Patterson have teamed up for their third book, a thriller: \"The First Gentleman,\" in which the commander-in-chief is a woman \u2013 and her husband stands accused of murder.",
    "story": [
      "Seems that there is always a lot going on behind the walls of the White House where truth can often be stranger than fiction. But fiction can be pretty compelling, too. In the new novel \"The First Gentleman\" (to be published June 2 by Little, Brown & Co.), the commander in chief is a woman, and her husband is accused of murder. It's the third collaboration from best-selling author James Patterson and his co-writer, President Bill Clinton.",
      "Was there a scenario in the book that Patterson couldn't have written without Clinton's help? \"Oh, I couldn't have done any of it without him,\" Patterson said. \"I would have been lost. But the other thing, you know, look, I mean, he's the expert on the first gentleman. You know, he was almost a first gentleman!\"",
      "\"Yeah, I thought about it for years. And it's the only political job I ever wanted and I didn't get!\" Clinton smiled. \"'Cause I really thought Hillary should be president.\"",
      "Clinton would have been the very first first gentleman had his wife, Hillary, won the 2016 election. And he says back then he did a lot of thinking about what his role would be as a presidential spouse: \"How could I do this job in a way that I would be on-call to help if she needed me, but I wouldn't get in the way?\"",
      "\"That's the way I feel about this relationship: How can I help without getting in the way?\" Patterson said. \"I'm kind of the first gentleman of our [relationship]!\"",
      "\"If you believe that, I got some land in Arizona I want to show you!\" Clinton laughed.",
      "And sometimes, their made-up White House looks almost like real life. In the book, the president keeps working through an agonizing personal crisis. During his 1999 impeachment proceedings, President Clinton kept working, too, with some of the very people who were trying to kick him out of the White House. \"And they were amazed by it,\" he said. \"They'd come and do business with me, [and] as far as they knew, I couldn't remember what was going on. And we would try to hammer out deals.\" In the midst of impeachment? \"Because that's what I got hired to do,\" Clinton said. \"The American people don't pay you to have personal feelings. They pay you to deliver for them.\"",
      "Clinton and Patterson have been delivering since 2018, with their first book about a president gone missing, and in 2021 their second about the president's daughter getting kidnapped. Both were bestsellers. But for them, it's really not all about work.",
      "Asked how their relationship has evolved over their three books together, Clinton replied, \"We've played a lot more golf.\"",
      "Patterson said, \"He's been president more times, but I have more holes-in-one.\"",
      "\"Oh God. Well, I have one; he has nine,\" said Clinton. \"How many Americans have nine holes-in-one?\"",
      "\"I know. That's sick,\" Patterson said. \"Remember I'm a fiction writer.\"",
      "\"Makes the craziness stop for a little while\"",
      "I asked, \"There's so much political drama in the world today, real-life political drama. Do you think that there's an appetite for political thrillers, for fictional political thrillers?\"",
      "Patterson said, \"I think so, 100%. I mean, one of the nice things here is you escape, but you don't totally escape reality. It's like, 'Yeah, I love this. I can't put it down.' Or 'I keep reading,' or in some cases to me what's even better, which is you don't want it to end.",
      "\"I think it's useful, and 'cause so many people are wandering around, they go, 'Oh my God, oh my God, please make it stop'? This makes it stop for a little while, makes the craziness stop for a little while for people.\"",
      "Clinton said, \"One reason I hope there's an appetite is\u2026 I hope that people will still believe in our democratic system enough to stick with it and keep pushing to make it work.\"",
      "During the summer, Patterson lives at his home on the Hudson River; the president is about five miles away.",
      "Asked what they may have learned about each other during the writing process, Patterson offered, \"the notion \u2026 of not worrying about stuff that we can't do anything about. And if we can do something about it, try to do it.\"",
      "Their new book comes out tomorrow and they hope it's another bestseller. But if you spend any time at all with Patterson and Clinton, you get the sense that their partnership is about something money can't buy.",
      "I asked, \"Back when you wrote your first book together, The New York Times said that the two of you 'complete each other in the Jerry Maguire sense.'\"",
      "\"Well, we kinda do,\" Patterson said. \"This has been driving me for months now, which is: my time here is short. What can I do most beautifully? And in this case, doing another book with my friend is a beautiful thing to do.\"",

      "President Wright AdministrationYear Three: September",
      "1Brentwood, New Hampshire",
      "Cole Wright is sitting in the rear seat of a black up-armored Chevy Suburban, one of three in a convoy speeding its way down Route 125 in the Seacoast Region of New Hampshire.",
      "Two dark green state police cruisers, lights flashing, are leading this no-frills motorcade, scaled down for the occasion. The presidential limousine \u2014 the Beast \u2014 is back at the airport, along with the Secret Service counterassault team, support personnel, news media vans, and a fully equipped ambulance.",
      "Three years after the election, Cole still gets pumped from seeing traffic part like magic, even though he's well aware that it's for the convenience and safety of the woman sitting beside him \u2014 his wife, Madeline Parson Wright, the president of the United States.",
      "He's just the First Gentleman.",
      "A light drizzle spatters against the bulletproof windows. The agent accelerates to seventy along the two-lane highway.",
      "\"Two minutes out,\" says Burton Pearce, the president's chief of staff. Pearce perches in a rear-facing jump seat across from the First Couple. He's pale and serious, wearing one of his many identical gray suits. \"The Gray Ghost,\" staffers call him. The president nods without looking up.",
      "Cole glances over to see the CONFIDENTIAL stamps on the pages Maddy is reading as the convoy hums along. He knows those pages represent the biggest political gamble of her administration \u2014 of any administration. She should be in the Oval Office working the phones and twisting arms, but instead she's here with him. A powerful personal show of support.",
      "Maddy puts her briefing packet aside. Cole takes her hand and squeezes it.",
      "She squeezes back. \"Don't worry,\" she says. \"After all we've been through together, we can get through this too.\"",
      "The Suburban slows down to make a hard turn behind the police escort. Now the convoy is moving at just forty miles per hour. On both sides of the route, locals hold up crude hand-painted placards.",
      "WE BELIEVE IN YOU, COLE!",
      "STAY STRONG, COLE!",
      "KEEP MOVING, COLE!",
      "He looks out through the tinted side window. Almost game time. He can feel his muscles twitching, his focus narrowing, just like in his days as a tight end for New England \u2014 before the blown knee forced him out. He remembers how the tension in the Patriots locker room would build and build almost to the breaking point until the team ran out into the light, and when the cheers of the crowd washed over him, he'd think, Yeah, we're okay. We've got this.",
      "But today?",
      "Today he's not so sure.",
      "The redbrick facade of the Rockingham County courthouse comes into view. The road is lined with police barricades holding back hundreds \u2014 maybe thousands \u2014 of onlookers. Up here, some of the signs have a different tone.",
      "SCUM!",
      "MONSTER!",
      "JUSTICE FOR SUZANNE!",
      "\"Don't worry about these people,\" says Maddy. \"They don't know what they're talking about.\"",
      "\"I don't care about the people on the road,\" says Cole. \"I'm worried about the twelve people waiting for me inside.\"",
      "As the Suburban slows to a crawl, two women jump out in front and unspool a long banner.",
      "CONVICT COLE WRIGHT! SEND HIM STRAIGHT TO HELL!",
      "Thanks for the kind wishes, Cole thinks.",
      "2",
      "A thousand demonstrators, media people, and curious locals are crowded into the rain-slick parking lot. The convoy is passing through the tall evergreens flanking the pavement leading up to the courthouse when I realize I left my umbrella in my car. Too late.",
      "Rockingham County has never drawn security like this. Uniforms representing every law enforcement department in New Hampshire \u2014 from local cops to Fish and Game \u2014 are patrolling the courthouse steps. On the roof there's a detail of men and women in tactical gear and black baseball caps carrying sniper rifles. They're not even trying to hide. That's the job of their colleagues, posted in places nobody can see.",
      "I hear someone calling my name: \"Brea Cooke? That you?\"",
      "I look at the crowd. Mostly white. No surprise; the Granite State is around 89 percent Caucasian. It's a situation I got used to as a Black student at Dartmouth, about two hours north. Let's just say it's not unusual for me to stand out around here.",
      "I turn around. \"Ron Reynolds!\"",
      "Ron is a friendly face from the old days when he and my partner, Garrett Wilson, both reported for the Boston Globe. He's wearing his standard outfit \u2014 tan overcoat, khaki pants, and a tweed cap. His big press pass is dangling around his neck.",
      "I give him a quick hug. \"Guess we both forgot our umbrellas.\"",
      "A guy in a thick camo jacket jostles by us and flicks a finger at Ron's press pass. \"Fake news!\" the guy shouts. Ron ignores him.",
      "\"So why are you here?\" I ask. \"You could be in one of those gyms right now, dry and toasty. Probably getting a better view than this.\"",
      "\"I get paid to get wet,\" says Ron. \"Even if nothing happens.\"",
      "But something is happening. I've been waiting for this day a long time. I see flashing lights coming up the drive. Two state police cars and three big black SUVs.",
      "\"It's them!\"",
      "The lights are getting closer. I'm in the middle of the crowd, but suddenly I feel as alone as I've ever felt in my life.",
      "I close my eyes for a second. My mind whispers, Garrett.",
      "I blink hard. Not now! I need to focus. Capture this scene for my book. Our book. The one Garrett and I were working on together. Until he ...",
      "Ron points to the courthouse steps. \"See the podium and the camera stands up there?\"",
      "I nod. \"What about them?\"",
      "\"All for show. No way the Secret Service allows the president and First Gent to go through the front entrance.\"",
      "\"The crowd won't appreciate being tricked like that.\"",
      "\"You're right,\" says Ron. \"They came to witness history.\"",
      "So did I.",
      "The first time in history that a president's spouse is going on trial for murder.",
      "3",
      "The convoy crawls toward the entrance as cops push the crowds back. Inside the six-ton Suburban in the middle, Cole rubs his hands together nervously. Pearce leans forward in his jump seat and says, \"The county sheriffs, state troopers, and Secret Service have carved out a path so we can go around to the rear of the courthouse. By the time the crowd and the press catch on, we'll be inside and out of sight.\"",
      "Hidden away, Cole thinks. \"No,\" he says quietly. \"That's not going to happen.\"",
      "Pearce blinks. \"Excuse me?\"",
      "\"I said no. Going in through the rear of the courthouse signals that I'm guilty, that I have something to hide. Screw that. I'm going to run the ball straight through the line of scrimmage.\"",
      "The Suburban moves toward the driveway turnoff. Pearce is getting testy. \"Cole, plans have been in place for days. Best to arrive via the rear from both a safety and PR viewpoint.\"",

    "story": [
      "Patti LuPone\u00a0has issued an apology after hundreds of Broadway performers spoke out against the three-time Tony Awards winner over what they say is a pattern of \"inappropriate and unacceptable public comments,\" specifically against Broadway star Kecia Lewis, in an open letter.",
      "\"For as long as I have worked in the theatre, I have spoken my mind and never apologized. That is changing today.\" LuPone said in her apology posted Saturday on social media.",
      "Lupone issued the apology in response to a\u00a0letter, dated May 30\u00a0 and addressed to the American Theatre Wing, the national trade association for the Broadway theatre industry, calling on decision makers to \"hold people accountable for violent, disrespectful, or harmful behavior.\" More than 500 Broadway performers \u2014 including\u00a0James Monroe Iglehart, Kalen Allen and\u00a0Tatianna C\u00f3rdoba \u2014 signed the open letter, which was first published in\u00a0Playbill.",
      "It comes after the New Yorker published an interview last week with 76-year-old LuPone, a White performer, in which she said of Lewis, who is a Black actress said: \"Don't call yourself a vet, bitch,\" apparently referring to Lewis' November 2024 video\u00a0posted to her Instagram\u00a0in which she spoke about LuPone's behavior.",
      "\"This language is not only degrading and misogynistic-it is a blatant act of racialized disrespect. It constitutes bullying. It constitutes harassment. It is emblematic of the microaggressions and abuse that people in this industry have endured for far too long, too often without consequence,\" said the open letter.",
      "LuPone's issue with Lewis appeared to have began last fall when she starred in\u00a0\"The Roommate,\" a two-woman show with Mia Farrow\u00a0that was next door to\u00a0\"Hell's Kitchen,\"\u00a0a musical inspired by Alicia Key's life and music in which Lewis performed and won Tony for Best Featured Actress in a Musical.",
      "According to Lewis' video, LuPone had made complaints about the noise from the musical, which led to changes to the sound design that \"negatively impacted\" the show and its performers. Lewis also brought up a video of LuPone refusing to sign a fan's \"Hell's Kitchen\" playbill because the musical is \"too loud.\"",
      "\"I wanted to address this because, Ms. LuPone, these actions, in my opinion, are bullying,\" Lewis said in the video. \"They're offensive, they are racially microaggressive, they're rude, they're rooted in privilege. And these actions also lack a sense of community and leadership for someone as yourself, who has been in the business as long as you have.\"",
      "Lewis then asked LuPone, from one Broadway veteran to another, to apologize.",
      "When asked, LuPone addressed the situation in the New Yorker article, saying, \"This is not unusual on Broadway. This happens all the time when walls are shared.\"",
      "\"She calls herself a veteran? Let's find out how many Broadway shows Kecia Lewis has done, because she doesn't know what the f--- she's talking about,\" LuPone told the New Yorker.",
      "CBS News has reached out to LuPone and Lewis for comment.",
      "When the New Yorker asked about Audra McDonald, who appeared to support Lewis' video, LuPone said: \"That's typical of Audra. She's not a friend.\" She added that the two had issues in the past, but didn't go into details.",
      "In her apology on Saturday, LuPone said she regrets her \"flippant and emotional responses during this interview, which were inappropriate, and I am devastated that my behavior has offended others and has run counter to what we hold dear in this community.\"",
      "\"I hope to have the chance to speak to Audra and Kecia personally to offer my sincere apologies,\" LuPone added. \"I wholeheartedly agree with everything that was written in the open letter shared yesterday. From middle school drama clubs to professional stages, theatre has always been about lifting each other up and welcoming those who feel they don't belong anywhere else. I made a mistake, I take full responsibility for it, and I am committed to making this right. Our entire theatre community deserves better.\"",
      "McDonald, the most nominated and awarded performer in Tony Award history, told CBS News' Gayle King in an interview set to air Tuesday on\u00a0\"CBS Mornings\" that she had not seen LuPone in 11 years.",
      "\"If there's a rift between us, I don't know what it is. That's something you'd have to ask Patti about,\" McDonald said.",
      "Next week on June 8, the Tony Awards are set to broadcast on CBS and stream on Paramount+. McDonald could add snatch her seventh Tony win thanks to the revival of \"Gypsy.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Jun 2025 11:00:43 -0400",
    "summary": "The norovirus strain GII.17 may have disrupted the seasonal pattern of outbreaks.",
    "story": [
      "After years of largely predictable norovirus waves, the emergence of a new strain might have disrupted the seasonal pattern of outbreaks from this notorious stomach bug, suggests a new report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In previous years, the U.S. usually saw norovirus outbreaks increase around December. That marked the start of the season for the virus. But last year's season started in October, as a new norovirus strain called GII.17 drove a record wave of outbreaks.",
      "\"Continued surveillance is needed to determine if this genotype remains the dominant genotype, as well as whether the norovirus season continues to start earlier than previous years,\" wrote two of the CDC's top norovirus researchers, in an article published this month by the agency's Emerging Infectious Diseases journal.",
      "Outbreaks have since slowed to usual levels. But with GII.17 now identified in more than 3 in 4 outbreaks in the U.S., its displacement of the GII.4 strain that had previously been dominant is raising questions about whether norovirus season could arrive early again.",
      "\"GII.4 viruses are the main driver for norovirus seasonality. With the decrease of GII.4 outbreaks since 2024, whether GII.17 viruses will continue to cause an earlier onset of the norovirus season cannot yet be determined,\" the CDC researchers wrote.",
      "Several other countries also saw unusually large or shifted waves of norovirus this past year, after GII.17 surged to dominance.",
      "In England, norovirus reports reached levels more than double recent seasons. GII.17 was the most frequently reported genotype of norovirus through April, far above GII.4.",
      "In Japan, where GII.17 previously drove a wave of infections a decade ago, local health authorities in Tokyo reported a steep wave of infectious gastroenteritis \u2014 most from norovirus \u2014 that peaked weeks later than previous seasons and remains above recent years.",
      "Miranda de Graaf, a scientist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands coordinating the global NoroNet network of norovirus researchers, said the Dutch nation did not see an earlier start to its norovirus season. But the country did see higher numbers of norovirus outbreaks, including a few large outbreaks in between when the usual seasonal surges occurred.",
      "GII.4 was still being detected around the world, meaning it was possible that GII.17's dominance could be short-lived, de Graaf said. Researchers had previously wondered if GII.17 could permanently take over, only to see GII.4 cases continue to remain dominant.",
      "\"GII.17 only replaced GII.4 last year, and there has not been another seasonal peak after that. Therefore it is not clear if these shifts will last, or if GII.17 will be the predominant strain next winter season,\" de Graaf said in an email.",
      "A CDC spokesperson said the agency is monitoring norovirus outbreaks through its CaliciNet laboratory\u00a0database\u00a0and pointed to a surge of GII.17 strains in Asia and Europe in 2014 that was followed by no reports of a change to seasonality.",
      "They also cautioned that there was no clear evidence to prove that GII.17's emergence was the cause of a change to the norovirus season last year.",
      "\"There are currently insufficient historic data to predict whether norovirus GII.17 will remain the dominant genotype and lead to an earlier onset of the norovirus season later this year,\" the spokesperson said in an email.",
      "Benjamin Lopman, an epidemiology professor at Emory University who previously worked for the CDC's viral diseases division, said shifts in norovirus strains happen \"when new variants find ways around the immunity that people have built up\" to previous strains. He said that new strains usually trigger more frequent outbreaks earlier in the season.",
      "\"I expect we'll see outbreak patterns return to more typical levels and seasonal patterns in the coming years, though it's always challenging to predict how these viruses will behave,\" Lopman said in an email.",

Kennedy Jr. to force an update to the agency's guidance.",

      "Panagiotakopoulos had served as one of the leads of this ACIP work group. She sent an email to members of the group early Tuesday morning to say she was resigning, multiple people who received the email confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Reuters first reported news of her resignation. Panagiotakopoulos and a CDC spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The process to update the CDC's influential vaccine recommendations is closely watched by experts because they are tied to federal policies and programs, including liability protections, vaccines for uninsured children and requirements for insurance coverage.",
      "The committee had been set to vote on updated recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines at a meeting later this month, before Kennedy usurped the process to impose his own changes to the guidance.",
      "Earlier this year, members of the work group had signaled they were already leaning toward narrowing the guidance to soften the recommendation for children with no underlying conditions to get vaccinated, in line with how Kennedy's order was ultimately implemented.",
      "But Kennedy's directive also broke with the committee by ordering the agency to exclude pregnant women from its COVID-19 vaccine recommendations. Pregnant women had been one of the groups that experts had worried were at higher risk of severe COVID-19 and warranted continued recommendations to get vaccinated.",

      "Jacobs watched her mom progress; one day Lee fell and hit her head. Because of the FTD, her brain couldn't take the swelling and she died at 62, leaving devastation and frustration.",
      "\"I had that understanding level while she was alive, this is not her, she is not doing this to me, this is happening because this disease is causing this symptom,\" Jacobs said.",

      "In a busy laboratory on the other side of the country, Clelland received an email.",
      "\"I get contacted from patients, particularly gene carriers from around the world, but I remember just replying that I would try to help in the best way that I could,\" she said.",

      "\"And if you look at new therapies that make it through the pipeline and actually get to patients, often, they have patient supporters and champions that don't give up even when the work gets really hard,\" Clelland said.",

From her frustration, to her grief, to that inmate's letter, she laid out her story for the world to see, giving her even more opportunity for revelations like the one she had in February inside a University of Minnesota research lab.",
      "It's there she saw a mouse with the frontal temporal dementia mutation she has. That mouse is a symbol of hope. It's part of promising research at the University of Minnesota.",
      "\"Linde sent me an email, she's actually the first FTD patient I've ever met,\" said Dr. Michael Koob, who is leading a team of researchers.",

      "After years, Jacobs finally found the inmate who had sent her the initial letter about her mom. She messaged her on Facebook, and the two set up a time to meet.",
      "When Jacobs met Angela Olson, the tears welled.",
      "\"I have no idea what the Lord is doing. I think it's amazing that he brought our lives together. I never realized, even writing that letter, what it was doing, right? I just knew that your mom was a really great person and needed help,\" said Olson.",
      "As they marveled at the letter, they marveled at the moment.",
      "\"I think there's so many times in life that, like, people are brought into our lives, right, for a poor purpose, right, and a bigger purpose,\" said Jacobs.",
      "\"Yeah, she's actually the beginning of my journey with sobriety,\" said Olson.",
      "Olson knew the ropes when it came to jail; she was 20 years into her addiction.",
      "\"Never, all these years, my whole life, I never understood how to have, actually, emotions. It's like I was rejected in my life, betrayed by people, but yet understand how to have love or emotion, and just was so suppressed. And so then I ended up coming to Teen Challenge,\" Olson said.",
      "Now she's seven years sober and thriving as a manager at Minnesota Adult and Teen Challenge Recovery program. She spends her days sharing her story.",
      "Olson recalled that Lee \"just kept repeating herself.\" As a nurse herself, she had some experience with dementia.",

    "summary": "\"This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" one scientist said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has moved to end funding for a broad swath of HIV vaccine research, saying current approaches are enough to counter the virus, multiple scientists and federal health officials say.",
      "Notifications that the funding would not be extended were relayed Friday to researchers, who were told by National Institutes of Health officials that the Department of Health and Human Services had elected \"to go with currently available approaches to eliminate HIV\" instead.",
      "The cuts will shutter two major HIV vaccine research efforts that were first funded by the NIH in 2012 at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute and the Scripps Research Institute, multiple scientists said. A spokesperson for Moderna said the vaccine manufacturer's clinical trials through the NIH's HIV Vaccine Trials Network have also been put on pause.",
      "One senior NIH official said the HHS had also instructed the agency not to issue any more funding in the next fiscal year for HIV vaccine research, with only a small handful of exceptions.",
      "A budgetary rule change specifically targeted at HIV vaccine research is also expected to lead to another cut to the NIH's awards for studies initiated by scientists, an official said.",
      "The change, to be finalized shortly, inflates the accounting for the upfront cost of studies into HIV vaccines funded by the agency. Instead of the cost of a five-year grant being spread out over five years, the NIH plans to make HIV vaccine dollars from multi-year grants all count toward a single year, the official said, making it harder for them to get funded.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS told CBS News that \"complex and duplicative health programs have resulted in serious duplication of efforts,\" saying that \"27 separate programs that address HIV/AIDS\" had spent $7.5 billion.",
      "\"The Administration believes the United States should have the best medical research in the world. To that end, we are advancing policies to maximize the impact of every federal taxpayer dollar and ensure proper oversight of this funding,\" HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said.",
      "Hilliard claimed \"critical HIV/AIDS programs will continue\" under the new agency that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed creating, dubbed the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "\"For HIV vaccine design and development, we've begun to see light at the end of the tunnel after many years of research. This is a terrible time to cut it off. We're beginning to get close. We're getting good results out of clinical trials,\" said Dennis Burton, an immunology professor at Scripps Research.",
      "Burton warned that their HIV vaccine research could not simply be turned back on, even if a future administration decided to change course on HIV funding. He said ongoing experiments would be shuttered, and researchers assembled to study the issue would be forced to refocus their careers on other topics.",
      "\"This is a decision with consequences that will linger. This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" Burton said.",
      "The cancellation of the funds comes weeks ahead of the Food and Drug Administration's June 19 deadline for deciding on approval of lenacapavir, a twice-yearly injectable drug to prevent HIV.",
      "The drug, which is being brought to the commercial market by drugmaker Gilead Sciences, builds on NIH-backed research into earlier HIV medications. The drug's availability could lead to a significant drop in HIV cases worldwide, since a study found it was 100% effective in preventing transmission.",
      "An NIH official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, rebuked the claim that the effectiveness of current HIV prevention strategies meant a vaccine was no longer needed. \"The only way of ending the HIV epidemic in the U.S. and AIDS pandemic worldwide\" is with a vaccine, they said.",
      "Developing an effective HIV vaccine has been an elusive target for researchers, though scientists have hailed recent breakthroughs in the field.",
      "\"HIV has established roadblocks to us fighting it off, which are unparalleled in vaccinology. We've had to learn what each of the roadblocks are and to devise ways to overcome it. This virus mutates so quickly,\" said Duke professor of medicine Dr. Barton Ford Haynes, who is part of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute.",
      "Haynes said their work was essentially combining multiple different vaccines as part of their approach to designing an effective HIV vaccine.",
      "He praised lenacapavir as a \"wonderful development for the field,\" but said there was still a need for a vaccine. Lenacapavir requires injections every six months to remain effective, a challenging proposition even before steep cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's domestic HIV programs and U.S.-backed HIV/AIDS foreign aid programs.",
      "\"The hope was that adding an HIV vaccine to all the preventive measures that we have would finally allow us to end the pandemic,\" Haynes said.",

Kennedy Jr. that the agency would stop recommending COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and healthy pregnant women.",
      "\"Where the parent presents with a desire for their child to be vaccinated, children 6 months and older may receive COVID-19 vaccination, informed by the clinical judgment of a healthcare provider and personal preference and circumstances,\" the CDC says in its new guidance.",
      "Thursday's change to what the CDC calls \"shared clinical decision-making\" recommendations for children means that health insurance companies will continue to be required to broadly cover the shots for now in this age group.",
      "The agency still broadly recommends COVID-19 vaccines for moderately or severely immunocompromised children, in addition to most\u00a0adults\u00a0for now. COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy are now listed as \"No Guidance/Not Applicable,\" where they were previously recommended for all pregnant adults.",

      "\"Studies including hundreds of thousands of people around the world show that COVID-19 vaccination before and during pregnancy is safe, effective, and beneficial to both the pregnant woman and the baby. The benefits of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine outweigh any potential risks of vaccination during pregnancy,\" one CDC webpage still reads.",
      "Health authorities and experts closely watch changes to the CDC's recommendations, usually updated through open meetings of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, since they are tied to policies like liability protections and insurance coverage requirements.",
      "The CDC also deleted a statement previously on the childhood immunization schedule that the guidance had been recommended by the committee, approved by the CDC and backed by a number of outside medical groups.",
      "So far, the CDC's changes echo what the committee had already been considering voting on next month: narrowing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations to only older adults and younger ages with risk factors, but still allowing for permissive coverage of others getting vaccinated.",
      "The CDC has used \"shared clinical decision-making\" guidance in the past to allow for federal requirements guaranteeing insurance coverage and access to some vaccines, while stopping short of full-throated recommendations for everyone eligible to get a shot.",
      "At its last meeting in April, the committee had not signaled that they were planning to lift the recommendation for pregnant women to get vaccinated.",

      "\"Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events,\" the agency now says, in an update published Wednesday.",
      "Since the beginning of the year, the CDC has received at least 62 reports of travelers who were contagious with the highly transmissible virus while flying into the U.S. or within the country, a spokesperson for the health agency told CBS News in a statement.",
      "After investigating 50 of those travelers, the CDC was able to determine that measles spread during air travel in at least one of those situations, the spokesperson said. That is usually based on connecting confirmed cases of measles among airline passengers sitting near each other.",
      "There have also been numerous public alerts in recent months about the possible risk of exposure in airports, after travelers were found to be contagious. \"Exposures at the airport itself are more difficult to track, and state, local, and territorial health departments lead these investigations,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In its Wednesday update, the CDC dropped its list of countries now facing \"high incidence\" of measles. Instead, the agency now warns only that the virus is \"an ongoing risk around the world, and more international travelers are getting infected.\"",
      "In addition to this year's record surge of the virus within the U.S., health authorities in neighboring Mexico and Canada have also reported large outbreaks of measles.",
      "The CDC also replaced a previous recommendation that Americans \"consider making alternative travel plans\" if they could not get vaccinated before departing, and now says travelers should \"consider postponing their trip.\"",
      "All travelers are recommended to be fully vaccinated for measles before going to any international destination. The CDC recently updated its guidance to doctors advising additional measles vaccines\u00a0for some domestic travelers as well.",
      "The changes come as the CDC's tally of measles cases has begun to show signs of accelerating again.",
      "At least 1,088 cases of measles have been reported so far this year, the CDC said Friday, with two more states \u2014 Iowa and Nebraska \u2014 now reporting their first confirmed cases. Around 90% of confirmed cases are linked to outbreaks within the U.S., not travel outside the country.",

    "published": "Fri, 30 May 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "As state officials anticipate Medicaid funding cuts that could strip resources for those with disabilities and chronic health conditions, an army of unpaid caregivers waits in the wings: children.",
    "story": [
      "St. Paul, Minn. \u2014 High school senior Joshua Yang understands sacrifice. When he was midway through 10th grade, his mom survived a terrible car crash. But her body developed tremors, and she lost mobility. After countless appointments, doctors diagnosed her with Parkinson's disease, saying it was likely triggered by brain injuries sustained in the wreck.",
      "At 15, Yang, an aspiring baseball player and member of his school's debate team, took on a new role: his mother's caregiver.",
      "Researchers estimate that Yang, now 18, counted among at least 5.4 million U.S. children who provide care to an adult in their home. As state officials eye federal Medicaid funding cuts that could drastically reduce home care services for those who are disabled or have chronic health conditions, many predict that number will rise.",
      "That's bad news for kids: Studies show that when young people take on care for adults with medical conditions, their health and academic outcomes decline. At the same time, their loved ones receive untrained care.",
      "\"It all fell to me,\" said Yang, whose sisters were 9 and 10 at the time of their mom's accident, and whose stepdad worked nights. His grades fell and he quit after-school activities, he said, unable to spare the time.",
      "Early on, Yang found reprieve from a personal care nurse who gave them supplies, such as adult diapers, and advice on items to purchase, such as a chair for the shower. And for about a year, Yang was able to work for a personal care agency and earn $1,000 a month caring for his mom \u2014 money that went toward her medication and family needs.",
      "But at the beginning of 11th grade, a change to his mom's insurance ended her personal care benefit, sending him into a runaround with his county's Medicaid office in Minnesota. \"For a solid month I was on my phone, on hold, in the back of the class, waiting for the 'hello,'\" he said. \"I'd be in third period, saying, 'Mr. Stepan, can I step out?'\"",
      "A report published in May by the U.S. Government Accountability Office reminded states that National Family Caregiver Support Program grants can be used to assist caregivers under 18. However, the future of those grants remains unclear: They are funded through the Older Americans Act, which is awaiting reauthorization; and the Administration for Community Living, which oversees the grants, was nearly halved in April as part of the reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services under President Trump.",
      "Additionally, if Congress approves proposed cuts to Medicaid, one of the first casualties likely will be states' home- and community-based service programs that provide critical financial relief to family caregivers, said Andrew Olenski, an economist at Lehigh University specializing in long-term health care.",
      "Such programs, which differ by state but are paid for with federal dollars, are designed to ensure that Medicaid-eligible people in need of long-term care can continue living at home by covering in-home personal and nursing care. In 2021, they served almost 5% of all Medicaid participants, costing about $158 billion.",
      "By law, Medicaid is required to cover necessary long-term care in a nursing home setting but not all home or community care programs. So, if states are forced to make cuts, those programs are vulnerable to being scaled back or eliminated.",
      "If an aide who makes daily home visits, for example, is no longer an option, family caregivers could step in, Olenski said. But he pointed out that not all patients have adult children to care for them, and not all adult children can afford to step away from the workforce. And that could put more pressure on any kids at home.",
      "\"These things tend to roll downhill,\" Olenski said.",
      "Some studies show benefits to young people who step into caregiving roles, such as more self-confidence and improved family relationships. Yang said he feels more on top of things than his peers: \"I have friends worrying about how to land a job interview, while I've already applied to seven or eight other jobs.\"",
      "But for many, the cost is steep. Young caregivers report more depression, anxiety, and stress than their peers. Their physical health tends to be worse, too, related to diet and lack of attention to their own care. And caregiving often becomes a significant drag on their education: A large study found that 15- to 18-year-old caregivers spent, on average, 42 fewer minutes per day on educational activities and 31 fewer minutes in class than their peers.",
      "Schools in several states are taking notice. In Colorado, a statewide survey recently included its first question about caregiving and found that more than 12% of high schoolers provide care for someone in their home who is chronically ill, elderly, or disabled.",
      "Rhode Island's education department now requires every middle and high school to craft a policy to support caregiving students after a study published in 2023 found 29% of middle and high school students report caring for a younger or older family member for part of the day, and 7% said the role takes up most of their day. Rates were higher for Hispanic, Asian, and Black students than their white peers.",
      "The results floored Lindsey Tavares, principal of Apprenticeship Exploration School, a charter high school in Cranston. Just under half her students identified as caregivers, she said. That awareness has changed conversations when students' grades slip or the kids stop showing up on time or at all.",
      "\"We know now that this is a question we should be asking directly,\" she said.",
      "Students have shared stories of staying home to care for an ill sibling when a parent needs to work, missing school to translate doctors' appointments, or working nights to pitch in financially, she said. Tavares and her team see it as their job to find an approach to help students persist. That might look like connecting the student to resources outside the school, offering mental health support, or working with a teacher to keep a student caught up.",
      "\"We can't always solve their problem,\" Tavares said. \"But we can be really realistic about how we can get that student to finish high school.\"",
      "Rhode Island officials believe their state is the first to officially support caregiving students \u2014 work they're doing in partnership with the Florida-based American Association for Caregiving Youth. In 2006, the association formed the Caregiving Youth Project, which works with schools to provide eligible students with peer group support, medical care training, overnight summer camp, and specialists tuned in to each student's specific needs. This school year, more than 700 middle and high school students took part.",
      "\"For kids, it's important for them to know they're not alone,\" said Julia Belkowitz, a pediatrician and an associate professor at the University of Miami who has studied student caregivers. \"And for the rest of us, it's important, as we consider policies, to know who's really doing this work.\"",
      "In St. Paul, Joshua Yang had hoped to study civil engineering at the University of Minnesota, but decided instead to attend community college in the fall, where his schedule will make it simpler to continue living at home and caring for his mom.",
      "But he sees some respite on the horizon as his sisters, now 12 and 13, prepare to take on a greater share of the caregiving. They're \"actual people\" now with personalities and a sense of responsibility, he said with a laugh.",
      "\"It's like, we all know that we're the most meaningful people in our mom's life, so let's all help out,\" he said.",

      "Those agreements \"enable us to enforce meaningful protections for our users, including the right to delete your content, user privacy protections, and preventing users from being spammed using this content,\" Lee said.",

    "summary": "The 50% steel and aluminum tariffs could lead to higher prices on everything from cars to home and office supplies.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Wednesday officially\u00a0raised tariffs on aluminum and steel to 50%, a move experts say could increase costs on everything from homes and cars to household items and office supplies.",
      "While the U.S. has carved out its own niche in domestic metals manufacturing, it also relies on imports from abroad to fill in the gaps: America imported 26.2 million metric tons of steel and 5.4 million metric tons of aluminum\u00a0from abroad last year, according to the International Trade Administration. Canada serves as the biggest foreign source for both metals.",
      "The White House has been aggressively trying to pare back on America's reliance on foreign nations,\u00a0imposing 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum\u00a0in February, citing\u00a0national security concerns. President Trump, during a visit to a U.S. Steel mill in Pittsburgh on May 30, announced he was\u00a0doubling down on that rate, raising the 25% levies to 50%. The higher tariffs went into effect Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. EST.",
      "While the new tariffs have won over some of the nation's largest steel makers, who saw huge gains in share prices following Mr. Trump's May 30 announcement, experts say the levies will raise cost of manufacturing on a wide range of products, making many items more expensive to buy. That's because businesses typically pass on most or all of tariff-related costs to consumers\u00a0through higher prices, according to economists.",
      "\"That will hurt the people working in those industries and put their jobs under stress,\" said Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow and director at the Pacific Research Institute, a right-leaning think tank. \"And it also is going to put pressure on consumers, because those prices are going to increase.\"",
      "While some businesses may ultimately choose to absorb some of those increased costs, experts say others are likely to pass some of them along to customers \u2014 as was the case\u00a0in 2018 when tariffs on steel and aluminum tariffs were introduced by the first Trump administration.",
      "Here are some of the consumer categories that could\u00a0get pricier with the new 50% steel and aluminum tariffs now in effect.",
      "Cars",
      "Automobile manufacturers are likely to feel the burn of higher tariffs, as they rely heavily on steel and aluminum for car production. The materials are found throughout the body and structure of a car, in everything from the car's frame to engine parts to the hub caps, pipes and bumpers. According to Jay Cushing, senior bond analyst with Gimme Credit, steel accounts for 60% of the weight of the average vehicle.",
      "Dean Baker, senior economist at The Center For Economic and Policy Research, told CBS MoneyWatch there is about $800 worth of steel in each vehicle. With that figure in mind, he projected a 50% tariff would drive up the cost of a car by around $400.",
      "Cushing, however, projects an even steeper price hike. \"A doubling of tariffs from 25% to 50% could raise the cost of a car from $1,500 to $3,000 per vehicle,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "A 25% tariff on imported cars remains in place, although the Trump administration has\u00a0softened industry tariffs\u00a0to ensure automakers aren't hit twice with the additional import duty on imported steel and aluminum. \"The metal tariffs should apply only once per vehicle,\" Cushing said.",
      "Sports equipment",
      "Athletes may also notice a slight uptick in prices when shopping for new equipment such as baseball bats, tennis rackets and lacrosse sticks which sometimes contain aluminum. Industry experts say they're already seeing price increases on aluminum bats, which are fairly expensive to begin with: upwards of $100 in many cases, with higher-end models running as high as $400.",
      "Those higher price tags could end up creating negative repercussions for sports participation. The Sports & Fitness Industry Association, which tracks industry data, has consistently found that the lowest household income brackets are most negatively impacted in terms of sports participation.",
      "\"If we're going to continue to increase costs on equipment, then those lower income level households are going to continue to be left on the sideline in terms of literally and figuratively,\" said Todd Smith, president and CEO of the Sports & Fitness Industry Association.",
      "Beer and soda cans",
      "Whether it be beer, soda or seltzer, any beverages that come in a can will likely cost Americans more after the steel and aluminum tariffs take effect.",
      "This could lead major name-brand businesses to shift their strategy. Back in February, the CEO of Coca-Cola James Quincey said if aluminum cans become more expensive, the company would put more emphasis on plastic bottles. The soda giant sources aluminum for its cans from Canada, Quincey said on a February company earnings call.",
      "Canned goods and packaged grocery items",
      "Another place where Americans might feel a slight pinch is at the grocery store. Nonperishables that come in aluminum or steel cans \u2014 think beans, chickpeas, and soups \u2014 are typically thought of as a way for shoppers to economize. But the steel and aluminum tariffs could ratchet up the price of canned goods.",
      "Robert Budway, president of the Can Manufacturers Institute,\u00a0told the Associated Press that manufacturers have become increasingly reliant on imported materials in recent years and that it's American families who will most likely bear the increased tariff costs.",
      "Baker, the economist from The Center For Economic and Policy Research, didn't have an exact estimate but said the increase to the cost of canned goods would be fairly low. \"If you get $2 can of soup, maybe it would go up a cent or two,\" he said.",
      "There could be indirect price increases at the grocery store as well. Many packaged goods are made using machines with steel and aluminum machines, Baker said, meaning products like cookies could get more expensive.",
      "Household appliances/supplies",
      "A wide range of appliances from dishwashers and dryers to garbage disposals and air conditioners all stand to become pricier as a result of the Trump administration's 50% steel and aluminum tariffs.",
      "The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment, but has said in the past that they strongly support an \"integrated North American market\" and have\u00a0called for \"common-sense\" trade policies.",
      "\"It can go from the grandiose of a washing machine and a car, to the trivial, like a staple or a paper clip,\" said Winegarden at the Pacific Research Institute.",
      "Lawn mowers could also see price hikes. Baker estimates that a lawn mower that goes for $250mightcost $255 after the tariffs take effect.",
      "\"Will people notice that? Some will, some won't,\" he said. \"But there's no doubt the direction is higher \u2014 the question is how much.\"",
      "Homes",
      "Building materials could also be impacted, which will ultimately translate to higher home prices.",
      "In an April blog post, Realtor.com documented how the price of nails used in homebuilding has already started to increase due to tariffs. A single box of coil roofing nails could go from $65 to $325, the real estate platform predicted at the time.",
      "Other products used in home construction like steel fasteners could also get caught in the crosshairs of the tariffs. This bodes poorly for the housing sector \u2014 which is already facing pressure from high prices, steep mortgage rates and lack of inventory.",
      "\"President Trump's move to double steel and aluminum tariffs will have a negative impact on housing affordability by further disrupting building material supply chains and fueling business uncertainty,\" said Buddy Hughes, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders.",
      "Before the new 50% tariffs were introduced, the trade association estimated that tariff activity would add roughly $10,900 to the average cost of a new home.",

      "Signed into law by President Biden in January 2025, the Social Security Fairness Act requires the agency to adjust benefits for 3.2 million people, including future and past benefits. So far, Social Security has completed 90% of its caseload, according to its May 27 update.",
      "Payments are going to public pension holders\u00a0 previously barred from collecting full benefits under the federal retirement program due to two federal policies: the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and Government Pension Offset (GPO). The Social Security Fairness Act ended these provisions, opening the door for millions to receive retroactive payments dating back to January 2024. December 2023 was the last month the WEP and GPO applied, according to the SSA.",

      "If you're eligible for these payments, read on for the latest from the SSA.",
      "When will I get my retroactive payment?",
      "The agency started issuing payments on Feb. 25. According to the SSA, beneficiaries should have received a one-time retroactive payment deposited into the bank account the agency has on file for them by the end of March 2025.",
      "In terms of the new monthly benefits, most eligible parties should have seen payment increases starting in April. There's a one-month lag for Social Security payments, so the April payments reflected March's benefit.",
      "What if I haven't gotten my payment yet?",
      "The SSA previously said that most Americans would have to wait up to a year or longer to receive their benefits. While the agency has been able to expedite payments using automation, more complicated cases need to be processed manually and will take longer as a result, according to its website. The SSA said it expects all beneficiary records to be updated by November 2025.",
      "Those eligible who have still not received their payment can check www.ssa.gov/my account or call 1-800-772-1213 to make sure the SSA has the right address and direct deposit information for them on file.",

      "There are still 900,000 Social Security Fairness Act cases which must be completed by hand, USA Today recently\u00a0reported. SSA employees told the news outlet that they have been directed to prioritize these cases over their other work.",
      "How much will benefits increase?",
      "The amount of the added payments hinges on a few factors, such as the type of Social Security benefit and pension a person receives. Some people will see \"very little\" adjustments, while others could see over $1,000 each month, according to the SSA\u00a0website.",
      "How will I know if my monthly benefit was adjusted?",
      "Any beneficiaries who receive a retroactive payment, or a monthly benefit adjustment, will receive a mailed\u00a0notice\u00a0from Social Security explaining the change.",

    "summary": "President Trump is putting a political spotlight on autopens, machines that have been used for decades by presidents, writers and more.",
    "story": [
      "The autopen \u2014 a machine first patented centuries ago \u2014 is having a moment in the political spotlight, following\u00a0 allegations made by President Trump that former President Biden used one to sign pardons.",
      "That's prompting questions about what autopens do, how they work and why the device is now stirring up controversy. The devices use pens or other writing instruments to place a person's signature on documents, books or other papers, such as in the case of a college president, for example, who would otherwise be required to sign hundreds or thousands of diplomas for graduating students by hand.",
      "Mr. Trump raised the issue in March when he claimed Mr. Biden's alleged use of an autopen to sign preemptive pardons to members of the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021,\u00a0assault on the U.S. Capitol\u00a0rendered them \"void\" and \"vacant.\"",
      "Mr. Trump raised the issue again on Wednesday, when he posted on Truth Social, \"With the exception of the RIGGED PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2020, THE AUTOPEN IS THE BIGGEST POLITICAL SCANDAL IN AMERICAN HISTORY!!!\"",
      "The autopen has also become a focus of the right-leaning Heritage Foundation's Oversight Project, which claims that Mr. Biden's alleged use of an autopen given his \"clear cognitive decline ... raises additional questions for investigators.\"",
      "Regardless of the allegations, the autopen is hardly a novel device for the political sphere, with the Shapell Manuscript Foundation noting that one of the devices was bought by Thomas Jefferson soon after it was patented in 1803. Throughout U.S. history, presidents have relied on autopens, although the Shapell Manuscript Foundation notes that some commanders-in-chief have been guarded about their use of the machine.",
      "\"Whereas once the official White House position was to deny the existence or usage of the autopen, today its existence is more of an open secret,\" the foundation notes.",
      "A spokesperson for Mr. Biden didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "What is an autopen?",
      "An autopen, also called a robot pen, is a machine that automates a person's signature with a pen or other writing instrument, versus a scanned signature, which is a digital image of a signature.",
      "Unlike people, the machine will never get writer's cramp, and can replicate a person's signature on high volumes of letters, certificates, diplomas and other documents, according to Automated Signature Technology, an autopen manufacturer.",
      "Its Ghostwriter machine uses a smart card or USB flash drive to store signatures and phrases that can be replicated on paper. The company's machines \"write at human speed ... to produce quality handwriting reproductions,\" Automated Signature Technology says.",
      "The Ghostwriter can use any type of writing instrument, from a ballpoint pen to crayons, and can write on a variety of materials with different thicknesses, it added.",
      "Another autopen manufacturer, the Autopen Company, said its machines can be used for \"signing certificates, correspondence, photographs and posters, almost anything up to 1/4 inch thick. Factory modifications can be incorporated for signing books and sports memorabilia.\"",
      "One site that sells autopens says that high-end machines used by governments can cost\u00a0between $5,000 to $20,000 each.",
      "Neither the Autopen Company nor Automated Signature Technology immediately responded to requests for comment from CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Have other presidents used autopens?",
      "Yes. President Johnson even allowed the autopen to be photographed in the White House. The photo appeared in The National Enquirer with a 1968 article titled, \"The Robot That Sits in for the President,\" according to the Shapell Manuscript Foundation.",
      "Other presidents who have relied on autopens include John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama, among others. Presidents have typically used an autopen to sign routine correspondence to constituents, like letters recognizing life milestones, as well as legislation and pardons.",
      "During the Gerald Ford administration, the president and First Lady Betty Ford occasionally signed documents and other correspondence by hand, but White House staff more often used autopen machines to reproduce their signatures on letters and photographs.",
      "Mr. Trump has also used an autopen, telling reporters on Air Force One in March that he'd used the device \"only for very unimportant papers.\"",
      "\"You know, we get thousands and thousands of letters, letters of support for young people, from people that aren't feeling well, etcetera. But to sign pardons and all of the things that he signed with an autopen is disgraceful,\" Mr. Trump said at the time, in reference to his claims former President Biden used the technology to sign pardons.",
      "President George W. Bush asked the Justice Department in 2005 if it was constitutional to use an autopen to sign a bill, with the department concluding that \"the president need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Jun 2025 16:23:35 -0400",
    "summary": "Roughly a quarter of consumers use \"buy now, pay later\" loans for ordinary expenses like groceries. That's worrisome, a personal finance expert says.",
    "story": [
      "A growing number of consumers are taking out \"buy now, pay later,\" or BNPL, loans to cover everyday living expenses, data shows, a sign of the precarious financial state facing many U.S. households.",
      "A quarter of Americans now use BNPL loans to pay for groceries, up 14% from last year, according to a recent survey from LendingTree. The personal finance firm also found that more people are using such financing to pay for clothing, technology and housewares.",
      "BNPL loans \u2014 which are readily available from financial technology companies such as Affirm, Klarna and PayPal, as well as from household names like Apple \u2014 let shoppers make interest-free purchases while spreading payments over several installments. The most common BNPL loans are \"pay in four\" products, which divide the total cost of a purchase, usually ranging from $50 to $1,000, into four equal payments. Consumers pay the first 25% at the point of sale and the remaining three installments over the next six weeks.",
      "Although such credit arrangements can help consumers afford an item in the short term, some BNPL loans can carry interest changes and fees, potentially leading consumers to rack up debt. According to LendingTree, 41% of customers who have used a BNPL loan say they have made a late payment in the past year, up from 34% the year prior. And while most lenders don't charge interest, they do charge late fees for missed payments, which can add up over time.",
      "Despite such risks, BNPL loans have exploded in popularity, including for modest transactions. For example, Klarna in March partnered with food delivery service DoorDash to offer a BNPL plan that consumers can use to pay for meal and grocery deliveries. DoorDash said it was launching the service to let customers postpone payment to \"a more convenient time, such as a date that aligns with their paycheck.\"",
      "LendingTree chief consumer finance analyst Matt Schulz said BNPL loan providers make it easy for customers to use them for a wide range of purchases. \"They give people more options, which can be good if it's managed well,\" he told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady.",
      "At the same time, the growing number of Americans using the loans to buy food \"clearly shows that there are a lot of people who are struggling with high costs at the grocery store and elsewhere, and who are looking for whatever ways they can find to help them make ends meet a little easier,\" Schulz said.",
      "\"If you make a bunch of purchases with a credit card, you're just making one payment at the end of the month,\" he added. \"But if you get a bunch of different BNPL loans, it can be a challenge to manage them. That's especially true if you're on a tight budget without a lot of wiggle room, and you're inexperienced with managing payments.\"",
      "LendingTree survey data shows that about one in four BNPL users say they've had at least three active BNPL loans at one time.",
      "\"That speaks to how easy these are to get and how easy it is to overspend on them,\" Schulz said.",

    "summary": "President Trump's sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8 trillion over 10 years while shrinking the economy, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8 trillion over a 10-year period while shrinking the economy, raising the inflation rate and reducing the purchasing power of households overall, according to an analysis released Wednesday by the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The numbers were revealed in a letter sent to Democratic congressional leadership outlining how the Trump administration's plan to impose wide-ranging tariffs on countries around the world will affect American households.",
      "Baked into the CBO analysis is a prediction that households would ultimately buy less from the countries hit with added tariffs. The budget office estimates that the tariffs would increase the average annual rate of inflation by 0.4 percentage points in 2025 and 2026.",
      "The budget office's model also assumes that the tariffs, announced through executive action between January and May, will be in place permanently. \"If the Administration makes additional changes to tariffs, the budget baseline will be adjusted to reflect the budgetary implications of those changes as they take effect,\" CBO Director Phillip Swagel wrote.",
      "Since the analysis was conducted, a federal court struck down sweeping tariffs that Mr. Trump invoked under an emergency-powers law. An appeals court allowed the Trump administration to continue collecting the tariffs while the case goes through appeals.",
      "Largely confirming what other economic models have predicted, the CBO's estimations show that the tradeoff for a $2.8 trillion deficit reduction over 10 years would be an overall reduction in household wealth. In addition, the tariffs would shrink the economy, or reduce the rate of the gross domestic product by 0.06 percentage points per year.",
      "The Penn-Wharton Budget Model's April report predicted that the Republican president's tariffs would reduce long-run GDP by about 6% and wages by 5%.",
      "A major caveat of the CBO's estimates is written into the report \u2014 its estimates are \"subject to significant uncertainty, in part because the Administration could change how the tariff policies are administered.\"",
      "The evaluation also does not appear to take into account any impact from Mr. Trump's massive tax and budget bill currently being debated in Congress. The CBO released another estimate earlier Tuesday showing that the legislation would increase deficits by a total of roughly $2.4 trillion over 10 years. White House have argued that any deficit increase caused by the \"one big, beautiful bill\" would be offset by the \"reciprocal\" tariff plans, and touted the CBO's new analysis on Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump has often announced changes and pauses to his tariff plans on his social media platform.",
      "In April, he posted that he was backing off his tariffs on most nations for 90 days and jacking up the tax rate on Chinese imports to 125%.",
      "Last week, he announced plans to hike the tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to a punishing 50%, a move that's set to hammer businesses and likely push up prices for consumers even further. The 50% tariffs went into effect Wednesday.",
      "The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast Tuesday that the U.S. economy, the world's largest, will slow growth to just 1.5% in 2026.",

      "Washington \u2014 Republicans' sweeping policy bill aimed at advancing President Trump's second-term agenda would increase annual budget deficits by a total of $2.4 trillion over the next decade, according to a new estimate prepared by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The CBO also estimates that 10.9 million more people would be without health insurance in 2034 as the result of the House-passed legislation, mostly due to cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act under the bill.",
      "House Republicans are aiming to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending to offset trillions in tax cuts, while also raising the debt ceiling by $4 trillion. The CBO projection puts the spending cuts at about $1.2 trillion over the next decade, with the tax cuts totaling just under $3.7 trillion. The national debt currently stands at roughly $36 trillion, according to the Treasury Department.",
      "The package, which Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers refer to as the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" is now in the hands of the Senate after making it out of the House before Memorial Day. The bill is expected to undergo changes in the Senate before heading back to the lower chamber.",
      "Though Republicans vowed to protect Medicaid benefits and have framed cuts to the program as trimming \"waste, fraud and abuse,\" the analysis found that the portion of the bill dealing with Medicaid would mean 7.8 million fewer people being enrolled in the safety net program. Federal spending on Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act would be reduced by $902 billion over a decade.",
      "Another 1.3 million people would be without insurance due to changes in the Affordable Care Act. The bill would also eliminate state-funded insurance for 1.4 million people \"without verified citizenship, nationality, or satisfactory immigration status,\" the CBO said.",
      "Medicaid, a popular entitlement program, provides government-sponsored health care for more than 70 million low-income adults, children and people with disabilities. The House bill includes new work requirements that would apply to childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 19 and 64, more frequent eligibility checks and changes to how states can finance their share of the costs of the program.",
      "Cuts to federal food assistance programs, which includes Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, would save more than $294 billion over 10 years, according to the analysis. House Republicans plan to achieve the savings by requiring states to cover a share of the costs to provide benefits that help low-income individuals and families pay for groceries and by expanding work requirements.",
      "About 42 million people benefited from SNAP, also known as food stamps, in fiscal year 2023, with recipients receiving an average of $211 each month in benefits, according to the Department of Agriculture.",
      "House Republican leadership dismissed the CBO's findings Wednesday morning, arguing that it ignores economic growth that will stem from their policies.",
      "\"This bill will actually reduce the deficit if you recognize the historical economical growth that has always been there,\" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, said Wednesday.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, also pushed back on the uninsured estimate, telling reporters later Wednesday, \"We're not buying the CBO estimates.\"",
      "\"The primary emphasis is on the work requirements,\" he said. \"That's the largest pool of people that they claim will be affected, and the minimal work requirement is 20 hours a week. Volunteer in your community, get a job or do a job training.\"",

    "story": [
      "A Republican-backed budget package includes a new restriction for the federal Child Tax Credit that could strip the benefit from millions of children who are U.S. citizens or legal residents, according to policy experts.",
      "The proposed tax and spending legislation \u2014 which proponents have dubbed the \"one big, beautiful bill\" \u2014 includes a\u00a0requirement that both a tax filer and the person's spouse have Social Security numbers to claim the Child Tax Credit, or CTC, for their kids. That means children with mixed-status parents, such as one parent who is a U.S. citizen and the second who is not, would no longer qualify for the tax credit, said Carl Davis, the research director of nonpartisan tax research group ITEP.",
      "Children who are born in the U.S., making them American citizens, but whose parents are undocumented would also be barred from the CTC. In some cases, one or both parents of a child who is authorized to be in the U.S. may lack a Social Security numbers. For example, parents who are in the U.S. on non-working visas, such as graduate students on education visas, would be prohibited from receiving the tax credit.",
      "The proposed restriction is part of a push by Republican lawmakers to ensure that tax breaks aren't going to undocumented immigrants. But the new policies would have the secondary effect of denying a tax credit to millions of children in the U.S. who currently qualify for the benefit, policy experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The CTC, which now amounts to $2,000 per eligible child and has been shown to lift children out of poverty, currently requires that each kid has a valid Social Security number, but not their parents.",
      "Republicans say the bill would benefit families by boosting the CTC to $2,500 for three years, and then adjusting the tax credit each year for inflation so its value doesn't erode over time.",
      "A spokesperson for the Republican members of the congressional panel didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In May, \"Working families, farmers and small businesses win with this bill,\" House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, a Republican from Missouri, said last month from the House floor. \"We expand and make permanent the small business deduction, and increase the Child Tax Credit, the standard deduction and the Death Tax exemption.\"",
      "He added, \"President Trump stopped the flow of illegal immigrants over our borders \u2014 this bill will stop the flow of taxpayer benefits to their pockets.\"",
      "4.5 million kids could be affected",
      "Most undocumented immigrants are already blocked from receiving most federal tax benefits, according to the Brookings Institution. The GOP tax bill could instead eliminate tax breaks for many immigrants who are in the U.S. legally, such as refugees or people on educational visas, the think tank said in a recent report.",
      "The tax bill could undergo more changes as it moves through the legislative process. The Senate is currently working on the measure after it squeaked through the House with a one-vote margin. Some senators have\u00a0voiced opposition, such as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has said the bill will \"explode the debt.\"",
      "Should the CTC restriction be passed into law, however, it would impact roughly 4.5 million children, with the greatest number residing in California, Texas and Florida, according to an April\u00a0estimate from researchers at the Center for Migration Studies, Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, ITEP and Boston University.",
      "\"The proposal now is actually to tighten the eligibility rules even more and to say, 'We basically don't care if the child is a citizen or not \u2014 we need every person in the household to be a citizen or otherwise have legal status in order for the credit to be paid out,\" Davis said.",
      "\"Treated differently\"",
      "Under the GOP bill, both spouses in a given household also must have a Social Security number to qualify for a number of other tax breaks, including provisions eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay.",
      "That would create different tax rules for people who are married to spouses without a Social Security number, as well as for immigrants who are undocumented or who possess valid visas that don't allow them to have Social Security numbers, ITEP's Davis said.",
      "\"It seems to say, if your parents don't meet this criteria regarding their immigration status, then you will be treated differently as a child than all other children in the U.S. who were born of two parents that meet the qualifications,\" said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Created in 1997, the Child Tax Credit received a boost in President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which doubled the credit to $2,000 per eligible child, although that provision is set to expire at the end of 2025, when the credit is set to return to $1,000 per kid.",
      "The Republican tax bill would boost the CTC to $2,500 per child from tax years 2025 through 2028, at which point the credit would return to its $2,000 level. The tax credit would also be adjusted for inflation each year, ensuring that it wouldn't erode in value over time.",
      "Eligible parents can claim the CTC when filing their taxes, which can help families reduce their tax liability or receive a tax refund. During the pandemic, the CTC received a temporary boost that increased the maximum credit per child to $3,600 while paying out half the benefit through monthly payments, helping millions of families afford things like school supplies, clothing and educational programs for their kids.",
      "An effort last year to expand the CTC failed to advance in the Senate\u00a0in the face of widespread Republican opposition.",
      "\"When families have counted on this funding, it means making sure they have the school supplies, they have access to food and groceries,\" Gonzales said. \"That sets them up for a better trajectory in life, and all of that could be lost because they can't access this credit.\"",

    "story": [
      "With weather\u00a0forecasts\u00a0showing above-normal temperatures throughout the country this summer, heat-weary Americans will soon likely be turning up their air conditioners for relief. But that comfort will come at a cost.",
      "Home electricity bills\u00a0are expected to reach their highest average rate in 12 years, at $784 for the summer period, according to a recent analysis from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA). The elevated cost comes as a one-two punch for families already financially strapped after this winter season's higher-than-average heating costs.",
      "Those most impacted by higher summer utility bills will be lower-income households, which often lack the resources to cover monthly payments. About one in four households say they can't pay their energy bills, according to the most recent Census Household Pulse Survey.",
      "The stakes for keeping cool are high. \"Heat is the leading weather-related killer in the United States, resulting in hundreds of fatalities each year,\"\u00a0according to the National Weather Service. Higher temperatures can lead to heat stroke and heat exhaustion.",
      "Heat waves are\u00a0already hitting\u00a0parts of the U.S. like\u00a0Texas. As Mayo Clinic points out, unexpected fluctuations in the temperature often catch people off guard.",
      "For those looking for relief from high temperatures and high bills, experts offer helpful suggestions. \"There are simple things to do,\" said Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA. \"You can do them now, and they pay off.\"",
      "Here are tips to reduce your energy costs as summer heats up.",
      "Low-hanging fruit",
      "As a starting point, Americans can tackle low-hanging fruit options, like using a fan in place of, or in addition to an AC. Fans use far less electricity than air conditioners and are priced more reasonably, whether you're looking for a box fan, a pedestal fan or another model.",
      "For those with ceiling fans there's a hack for staying extra cool. Experts recommend setting ceiling fans to rotate counterclockwise during summer months, as doing so pushes warm air down and keeps a cool breeze going. In the fall and winter, rotation should be switched back to clockwise so that as warm air rises, it's circulated throughout the room, said Laurie Wheelock, executive director and counsel at New York's Utility Project (PULP).",
      "If you use an AC, make sure to change the air filter regularly. Wolfe recommends replacing AC filters monthly during the summer, to help units run more efficiently. For those who plan to keep their unit running during the day, you can set it to a few degrees higher before you leave your home to conserve energy.",
      "Wolfe advises setting your AC temperature between 70\u00b0F and 78\u00b0F when you are at home, and 78\u00b0F when the house is empty.",
      "Other small adjustments to keep your space cool include using indoor plants to create shade, keeping your curtains closed to block out the sunlight during the day, investing in reflective blinds or UV-reflective film for windows. Also, limit your oven use and make sure to turn it off right after using it, as it can warm up your space significantly, said Wolfe.",
      "For general energy conservation, experts suggest unplugging small appliances or electronics when you're not using them. Wolfe also recommends running your refrigerator and freezer at the regular temperature as directed by the manufacturer.",
      "\"Running them at cooler temperatures might seem like a good idea in the summer, but that can drive up electricity costs and potentially wear out the electrical appliance,\" he said.",
      "Also, make sure nothing is blocking the airflow of your heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system. Plant life or other obstacles in front of vents can make units less efficient, Wolfe noted.",
      "Look to your state or utility company for help",
      "While it may seem counter-intuitive, your utility company may be able to help you bear the cost burden of higher bills.",
      "\"Some utilities run programs to help make your home more energy efficient in the summer,\" said Wolfe. \"They'll offer rebates if you buy more efficient air conditioners, no-cost audits of your home, and they'll subsidize the cost of installing more insulation.\"",
      "In New York, for example, energy giants ConEd and National Grid have monthly discount programs that provide bill credits to low-income households. Wheelock said PULP has seen ConEd customers save $30 to $45 per month on gas an electricity as part of New York's Energy Affordability program, which is administered by the state's major electric and natural gas utilities.",
      "State governments can also be a useful resource. Depending on where you live, your local government may offer free home energy assessments, weatherization assistance or an energy efficiency program designs to help residents lower their electricity bill.",
      "For those struggling to make ends meet, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), a federally funded initiative with a\u00a0network\u00a0of state-run programs, provides financial assistance to low-income households.",
      "HEAP provides eligible households, including apartments, with air conditioning units or fans, up to a value of $800, according to WE ACT for Environment Justice, a New York-based environmental justice organization.",
      "\"Anyone at risk of service termination who is low-income should contact their local Department of Social Services to discuss financial assistance programs including Emergency Energy Assistance,\" said Wheelock.",
      "Invest in long-term solutions",
      "With hotter temperatures here to stay, Wolfe said it may be worth investing in more permanent measures like improving your home's insulation or updating your ductwork. This will improve ventilation, keep cold air locked in and make your home more energy efficient overall.",
      "Another option is installing a smart thermostat, which allows you to remotely control the temperature of your space. They can also automatically adjust heating and cooling based on when you're home. Models like Ecobee's Smart Thermostat Essential or Google's Nest Smart Learning Thermostat typically run anywhere from $100 to $200.",
      "These investments may cost more upfront but will save you money over time, says Wolfe. \"In making your home more energy efficient, the savings will pay for the improvements,\" he said.",
      "For those ready to make an even bigger leap, installing a heat pump, switching to central air or upgrading your HVAC or AC system to one with a high Energy Star rating\u00a0are other long-term investments.",
      "Something to keep in mind before you make any of these purchases is whether electricity in your state is high enough to warrant the investment.",
      "\"If you're in like the northeast using heating oil, heat pumps make a lot of sense,\" said Wolfe.",
      "Even before you buy a home, it's worth investigating what the energy bills will look like. You can do this by getting an energy audit from a utility company, said Wolfe.",

The Trump administration's policies, which have introduced new import duties on almost every foreign nation, have hiked the effective tariff rate to 15.4% from 2% last year, marking the highest rate since 1938, the group said.",

      "Gates, who earlier this month told \"CBS Mornings\" about his plans to donate the bulk of his fortune, disclosed his intentions to focus on Africa on Monday while speaking at Nelson Mandela Hall at the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Gates had previously said his goal was to fund causes that would help save and improve lives around the globe.",

      "The surge in steel stocks followed an announcement by Mr. Trump on Friday that he would double tariffs on steel and aluminum from the current rate of 25% to 50%. The 25% tariffs,\u00a0announced in February, were enacted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which gives the president authority to restrict imports he deems a national security threat.

      "Mr. Trump in May announced a \"planned partnership\" between U.S. Steel and its Japanese competitor Nippon Steel. Few details have emerged about what exactly the $14 billion deal will look like, although the White House has said it will create \"at least 70,000 jobs\" and that it will \"ensure steel is made in America for decades to come.\"",

      "China on Monday said the Trump administration is undermining the temporary\u00a0May 12 trade agreement between the two nations by issuing AI chip export control guidelines, stopping the sale of chip design software to China and by planning to revoke Chinese student visas.",
      "The Trump administration's actions \"seriously undermine the existing consensus reached at the Geneva economic and trade talks, and seriously damage China's legitimate rights and interests,\" China's Commerce Ministry said in the June 2 statement.",

The escalation of rhetoric heightens concerns that the two largest global economies may encounter further stumbling blocks as they pursue trade negotiations, experts say.",
      "\"Fresh hostilities between the U.S. and China show that the many questions left hanging after the Geneva ceasefire in mid-May still have no satisfactory answers,\" Arthur Kroeber, a China analyst at Gavekal Research, said in a report. \"It is not clear whether U.S. trade policy is being run by President Donald Trump, his trade negotiators or his national security team.\"",
      "He added, \"The overall objectives of the trade aggression, other than the display of raw power, are as muddled as ever.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said he's \"confident\" a U.S.-China trade dispute \"will be ironed out\" when Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have a conversation. \"I believe we'll see something very soon,\"\u00a0Bessent said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Wall Street was lower on Monday amid renewed concerns of a brewing trade war between the nations. The S&P 500 slipped 10 points, or 0.2%, to 5,901, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite shed 0.1%.",
      "May 12 tariff pause",
      "The May 12 deal lasts 90 days, creating time for U.S. and Chinese negotiators to reach a more substantive agreement. But the pause still leaves tariffs higher than before Mr. Trump\u00a0started ramping them up\u00a0last month. Businesses and investors must also contend with uncertainty about whether the truce will last.",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the U.S. agreed to drop the 145% tax Mr. Trump had imposed on China to 30%. China agreed to lower its tariff rate on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%.",
      "On Monday, the Commerce Ministry said China held up its end of the deal, canceling or suspending tariffs and nontariff measures taken against the U.S. \"reciprocal tariffs\" following the agreement. But it alleged that the Trump administration has \"unilaterally provoked new economic and trade frictions and exacerbated the uncertainty and instability\" in trade relations between the two nations, citing curbs on exports of AI chips and chip design software to China.",
      "The statement also singled out the Trump administration's threat of stripping visas away from Chinese students studying at U.S. universities as undermining the trade agreement between the nations.",
      "The Trump administration stepped up the clash with China last week, announcing that it would start\u00a0revoking visas for Chinese students\u00a0in the U.S. American campuses host more than 275,000 students from China.",
      "The turmoil between the U.S. and China raises economic risks, given the links between the two nations and their importance in global trade, experts added.",
      "\"If the United States and China were to disengage completely in another blitz of escalating tariffs, it would be a really big deal for the global economy,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, told investors in a client note. \"Demand for industrial commodities would plummet.

      "President Trump on Friday announced that the tariff on foreign steel will double from 25% to 50%, effective June 4, and accused Beijing of violating a recent trade agreement by withholding critical exports like rare earth minerals.",
      "\"I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didn't want to see that happen. Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Friday morning on his Truth Social app.",
      "He added, \"The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!\"",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement is the latest in the tariff standoff, coming nearly two months after Mr. Trump announced \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on the U.S.' trading partners, eventually hiking the levy on Chinese to 145%. China responded with a 125% tariff on U.S. goods. In May, the U.S. eased the tariff on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, including a 10% baseline levy plus a fentanyl-specific 20% levy. China agreed then to reduce its 125% tariff on American goods to 10%.",
      "Bessent on Sunday emphasized the White House's intention is not to \"decouple\" from China but to \"de-risk,\"and defended the new trade stance as essential to national and economic security.",
      "\"What China is doing is holding back products essential for industrial supply chains in India and Europe,\" Bessent said. \"That is not what a reliable partner does.\"",
      "Retailers, however, have sounded the alarm about the ripple effects of the ongoing U.S.-China trade standoff. Walmart, Best Buy, and Target have warned that high tariffs on imports from Asia could drive up prices for American consumers.",
      "Bessent addressed such warnings as speculative, highlighting companies who have opted not to raise prices.",
      "\"I know what Home Depot and Amazon are saying,\" he said. \"They're not raising prices. There's a wide aperture here. Different companies are doing different things. They are making decisions based on their customers, what they think they're able to pass along to their customers, what they want to do to keep their customers.\"",
      "Asked whether the administration has identified sectors where Americans will feel the impact most, Bessent pointed to easing food and energy prices, and insisted that overall inflation is falling. \"Egg prices have collapsed,\" he said, crediting the administration's economic council and trade policies. Although egg prices have come down from the highest levels earlier this year, the Consumer Price Index showed in May that egg prices are still 49% higher than they were in May 2024.",
      "Despite industry concerns, Bessent argued Sunday that companies often offer worst-case scenarios on earnings calls to shield themselves from legal risk.",
      "\"They have to give the worst case,\" he said. \"Because if they haven't, and something bad happens, then they'll be sued.\"",

      "A key U.S. inflation gauge slowed last month as President Donald Trump's tariffs have yet to noticeably push up prices. Spending by Americans slowed despite rising incomes, potentially an early reaction to higher prices on some imported goods.",
      "Friday's report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose just 2.1% in April compared with a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March and the lowest since September. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.5% from a year earlier, below the March figure of 2.7%, and the lowest in more than four years. Economists track core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed.",
      "The figures show inflation is still declining from its post-pandemic spike, which reached the highest level in four decades in July 2022. Economists and some business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect, though the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt after they were struck down late Wednesday in court, only to be temporarily reinstated by a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.",
      "On a monthly basis, overall prices and core prices both increased just 0.1% from March to April. The cost of big-ticket manufactured goods rose a hefty 0.5%, though that increase was offset by a 0.1 decline in other goods, such as groceries. The cost of services rose just 0.1% from March to April.",
      "Americans cool off on spending",
      "The big increase in durable goods prices could reflect the early impact of tariffs. Americans also cut back their spending on longer-lasting factory goods in April, the report showed.",
      "Overall consumer spending \u2014 which includes spending on services \u2014 rose 0.2% in April from March, the report said, but that's down from a big 0.7% rise in March.",
      "The slowdown in spending could reflect some early caution on the part of consumers, economists said, in response to higher goods prices. It also suggests that some of the spending jump in March reflected consumers purchasing items like cars to get in front of the impact of tariffs.",
      "\" This is unsurprising, given the implementation of tariffs,\" Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics said in a research note. \"While tariffs may have started to weigh on consumers, this is far from a disaster,\" he added.",
      "\"The pulling forward of consumer spending ahead of the tariff increases will continue to dampen household spending in the coming months, especially as they face higher prices and a softening labor market,\" Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, said in an email. \"We anticipate that the improved inflation trend will reverse in the second half of the year as companies are forced to begin passing along a portion of the increased tariffs in order to protect profit margins.\"",
      "Walmart executives said earlier this month that the retail giant would increase prices for many products in May and June to account for the tariffs, while electronics chain Best Buy's CEO Corie Barry said Thursday the company is increasing some prices as well because of the duties, as a \"last resort.\"",
      "At the same time, incomes \u2014 before adjusting for inflation \u2014 rose a healthy 0.8% in April. Much of that gain reflected an increase in Social Security benefits as a result of the Social Security Fairness Act. The law signed in January by\u00a0former President Biden, granted retroactive benefits for some retired teachers, fire fighters, and federal workers whose incomes previously weren't fully counted toward Social Security benefits because they have pensions.",
      "The inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve said at their most recent meeting May 6-7 that inflation is still elevated, compared with their target of 2%.

      "But the duties were allowed to remain in effect while the Trump administration appeals the ruling against them.

      "\"In light of OCR's determination, Columbia University no longer appears to meet the Commission's accreditation standards,\" the department release said.",
      "A Columbia spokesperson told CBS News the school is aware of the Department of Education's concerns and has \"addressed those concerns directly with Middle States,\" referring to its accreditor. The spokesperson also said the school is \"deeply committed to combating antisemitism on our campus\" and is \"continuing to work with the federal government to address it.\"",
      "The accreditation group confirmed to CBS News it received a letter Wednesday on the Department of Education's issues with Columbia, but did not comment further.",
      "Last month, the civil rights offices of the Education Department and Department of Health and Human Services determined that Columbia had \"failed to meaningfully protect Jewish students against severe and pervasive harassment on Columbia's campus and consequently denied these students' equal access to educational opportunities to which they are entitled under the law.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Jun 2025 23:01:38 -0400",
    "summary": "Last week, the Labor Department announced a \"phased pause\" in operations at 99 contractor-operated Job Corps centers nationwide.",
    "story": [
      "Emily Scott is a Job Corps student in Los Angeles who is also a caretaker for her disabled mother. She is four months away from graduating from the Job Corps program as a licensed nurse.",
      "Andrea Watts of Las Vegas was homeless before finding her way to a Job Corps center in L.A. for an opportunity to obtain her high school diploma and eventually become a pharmacy technician.",
      "Both are students who are undergoing training at Job Corps, but whose careers are in limbo as the centers were abruptly shut down last week.",
      "On May 29, the Labor Department announced a \"phased pause\" in operations at 99 contractor-operated Job Corps centers nationwide.",
      "These are federally-funded centers that offer career training, housing and career assistance to more than 25,000 young people ages 16 to 24. The Labor Department program was funded by Congress in 1964 and has generally received bipartisan support.",
      "However, Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a news release that the program was \"no longer achieving the intended outcomes that students deserve\" as evidenced by \"a startling number of serious incident reports and our in-depth fiscal analysis.\"",
      "On Wednesday, U.S District Judge Andrew Carter in Manhattan temporarily blocked the Trump administration from eliminating the Job Corps program while the case plays out.",
      "The temporary restraining order was issued after Job Corps contractors sued the Trump administration Tuesday arguing the Labor Department violated federal law by shutting down the Job Corps centers, arguing the White House does not have the power to dismantle a program established and funded by Congress.",
      "A hearing is set for June 17. CBS News has reached out to the Labor Department and Job Corps for comment on the ruling.",
      "Job Corps officials told CBS News that even before the Labor Department paused operations last week, it had halted their ability to conduct background checks, effectively freezing the enrollment process. Though it was initially communicated as a pause, staff had been given dates for their last date of employment, they said.",
      "Prior to Carter's ruling, a stop in operations at all contractor-operated Job Corps centers was slated to occur by June 30.",
      "A transparency report released in April by the Labor Department found that the average graduation rate for the program was under 40%. The yearly average cost per student was $80,000 and there were over 14,000 serious incident infractions, including inappropriate sexual behavior, sexual assaults and reported drug use.",
      "The decision to pause operations aligned with President Trump's 2026 budget proposal, according to the Labor Department, and the administration's commitment to \"ensure federal workforce investments deliver meaningful results for both students and taxpayers,\" the agency said last week when it announced the pause.",
      "According to Michelle Matthews, who helps lead the L.A. Job Corps centers, the Labor Department's findings were \"unbelievable\" given that students are under strict rules and are drug tested in order to qualify.",
      "\"All of the numbers presented were inflated, deflated lies and their intent was clear from the start,\" said Matthews, adding that news of the centers' closure was communicated to students last Friday.",
      "\"That was a day I will never forget,\" Matthews told CBS News in tears. \"To see what they were going through and to know that the impact was going to be devastating.\"",
      "Students were required to abandon their dorms, but more than 50 students in the L.A. centers had nowhere to go. Matthews says she is part of the staff still working around the clock to find them housing.",
      "It was not immediately clear whether Wednesday's ruling will allow it to immediately reopen to students.",
      "Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have denounced the Trump administration's move to suspend Job Corps operations, a move they say is illegal.",
      "\"We funded the program through fiscal year 2025 and they are cutting these slots and shutting things down that Congress has already funded,\" said Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez of California in a phone interview with CBS News. \"The money is already there, so they should use it to help these kids finish out their degrees and certifications and then we can have a debate on what the future of Job Corps looks like.\"",
      "Gomez added that he has personally witnessed the success of the program as his two siblings are Job Corps graduates.",
      "\"The kids are in the pipeline, don't take this away from them because they don't have many opportunities as it is,\" Gomez said.",
      "In May, Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, sent a letter to Chavez-DeRemer requesting information on Job Corps contracts, background check processing and evaluation plans.",
      "\"I strongly oppose the Department of Labor's directive to pause operations at Job Corps centers in Maine and across the country,\" Collins said in a statement. \"Serving nearly 500 students in Maine, the Loring Job Corps Center and the Penobscot Job Corps Center have become important pillars of support for some of our most disadvantaged young adults.\"",
      "Scott, who has autism, was forced to drop out of college at the age of 19 to care for her disabled mother.",
      "\"I watched my whole life get put on pause and our circumstances never improved,\" Scott said.",
      "The nursing student says she's unable to pay for her training on her own if Job Corps is effectively shut down.",
      "\"My future, I don't see it, I don't see anything being different than how I started,\" Scott said.",
      "For Watts, leaving Job Corps would mean returning to Las Vegas \u2014 where she doesn't have a home \u2014 without achieving her initial hopes of becoming a pharmacy technician.",
      "\"I wanted to set an example for my future self, and I enrolled into Job Corps thinking that I would come out with a career, with my high school diploma,\" Watts said. \"But that was all just taken from me in a short amount of time.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump ordered an investigation Wednesday into whether former President Joe Biden's administration used an autopen machine to sign key presidential documents like pardons \u2014 months after Mr. Trump claimed his predecessor's pardons were illegitimate.",
      "In a memo signed Wednesday night, Mr. Trump told Attorney General Pam Bondi and the president's counsel to probe what he claimed was a \"conspiracy\" to \"abuse the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden's cognitive decline.\"",
      "The order cited a litany of executive actions by Biden \u2014 including pardons and federal judge appointments \u2014 and argued \"there are serious doubts as to the decision making process and even the degree of Biden's awareness of these actions being taken in his name.\"",
      "It then suggested that if Biden's advisers \"secretly used the mechanical signature pen,\" it would \"have implications for the legality and validity of numerous executive actions.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the investigation should cover whether Biden's aides \"conspired to deceive the public about Biden's mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the president.\" It also directed an investigation into which executive actions an autopen was used for, and who directed its use.",
      "In a statement, Biden called the attacks false and \"nothing more than a distraction by Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans.\"",
      "\"Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false,\" Biden said.",
      "Presidents have used an autopen \u2014 or a signature-signing machine \u2014 to sign certain documents for decades, and then-President George W. Bush's Justice Department said in 2005 that the president can legally use an autopen to sign bills into law. Mr. Trump said in March he has occasionally used an autopen, but \"only for very unimportant papers.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump and his allies have suggested Biden's alleged use of an autopen could be illegitimate. In March, the president claimed a slate of pardons issued to some Trump foes in the final days of his administration were \"VOID\" and \"VACANT.\"",
      "CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinson said in March that Mr. Trump cannot revoke his predecessor's pardons, even if an autopen was involved, noting that the president's constitutional power to pardon people is extremely broad. \"This is not a gray area,\" she said on \"CBS Mornings Plus.\"",
      "Early Wednesday, Mr. Trump on Truth Social\u00a0called the alleged autopen use \"THE BIGGEST POLITICAL SCANDAL IN AMERICAN HISTORY,\" aside from the 2020 presidential election, which Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed \u2014 without evidence \u2014 was rigged.",
      "Scrutiny over Biden's mental acuity while in office has ramped up in recent weeks, amid new reporting about the circumstances of Biden's exit from the 2024 presidential race. Earlier Wednesday, the Republican chair of the House Oversight Committee, Rep. James Comer of Kentucky,\u00a0pushed several members of Biden's inner circle to answer questions about the president's \"mental and physical faculties\" while serving as the chief executive.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump barred most international students from entering the United States to study at Harvard University late Wednesday \u2014 escalating the Trump administration's battle with the Ivy League school.",
      "In a proclamation, Mr. Trump suspended the entry of foreign students or exchange visitors planning to go to Harvard, unless his administration determines somebody's entry \"would be in the national interest.\" The order also directs Secretary of State Marco Rubio to consider whether student visa holders who are already in the U.S. \"should have their visas revoked.\" The order will expire in six months, though an extension is possible.",
      "The order claimed Harvard \"is no longer a trustworthy steward of international student and exchange visitor programs,\" accusing the school of failing to report students' disciplinary records to the federal government and criticizing it for ties to researchers based in China.",
      "A Harvard spokesperson called the order \"yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard's First Amendment rights.\"",
      "\"Harvard will continue to protect its international students,\" the spokesperson told CBS News.",
      "The Trump administration has tried repeatedly to restrict Harvard's ability to enroll international students \u2014 a serious threat for a school where more than one in four students hail from foreign countries.",
      "Last month, the Department of Homeland Security tried to take away Harvard's certification in the federal government's student visa database. A judge halted that policy after Harvard sued, with the school arguing the order was unconstitutional and would have an \"immediate and devastating effect for Harvard and more than 7,000 visa holders.\"",
      "And last week, the State Department ordered embassies and consulates to conduct \"additional vetting\" of anybody who wants to travel to Harvard \u2014 including current and prospective students, faculty, guest speakers and even tourists \u2014 according to an email obtained by CBS News.",
      "The Trump administration has feuded with Harvard for months, seeking to cut off billions in federal funding. The funding cutoffs came after\u00a0the school rejected the government's demands to change its disciplinary practices, end diversity, equity and inclusion programs and commission an external audit of some academic departments.",
      "The government has sharply criticized Harvard's handling of pro-Palestinian protests and alleged the school has failed to deal with antisemitism on campus. But Harvard argues it is being punished for First Amendment-protected speech.",
      "The administration has cracked down on international students beyond Harvard. It halted new student visa interviews last week in preparation for \"expanded social media vetting,\" and the State Department's email directing extra vetting for travelers to Harvard framed the policy as a \"pilot\" for other visa applicants.",
      "Meanwhile, thousands of foreign students who are already present in the U.S. have faced the termination of their student visa status, sometimes after appearing to get on the government's radar due to minor legal issues \u2014 though a judge blocked that policy.",
      "And some international students with links to pro-Palestinian activism have been detained under a rarely used law allowing visas to be revoked if someone's presence in the U.S. poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\" Judges ordered the release of two students on bond \u2014 Columbia University's Mohsen Mahdawi and Tufts University's Rumeysa Ozturk \u2014 but another Columbia activist, Mahmoud Khalil, remains detained.",

With certain exemptions, Mr. Trump's order bans citizens of those countries seeking to come to the U.S. permanently as legal immigrants, as well as temporary visa holders, like tourists.",
      "The president also partially suspended the entry of travelers and immigrants from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. That part of his proclamation applies to all prospective immigrants from these countries with visas to settle in the U.S. permanently and certain temporary visa holders.",
      "The ban is set to take effect at 12:01 a.m. on Monday, June 9.",
      "Mr. Trump said the sweeping entry restrictions were necessary to address concerns related to terrorism in the countries listed in the order, inadequate vetting of the affected nationals and the lack of cooperation on deportations among some of the nations.",
      "\"President Trump is fulfilling his promise to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors that want to come to our country and cause us harm. These commonsense restrictions are country-specific and include places that lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates, or fail to share identity and threat information. President Trump will always act in the best of interest of the American people and their safety,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told CBS News.",
      "Mr. Trump's decree contains certain exemptions, including for U.S. permanent residents, Afghans who assisted American forces and have special visas, diplomats, athletes and dual nationals with a passport from a country not listed in his proclamation.",
      "The announcement of the ban follows an attack Sunday in Boulder, Colorado, on marchers raising attention for Israelis taken hostage by Hamas. The suspect was identified by U.S. officials as an Egyptian national who had overstayed his tourist visa.",
      "In a video statement released by the White House Wednesday night, Mr. Trump said the Boulder attack \"underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas. We don't want them.\"",
      "He said the list could be revised if countries make material improvements, and new countries could be added as threats emerge.",
      "Mr. Trump's actions echo a series of travel bans issued during his first administration that initially targeted predominantly Muslim countries. Like those orders, his latest proclamation could be subject to lawsuits.",
      "In the first month of his first term, January 2017, Mr. Trump signed a travel ban restricting the entry of most citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The move triggered widespread outcry, chaos at airports and legal challenges from advocates who argued the ban was discriminatory.",
      "In March 2017, Mr. Trump removed Iraq from the list and added Chad, Venezuela and North Korea. In 2020, he expanded the ban, adding immigration restrictions for nationals of Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan, Tanzania, Myanmar and Kyrgyzstan. Chad was later removed from the list.",
      "The third version of Mr. Trump's first-term ban was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court in the summer of 2018, with the conservative justices citing the president's broad authority to restrict the entry of foreigners on national security grounds. The Biden administration scrapped that ban after it took office.",

      "A spokesperson for the FDA confirmed the plans in a statement to CBS News Tuesday, but did not respond to questions about when the review is scheduled to start and what exactly it will be reviewing about the medication.",
      "According to a letter published on social media Monday by Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Makary's review aims to closely monitor the drug's safety. But experts say concerns about its safety are misguided, fueled in part by a report from the Ethics and Public Policy Center, an advocacy group that promotes religious traditions and is funded by multiple right-wing organizations.",
      "Mifepristone, which is taken with a second drug, misoprostol, to end an early pregnancy, was first approved by the FDA in 2000 after \"a thorough and comprehensive review\" determined it was safe and effective, the agency says. Periodic reviews since its approval have not found new safety concerns, according to the FDA.",
      "In the Ethics and Public Policy Center report, which was not published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, the authors, who don't have medical training, claim the pill harms women, causing 1 in 10 patients to experience what they call a \"serious adverse event,\" including hemorrhage, ER visits, ectopic pregnancy and an undefined category of \"abortion-specific complications.\"",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said some of the instances described as \"adverse events\" are questionable.",
      "\"When you have a medication abortion, you bleed. That is normal. That is not an adverse event unless the bleeding is so significant that a woman needs a transfusion,\" she explained. \"It is to be expected that not all medication abortions will successfully eliminate the pregnancy. A surgical abortion after incomplete/failed medication abortion should not be considered an adverse event. ... An ectopic pregnancy is not caused by mifepristone and should not be considered a serious adverse event.\"",
      "Gounder added that the report lacks transparency and doesn't disclose the data source, meaning no one can reproduce and verify the findings, something Kennedy himself said he's a proponent of, noting in his confirmation hearings that he wants to replicate studies.",
      "It also lacks a comparison group, Gounder said, which is important for examining how experiences compare to pregnant women who did not take the drug.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the makers of the generic and brand name of mifepristone for comment.",
      "While it's unclear whether the latest review of the drug will impact access, this isn't the first time it has come under fire.",
      "In 2024, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge targeting the availability of the widely used pill, preserving access to the drug in its first major abortion-related ruling since the reversal of Roe v. Wade. If the challengers had prevailed, the ruling would have restricted access to mifepristone nationwide, even in states where abortion is legal.",
      "The justices unanimously ruled that the anti-abortion rights doctors and medical associations who brought the lawsuit against the FDA did not have the legal right to do so. They did not address whether the FDA acted lawfully when it took a series of steps in 2016 and 2021 that relaxed the rules for mifepristone's use.",
      "Makary had previously said that he had \"no plans to take action on mifepristone,\" which has been a target of abortion opponents and conservatives who have called on the FDA to reconsider its approval.",
      "Since it was approved, mifepristone has been taken by more than 5 million patients, according to the FDA. Medication abortions made up more than half of all abortions in the United States health care system in 2023, a study from the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research group, found.",

      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, says he agrees with Elon Musk's characterization of President Trump's domestic policy bill as a \"disgusting abomination,\" torching what he called a \"Republican civil war\" among GOP lawmakers in an interview with CBS News.",
      "\"What Elon Musk said is the stone-cold reality,\" Jeffries said in an interview with \"CBS Evening News\" co-anchor Maurice DuBois   of Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" \u2014 which passed the House last month.",
      "\"When you try to take away healthcare from more than 15 million Americans, that's a disgusting abomination,\" Jeffries said of the cuts to Medicaid included in the bill. \"When you are endeavoring to rip food, literally, out of the mouths of children, veterans and seniors with the largest cut to nutritional assistance in American history, that is a disgusting abomination. And it's certainly a disgusting abomination, when all of this is being done to provide massive tax breaks to their billionaire donors, and they're going to stick the American people with the bill and increase the debt by trillions of dollars.\"",

Some senators are pushing for changes \u2014 including a few who are skeptical of its changes to Medicaid. Any changes passed by the Senate will also need to be approved by the House.",

      "The Trump administration is preparing to end a federal domestic surveillance program for travelers that's meant to ferret out terrorist threats but has sometimes ended up saddling Americans with inconvenient or invasive searches at U.S. airports.",
      "President Trump plans to discontinue the Transportation Security Administration's \"Quiet Skies\" program, multiple sources told CBS News.",
      "An announcement could come as soon as Thursday, one U.S. official said.",
      "Aides have debated how to shut down Quiet Skies without any lapses in security, another U.S. official said.",
      "Quiet Skies works to identify travelers who could present an elevated risk to aviation security. The program, which began in 2010, employs analysts and undercover air marshals to monitor people in airports and during flights, using outstanding warrants, facial recognition software, identification of suspicious travel patterns and behaviors and other data to try to prevent terrorist attacks.",
      "It has caught up some high-profile people in its dragnet, including Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman who is now Mr. Trump's director of national intelligence, and led to debates about what has appeared at times to be an uneven application of the rules.",
      "TSA's surveillance efforts have long attracted criticism for tracking U.S. citizens not suspected of any crimes. The circumstances that land an individual on the Quiet Skies list \u2014 or what gets them removed \u2014 have been mostly concealed from the public.",
      "Some Americans undertake exhaustive efforts to get themselves removed from the list \u2014 with some even engaging in protracted legal fights.",
      "CBS News reported Tuesday that the husband of Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, landed on the TSA's watchlist in 2023. He was removed shortly after Shaheen spoke with the TSA's then-director. A spokesperson for the senator said she was not aware William Shaheen had been monitored under Quiet Skies.",
      "It was unclear Wednesday whether Quiet Skies staff would be shifted elsewhere in the administration or whether the undercover federal air marshals would continue their work.",

      "Washington \u2014 GOP leaders in Congress appeared undeterred Wednesday as Elon Musk ramped up his criticism of President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" with a barrage of posts slamming the measure, raising questions about whether Republicans can remain united around the centerpiece legislation of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda.",
      "In a post on X on Tuesday, Musk called the bill \"outrageous\" and \"pork-filled,\" arguing that it's a \"a disgusting abomination\" and lambasting congressional Republicans for supporting it. The post was only the beginning of a slew of comments from Musk, who called for a new bill to be drafted on Wednesday as the onslaught continued.",
      "\"KILL the BILL,\" Musk wrote on X Wednesday afternoon.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson pushed back on Musk's criticism Wednesday morning, telling reporters at his weekly press conference that \"I think he's flat wrong.\"",
      "\"I think he's way off on this,\" Johnson said, noting that he considers Musk a \"friend\" and arguing that \"policy differences are not personal.\"",
      "The speaker told reporters later Wednesday that \"we don't have time for a brand new bill.\" And he said he would continue to try to reach Musk after saying he didn't answer his call Tuesday. Johnson also noted that he had spoken with the president about Musk's reaction to the bill, saying Mr. Trump is \"not delighted that Elon did a 180 on that.\"",
      "Across the Capitol, the Senate is now forging ahead on the legislation, which the House narrowly passed last month. Senate Majority Leader John Thune acknowledged to reporters Wednesday that Musk has \"some influence,\" citing his social media following, but he downplayed the Tesla CEO's hold over Republicans in the upper chamber, saying that \"at the end of the day, this is a 51-vote exercise here in the Senate.\"",
      "\"I think we'll get there,\" Thune said. \"There are going to be a lot of people who share commentary about this, and we've just got to make sure we're doing everything we can to get our arguments out there.\"",
      "Senate Republicans on the Finance Committee met with the president at the White House on Wednesday evening, in what Thune said was a \"positive discussion on the path forward\" for the bill.",
      "\"I think it was a reminder that we are all in this together, this is a team effort, and everybody is going to be rowing in the same direction to get this across the finish line,\" Thune said. \"Failure is not an option.\"",

      "\"Pass the bill with as minimal changes as you can,\" Marshall said of the president's urging to senators. \"If there's an opportunity to, a few tweaks here and a few tweaks there, then great. But let's get this bill across the finish line.\"",
      "The Kansas Republican said Musk came up at the White House meeting for a \"laughing conversation for 30 seconds\" and that Mr. Trump is \"absolutely not\" concerned about his criticism.",
      "The criticism from Musk comes almost six months after he successfully\u00a0torpedoed a measure to fund the government in December, forcing lawmakers back to the drawing board. But this time around, with Musk having recently departed from his role as a Special Government Employee, the criticism has not had the same effect.",
      "\"He certainly doesn't have the same sway,\" Sen. Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, told CBS News of Musk.",
      "GOP Sen. Markwayne Mullin, who previously represented Oklahoma in the House and has served as a messenger between the two chambers, told reporters \"I don't know if it affects a lot.\"",
      "\"I have all the respect in the world for Elon, all the respect in the world for him,\" Mullin said. \"I also love my wife, and every now and then my wife and I disagree. And so sometimes people just have disagreements.\"",
      "Senate Republicans were gathered for their conference luncheon on Tuesday when Musk took to X to criticize the bill, prompting a handful of Senate Republicans to quickly voice their agreement, including Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who had already expressed serious concerns that spending cuts don't go far enough. Other Republicans, like Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, voiced understanding for Musk's views on Wednesday. But she cast doubt on whether the criticism would sway her colleagues.",
      "\"I think that those of us who share concerns that there are inadequate reductions in the bill knew that before Elon Musk said that,\" Lummis said. \"Those who disagree with him disagreed before he said that. So I don't think it changed any views in the Republican Party in the Senate.\"",
      "Senate GOP leadership has already been contending with opposition from the fiscal hawks, along with a handful of other senators who oppose Medicaid restrictions, among other things.

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has returned a Guatemalan man to the United States after a judge determined he was wrongly deported without due process, his legal team told CBS News.",
      "The man, who has gone by O.C.G. in court proceedings, landed in the United States today and made contact with lawyers representing him after he landed, said Trina Realmuto, one of his attorneys and the executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance.",
      "Last month, the Trump administration said in court filings it was working to secure a charter flight to return him, after U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy of Boston said he must be returned. This was the first high-profile case in which the Trump administration has brought back someone who was removed from the country after a judge ordered their return.",
      "Realmuto said that she expects the man will be taken into government custody as he seeks protection from persecution via due process proceedings.",
      "She said the man is \"nervous, scared and thankful to be returned to the United States.\"",
      "O.C.G.'s attorneys argued that he has no criminal history and sought asylum in the United States after multiple violent attacks against him in his native country of Guatemala.",
      "In March 2024, O.C.G. entered the United States illegally and was deported, according to court filings. After making it back to the United States again last year, he presented himself to Border Patrol for asylum proceedings. An immigration judge found in February 2025 that O.C.G. would face serious harm if he were sent back to Guatemala and ordered a \"withholding of removal\" that barred deportation back to his home country.",
      "Two days after the immigration judge's February decision, O.C.G. says he was placed on a bus and removed without due process to Mexico, where his attorneys said he was previously held for ransom and raped during his second attempt to get to the United States. He submitted evidence at his immigration hearing of his experiences in Mexico, and as a result the immigration judge said that O.C.G. could not be removed to a country other than Guatemala without additional due process.",
      "After O.C.G. was sent to Mexico by the United States, Mexican authorities removed him to Guatemala, where he had to remain in hiding until his return, according to court documents.",
      "\"[The] immigration judge told O.C.G.\u2014 consistent with this Court's understanding of the law\u2014that he could not be removed to a country other than his native Guatemala, at least not without some additional steps in the process,\" Murphy wrote in an order requiring his return. \"Those necessary steps, and O.C.G.'s pleas for help, were ignored.\"",
      "Murphy had previously ordered additional fact-finding in the case, after the Trump administration submitted a declaration under oath that O.C.G. told government officials that he had no fear of being sent to Mexico. O.C.G had previously submitted a declaration to the court stating that he was told at the last minute before his removal that he was being sent to Mexico, and that he was denied a request to speak to his attorneys beforehand.",
      "The Justice Department admitted to Murphy that there was no witness who could verify the government's account of O.C.G.'s removal under oath and the declaration was made in error.",
      "\"The only evidence before the Court therefore is O.C.G.'s uncontroverted assertion that he was given no notice of his transfer to Mexico and no opportunity to explain why it would be dangerous to send him there,\" Murphy wrote in his order mandating the man's return.",
      "\"Defendants' retraction of their prior sworn statement makes inexorable the already-strong conclusion that O.C.G. is likely to succeed in showing that his removal lacked any semblance of due process,\" the judge added.",
      "Realmuto said that her legal team was still working to get in touch with eight defendants in the same case who were allegedly flown without due process to East Africa, with a final destination of South Sudan. They are still currently being held in Djibouti after Murphy ordered the government to \"maintain custody and control\" of the migrants as they are given \"reasonable fear\" interviews to screen them for concerns about being harmed in a third country.",
      "If they do not satisfy the reasonable fear standard, the government must give them at least 15 days to challenge their removal. Murphy says the men can be held either in the U.S. or abroad, as long as the government maintains custody over them.",

    "summary": "More than 100 Venezuelan men who were sent to a prison in El Salvador must get an opportunity to challenge their detention, Judge TK James Boasberg ruled.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Washington, D.C., ordered the Trump administration to give more than 100 Venezuelan men it sent to a supermax prison in El Salvador earlier this year a chance to contest their deportation, the latest development after months of legal battles over the fate of the deportees.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg found that the 137 men removed to El Salvador on March 15 under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act had been \"plainly deprived\" of their due process rights. The Trump administration has argued the 18th century wartime law allows the government to summarily deport Venezuelans identified to be gang members, though that argument has been rejected by several federal judges. The deportees are held in El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center prison, or CECOT.",
      "Boasberg concluded that the secretive deportations to El Salvador in March had \"improperly withheld\" from the deportees due process rights that he said \"must now be afforded to them.\"",
      "The order by Boasberg gave the Justice Department one week to say how it intends to provide the 137 Venezuelan deportees an opportunity to seek relief under the constitutional principle of habeas corpus, which allows people to challenge their detention.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"As is now clear, CECOT Class members were entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removability pursuant to the Proclamation. That process \u2014 which was improperly withheld \u2014 must now be afforded to them. Put differently, Plaintiffs' ability to bring habeas challenges to their removal must be restored,\" Boasberg wrote. The judge added that the men \"must be allowed the practical opportunity to seek habeas relief that they were previously denied,\" and their cases must be handled as if they had never been removed to El Salvador in the first place.",
      "Boasberg ruled that he does not have jurisdiction over Venezuelan men who are subject to the Alien Enemies Act proclamation and are still in state or federal custody. The judge said he cannot grant them relief from his position on the bench in D.C. after the American Civil Liberties Union asked for relief for both groups of men.",
      "The Trump administration has repeatedly said all the Venezuelan men deported to El Salvador are dangerous criminals and members of Tren de Aragua, a prison gang that the president labeled a wartime enemy and terrorist group. But a \"60 Minutes\" and CBS News review of the migrants' cases found that an overwhelming majority of the men have no apparent criminal convictions or charges.",
      "The Venezuelan migrants deported to El Salvador and imprisoned at CECOT include Andry Romero Hernandez, a gay makeup artist whom an independent journalist photographed weeping when he was transferred to the maximum-security facility.",
      "Boasberg also expressed concerns about the government's claims that all the deportees are gangsters, saying, \"significant evidence has come to light indicating that many of those currently entombed in CECOT have no connection to the gang and thus languish in a foreign prison on flimsy, even frivolous, accusations.\"",
      "\"The court correctly held that the government cannot simply wash its hands of all responsibility for these constitutional violations and leave these men to linger in a brutal prison, perhaps for the rest of their lives,\" said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU lawyer leading the legal challenge against the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The March 15 deportation flights at the center of the legal fight overseen by Boasberg sent roughly 240 Venezuelan men to El Salvador, alongside roughly two dozen Salvadorans accused of gang membership. According to government officials, 137 of the Venezuelans were expelled under the Alien Enemies Act, which allows deportations during a foreign invasion, while the rest were deported under regular immigration law.",
      "Earlier this year, Boasberg blocked deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, after a challenge was brought by the ACLU on behalf of a group of Venezuelan migrants who sought to prevent their removal under the more than 200-year-old wartime law.",
      "After an appeal of Boasberg's order by the Trump administration, the Supreme Court in April allowed the Trump administration to restart removals under the Alien Enemies Act, but mandated that those subject to removal are entitled to some level of due process, including a notice before their deportation.",
      "While the April Supreme Court ruling prohibited Boasberg from granting nationwide relief to those currently in state and local detention across the country, the ACLU asked him to consider the case of the men who are already in CECOT given that there are no other legal jurisdictions that apply.",
      "In April, Boasberg found that probable cause exists to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt over what he said was its \"willful disregard\" of his order to turn two planes carrying the men around.",
      "The judge said the Trump administration can remedy the breach of his order before contempt proceedings are initiated by asserting custody over the migrants who were removed in violation of it, so they can assert their right to challenge their removability. That has not happened yet, and the Trump administration has argued in both this case and the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia \u2014 who was deported due to an \"administrative error\" \u2014 that it does not have custody over the men, because they are technically under the control of the Salvadoran government.",
      "President Trump and his allies have repeatedly attacked Boasberg over his handling of the case that arose after the president issued a proclamation in March invoking the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Jake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice. He was previously a campaign digital reporter covering President Trump's 2024 campaign and also served as an associate producer for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" where he worked with Brennan for two years on the broadcast.

      "Szabo, a Romanian national, has pleaded guilty to leading a scheme to target dozens of politicians and social media influencers with a wave of \"swatting\" attacks.",
      "According to court filings, Szabo began building a network of \"swatters\" in 2018 to unleash havoc on public figures in the United States.",
      "In a swatting hoax, a false emergency call is made to police to lure a SWAT team to a target's home.\tThe swatting call often falsely claims a mass shooting or hostage situation is underway, so as to create an exceptionally large police response and raise the risk of a confrontation at the victim's home.",
      "According to the Justice Department, \"Szabo made false reports to U.S. law enforcement including a threat in December 2020 to commit a mass shooting at New York City synagogues, and a threat in January 2021 to detonate explosives at the U.S. Capitol and kill the President-elect\"\u2014likely referring to Joe Biden.",
      "A plea agreement reviewed by CBS News said Szabo's co-conspirators also targeted at least 25 members of Congress or their families, six executive branch officials and Cabinet members, judges, members of the media and at least two dozen former government officials.",
      "He was extradited from Romania late last year and will be sentenced on federal conspiracy and threat charges in October.",
      "According to the court filings, Szabo's conspiracy sought to victimize targets with large audiences and social media followings, amplifying the impact of the attacks. \"The defendant sought to target those who would react publicly to having been swatted.\" His plea agreement said Szabo's conspiracy would target \"streamers\" who were broadcasting or speaking to an audience online during the attacks.",
      "Among those who say they were targeted was a prolific conservative social media figure known as \"Catturd,\" who posted earlier this week to his 3 million X followers, \"This is the guy who swatted me the first three times.\"",
      "Szabo publicized his \"swatting\" activity to his followers and encouraged them to engage in similar behavior, court documents say. Prosecutors said, \"One of (his) subordinates bragged to Szabo:\u00a0 'I did 25+ swattings today,\" and, 'creating massive havoc in [A]merica. $500,000+ in taxpayers wasted in just two days.\"",
      "Szabo sought to find and inspire others to execute swattings, according to the Justice Department.",
      "Former Department of Homeland Security Undersecretary of Intelligence John Cohen told CBS News, \"Increasingly, swatters are doing more than just incentivizing or inspiring attacks.\u00a0 We are seeing the posting of content that is intended to give people detailed instructions on how to carry out the activity.\"",
      "Cohen said the technology and techniques employed by swatters are becoming more sophisticated and potent. \"If a swatting call involves reporting a fictitious active shooter event, they'll use artificial intelligence-generated sound effects depicting the sounds of gunfire. That's meant to give it credibility,\" Cohen said.",
      "In Szabo's case, prosecutors alleged he used an internet-based phone platform to execute some hoaxes, which could mask identifying information about Szabo or his co-conspirators.",
      "Although charging documents do not name which members of Congress were targeted and disrupted by Szabo or his co-conspirators, several lawmakers have publicly acknowledged being victims of recent swatting attacks across the country.",
      "In a 2023 case spotlighted by CBS News, then-Rep. Brandon Williams, a central New York Republican, said the swatting happened on Christmas Day at his home. Williams told CBS News, \"I organized my family in the kitchen and told them to hang out and keep their hands visible,\" to avoid any confusion by officers when police arrived.

She also said the transcript from an April 30 hearing will be partially unsealed and include redactions that aim to protect potentially classified information or other sensitive material.",
      "Xinis' order was in response to a request to unseal court records made by more than a dozen news organizations, including CBS News. The judge found that the media outlets \"rightly contend that, at common law, the public enjoys a presumptive right to access court records, overcome only when outweighed by competing interests.\"",
      "The Justice Department opposed the request to make the records public on two grounds: the filings in question are discovery materials that are typically not available to the press and the public; and keeping the documents sealed is needed to protect national security and prevent sensitive information from being disseminated.",
      "As to those arguments, Xinis said \"neither withstand scrutiny.\"",
      "One batch of three documents had been available to the public but were then sealed following an April hearing. Another record is a three-page Justice Department request to pause for one week the court's order to turn over certain information about efforts to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody.",
      "The document that contains redactions is from Abrego Garcia's lawyers and urged the judge to maintain the original deadlines for information to be produced.",
      "The final records made public are a brief, one-sentence notice and additional request from the Justice Department for Xinis to pause proceedings to avoid interfering with efforts to \"resolve this litigation.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran immigrant who had been living in Maryland since he arrived in the U.S. illegally in 2011. He was arrested in March and deported to El Salvador, where he was initially held in the\u00a0notorious maximum-security Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT, with a group of more than 230 men, mostly Venezuelans, accused of being gang members. The State Department said in April that Abrego Garica had been moved to a lower-security facility in Santa Ana.",
      "But the Trump administration has acknowledged that Abrego Garcia's deportation to El Salvador was a mistake, as he had been granted a legal status in 2019 known as withholding of removal that forbade the Department of Homeland Security from removing him to his home country of El Salvador because he was likely to face persecution by local gangs.",
      "The Trump administration has claimed Abrego Garcia is a member of the gang MS-13, citing an allegation from a confidential informant and the clothes he was wearing when he was arrested in 2019, after which he was released from custody. His lawyers have denied Abrego Garcia has any ties to MS-13, and said he has never been charged or convicted of a crime in the U.S. or El Salvador.",

    "summary": "President Trump's sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8 trillion over 10 years while shrinking the economy, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8 trillion over a 10-year period while shrinking the economy, raising the inflation rate and reducing the purchasing power of households overall, according to an analysis released Wednesday by the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The numbers were revealed in a letter sent to Democratic congressional leadership outlining how the Trump administration's plan to impose wide-ranging tariffs on countries around the world will affect American households.",
      "Baked into the CBO analysis is a prediction that households would ultimately buy less from the countries hit with added tariffs. The budget office estimates that the tariffs would increase the average annual rate of inflation by 0.4 percentage points in 2025 and 2026.",
      "The budget office's model also assumes that the tariffs, announced through executive action between January and May, will be in place permanently. \"If the Administration makes additional changes to tariffs, the budget baseline will be adjusted to reflect the budgetary implications of those changes as they take effect,\" CBO Director Phillip Swagel wrote.",
      "Since the analysis was conducted, a federal court struck down sweeping tariffs that Mr. Trump invoked under an emergency-powers law. An appeals court allowed the Trump administration to continue collecting the tariffs while the case goes through appeals.",
      "Largely confirming what other economic models have predicted, the CBO's estimations show that the tradeoff for a $2.8 trillion deficit reduction over 10 years would be an overall reduction in household wealth. In addition, the tariffs would shrink the economy, or reduce the rate of the gross domestic product by 0.06 percentage points per year.",
      "The Penn-Wharton Budget Model's April report predicted that the Republican president's tariffs would reduce long-run GDP by about 6% and wages by 5%.",
      "A major caveat of the CBO's estimates is written into the report \u2014 its estimates are \"subject to significant uncertainty, in part because the Administration could change how the tariff policies are administered.\"",
      "The evaluation also does not appear to take into account any impact from Mr. Trump's massive tax and budget bill currently being debated in Congress. The CBO released another estimate earlier Tuesday showing that the legislation would increase deficits by a total of roughly $2.4 trillion over 10 years. White House have argued that any deficit increase caused by the \"one big, beautiful bill\" would be offset by the \"reciprocal\" tariff plans, and touted the CBO's new analysis on Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump has often announced changes and pauses to his tariff plans on his social media platform.",
      "In April, he posted that he was backing off his tariffs on most nations for 90 days and jacking up the tax rate on Chinese imports to 125%.",
      "Last week, he announced plans to hike the tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to a punishing 50%, a move that's set to hammer businesses and likely push up prices for consumers even further. The 50% tariffs went into effect Wednesday.",
      "The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast Tuesday that the U.S. economy, the world's largest, will slow growth to just 1.5% in 2026.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Jun 2025 15:24:48 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's domestic policy legislation the House advanced in May includes a substantial rollback of the Affordable Care Act.",
    "story": [
      "Millions would lose Medicaid coverage. Millions would be left without health insurance. Signing up for health plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces would be harder and more expensive.",
      "President Trump's domestic policy legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that cleared the House in May and now moves to the Senate, could also be called Obamacare Repeal Lite, its critics say. In addition to causing millions of Americans to lose their coverage under Medicaid, the health program for low-income and disabled people, the measure includes the most substantial rollback of the ACA since Mr. Trump's Republican allies tried to pass legislation in 2017 that would have largely repealed President Barack Obama's signature domestic accomplishment.",
      "One difference today is that Republicans aren't describing their legislation as a repeal of the ACA, after the 2017 effort cost them control of the House the following year. Instead, they say the bill would merely reduce \"waste, fraud, and abuse\" in Medicaid and other government health programs.",
      "\"In a way, this is their ACA repeal wish list without advertising it as Obamacare repeal,\" said Philip Rocco, an associate professor of political science at Marquette University in Milwaukee and co-author of the book \"Obamacare Wars: Federalism, State Politics, and the Affordable Care Act.\"",
      "The GOP, Rocco said, learned eight years ago that the \"headline of Obamacare repeal is really bad politics.\"",
      "Democrats have tried to frame Mr. Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act as an assault on Americans' health care, just as they did with the 2017 legislation.",
      "\"They are essentially repealing parts of the Affordable Care Act,\" Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) said as the House debated the measure in May. \"This bill will destroy the health care system of this country.\"",
      "Nearly two-thirds of adults have a favorable view of the ACA, according to polling by KFF, a national health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "In contrast, about half of people polled also say there are major problems with waste, fraud, and abuse in government health programs, including Medicaid, KFF found.",
      "\"We are not cutting Medicaid,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said May 25 on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" describing the bill's changes as affecting only immigrants living in the U.S. without authorization and \"able-bodied workers\" whom he claimed are on Medicaid but don't work.",
      "The program is \"intended for the most vulnerable populations of Americans, which is pregnant women and young single mothers, the disabled, the elderly,\" he said. \"They are protected in what we're doing because we're preserving the resources for those who need it most.\"",
      "The 2025 legislation wouldn't cut as deeply into health programs as the failed 2017 bill, which would have led to about 32 million Americans losing insurance coverage, the Congressional Budget Office estimated\u00a0at the time. By contrast, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, with provisions that affect Medicaid and ACA enrollees, would leave 11 million more people without health insurance by 2034, according to the CBO's latest estimates, released June 4.",
      "That number rises to about 16 million when including the Trump administration's proposed tightening of ACA marketplace eligibility and if Congress doesn't extend premium subsidies for Obamacare plans that were enhanced during the pandemic to help more people buy insurance on government marketplaces, the CBO says. Without congressional action, the more generous subsidies will expire at the end of the year and most ACA enrollees will see their premiums rise sharply.",
      "The increased financial assistance led to a record 24 million people enrolled in ACA marketplace plans this year, and health insurance experts predict a large reduction without the enhanced subsidies.",
      "Loss of those enhanced subsidies, coupled with other changes set in the House bill, will mean \"the ACA will still be there, but it will be devastating for the program,\" said Katie Keith, founding director of the Center for Health Policy and the Law at Georgetown University.",
      "Republicans argue that ACA subsidies are a separate issue from the One Big Beautiful Bill and accused Democrats of conflating them.",
      "The House-passed bill also makes a number of ACA changes, including shortening by a month the annual open enrollment period and eliminating policies from Joe Biden's presidency that allowed many low-income people to sign up year-round.",
      "New paperwork hurdles the House bill creates are also expected to result in people dropping or losing ACA coverage, according to the CBO.",
      "For example, the bill would end most automatic reenrollment, which was used by more than 10 million people this year. Instead, most ACA enrollees would need to provide updated information, including on income and immigration status, to the federal and state ACA marketplaces every year, starting in August, well before open enrollment.",
      "Studies show that additional administrative hurdles lead to people dropping coverage, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor and co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.",
      "\"Not only do people drop out of the process, but it tends to be healthier, younger, lower-income folks who drop out,\" she said. \"That's dumb because they go uninsured. Also, it is bad for the insurance market.\"",
      "Supporters of the provision say it's necessary to combat fraudulent enrollment by ensuring that ACA beneficiaries still want coverage every year or that they are not being enrolled without their permission by rogue sales agents. Most of the Medicaid coverage reductions in the bill, the CBO says, are due to new work requirements and directives for the 21 million adults added to the program since 2014 under an expansion authorized by the ACA.",
      "One new requirement is that those beneficiaries prove their eligibility every six months, instead of once a year, the norm in most states.",
      "That would add costs for states and probably lead to people who are still eligible falling off Medicaid, said Oregon Medicaid Director Emma Sandoe. Oregon has one of the most liberal continuous eligibility policies, allowing anyone age 6 or older to stay on for up to two years without reapplying.",
      "Such policies help ensure people don't fall off for paperwork reasons and reduce administrative burden for the state, Sandoe said. Requiring more frequent eligibility checks would \"limit the ability of folks to get care and receive health services, and that is our primary goal,\" Sandoe said.",
      "The 2017 repeal effort was aimed at fulfilling Mr. Trump's promises from his first presidential campaign. That's not the case now. The health policy provisions of the House bill instead would help to offset the cost of extending about $4 trillion in tax cuts that skew toward wealthier Americans.",
      "The Medicaid changes in the bill would reduce federal spending on the program by about $700 billion over 10 years. CBO has not yet issued an estimate of how much the ACA provisions would save.",
      "Timothy McBride, a health economist at Washington University in St. Louis, said Republican efforts to make it harder for what they term \"able-bodied\" adults to get Medicaid is code for scaling back Obamacare.",
      "The ACA's Medicaid expansion has been adopted by 40 states and Washington, D.C. The House bill's work requirement and added eligibility checks are intended to drive off Medicaid enrollees who Republicans believe never should have been on the program, McBride said. Congress approved the ACA in 2010 with no Republican votes.",
      "Most adult Medicaid enrollees under 65 are already working, studies show. Imposing requirements that people prove they're working, or that they're exempt from having to work, to stay on Medicaid will lead to some people losing coverage simply because they don't fill out paperwork, researchers say.",
      "Manatt Health estimates that about 30% of people added to Medicaid through the ACA expansion would lose coverage, or about 7 million people, said Jocelyn Guyer, senior managing director of the consulting firm.",
      "The bill also would make it harder for people enrolled under Medicaid expansions to get care, because it requires states to charge copayments of up to $35 for some specialist services for those with incomes above the federal poverty level, which is $15,650 for an individual in 2025.",
      "Today, copayments are rare in Medicaid, and when states charge them, they're typically nominal, usually under $10. Studies show cost sharing in Medicaid leads to worse access to care among beneficiaries.",
      "Christopher Pope, a senior fellow with the conservative Manhattan Institute, acknowledged that some people will lose coverage but rejected the notion that the GOP bill amounts to a full-on assault on the ACA.",
      "He questioned the coverage reductions forecast by the CBO, saying the agency often struggles to accurately predict how states will react to changes in law. He said that some states may make it easy for enrollees to satisfy new work requirements, reducing coverage losses.",
      "By comparison, Pope said, the ACA repeal effort from Mr. Trump's first term a decade ago would have ended the entire Medicaid expansion. \"This bill does nothing to stop the top features of Obamacare,\" Pope said.",
      "But McBride said that while the number of people losing health insurance under the GOP bill is predicted to be less than the 2017 estimates, it would still eliminate about half the ACA's coverage gains, which brought the U.S. uninsured rate to historical lows. \"It would take us backwards,\" he said.",

      "The CBO also estimates that 10.9 million more people would be without health insurance in 2034 as the result of the House-passed legislation, mostly due to cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act under the bill.",
      "House Republicans are aiming to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending to offset trillions in tax cuts, while also raising the debt ceiling by $4 trillion. The CBO projection puts the spending cuts at about $1.2 trillion over the next decade, with the tax cuts totaling just under $3.7 trillion. The national debt currently stands at roughly $36 trillion, according to the Treasury Department.",
      "The package, which Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers refer to as the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" is now in the hands of the Senate after making it out of the House before Memorial Day. The bill is expected to undergo changes in the Senate before heading back to the lower chamber.",
      "Though Republicans vowed to protect Medicaid benefits and have framed cuts to the program as trimming \"waste, fraud and abuse,\" the analysis found that the portion of the bill dealing with Medicaid would mean 7.8 million fewer people being enrolled in the safety net program. Federal spending on Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act would be reduced by $902 billion over a decade.",
      "Another 1.3 million people would be without insurance due to changes in the Affordable Care Act. The bill would also eliminate state-funded insurance for 1.4 million people \"without verified citizenship, nationality, or satisfactory immigration status,\" the CBO said.",
      "Medicaid, a popular entitlement program, provides government-sponsored health care for more than 70 million low-income adults, children and people with disabilities. The House bill includes new work requirements that would apply to childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 19 and 64, more frequent eligibility checks and changes to how states can finance their share of the costs of the program.",
      "Cuts to federal food assistance programs, which includes Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, would save more than $294 billion over 10 years, according to the analysis. House Republicans plan to achieve the savings by requiring states to cover a share of the costs to provide benefits that help low-income individuals and families pay for groceries and by expanding work requirements.",
      "About 42 million people benefited from SNAP, also known as food stamps, in fiscal year 2023, with recipients receiving an average of $211 each month in benefits, according to the Department of Agriculture.",
      "House Republican leadership dismissed the CBO's findings Wednesday morning, arguing that it ignores economic growth that will stem from their policies.",

Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts, the acting ranking member of the panel, wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump that he is investigating the extent of Musk's alleged drug use and asked the president to turn over information about what he or other administration officials knew about Musk's supposed consumption while he was working as a special government employee.",
      "Musk, who helped oversee the efforts to overhaul the federal government through the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, officially ended his tenure working in the federal government last Friday. But the president said that Musk \"is not really leaving,\" and the billionaire said he would remain a \"friend and adviser\" to Mr. Trump.",
      "As a special government employee, Musk was limited to 130 days in a 365-day period, according to federal law.",
      "\"The drastic and erratic nature of Mr. Musk's decisions and actions as a government employee, coupled with the reports of his drug use, begs the question of whether Mr. Musk was under the influence of illicit substances while working in your White House,\" Lynch wrote. \"The American people deserve to know whether Mr. Musk was under the influence while he gleefully took a 'chainsaw' to our federal government.\"",
      "The letter from the Massachusetts Democrat comes on the heels of a New York Times report published last week that alleged Musk used the drug ketamine as often as once a day during the 2024 campaign. According to the Times, Musk told people he was taking so much ketamine \u2014 which can be used recreationally and for medical purposes \u2014 that it was affecting his bladder.",
      "In addition to ketamine, Musk allegedly took Ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms, the Times reported.",
      "The CEO of Tesla and SpaceX wrote on social media on Saturday that he \"tried *prescription* ketamine a few years ago\" adding it \"helps for getting out of dark mental holes, but haven't taken it since then.\" He also accused the Times of \"lying their ass off.\" The Times responded that the newspaper had \"provided Musk with multiple opportunities to reply or rebut this reporting before publication and he declined, opting instead to try to distract with a social post and no evidence.\"",
      "When asked about the claims of chronic drug use during an event with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office on Friday, Musk rebuffed the question and attacked the Times.",
      "\"The New York Times? Is that the same publication that got a Pulitzer Prize for false reporting on the Russiagate?\" Musk asked. \"Let's move on.\"",
      "Musk addressed his ketamine use during an interview with journalist Don Lemon last year and said he was taking a \"small amount once every other week.\" He added that \"if you use too much ketamine, you can't really get work done \u2026 and I have a lot of work.\"",
      "But the Wall Street Journal reported in January 2024 that some executives and board members at his companies became concerned with his use of drugs and the potential consequences for his health and the businesses he oversees.",
      "Musk in February said on social media that he has had a top secret security clearance \"for many years.\" Drug tests to screen for illegal drug use are typically part of the security clearance process, according to the Defense Intelligence Agency.",
      "In his letter to Mr. Trump, Lynch said the president's potential knowledge of any drug use by Musk while he worked in the White House \"deserves scrutiny.\"",
      "\"Given his prominent role in the Trump administration, the American people deserve to know the history and extent of Mr. Musk's drug use and any influence illicit drugs may have had on his efforts to illegally and recklessly dismantle our government,\" he wrote. \"If Mr. Musk is struggling with substance abuse, it is my hope that he gets the assistance and treatment he needs.\"",
      "In addition to seeking information about whether Musk used illegal drugs during his stint in the administration, Lynch also asked whether the billionaire consumed illicit substances on the White House campus or in federal buildings, and what Mr. Trump or his campaign knew about Musk's alleged drug use during the 2024 campaign.",
      "Musk was brought on as a special government employee to help with Mr. Trump's initiative aimed at drastically scaling back the size of the federal government. While working as a senior adviser to the president, Musk attended Cabinet meetings and traveled with the president.",
      "The cost-cutting efforts undertaken by DOGE, which Mr. Trump has said Musk led, included plans to lay off thousands of federal workers, the dismantling of federal agencies like the U.S. Agency for International Development and the termination of federal grants, contracts and leases.",
      "Many of DOGE's actions, as well as Musk's role with the administration, have been challenged in the federal courts. The Supreme Court is weighing a request to allow the administration's sweeping layoffs of federal employees, while a federal district court in Maryland found Musk and DOGE's shutdown of USAID was likely unconstitutional. The Justice Department has appealed that decision.",
      "A federal judge in Washington has also allowed a challenge to Musk's actions to proceed.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Jun 2025 18:28:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Two Chinese researchers were charged with trying to smuggle strains of a fungus called Fusarium graminearum into the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "The fungus labeled a \"potential agroterrorism weapon\" in a recent arrest touted by the Trump administration likely originated in North America and is already widely prevalent around the country, a researcher who studied the fungus for the federal government says.",
      "University of Michigan researcher Yunqing Jian and her boyfriend, Zunyong Liu, were charged with trying to smuggle strains of a fungus called Fusarium graminearum into the United States. Jian worked at the University of Michigan, according to officials, and Liu works at a Chinese university. The two have co-authored research into the fungus.",
      "\"I can confirm that the FBI arrested a Chinese national within the United States who allegedly smuggled a dangerous biological pathogen into the country,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said Tuesday in a post\u00a0on X.",
      "According to charging documents in the case, Liu told customs officers he was trying to continue his research with the strains at the University of Michigan lab that Jian worked in, skirting the rules that require paperwork and safeguards to safely import fungi for studies.",
      "F. graminearum is already widely prevalent across the U.S. in native grasses around the country as well as crops, scientists say. It spreads and thrives usually during wet weather, causing a common crop disease called Fusarium head blight or head scab, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service.",
      "\"It's extremely prevalent in North America. It likely arose in North America, so it's not like a foreign agent coming in. And it's already causing a lot of problems in U.S. agriculture,\" Harold Kistler, an adjunct professor at the University of Minnesota, told CBS News.",
      "Kistler said scientists believe F. graminearum likely originated in North America, because all of its closest relatives have been found on the continent.",
      "\"Graminearum itself is distributed worldwide, and likely because of the distribution of grain from North America worldwide,\" he said.",
      "Kistler previously worked as a researcher for the USDA's Agricultural Research Service, studying fungi like F. graminearum and the crop disease it causes. While at the agency, he co-authored research with Liu and Jian uncovering new molecular clues to how the disease might be mitigated.",
      "\"It's a real problem. The problem is because there's no naturally occurring resistance to the disease. And people have been trying for decades to find resistance. It's just a tough nut to crack,\" Kistler said of the head blight caused by F. graminearum.",
      "Farmers in the U.S. rely on a number of methods to mitigate the risk of F. graminearum, including the use of fungicides, though scientists have worried about the possibility of mutations that could make the fungicides less effective.",
      "\"The fungicides are not cheap. So it's extra cost to farmers. But it's worth it because, without it, their crops could be completely lost. Not only due to yield reduction, but because what grain they may have would be contaminated with these toxins,\" Kistler said.",
      "Billions of dollars were lost to epidemics caused by the fungus in the 1990s, researchers and agriculture officials estimate. The Food and Drug Administration monitors for the toxins that are produced by fungi like F. graminearum, including deoxynivalenol, also called vomitoxin or DON, which can cause vomiting and diarrhea in humans who ingest too much of it.",
      "\"It is not possible to completely avoid the presence of DON in wheat. DON is sometimes found in wheat grown under normal weather conditions, however, the fungus thrives in cool, wet conditions,\" the FDA said in a 2010 advisory to states and grain groups.",
      "Kistler said U.S. distributors also test grain for the presence of the toxins to prevent there being too much of it in the food supply.",
      "\"If it's too high, they will reject it. They won't buy it. Or they will reduce the amount that they'll pay for it. If it's just marginal, they can blend it with grain that doesn't have the toxin to get below the limit of what's considered safe,\" he said.",

      "Astronomers announced Wednesday they have discovered a massive planet orbiting a tiny star, a bizarre pairing that has stumped scientists.",
      "Most of the stars across the Milky Way are small red dwarfs like TOI-6894, which has only 20% the mass of our sun.",
      "It had not been thought possible that such puny, weak stars could provide the conditions needed to form and host huge planets.",
      "But an international team of astronomers have detected the unmistakable signature of a gas giant planet orbiting the undersized TOI-6894, according to a study in the journal Nature Astronomy. This makes the star the smallest star yet known to host a gas giant.",
      "The planet has a slightly larger radius than Saturn, but only half its mass. It orbits its star in a little over three days.",
      "The astronomers discovered the planet when searching through more than 91,000 low-mass red dwarfs observed by NASA's TESS space telescope. Its existence was then confirmed by ground-based telescopes, including Chile's Very Large Telescope.",
      "\"The fact that this star hosts a giant planet has big implications for the total number of giant planets we estimate exist in our galaxy,\" study co-author Daniel Bayliss of the UK's Warwick University said in a statement.",
      "Another co-author, Vincent Van Eylen, of University College London, said it was an \"intriguing discovery.\"",
      "\"We don't really understand how a star with so little mass can form such a massive planet!\" he said. \"This is one of the goals of the search for more exoplanets. By finding planetary systems different from our solar system, we can test our models and better understand how our own solar system formed.\"",
      "Planet is unusually cold",
      "The most prominent theory for how planets form is called core accretion.",
      "The process begins when a ring of gas and dust \u2014 called a protoplanetary disc \u2014 which surrounds a newly formed star builds up into a planetary core. This core attracts more gas that forms an atmosphere, eventually snowballing into a gas giant.",
      "Under this theory, it is difficult for low-mass stars to host giant planets because there is not enough gas and dust to begin building a core in the first place.",
      "A rival theory proposes that these planets instead form when their protoplanetary disc becomes gravitationally unstable and breaks up, with the collapsing gas and dust forming a planet.",
      "However neither theory seems to explain the existence of the newly discovered planet, TOI-6894b, the researchers said.",
      "The planet also interests scientists because it is strangely cold.",
      "Most of the gas giants discovered outside our solar system so far have been what are known as \"hot Jupiters,\" where temperatures soar well over 1,000 degrees Celsius. But the newly discovered planet appears to be under 150C, the researchers said.",
      "\"Temperatures are low enough that atmospheric observations could even show us ammonia, which would be the first time it is found in an exoplanet atmosphere,\" said study co-author Amaury Triaud of Birmingham University.",
      "The James Webb space telescope is scheduled to turn its powerful gaze toward the planet in the next year, which could help uncover some more mysteries of this strange planet.",
      "Recent cosmic discoveries",
      "The spotting of the giant planet orbiting the undersized star marks the latest in a string of recent celestial discoveries.",
      "Last month, a U.S.-based trio hunting the elusive \"Planet Nine\" said they instead stumbled on what appears to be a new dwarf planet in the solar system's outer reaches. Named 2017 OF201, the new object is roughly 430 miles across, according to a preprint study, making it three times smaller than Pluto.",
      "Also in May, an international team reported that a newly found celestial object \u2014 perhaps a star, pair of stars or something else entirely \u2014 is emitting X-rays around the same time it's shooting out radio waves.",
      "Meanwhile, scientists announced recently that a new planetarium show about the Milky Way helped them unlock one of the solar system's many secrets. Experts at the American Museum of Natural History in New York were fine-tuning a scene about the Oort Cloud that's far beyond Pluto. Scientists have never glimpsed this region, but when museum experts projected their scene onto the planetarium dome, created using simulation data, they saw a spiral shape.",

The show features many vivid scenes that may capture audiences more than the Oort Cloud, said the museum's Jon Parker, including an ongoing merge of the Sagittarius mini galaxy with the Milky Way.",
      "No matter how striking and beautiful the visuals of the show, the museum was committed to making it scientifically accurate. That's what created the perfect conditions to stumble upon something new, said the museum's Carter Emmart.",

    "summary": "If you're seeing a thick haze outside your window, it's likely air pollution. Here's how to find out what the air quality is near you.",
    "story": [
      "Smoke from wildfires in Canada has drifted into the U.S., prompting air quality alerts for Americans as it continues to spread.",
      "But when officials and forecasters classify a city's air as \"unhealthy\" or \"hazardous,\" what does that really mean? The classifications are based on a federal measurement system called the Air Quality Index.",
      "What is the Air Quality Index?",
      "The Air Quality Index is used nationwide to measure the severity of air pollution and categorize the health risks that are involved with various levels of pollution. The index uses six color-coded categories: good (green), moderate (yellow), unhealthy for sensitive groups (orange), unhealthy (red), very unhealthy (purple) and hazardous (maroon).",
      "The health impacts included in the index are those that people are likely to experience within \"a few hours or days\" after being exposed to the air, the National Weather Service Says.",
      "How is air quality measured?",
      "The National Weather Service says that the Environmental Protection Agency calculates the Air Quality Index \u2014 a value between 0 and 500 \u2014 based on five \"major pollutants.\"",
      "Those pollutants \u2014 ground-level ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide \u2014 are all regulated by the Clean Air Act. Of those, ground-level ozone and airborne particles are considered \"the greatest threat to human health.\"",
      "What do the numbers mean?",
      "Each Air Quality Index category, also known as the level of concern, is attached to a certain range of values:",
      "Good (green): 0 to 50Moderate (yellow): 51 to 100Unhealthy for sensitive groups (orange): 101 to 150Unhealthy (red): 151 to 200\u00a0Very unhealthy (purple): 201 to 300\u00a0Hazardous (marron): 301 and higher",
      "Good (green): 0 to 50",

      "Unhealthy for sensitive groups (orange): 101 to 150",
      "Unhealthy (red): 151 to 200",
      "Very unhealthy (purple): 201 to 300",
      "Hazardous (marron): 301 and higher",
      "Essentially, the lower the number, the cleaner the air. The only category where air quality is considered \"satisfactory\" is the one where the index value is no more than 50, although values between 51 and 100 are still considered \"acceptable.\" After that, the air could pose a risk to at least some people, and that risk only becomes greater as the index value rises.",
      "Once the air is deemed \"very unhealthy,\" the general public is at risk of experiencing health impacts, which range from a headache and fatigue to much more serious issues such as heart attack or stroke. At \"hazardous\" levels, the region is experiencing an air quality emergency. Those with chronic respiratory or cardiovascular conditions are more at risk of developing serious health issues as pollution worsens.",
      "What is the air quality near me?",
      "Air Quality Index values change constantly throughout the day as weather conditions and weather patterns move through the area. The map below automatically updates to show air quality conditions nationwide.",
      "The EPA's\u00a0AirNow.gov site uses the index to provide the latest status for your area. To use the site, enter your ZIP code and a meter will pop up showing you what the value and color category is for your city, as well as the last time that measurement was updated.",
      "It also tells you what pollutant is causing issues, who is most at risk for health complications and what activities may be safe to do.",
      "In Minneapolis, for example, the reading on Tuesday morning, June 3, said the AQI for PM2.5, a kind of particulate matter, is 203, meaning \"very unhealthy,\" and that people who have heart or lung disease, those who are elderly, and children and teens should avoid outdoor physical activity.

      "\"Why is there a spiral there?\" said Jackie Faherty, an astrophysicist who leads the museum's educational programs and helped put together the planetarium show.",
      "The inner section of the Oort Cloud, made of billions of comets, resembled a bar with two waving arms, similar to the shape of our Milky Way galaxy.",
      "Scientists had long thought the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, warped by the push and pull of other planets and the Milky Way itself. The planetarium show hinted that a more complex shape could lie inside.",
      "The museum contacted the researcher who provided the Oort Cloud data for the show, who was also surprised to see the spiral.",
      "\"It's kind of a freak accident that it actually happened,\" said David Nesvorny with the Southwest Research Institute.",
      "Realizing they'd stumbled on something new, the researchers published their findings earlier this year in The Astrophysical Journal.",

      "The discovery, relying on data on how celestial objects move and using simulations, will be difficult to confirm with observations. But knowing more about the orbits of distant comets could give scientists some clues, Izidoro said.",
      "While putting together the planetarium show, the museum's experts weren't expecting a window into the universe's inner workings. The show features many vivid scenes that may capture audiences more than the Oort Cloud, said the museum's Jon Parker, including an ongoing merge of the Sagittarius mini galaxy with the Milky Way.",
      "No matter how striking and beautiful the visuals of the show, the museum was committed to making it scientifically accurate. That's what created the perfect conditions to stumble upon something new, said the museum's Carter Emmart.",
      "\"You just never know what you're going to find,\" Emmart said.",
      "According to the planetarium, \"Encounters in the Milky Way\" \u2014 narrated by actor Pedro Pascal \u2014 is a \"a time-traveling journey about the cosmic movements that shape our galactic neighborhood.\"",

      "In a memo signed Wednesday night, Mr. Trump told Attorney General Pam Bondi and the president's counsel to probe what he claimed was a \"conspiracy\" to \"abuse the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden's cognitive decline.\"",
      "The order cited a litany of executive actions by Biden \u2014 including pardons and federal judge appointments \u2014 and argued \"there are serious doubts as to the decision making process and even the degree of Biden's awareness of these actions being taken in his name.\"",

      "Last month, the Department of Homeland Security tried to take away Harvard's certification in the federal government's student visa database. A judge halted that policy after Harvard sued, with the school arguing the order was unconstitutional and would have an \"immediate and devastating effect for Harvard and more than 7,000 visa holders.\"",
      "And last week, the State Department ordered embassies and consulates to conduct \"additional vetting\" of anybody who wants to travel to Harvard \u2014 including current and prospective students, faculty, guest speakers and even tourists \u2014 according to an email obtained by CBS News.",
      "The Trump administration has feuded with Harvard for months, seeking to cut off billions in federal funding. The funding cutoffs came after\u00a0the school rejected the government's demands to change its disciplinary practices, end diversity, equity and inclusion programs and commission an external audit of some academic departments.",
      "The government has sharply criticized Harvard's handling of pro-Palestinian protests and alleged the school has failed to deal with antisemitism on campus. But Harvard argues it is being punished for First Amendment-protected speech.",
      "The administration has cracked down on international students beyond Harvard. It halted new student visa interviews last week in preparation for \"expanded social media vetting,\" and the State Department's email directing extra vetting for travelers to Harvard framed the policy as a \"pilot\" for other visa applicants.",
      "Meanwhile, thousands of foreign students who are already present in the U.S. have faced the termination of their student visa status, sometimes after appearing to get on the government's radar due to minor legal issues \u2014 though a judge blocked that policy.",
      "And some international students with links to pro-Palestinian activism have been detained under a rarely used law allowing visas to be revoked if someone's presence in the U.S. poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\" Judges ordered the release of two students on bond \u2014 Columbia University's Mohsen Mahdawi and Tufts University's Rumeysa Ozturk \u2014 but another Columbia activist, Mahmoud Khalil, remains detained.",

      "Led by almost entirely Gen Z players born between the late 1990s and early 2010s, the Oklahoma City Thunder and Indiana Pacers are among the youngest teams in NBA history to make it to the championship games. The Thunder entered the season as the youngest team, with an average age of 24.148, according to the NBA. The Pacers came in slightly older at 25.263, but the number is still below the league average for teams that make it to the Finals.",
      "The youngest team to win a championship was the Portland Trail Blazers nearly 50 years ago, with the average age of the team being just 25.03. They were led by then-24-year-old Bill Walton.",
      "Now, a new generation of rising stars includes Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Tyrese Haliburton, Chet Holmgren, and Bennedict Mathurin. The players themselves are aware of the shift this Finals represents.",
      "After the Pacers punched their ticket to the NBA Finals with a win in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals \u2014   their first trip to the Finals in 25 years \u2014 Myles Turner, who has been on the team the longest of anyone on the roster, reflected on what the 2025 playoffs could represent: \"It's a new blueprint for the league, man \u2026 I think the years of the super teams and stacking, it's not as effective as it once was.\"",
      "\"Since I've been in the league, the NBA is very trendy. It just shifts,\" he said. \"The new trend now is kind of what we're doing.\"",
      "The Oklahoma City Thunder dominated this year's regular season, finishing with a 68-14 record and securing the No.1 spot in the Western Conference. With the leadership of 2024-25 MVP Gilgeous-Alexander, they were able to mostly cruise through the playoffs, taking down a tough Mavericks team in seven games but easily handling the Timberwolves and the Grizzlies.",
      "The Thunder is the youngest team to have ever won 68 games in a single regular season, according to NBA statistics. If they win the 2025 championship, they would be the second youngest team to ever do so.",
      "The Pacers finished the regular season with a record of 50-32, and the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference. Tyrese Haliburton, 24, has been leading the team alongside standouts Mathurin, 22, and 25-year-old Andrew Nembhard.",
      "Both the Thunder and Pacers have built their rosters through strategic draft picks and trades.",
      "Oklahoma City's Gilgeous-Alexander arrived via trade in 2019, when he was a rising prospect. While first-round picks Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren arrived in 2022 together. The Indiana Pacers had a similar blueprint, trading for Haliburton in 2022 and drafting Nembhard and Mauthrin in the following years.",
      "Both teams are now in the finals without having signed any of the marquee veteran players when they were available on the market.",
      "The generation that grew up fully with the internet is now reshaping NBA history. Together, these teams are carving out a new lane, bringing fresh energy and excitement to the younger fan base by connecting with their fans on social media.",
      "Both teams have been posting more content related to games on platforms like Instagram, X and TikTok, where the younger generation is, drawing on OKC's \"Loud City\" and the Pacers' \"Pacer Nation.\"",
      "In a league where veterans like LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Steph Curry traditionally dominate the court, this year feels like a passing of the torch.",

    "summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. asked the FDA \"to review the latest data on mifepristone\u200b,\" but experts say concerns about the abortion pill's safety are misguided.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has asked Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary \"to review the latest data on mifepristone,\" raising questions about the drug commonly referred to as the abortion pill.",
      "A spokesperson for the FDA confirmed the plans in a statement to CBS News Tuesday, but did not respond to questions about when the review is scheduled to start and what exactly it will be reviewing about the medication.",
      "According to a letter published on social media Monday by Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Makary's review aims to closely monitor the drug's safety. But experts say concerns about its safety are misguided, fueled in part by a report from the Ethics and Public Policy Center, an advocacy group that promotes religious traditions and is funded by multiple right-wing organizations.",
      "Mifepristone, which is taken with a second drug, misoprostol, to end an early pregnancy, was first approved by the FDA in 2000 after \"a thorough and comprehensive review\" determined it was safe and effective, the agency says. Periodic reviews since its approval have not found new safety concerns, according to the FDA.",
      "In the Ethics and Public Policy Center report, which was not published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, the authors, who don't have medical training, claim the pill harms women, causing 1 in 10 patients to experience what they call a \"serious adverse event,\" including hemorrhage, ER visits, ectopic pregnancy and an undefined category of \"abortion-specific complications.\"",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said some of the instances described as \"adverse events\" are questionable.",
      "\"When you have a medication abortion, you bleed. That is normal. That is not an adverse event unless the bleeding is so significant that a woman needs a transfusion,\" she explained. \"It is to be expected that not all medication abortions will successfully eliminate the pregnancy. A surgical abortion after incomplete/failed medication abortion should not be considered an adverse event. ... An ectopic pregnancy is not caused by mifepristone and should not be considered a serious adverse event.\"",
      "Gounder added that the report lacks transparency and doesn't disclose the data source, meaning no one can reproduce and verify the findings, something Kennedy himself said he's a proponent of, noting in his confirmation hearings that he wants to replicate studies.",
      "It also lacks a comparison group, Gounder said, which is important for examining how experiences compare to pregnant women who did not take the drug.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the makers of the generic and brand name of mifepristone for comment.",
      "While it's unclear whether the latest review of the drug will impact access, this isn't the first time it has come under fire.",
      "In 2024, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge targeting the availability of the widely used pill, preserving access to the drug in its first major abortion-related ruling since the reversal of Roe v. Wade. If the challengers had prevailed, the ruling would have restricted access to mifepristone nationwide, even in states where abortion is legal.",
      "The justices unanimously ruled that the anti-abortion rights doctors and medical associations who brought the lawsuit against the FDA did not have the legal right to do so. They did not address whether the FDA acted lawfully when it took a series of steps in 2016 and 2021 that relaxed the rules for mifepristone's use.",
      "Makary had previously said that he had \"no plans to take action on mifepristone,\" which has been a target of abortion opponents and conservatives who have called on the FDA to reconsider its approval.",
      "Since it was approved, mifepristone has been taken by more than 5 million patients, according to the FDA. Medication abortions made up more than half of all abortions in the United States health care system in 2023, a study from the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research group, found.",

      "In a post on X on Tuesday, Musk called the bill \"outrageous\" and \"pork-filled,\" arguing that it's a \"a disgusting abomination\" and lambasting congressional Republicans for supporting it. The post was only the beginning of a slew of comments from Musk, who called for a new bill to be drafted on Wednesday as the onslaught continued.",

      "The Kansas Republican said Musk came up at the White House meeting for a \"laughing conversation for 30 seconds\" and that Mr. Trump is \"absolutely not\" concerned about his criticism.",
      "The criticism from Musk comes almost six months after he successfully\u00a0torpedoed a measure to fund the government in December, forcing lawmakers back to the drawing board. But this time around, with Musk having recently departed from his role as a Special Government Employee, the criticism has not had the same effect.",

Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who had already expressed serious concerns that spending cuts don't go far enough. Other Republicans, like Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, voiced understanding for Musk's views on Wednesday. But she cast doubt on whether the criticism would sway her colleagues.",
      "\"I think that those of us who share concerns that there are inadequate reductions in the bill knew that before Elon Musk said that,\" Lummis said. \"Those who disagree with him disagreed before he said that. So I don't think it changed any views in the Republican Party in the Senate.\"",
      "Senate GOP leadership has already been contending with opposition from the fiscal hawks, along with a handful of other senators who oppose Medicaid restrictions, among other things. Key GOP senators have been conducting meetings in recent days to iron out the disagreement, with opposition from just four Senate Republicans enough to tank the bill.",

      "The fungus labeled a \"potential agroterrorism weapon\" in a recent arrest touted by the Trump administration likely originated in North America and is already widely prevalent around the country, a researcher who studied the fungus for the federal government says.",
      "University of Michigan researcher Yunqing Jian and her boyfriend, Zunyong Liu, were charged with trying to smuggle strains of a fungus called Fusarium graminearum into the United States. Jian worked at the University of Michigan, according to officials, and Liu works at a Chinese university. The two have co-authored research into the fungus.",
      "\"I can confirm that the FBI arrested a Chinese national within the United States who allegedly smuggled a dangerous biological pathogen into the country,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said Tuesday in a post\u00a0on X.",
      "According to charging documents in the case, Liu told customs officers he was trying to continue his research with the strains at the University of Michigan lab that Jian worked in, skirting the rules that require paperwork and safeguards to safely import fungi for studies.",
      "F. graminearum is already widely prevalent across the U.S. in native grasses around the country as well as crops, scientists say. It spreads and thrives usually during wet weather, causing a common crop disease called Fusarium head blight or head scab, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service.",
      "\"It's extremely prevalent in North America. It likely arose in North America, so it's not like a foreign agent coming in. And it's already causing a lot of problems in U.S. agriculture,\" Harold Kistler, an adjunct professor at the University of Minnesota, told CBS News.",
      "Kistler said scientists believe F. graminearum likely originated in North America, because all of its closest relatives have been found on the continent.",
      "\"Graminearum itself is distributed worldwide, and likely because of the distribution of grain from North America worldwide,\" he said.",
      "Kistler previously worked as a researcher for the USDA's Agricultural Research Service, studying fungi like F. graminearum and the crop disease it causes. While at the agency, he co-authored research with Liu and Jian uncovering new molecular clues to how the disease might be mitigated.",
      "\"It's a real problem. The problem is because there's no naturally occurring resistance to the disease. And people have been trying for decades to find resistance. It's just a tough nut to crack,\" Kistler said of the head blight caused by F. graminearum.",
      "Farmers in the U.S. rely on a number of methods to mitigate the risk of F. graminearum, including the use of fungicides, though scientists have worried about the possibility of mutations that could make the fungicides less effective.",
      "\"The fungicides are not cheap. So it's extra cost to farmers. But it's worth it because, without it, their crops could be completely lost. Not only due to yield reduction, but because what grain they may have would be contaminated with these toxins,\" Kistler said.",
      "Billions of dollars were lost to epidemics caused by the fungus in the 1990s, researchers and agriculture officials estimate. The Food and Drug Administration monitors for the toxins that are produced by fungi like F. graminearum, including deoxynivalenol, also called vomitoxin or DON, which can cause vomiting and diarrhea in humans who ingest too much of it.",
      "\"It is not possible to completely avoid the presence of DON in wheat. DON is sometimes found in wheat grown under normal weather conditions, however, the fungus thrives in cool, wet conditions,\" the FDA said in a 2010 advisory to states and grain groups.",
      "Kistler said U.S. distributors also test grain for the presence of the toxins to prevent there being too much of it in the food supply.",
      "\"If it's too high, they will reject it. They won't buy it. Or they will reduce the amount that they'll pay for it. If it's just marginal, they can blend it with grain that doesn't have the toxin to get below the limit of what's considered safe,\" he said.",

      "Anthropic said in a statement that it disagreed with Reddit's claims \"and will defend ourselves vigorously.\"",
      "Reddit filed the lawsuit Wednesday in California Superior Court in San Francisco, where both companies are based.",

      "Those agreements \"enable us to enforce meaningful protections for our users, including the right to delete your content, user privacy protections, and preventing users from being spammed using this content,\" Lee said.",
      "The licensing deals also helped the 20-year-old online platform raise money ahead of its Wall Street debut as a publicly traded company last year Among those who stood to benefit was OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who accumulated a stake as an early Reddit investor that made him one of the company's biggest shareholders.",
      "Claude and Alexa",
      "Anthropic was formed by former OpenAI executives in 2021 and its flagship Claude chatbot remains a key competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT. While OpenAI has close ties to Microsoft, Anthropic's primary commercial partner is Amazon, which is using Claude to improve its widely used Alexa voice assistant.",
      "Much like other AI companies, Anthropic has relied heavily on websites such as Wikipedia and Reddit that are deep troves of written materials that can help teach an AI assistant the patterns of human language.",
      "In a 2021 paper co-authored by Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei \u2014 cited in the lawsuit \u2014 researchers at the company identified the subreddits, or subject-matter forums, that contained the highest quality AI training data, such as those focused on gardening, history, relationship advice or thoughts people have in the shower.",
      "Anthropic in 2023 argued in a letter to the U.S. Copyright Office that the \"way Claude was trained qualifies as a quintessentially lawful use of materials,\" by making copies of information to perform a statistical analysis of a large body of data. It is already battling a lawsuit from major music publishers alleging that Claude regurgitates the lyrics of copyrighted songs.",
      "But Reddit's lawsuit is different from others brought against AI companies because it doesn't allege copyright infringement. Instead, it focuses on the alleged breach of Reddit's terms of use, and the unfair competition, it says, was created.",

      "House Republicans are aiming to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending to offset trillions in tax cuts, while also raising the debt ceiling by $4 trillion. The CBO projection puts the spending cuts at about $1.2 trillion over the next decade, with the tax cuts totaling just under $3.7 trillion. The national debt currently stands at roughly $36 trillion, according to the Treasury Department.",
      "The package, which Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers refer to as the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" is now in the hands of the Senate after making it out of the House before Memorial Day. The bill is expected to undergo changes in the Senate before heading back to the lower chamber.",
      "Though Republicans vowed to protect Medicaid benefits and have framed cuts to the program as trimming \"waste, fraud and abuse,\" the analysis found that the portion of the bill dealing with Medicaid would mean 7.8 million fewer people being enrolled in the safety net program. Federal spending on Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act would be reduced by $902 billion over a decade.",
      "Another 1.3 million people would be without insurance due to changes in the Affordable Care Act. The bill would also eliminate state-funded insurance for 1.4 million people \"without verified citizenship, nationality, or satisfactory immigration status,\" the CBO said.",
      "Medicaid, a popular entitlement program, provides government-sponsored health care for more than 70 million low-income adults, children and people with disabilities. The House bill includes new work requirements that would apply to childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 19 and 64, more frequent eligibility checks and changes to how states can finance their share of the costs of the program.",
      "Cuts to federal food assistance programs, which includes Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, would save more than $294 billion over 10 years, according to the analysis.

      "The ice battery system freezes water at night when the cost of electricity is low. Then, during the day, when the price is high, the building is cooled with the previous night's ice instead of using expensive electricity. Trane says that this system can lower cooling costs by up to 40%.",
      "\"So, when everyone else is using their electricity in the middle of July to cool their building or to cool their homes, it's a big draw on the grid,\" Paeper said. \"This building won't draw from that because it made its ice last night.\"",
      "Air conditioning makes up about 20% of energy use in homes and businesses worldwide, according to a 2018 report from the International Energy Agency. But on the hottest days, it can account for more than 70% of electricity use during peak hours, per a 2023 IEA report.",

      "So, instead of building more power plants, the focus is on storing energy with a system such as ice batteries. But because the process of freezing water uses a lot of energy itself, Shamberger and others are testing new materials that don't need to get as cold as ice, but can still keep buildings cool.",
      "\"We take water, we add some other elements and molecules to it,\" Shamberger explained. \"And based on the composition, we can control that temperature basically anywhere we want it, in the zero to 20 C range. And that's important, because what might work great here in Texas, maybe it's not the right temperature to store your heat at if you're in Nevada, or in Wisconsin, say.\"",
      "According to an analysis released last month by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, a Washington, D.C.-based energy advocacy group, home electricity bills in the U.S. this summer are expected to rise to an average of $784 for the summer period, from June through September, up 6.2% from last year's projected average of $737.",

      "Mr. Trump said the sweeping entry restrictions were necessary to address concerns related to terrorism in the countries listed in the order, inadequate vetting of the affected nationals and the lack of cooperation on deportations among some of the nations.",
      "\"President Trump is fulfilling his promise to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors that want to come to our country and cause us harm. These commonsense restrictions are country-specific and include places that lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates, or fail to share identity and threat information.

      "He said the list could be revised if countries make material improvements, and new countries could be added as threats emerge.",

      "In the first month of his first term, January 2017, Mr. Trump signed a travel ban restricting the entry of most citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The move triggered widespread outcry, chaos at airports and legal challenges from advocates who argued the ban was discriminatory.",

    "summary": "Erin Patterson spoke Wednesday about the July 2023 lunch and offered her explanations on how she planned the meal that killed three of her four guests who ate it.",
    "story": [
      "An Australian woman accused of serving poisonous death cap mushrooms in a dish that killed three of her four guests who ate it spoke Wednesday about the incident and detailed how she planned the meal.",
      "Prosecutors in the Supreme Court case in the state of Victoria say Erin Patterson, 50, lured her guests to lunch in July 2023 with a lie about having cancer, before deliberately feeding them toxic fungi. But her lawyers say the tainted beef Wellington that Patterson served was a tragic accident caused by a mushroom storage mishap.",
      "Patterson denies murdering her estranged husband's parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and their relative, Heather Wilkinson. The mother of two also denies attempting to murder Heather's husband, Ian Wilkinson, who survived the meal. If convicted, Patterson faces life in prison for murder and 25 years for attempted murder.",
      "In a rare step for a defendant charged with murder, Patterson chose to speak in her own defense at her trial this week.",
      "On Wednesday, she spoke publicly for the first time about the fateful lunch and offered her explanations on how she planned the meal and didn't become sick herself.",
      "Adding more mushrooms to a \"bland\" meal",
      "No one disputes that Patterson served death cap mushrooms to her guests for lunch in the rural town of Leongatha, but she says she did it unknowingly.",
      "Patterson said Wednesday she splurged on expensive ingredients and researched ideas to find \"something special\" to serve. She deviated from her chosen recipe to improve the \"bland\" flavor, she said.",
      "She believed she was adding dried fungi bought from an Asian supermarket from a container in her pantry, she told the court.",
      "\"Now I think that there was a possibility that there were foraged ones in there as well,\" she told her lawyer, Colin Mandy. Patterson had foraged wild mushrooms for years, she told the court Tuesday, and had put some in her pantry weeks before the deaths.",
      "The accused says she 'shouldn't have lied' about cancer",
      "Patterson, who formally separated from her husband Simon Patterson in 2015, said she felt \"hurt\" when Simon told her the night before the lunch that he \"wasn't comfortable\" attending.",
      "She had earlier told his relatives that she'd arranged the meal to discuss her health. Patterson admitted this week that she never had cancer \u2014 but after a health scare, she told her in-laws she did.",
      "In reality, Patterson said she intended to have weight loss surgery. But she was too embarrassed to tell anybody and planned to pretend to her in-laws that she was undergoing cancer treatment instead, she said.",
      "\"I was ashamed of the fact that I didn't have control over my body or what I ate,\" a tearful Patterson said Wednesday. \"I didn't want to tell anybody, but I shouldn't have lied to them.\"",
      "Patterson says she threw up her mushroom meal",
      "The accused said she believes she was spared the worst effects of the poisoned meal because she self-induced vomiting shortly after her lunch guests left. She had binged on most of a cake and then made herself throw up \u2014 a problem she said she had struggled with for decades.",
      "Patterson also said she believes she had eaten enough of the meal to cause her subsequent diarrhea. She then sought hospital treatment but unlike her lunch guests, she quickly recovered.",
      "At the hospital where her guests' health was deteriorating, her estranged husband asked her about the dehydrator she used to dry her foraged mushrooms, she said.",
      "\"Is that how you poisoned my parents?\" she said Simon Patterson asked her.",
      "Growing afraid she would be blamed for the poisoning and that her children would be taken from her, Patterson said she later disposed of her dehydrator. She told investigators she'd never owned one and hadn't foraged for mushrooms before.",
      "While still at the hospital, she insisted she'd bought all the mushrooms at stores, even though she said she knew it was possible that foraged mushrooms had accidentally found their way into the meal.",
      "She was too frightened to tell anyone, Patterson said.",
      "Also later, Patterson said she remotely wiped her cellphone while it sat in an evidence locker to remove pictures of mushrooms she'd foraged.",
      "Prosecutors argued in opening their case in April that she poisoned her husband's family on purpose, although they didn't suggest a motive. She carefully avoided poisoning herself and faked being ill, they said.",
      "The trial continues on Thursday with Patterson's cross-examination by the prosecutors."

    "summary": "At 37 she became the world's youngest female head of government. Now a fellow at Harvard University, Jacinda Ardern talks about the importance of exhibiting kindness and empathy in politics.",
    "story": [
      "These days, at her local coffee shop near Boston, Jacinda Ardern can be just another customer. \"I don't put my name on the order; it's too complicated!\" she laughed.",
      "I asked, \"When you order coffee here, do people start talking politics with you?\"",
      "\"No. Not at all,\" Ardern replied. \"In fact, the guy behind the counter said to me, 'Ah, you are really familiar. Oh, I know: Toni Collette!'\"",
      "That's a moment that would never happen in New Zealand, where Ardern became the world's youngest female head of government when she was just 37 years old. Now 44, former Prime Minister Ardern has been living in the U.S. since she left office two years ago. She is serving as a fellow at Harvard University, and has written a new book, \"A Different Kind of Power\" (to be published June 3 by Crown).",
      "Of the title, she says, \"I think, you know, there are different ways to lead. But I hope you also see that some of those character traits that we perhaps bring to it that we might believe to be weaknesses \u2013 imposter syndrome, or even empathy \u2013 actually are incredible strengths.\"",
      "Ardern says her story is about finding her voice in New Zealand, a small nation of about five million people. \"I never, ever saw myself becoming prime minister, ever,\" she said.",
      "In fact, her father told Ardern that she was too \"thin-skinned\" for politics.",
      "Was he right? \"He was absolutely right!\" she laughed. \"But I guess where I corrected him is, your sensitivity is your empathy. And goodness, don't we need a bit more of that?\"",
      "In New Zealand, the answer was yes. Ahead of the 2017 election, Ardern suddenly became the leader of her country's left-leaning Labour Party. Weeks after winning, she made an announcement: she was pregnant. Her journey, alongside her then-partner, now-husband, Clarke, soon won her global attention.",
      "Was she comfortable with the symbolism of her role? Ardern said, \"I realized the importance of it when I first received a letter from someone on their way to work to tell their boss that they were having a baby, and they felt nervous about their boss' view of whether they could do their job When she heard that I was pregnant, and that gave her a level of confidence, you know, I felt like I also needed to show I could do the job and be a mother.\"",
      "But those joyful early days were followed by challenges. In 2019, mass shootings targeting Muslims in Christchurch left more than 50 dead \u2013 a crucible for New Zealand, and a call to action for its leader: a ban on semi-automatic weapons.",
      "I asked, \"Why do you believe you and your colleagues in New Zealand were able to achieve gun control reform in the wake of a horrific mass shooting, but so often here in the United States such legislative changes have been hard to get?\"",
      "\"I can't speak to the U.S. experience,\" Ardern replied, \"but if we really wanted to say, 'We don't ever want this to happen again,' we needed to demonstrate what we were doing to make that a reality.\"",
      "But even after she won another election, things weren't easy. As the pandemic wore on, tensions flared over her government's COVID policies. In 2023, when she stunned many by deciding to resign, she wore her heart on her sleeve, telling Parliament: \"You can be a nerd, a cryer, a hugger, you can be all of these things, and not only can you be here, you can lead, just like me.\"",
      "Though she has left office, she has not stopped keeping a close eye on our turbulent ties. Asked what she makes of President Trump and his decisions on trade and foreign policy, Ardern said, \"You know, we are seeing people experience deep financial insecurity, and that has to be addressed by political leaders. But I continue to hold that ideas of isolation or protectionism or closing ourselves off to remedy the issue actually doesn't remedy it in the long term, and has a long-term negative impact for some of the collective issues we need to address as a global community.\"",
      "For now, Ardern is not angling to jump back into politics, but she is settling into her new normal \u2013 that is, \"Being just a normal family.\"",
      "And when she is asked for advice \u2013 in a Harvard classroom, or from a world leader \u2013 Jacinda Ardern tells them to be kind: \"That principle of kindness, it's something we teach our kids. Why shouldn't we role model that in the way that we conduct ourselves in politics? And secondly, if you're putting people at the center of what you're doing, it's a reminder that, actually, the act of being in politics is an act of public service as well. And I think voters need to see more of that.\"",

    "story": [
      "Toronto \u2014 At least 33,400 people have been forced to evacuate their homes in three Canadian provinces due to active wildfires that are sending smoke drifting across the border into northern U.S. states and all the way across the Atlantic to Europe. As of Wednesday two deaths were blamed on the blazes.",
      "Officials have declared a state of emergency in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, where crews and military forces were battling this week to try to contain dozens of out-of-control fires.",
      "Some 17,000 people got evacuation orders in Manitoba alone, many of them seeking shelter in Winnipeg, while others were put up in hotels in Niagara Falls, in neighboring Ontario province.",
      "\"This is the largest evacuation Manitoba will have seen in most people's living memory,\" Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew said during a news conference on May 29.",
      "All of Manitoba was under an \"extreme fire danger\" warning on Tuesday, according to the regional government. The Canadian armed forces were assisting with the evacuation of two separate Indigenous communities in the province.",
      "Kinwew confirmed that two people in the small town of Lac du Bonnet were killed, representing the first civilian casualties from wildfires in Manitoba's recent history, according to regional media reports.",
      "In Saskatchewan, about 15,000 people had been evacuated by Tuesday, according to the province's top public official.",
      "\"We didn't have a very good day yesterday, with the weather the way it was, where the fires are and just how aggressive they are as they bear down on communities,\" Saskatchewan premier Scott Moe said Tuesday, according to The Canadian Press news agency. \"We're probably approaching in the neighborhood of 15,000 people that have been evacuated across the province and being supported in communities throughout Saskatchewan, and more families are leaving their homes as we speak.\"",
      "In Alberta, more than 1,400 people were ordered to evacuate to shelters provided in hotels and other temporary accommodations. The province had 56 active wildfires as of Tuesday, 27 of them deemed out of control.",
      "Conditions did improve slightly, with cooler temperatures and higher humidity helping firefighters in Alberta, according to an update shared Tuesday by provincial officials.",
      "As of Tuesday, there were 21 active wildfires in Saskatchewan, according to the province's Public Safety Agency, including eight deemed completely uncontained.",
      "In Manitoba, there were 27 active fires on Tuesday, nine of them considered out of control, which is above the average for this time of year.",
      "According to the province's fire situation report, most of those fires were caused by human activity. As a precaution, Manitoba parks were advised to prepare for potential evacuations.",
      "Canada's wildfire season typically begins in April and lasts until late September, with most activity occurring in June and July. In recent years, however, it has started as early as February, due to warmer weather and drier conditions.",
      "Smoke from the wildfires has been impacting air quality in several U.S. states, including Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. The smoke had reached parts of western Europe, too, according to climate monitoring services.",
      "\"Smoke originating from the wildfires in the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan has been transported across the Atlantic, reaching Europe during the last few days with forecasts showing further smoke transport this week,\" according to a statement published Tuesday by the European Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS).",
      "Firefighters, emergency crews and aircraft from other provinces, and from the U.S., were on their way to help fight the wildfires in Canada.",
      "\"I've never seen anything like it, in the way of the ferocity of the fires, how quickly they're moving, how they're changing and encroaching on communities,\" Moe, the Saskatchewan premier whose home is lives close to some of the active fires, said according to national broadcaster CBC.",
      "While Alberta was seeing a slightly improved picture, in Manitoba and Saskatchewan, the forecast for the coming days was for strong winds and no precipitation, meaning little expected relief for the teams battling the fires.",
      "Canada faced its worst wildfire season on record in 2023. Eight firefighters were killed and a record 18 million acres scorched, making the blazes the biggest single emitter of carbon in the world that year.",

    "story": [
      "A World War II pilot who was remembered for helping fellow servicemembers survive the plane crash that killed him has been accounted for, military officials said this week.",
      "Army Air Forces 1st Lt. Charles W. McCook, 23, of Georgetown, Texas, was a member of the 22nd Bombardment Squadron (Medium), 341st Bombardment Group (Medium), 10th Air Force during World War II, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said in a news release. Before joining the military, McCook had graduated from Southwestern University and came from a family of pilots, according to local newspaper clippings gathered by the DPAA.",
      "McCook, nicknamed \"Woody,\" served in China and Burma, according to newspaper clippings. He was one of 20 officers and enlisted men credited for a mission that air-dropped supplies to Allied forces battling Japanese troops in northern Burma. During his service, McCook received the Air Medal and the Distinguished Flying Cross, according to newspaper clippings.",
      "On August 3, 1943, McCook was the armor-gunner on the B-25C \"Mitchell,\" conducting a low-altitude bombing raid over Meiktila, Burma, the DPAA said. The raid was meant to target the Meiktila dam and nearby Japanese barracks, according to a newspaper clipping.",
      "The aircraft crashed during the mission. McCook and three others aboard the plane died, but two men survived. One of the survivors, identified in newspaper clippings as Sgt. John Boyd, said the plane had been hit by an explosive gas shell while flying at a low altitude. McCook, who Boyd recalled \"as the best in the business,\" was able to bring the damaged plane up to an altitude that allowed Boyd and the other surviving soldier to parachute from the craft before it crashed.",
      "Boyd said this action allowed him to survive. He and the other soldier were taken captive by Japanese forces, the DPAA said. Boyd spent two years as a prisoner in Rangoon before he was freed, according to newspaper clippings.",
      "McCook's remains were not recovered. He was eventually listed as missing in action. In 1947, after World War II ended, the American Grave Registration Service recovered four sets of remains from a common grave near a village in Burma, the DPAA said.",
      "Locals said the four sets of remains, designated X-282A-D, were from an \"American crash,\" the DPAA said. But the remains were not identified at the time. They were interred as \"Unknowns\" at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, or the Punchbowl, in Honolulu, Hawaii. McCook's name was listed on the Walls of the Missing at the Manila American Cemetery and Memorial in the Philippines.",
      "In January 2022, the DPAA disinterred all four sets of remains and taken to the agency's laboratory. Dental, anthropological and isotope analyses were conducted. Other military agencies used mitochondrial DNA analysis and genome sequencing data to help identify the remains. The processes allowed the DPAA to identify one of the sets of remains as belonging to McCook.",
      "Now that McCook has been accounted for, a rosette has been placed next to his name on the Walls of the Missing. He will be buried in his hometown in August 2025, the DPAA said.",

    "summary": "The controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has halted its work for a day and is asking Israel to reduce the risks for Palestinians seeking access to its sites.",
    "story": [
      "The controversial U.S.-backed humanitarian aid operation in Gaza, which has been mired by reports of dozens of Palestinians being killed trying to reach its distribution hubs in the war-torn enclave since it started work just over a week ago, said it was pausing its operations for Wednesday. The\u00a0Gaza Humanitarian Foundation\u00a0said in a statement posted on social media that the pause was \"for update, organization, and efficiency improvement work,\" but a spokesperson for the group said it was working to address security concerns.",
      "GHF said in its brief statement that operations would resume on Thursday.",
      "The United Nations and other aid agencies have refused to work with the group, calling it a distraction and accusing it of weaponizing access to desperately needed food. More than 50 people have been killed by Israeli forces near the sites, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health, which has called the GHF effort a trap for hungry Palestinians.",
      "The Israeli military has denied the accusations and accused Hamas of shooting at people seeking aid.",
      "The funding, operational details and origins of the GHF have remained murky since its inception, and it has been plagued not only by grave questions about security for civilians accessing its hubs, but by potentially existential issues regarding its internal operations.",
      "The move comes just days after GHF said it would shutter its Switzerland-based office after officials there told CBS News the foundation was violating Swiss rules for non-governmental organizations. It also comes just a day after\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0reported that U.S.-based consulting firm Boston Global had severed its ties with the group and launched an internal review over its involvement with GHF.",
      "GHF said it began work in Gaza on May 27, but it remains unclear where it is based and who is funding its operations. Its official\u00a0website\u00a0consists only of a homepage bearing its name and the message: \"More information coming soon.\"",
      "A GHF spokesperson told CBS News in a statement sent Wednesday that the group was \"actively engaged in discussions with\" Israel's military aimed at enhancing security \"beyond the immediate perimeter of GHF sites.\"",
      "The organization said it had asked the Israel Defense Forces to \"guide foot traffic in a way that minimizes confusion or escalation risks\" around its ongoing military operations in Gaza, to offer clearer guidance for civilians seeking to reach its distribution hubs, and to \"enhance IDF force training and refine internal IDF procedures to support safety.\"",
      "\"Our top priority remains ensuring the safety and dignity of civilians receiving aid,\" the spokesperson said in the statement, which was also shared with other news outlets.",
      "Health officials in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip said 27 Palestinians were killed trying to reach a GHF hub in southern Gaza on Tuesday alone. The Israeli military denied the claim of mass shooting at civilians, saying troops about a third of a mile away from the site had fired at several people who were deemed to present a threat after they strayed beyond the defined boundaries of the access route. The IDF said it was looking into the reports of civilian casualties.",
      "In a\u00a0message posted\u00a0Wednesday on social media in Arabic, IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee warned Gazans against using the roads leading to GHF distribution centers, saying they would be considered \"combat zones\" for the day and stressing that access to them was \"prohibited and dangerous.\"",
      "The IDF has repeatedly accused Hamas of sabotaging the GHF effort, accusing it of sending gunmen specifically to shoot at civilians at the aid hubs.",
      "\"We are not preventing Gaza residents from accessing aid distribution sites,\" IDF spokesperson Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin said in a video statement posted online Tuesday, before the one-day pause was reported. \"Food packages are being distributed daily by a U.S.-based civilian company. This initiative is proving effective. Gazan residents are coming to the distribution centers to receive the aid. The civilian population of Gaza understands that Hamas is not taking care of them \u2014 on the contrary, Hamas is actively trying to prevent them from receiving the aid.\"",
      "Defrin said IDF forces \"operate nearby and do whatever is necessary to ensure that the aid does not fall into the hands of Hamas.\"",
      "He also accused the United Nations' aid agencies of failing to collect and distribute more than 450 trucks carrying humanitarian aid that Israel says were allowed into Gaza in recent days but left waiting on the other side of the Kerem Shalom border crossing with Israel. The U.N. has rejected similar previous Israeli claims, noting that Israeli forces maintain control over virtually all of Gaza and that there are huge logistics challenges to operating in a densely populated active warzone.",
      "And the IDF's assault, which Israel has vowed to continue until Hamas is destroyed and the remaining 58 Israeli hostages are brought back home from Gaza, has continued to ramp up despite the U.S.-backed aid effort.",
      "CBS News' team in Gaza was there as Palestinians rushed to rescue survivors of an Israeli strike that destroyed a bank in Gaza City where families had taken shelter. At least seven people were killed and dozens injured, according to first responders who spoke with CBS News at the scene. They were among 97 Palestinians killed over the preceding 24 hours alone, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, which put the overall death toll from the war at 54,607 as of Wednesday.",
      "The war was sparked by the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel orchestrated by Hamas, which has long been designated a terrorist group by the U.S., Israel and the European Union.",
      "That attack killed some 1,200 people in Israel and saw 251 others taken hostage into Gaza. Israeli authorities believe about 20 of the remaining hostages are still alive.",

      "A jury made up of five women convicted the three men of murder in a lightning trial that began Tuesday morning in the northern city of Chalatenango, said Oscar P\u00e9rez, lawyer for the Foundation Comunicandonos that represented the victims' families. P\u00e9rez said prosecutors had requested minimum 15-year prison sentences for all three.",
      "Convicted were former Defense Minister Gen. Jos\u00e9 Guillermo Garc\u00eda, 91, former treasury police director Col. Francisco Mor\u00e1n, 93, and Col. Mario Adalberto Reyes Mena, 85, who was the former army commander of the Fourth Infantry Brigade in Chalatenango.",
      "Garc\u00eda and Mor\u00e1n are under police guard at a private hospital in San Salvador, while Reyes Mena lives in the United States. In March, El Salvador's Supreme Court ordered that the extradition process be started to bring him back.",
      "P\u00e9rez said that in addition to the convictions of the former high-ranking officers, the judge condemned the government for the delayed justice and ordered the commander in chief of the armed forces, President Nayib Bukele, to issue a public apology to the victims.",
      "The Dutch TV journalists \u2014 Jan Kuiper, Koos Koster, Hans ter Laag and Joop Willemson \u2014 had linked up with leftist rebels and planned to spend several days behind rebel lines reporting. But Salvadoran soldiers armed with assault rifles and machine guns ambushed them and the guerrillas.",
      "Garc\u00eda was deported from the U.S. in 2016, after a U.S. judge declared him responsible for serious human rights violations during the early years of the war between the military and the leftist Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front guerrillas.",
      "The prosecution of the men was reopened in 2018 after the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a general amnesty passed following the 1980-1992 war.",
      "It moved slowly, but in March 2022, relatives of the victims and representatives of the Dutch government and European Union demanded that those responsible for killing Jan Kuiper, Koos Koster, Hans ter Laag and Joop Willemson be tried.",
      "Dutch Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp welcomed the convictions.",
      "\"This is an important moment in the fight against impunity and in the pursuit of justice for the four Dutch journalists and their next of kin,\" Veldkamp said in a message on social media.",
      "\"Grateful to the authorities of El Salvador and to all those who have worked tirelessly on this case,\" he added.",
      "According to Foundation Comunicandonos, Jan Kuiper died just two days before his 40th birthday and his colleague Hans ter Laag wrote a letter to his girlfriend shortly before the fatal trip, saying: \"My dear, this Wednesday the guerrillas will take us to the liberated zone. We are going to Chalatenango, where the armed struggle is taking place. It is a very dangerous trip and must be secret.\"",
      "Koos Koster studied theology in college and published several books about international politics, Foundation Comunicandonos said. The tombstone at his graveside features an image, made by his sister, depicting a biblical story and next to it the motto: \"Survival compels.\"",
      "Joop Willensen planned to marry his longtime partner, Yata Matsuzaki, in Mexico after his trip to El Salvador, she said.",
      "The United Nations Truth Commission for El Salvador, which was set up as part of a U.N.-brokered peace agreement in 1992, concluded there was clear evidence that the killings were the result of an ambush set up by Reyes Mena with the knowledge of other officials, based on an intelligence report that alerted of the journalists' presence.",

    "published": "Tue, 03 Jun 2025 14:51:47 -0400",
    "summary": "South Korea's voters cast their ballots in a snap presidential election sparked by the impeachment of Yoon Suk Yeol.",
    "story": [
      "Seoul, South Korea \u2014 Democratic Party candidate Lee Jae-myung was elected president of South Korea in a snap election sparked by the impeachment of the country's former leader, Yoon Suk Yeol. As of early Wednesday, Lee had a lead over his conservative rival Kim Moon-soo that was mathematically impossible to surpass.",
      "Kim conceded the race, telling reporters he \"humbly accepts the people's choice\" and gave Lee his congratulations.",
      "Lee didn't formally claim victory when he appeared earlier before supporters in the nation's capital, repeating his goals to reinvigorate the economy and unite the country.",
      "\"Let us move forward with hope and make a fresh start from this moment on,\" he said. \"Though we may have clashed for some time, even those who did not support us are still our fellow citizens of the Republic of Korea.\"",
      "An impressive 77.8% of the country's eligible voters turned up at polling stations Tuesday to cast their ballots. It was the highest turnout ever seen in a Korean election, and the country's media had said exit polls made a victory by Lee all but certain after the voting ended.",
      "Kim had recently served as the employment and labor minister in the Cabinet of former President Yoon, who was\u00a0impeached\u00a0over his brief but shocking imposition of martial law late last year.",
      "Lee's Democratic Party has been the primary opposition party for several years, but with the win of the South Korean presidency, the Democrats find themselves back in control of both the executive branch and the parliament, where they already have a majority of seats, for the first time since 2022.",
      "There has not been an elected president in office since Yoon was impeached late last year, so there will be no formal transition period. The inauguration ceremony for the 21st president of South Korea is set to be held Wednesday, just hours after the final votes were cast.",
      "South Koreans filled the streets around central government buildings in Seoul in December after Yoon suddenly declared martial law. He said the draconian measure was necessary given the level of political division in South Korea, and claiming communist forces were threatening the public peace and safety.",
      "But Yoon's definition of an enemy within changed, as he first said the communists infiltrating South Korean politics were North Koreans, but then said it was Chinese influence that warranted his martial law declaration.",
      "Many younger South Koreans bristled, and they came out in force in front of the parliament, urging lawmakers to impeach Yoon, who did maintain significant support, particularly among older and right-wing voters.",
      "His huge political gamble with the martial law declaration, and his subsequent refusal to leave office following his impeachment, is widely seen as having shifted many voters to Lee and the Democratic Party.",
      "Yoon beat Lee in the last presidential election in 2022, but by a razor-thin margin of only 247,077 votes.",
      "Who is Lee Jae-myung, South Korea's new leader?",
      "Lee is a veteran politician with 20 years of experience as an elected official.",
      "He will rely on that experience to help him navigate the power struggle between South Korea's longtime closest ally, the United States, and its neighbor China, as Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping engage in a trade war that has affected global markets.",
      "Lee vowed before the election that he would work to further develop the U.S.-South Korea relationship \"into a future-oriented, comprehensive strategic alliance.\"",
      "Lee also promised \"stable management of Korea-China relations, promotion of Korea-Russia diplomacy,\" and to prioritize South Korea's national interests.",
      "He has vowed to invest up to 100 trillion won (about $73 billion) to fund artificial intelligence work in the country, aiming to make South Korea one of the top three global AI powerhouses.",
      "But Lee has offered little in the way of firm, specific commitments, and many South Koreans remained unclear about what kind of diplomatic policies he might adopt when he takes the country's highest office.",
      "Before South Korea descended into internal political chaos in late 2024, the former conservative government had taken a hard line on North Korea and Kim Jong Un's isolated regime, fueling higher tension across the two countries' heavily militarized border.",
      "Lee takes office facing multiple ongoing criminal cases, including a $1 billion property development scandal, alleged illegal remittances sent to North Korea, and the alleged misuse of government credit cards.",
      "South Korean presidents do have a significant degree of immunity from criminal prosecution, though not from charges of treason or insurrection.",

    "story": [
      "A fresh search effort has been launched for Madeleine McCann, a British toddler who disappeared from her family's vacation rental in Portugal more than 18 years ago.",
      "Police haven't disclosed any evidence to explain why they decided to carry out a new search almost two decades later, but they were focusing Tuesday on land around a cottage previously used by the only suspect in the girl's disappearance, a German man currently jailed in his home country for unrelated rape and sexual assault charges.",
      "Dozens of agents from Germany's leading domestic law enforcement agency were poring over the ground Tuesday in the Algarve, a southern Portugal region hugely popular with tourists, where Madeleine was last seen.",
      "Search teams on Tuesday scoured undergrowth and an abandoned building, with police hoping to find evidence that could implicate the convicted German sex offender in her disappearance.",
      "Madeleine was just 3 years old when she vanished from an apartment on the Algarve coast where she was on holiday with her family, sparking unprecedented media coverage and a global campaign to find her.",
      "A previous search of a lake near the Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz in 2023 yielded no results, but on Tuesday, investigators were back in a part of nearby Lagos to hunt for clues.",
      "Several police vehicles with Portuguese and German number plates as well as fire trucks were seen down a cordoned-off dirt road toward the search site, AFP journalists at the scene saw. Portuguese police said about 25 German investigators were present, with the investigation looking at an abandoned building in an overgrown wooded area.",
      "The new searches \u2014 carried out at the request of German authorities investigating Christian Brueckner, a convicted rapist who is suspected of having killed Madeleine \u2014 are expected to last until Friday.",
      "According to the British tabloid The Sun, investigators are equipped with ground radar technology that can scan the ground down to a depth of 15 feet. The area includes a cottage where Brueckner was living and is dotted with wells and ditches, The Sun reported.",
      "Christian Brueckner, the German suspect",
      "A mobile phone registered in Brueckner's name was traced close to the family's accommodation on the night Madeleine went missing. He has always denied any role in her disappearance.",
      "The 48-year-old is currently serving a 7-year prison sentence in Germany for the 2005 rape of a 72-year-old American woman in Praia da Luz. He is due to complete his sentence in September.",
      "He was acquitted in October 2024 in Germany in a separate trial for two sexual assaults and three rapes committed in Portugal between 2000 and 2017.",
      "German authorities in 2020 said they were convinced Brueckner was involved in Madeleine's disappearance, which has seen several false leads.",
      "He has not been charged in connection with Madeleine's case.",
      "Brueckner, who according to German media had a string of previous convictions, including for sexual offenses, assault and theft before he was convicted of rape, worked as an odd-job man during his 10 years in the Algarve. He also reportedly burgled hotel rooms and holiday apartments.",
      "At the time of Madeleine's disappearance, he was living in a camper van.",
      "On Tuesday, a journalist from Germany's RTL television recounted his correspondence with Brueckner and how he had met him in prison.",
      "Brueckner, the journalist said, complained that \"half the world\" considered him to be a \"cruel rapist.\" He said he wanted to eat steak and drink beer when he is released from prison.",
      "A former neighbor in Portugal had told Britain's Sky News in 2020 that Brueckner was \"always a bit angry, driving fast up and down the lane, and then one day, around 2006, he just disappeared without a word.\"",
      "He returned to Germany in 2007 \u2014 the year Madeleine disappeared \u2014 settling in Hanover, but still spent time in Portugal.",
      "On May 3, 18 years since their daughter's disappearance, Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry McCann said they were still determined to find out what happened.",
      "\"The years appear to be passing even more quickly and whilst we have no significant news to share, our determination to 'leave no stone unturned' is unwavering,\" they wrote on the findmadeleine.com website. \"We will do our utmost to achieve this.\"",

      "Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., dissects the legal battle between the Trump administration and Judge James Boasberg over deportation flights on \u2018Fox News Live.\u2019",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg on Wednesday ordered the Trump administration to provide all non-citizens deported from the U.S. to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador to be afforded the opportunity to seek habeas relief in court, and challenge their alleged gang status\u2014 the latest in a heated fight centered on President Donald Trump's use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport certain migrants.",
      "\"In short, the Government must facilitate the Class\u2019s ability to seek habeas relief to contest their removal under the Act,\" Judge Boasberg said in the order, filed late Wednesday afternoon. \"Exactly what such facilitation must entail will be determined in future proceedings. Although the Court is mindful that such a remedy may implicate sensitive diplomatic or national-security concerns within the exclusive province of the Executive Branch, it also has a constitutional duty to provide a remedy that will \u2018make good the wrong done.\u2019\"",
      "Notably, the order also includes Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, the Salvadorian migrant and alleged MS-13 member who was deported from Maryland to El Salvador in March in what administration officials have acknowledged was an administrative error. That case alone had touched off a heated court fight, which prompted intervention from the Supreme Court in April.",

      "At least 261 migrants were deported in the first wave of flights to El Salvador, including more than 100 Venezuelan nationals who were subject to removal \"solely on the basis\" of the law temporarily blocked by the federal district court.",
      "Judge Boasberg's new, 69-page order begins by invoking Franz Kafka\u2019s \"The Trial,\" in which the protagonist, Josef K., awakens to find two strange men outside his room, who proceed to arrest him for unspecified crimes. \"Such was the situation into which Frengel Reyes Mota, Andry Jose Hernandez Romero, and scores of other Venezuelan noncitizens say they were plunged on March 15, 2025,\" Boasberg begins, before outlining the lengthy, complex saga that has spawned dozens of federal court challenges across the country\u2014 though the one brought before his court on March 15 was the very first\u2014 and which later prompted the Supreme Court to rule, on two separate occasions, that the hurried removals had violated migrants' due process protections under the U.S. Constitution.",
      "JUDGE BOASBERG CANCELS PLANNED HEARING TO REVIEW TRUMP DEPORTATIONS",
      "More than 250 suspected gang members arrive in El Salvador by plane, including 238 members of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang and 23 members of the MS-13 gang, who were deported to El Salvador by the US in San Salvador, El Salvador on Mar. 16, 2025.\u00a0 (El Salvador Presidency / Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Boasberg invoked the high court's rulings before reiterating that due process includes providing migrants prior notice of removal, as well as so-called habeas protections, or the right to challenge their removals in court.",
      "\"Defendants plainly deprived these individuals of their right to seek habeas relief before their summary removal from the United States \u2014 a right that need not itself be vindicated through a habeas petition,\" Boasberg said.",
      "He allowed that it is possible that the Trump administration \"lawfully invoked the Alien Enemies Act\" as well as the possibility that defendants are correct that the individuals removed are, in fact gang members. \"But \u2014 and this is the critical point \u2014 there is simply no way to know for sure, as the CECOT Plaintiffs never had any opportunity to challenge the government\u2019s say-so,\" Boasberg said.",
      "The order is almost certain to spark fierce backlash from the Trump administration, which has previously railed against Boasberg's earlier orders and temporary restraining order handed down in March. He later found probable cause to hold the administration in contempt of the court, citing the government's \"willful disregard\" for his March 15 emergency order, though those proceedings were later halted by a federal appeals court.",

      "IS THIS ROBOT AFTER OUR HOSPITALITY, RETAIL AND HEALTHCARE JOBS?",
      "Using AI to build the hospitals of the future",
      "Foxconn's approach to smart hospitals goes beyond deploying robots. The company has developed a suite of digital tools using Nvidia platforms, including AI models that monitor patient vitals and digital twins that simulate hospital environments for planning and training purposes.",
      "The process starts in the data center, where large AI models are trained on Nvidia supercomputers. Hospitals then use digital twins to test and train robots in virtual settings before deploying them in real-world scenarios, ensuring that these systems are both safe and effective.",

TCVGH has built digital twins of its wards and nursing stations, providing a virtual training ground for Nurabot before it is introduced to real hospital floors. According to Shu-Fang Liu, deputy director of the nursing department at TCVGH, robots like Nurabot are augmenting the capabilities of healthcare staff, enabling them to deliver more focused and meaningful care to patients.",

      "Nurabot is already making a difference in daily hospital operations. The robot handles medicine deliveries, ward patrols and visitor guidance, which Foxconn estimates can reduce nurse workloads by up to 30%. In one ward, Nurabot delivers wound care kits and educational materials directly to patient bedsides, saving nurses multiple trips to supply rooms and allowing them to dedicate more time to their patients. The robot is also especially helpful during visiting hours and night shifts, when staffing levels are typically lower.",
      "Nurses hope future versions of Nurabot will be able to converse with patients in multiple languages, recognize faces for personalized interactions and even assist with lifting patients when needed. For example, a lung patient who needs two nurses to sit up for breathing exercises might only require one nurse with Nurabot's help, freeing the other to care for other patients.",

Instead of spending their shifts running errands or handling repetitive tasks, nurses now have robots like Nurabot to lend a hand. This means nurses can focus their energy on what matters most \u2013 caring for patients \u2013 while robots handle tasks such as delivering medication or guiding visitors around the hospital.",

After years of prototypes and over 500 test flights, the AirCar is finally set for certification later this year.

      "From the road to the sky in minutes",
      "So, how does it work? The AirCar looks like a sleek sports coupe on the road, with four wheels and a design that would fit right in next to a luxury sedan. When you need to fly, you simply drive to a runway, press a button and watch as the wings unfold and the tail extends. The transformation takes about 80 seconds, and there's no manual tinkering required. Once the wings are locked and the tail is in place, you're ready for takeoff. The steering wheel transforms into a flight yoke, and extra pedals appear for rudder control. The controls are designed to be intuitive for pilots, so if you already have a private pilot's license, you won't need to learn anything new.",

The base model puts out 280 horsepower, while the top version offers 340 horsepower with twin turbos. On the road, the AirCar can reach a top speed of about 124 mph, and it handles and feels much like a sports car. In the air, it cruises at 155 mph and can travel up to 620 miles on a single tank of fuel.",

The AirCar runs on regular high-octane gasoline, and you can fill up at most gas stations.

      "To operate the AirCar on the road, you will need a standard driver's license, just like any other car. If you want to take to the skies, you'll also need a private pilot's license. According to Klein Vision, the AirCar is designed so that if you already have a private pilot's license, you won't have to learn anything new to fly it.

      "What you need to know",
      "Bitdefender researchers have uncovered a massive and highly coordinated subscription scam campaign involving more than 200 active websites designed to look like real online stores. These sites, often promoted through Facebook ads, sell everything from clothes and electronics to beauty products, but the real goal is to trick users into signing up for recurring payments, often without realizing it.",
      "One of the most common lures is the \"mystery box\" scam, where you are promised a surprise package at a bargain price. These offers are made to look fun and harmless, but behind the scenes you are giving away personal and credit card information while unknowingly agreeing to hidden subscription terms, often written in tiny fine print.",
      "The scam doesn\u2019t stop there. Once you\u2019re convinced and reach the checkout page, scammers often layer in a second scam, like loyalty cards or VIP memberships that further lock you into payments. It\u2019s all designed to confuse you, overwhelm you with supposed perks and make the scam feel like a good deal.",
      "Researchers found that many of these websites share a single Cyprus address, possibly tied to offshore entities linked to the Paradise Papers. Despite being spread across different categories and brand names, the sites often use the same layouts, AI agents and payment structures, all pointing to a centralized fraud network.",
      "Scammers frequently rotate the brands they impersonate and have started moving beyond mystery boxes, now peddling low-quality products, counterfeit goods, fake investment schemes, dubious supplements and more. To avoid automatic detection, they employ several tactics. These include running multiple versions of an ad, with only one of which is actually malicious while the others display harmless product images, uploading ad images from platforms like Google Drive so they can be swapped out later and cropping visuals to alter recognizable patterns.",

      "The scam is expanding",
      "What started with simple \"mystery box\" scams has grown into a sprawling, coordinated campaign. These scams now feature fake surveys, tiered \"VIP\" memberships and deceptive credit systems that make the purchase process intentionally confusing. Users are promised deep discounts or access to exclusive deals, but in reality they\u2019re just being locked into recurring payments.",
      "Many of the scam websites trace back to the same physical address in Cyprus, pointing to what appears to be a centralized operation. Researchers also found links to entities mentioned in the Paradise Papers, suggesting these fraudsters are hiding behind offshore infrastructure.",
      "And it\u2019s not just mystery boxes anymore. The same scam format is being used to sell low-quality goods, fake supplements and even bogus investment opportunities. With high-quality site design, aggressive advertising and increasingly sophisticated tactics, subscription scams are becoming the new face of online fraud.",

      "10 proactive measures to take to protect your data",
      "Even as scammers become more sophisticated, there are practical steps you can take right now to protect your personal and financial information from subscription fraud and other online threats. Here are ten proactive measures to help keep your data safe:",
      "1) Always read the fine print: One of the simplest yet most effective ways to protect yourself from subscription scams is to slow down and read the fine print, especially on checkout pages. Scammers often hide recurring payment terms in small or lightly colored text that\u2019s easy to miss. What seems like a one-time purchase could actually sign you up for a biweekly or monthly charge. Taking just a moment to scan for hidden terms before hitting \"Pay\" can help you avoid weeks of silent billing.",
      "2) Avoid mystery box or VIP-style deals:\u00a0These offers often prey on curiosity and the promise of surprise or luxury for a low fee. In reality, the \"mystery\" is the trap: you might receive nothing or a low-quality item while being unknowingly enrolled in a recurring subscription. Scammers use the illusion of exclusivity or urgency to pressure quick decisions.",
      "3) Don\u2019t trust ads blindly on social media:\u00a0Facebook, Instagram and other platforms are a hotbed for these scams, with criminals running paid ads that mimic well-known brands or influencers. These ads often link to professional-looking but fake storefronts. If you\u2019re interested in a deal you see online, don\u2019t click through immediately. Instead, look up the brand or offer in a separate tab and check if it exists outside social media.",
      "4) Investigate before you buy:\u00a0Before purchasing from any unfamiliar site, take a few quick steps to verify its legitimacy. Search the brand's name alongside words like \"scam\" or \"reviews\" to see what others have experienced. Look up the company's physical address and check if it actually exists using tools like Google Maps. Make sure the website uses HTTPS, review the site's contact information and cross-check reviews on trusted third-party sites like the Better Business Bureau or Consumer Reports.",
      "5) Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Adding a strong antivirus program to your devices can provide an extra layer of defense against fraudulent websites and phishing attempts. Strong antivirus software warns you about suspicious links, blocks malicious ads and scans downloads for malware. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0Scammers often rely on leaked or publicly available personal information to target victims with convincing subscription scams. Investing in a personal data removal service can help minimize your digital footprint by removing your information from data broker databases and reducing the chances of being targeted in future campaigns. Regularly monitoring and cleaning up your online presence makes it harder for fraudsters to exploit your data for financial gain.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "7) Be cautious with payment methods: Use secure payment options like credit cards, which often offer better fraud protection than wire transfers, gift cards or cryptocurrency.",
      "8) Limit personal information shared on social media: Scammers often gather details from public profiles to craft convincing scams. Review your privacy settings and only share necessary information.",
      "9) Use strong, unique passwords and enable multifactor authentication:\u00a0Create strong, unique passwords for each of your online accounts, especially those tied to your finances or shopping. Enable multifactor authentication wherever possible, as this adds an extra layer of security and makes it harder for scammers to access your accounts, even if your password is compromised. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.\u00a0Get more details about my best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "10) Keep your devices and software updated:\u00a0Regularly\u00a0update your operating system, browsers and apps. Security updates often patch vulnerabilities that scammers exploit to gain access to your information or install malicious software.",
      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "While the rise of subscription scams and deceptive ads is concerning, it\u2019s especially troubling that platforms like Facebook continue to allow these fraudulent ads to run unchecked. Facebook has repeatedly failed to adequately vet or prevent these malicious campaigns from reaching vulnerable individuals. The platform\u2019s ad approval system should be more proactive in spotting and blocking ads promoting scams, particularly those that impersonate well-known brands or content creators.",

      "Kurt Knutsson talks about a viral video that shows a humanoid robot going wild. A tech nightmare or just a glitch?",
      "A chilling video circulating on social media has reignited old anxieties about robots turning against their creators. The footage shows a Unitree H1 humanoid robot, a machine about the size of an adult human, suddenly flailing its arms and legs with alarming force during a test, coming dangerously close to two technicians.",

      "What the video shows",
      "In the viral clip first posted on\u00a0Reddit, the\u00a0Unitree H1 is seen suspended from a crane at a Chinese factory, surrounded by two handlers. Without warning, the robot loses control, thrashing its limbs, knocking over equipment and forcing the technicians to scramble out of harm's way. The chaos is palpable, and the images quickly drew comparisons to movies like \"The Terminator\" and \"I, Robot,\" with many viewers wondering if the age of rogue machines had finally arrived.",

      "The Unitree H1 is not a prototype but a commercially available, general-purpose humanoid robot. Standing 5.9 feet tall and weighing 104 pounds, it's designed to walk, run and even perform dynamic movements like backflips and dancing. Its joints are powerful and capable of generating 365 pound-feet of torque, enough to lift heavy objects or, in the wrong circumstances, cause serious harm.",

      "What went wrong?",
      "Despite the frightening visuals, the reality is far less sinister. According to engineers and robotics experts, the root cause of the malfunction was a combination of software and design oversight. During the test, the H1 was tethered by its head for safety, a common practice during public demonstrations. However, this physical restraint was not accounted for in the robot's balance algorithm.",
      "The robot's sensors interpreted the resistance from the tether as if it were constantly falling. In response, the H1's stabilization software tried to correct its position, but the tether prevented normal movement. This created a feedback loop: the robot made increasingly aggressive corrections, resulting in the violent flailing seen in the video. Investigators concluded that this was not a case of emergent AI behavior but rather a known failure mode triggered by an unanticipated physical constraint and software flaw.",

While the footage is unsettling, the true story is one of technical error, not a robot rebellion. As robots become more common in our workplaces and public spaces, incidents like this will serve as important lessons for engineers, regulators and the public alike.

      "1. Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to press Windows + R, copy commands or paste anything into PowerShell. If a website instructs you to do this, it\u2019s likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2. Don\u2019t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many infostealer attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company\u2019s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "4. Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",

      "5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you\u2019ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in a personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from infostealer malware or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0\u200bCheck out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "How the database was uncovered and what it contained",
      "Cybersecurity researcher Jeremiah Fowler has\u00a0revealed the existence of an open database that contains 184,162,718 million account credentials. These include email addresses, passwords, usernames and URLs for platforms such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook and Snapchat.",
      "The information also covers banking services, medical platforms and government accounts. Most shockingly, the entire dataset was left completely unsecured.

These lightweight tools are favored by cybercriminals for their ability to silently extract login credentials and other private information from compromised devices. Once stolen, the data is often sold on dark web forums or used in targeted attacks.",
      "After reporting the breach, the hosting provider quickly removed access to the file. However, the owner of the database remains unknown. The provider did not disclose who uploaded it or whether the database was part of a legitimate archive that was accidentally published. Fowler could not determine whether this was the result of negligence or an operation with malicious intent.",

      "6 ways to protect yourself after a data breach",
      "1. Change your password on every platform: If your login credentials have been exposed, it\u2019s not enough to change the password on just one account. Cybercriminals often try the same combinations across multiple platforms, hoping to gain access through reused credentials. Start by updating your most critical accounts, email, banking, cloud storage and social media, then move on to others. Use a new, unique password for each platform and avoid variations of old passwords, as they can still be predictable. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Our\u00a0top-rated password manager delivers powerful protection to help keep your accounts secure. It features\u00a0real-time data breach monitoring to alert you if your login details have been exposed, plus a built-in\u00a0data breach scanner\u00a0that checks your saved emails, passwords and credit card information against known leak databases. A password health checker also highlights weak, reused or compromised passwords so you can strengthen your online defenses with just a few clicks. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Enable two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication, or 2FA, is a critical security feature that drastically reduces the risk of unauthorized access. Even if someone has your password, they won\u2019t be able to log in without the second verification step, usually a one-time code sent to your phone or an authenticator app. Enable 2FA on all services that support it, especially your email, financial accounts and any service that stores sensitive personal data.",
      "3. Watch for unusual account activity: After a breach, it\u2019s common for compromised accounts to be used for spam, scams, or identity theft. Pay close attention to signs such as login attempts from unfamiliar locations, password reset requests you didn\u2019t initiate or unexpected messages sent from your accounts. Most platforms allow you to review login history and connected devices. If you see something off, take action immediately by changing your password and revoking suspicious sessions.",
      "4. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0You should also consider a data removal service. Given the scale and frequency of breaches like the one described above, relying on personal caution alone is no longer enough. Automated data removal services can provide an essential extra layer of defense by continuously scanning for and helping eliminate your exposed information from data broker sites and other online sources. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "5. Avoid clicking on suspicious links and use strong antivirus software: One of the most common post-breach threats is phishing. Cybercriminals often use information from leaked databases to craft convincing emails that urge you to verify your account or reset your password. Never click on links or download attachments from unknown or suspicious sources. Instead, visit websites by typing the URL directly into your browser.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping\u00a0your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Keep your software and devices up to date: Many cyberattacks exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated software. Operating systems, browsers, antivirus programs and even apps\u00a0need to be updated regularly to patch security flaws. Turn on automatic updates wherever possible so you\u2019re protected as soon as fixes are released. Staying current with your software is one of the easiest and most effective ways to block malware, ransomware and spyware from infiltrating your system.",
      "HACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Security is not only the responsibility of companies and hosting providers. Users need to adopt better practices, including unique passwords, multifactor authentication and regular reviews of their digital footprint. The careless exposure of over 184 million credentials is not just a mistake. It is an example of how fragile our systems remain when even basic protection is absent. In an era where artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and global connectivity are reshaping technology, it is unacceptable that plain text files containing financial and governmental credentials are still left sitting online.",

    "published": "Fri, 30 May 2025 14:48:58 -0400",
    "summary": "Here are five AI prompts you can use for freelance work, writing product descriptions, creating social media posts and writing emails to negotiate discounts.",
    "story": [
      "A majority of small businesses are using artificial intelligence and finding out it can save time and money.",
      "So, you want to start making money using AI but you\u2019re not trying to build Skynet or learn 15 coding languages first? Good, because neither am I. You don\u2019t need to become the next Sam Altman or have a Ph.D. in machine learning to turn artificial intelligence into real income. What you do need is curiosity, a dash of creativity, and the right prompts.",
      "\ud83d\udcb8 Enter to win $500 for you and $500 for your favorite person or charity in our\u00a0Pay It Forward Sweepstakes. Hurry, ends soon!",
      "I\u2019ve pulled together five powerful, practical prompts you can throw into ChatGPT (or your AI tool of choice) to help you start earning extra cash this week. These aren\u2019t pie-in-the-sky dreams or $10K-a-month YouTube ad schemes. They\u2019re doable, even if your calendar is already packed.",
      "5-MINUTE CLEANUP FOR YOUR PHONE AND COMPUTER",
      "Let\u2019s get to it.",
      "1. Fast-Track Your Freelance Life",
      "Prompt to use:\"Act as a freelance business coach. Suggest 3 services I can offer on Fiverr or Upwork using AI tools like ChatGPT, Midjourney or Canva. I have [insert skill: writing/design/admin/accounting/managerial] experience.\"",
      "Why this works:Freelance work is exploding right now. Platforms like Upwork and Fiverr are filled with small businesses and entrepreneurs who need help\u2014but don\u2019t have the budget to hire full-time staff. If you\u2019ve got any kind of professional background, you can use AI tools to turbocharge your services. Writing blog posts? ChatGPT can give you a draft. Creating logos or social media templates? Midjourney and Canva are your new best friends.",
      "You don\u2019t need a team. You don\u2019t need fancy software. You just need a good prompt and the confidence to say, \"Yes, I can do that.\" AI helps you scale what you already know how to do.",
      "A man is pictured with a smartphone and laptop computer on January 31, 2019.\u00a0 (Neil Godwin/Future via Getty Images)",
      "2. Make Product Descriptions Sexy Again",
      "Prompt to use:\"Rewrite this Etsy or Shopify product description to make it more compelling and SEO-friendly. Target audience: [insert group]. Here\u2019s the original: [paste description].\"",
      "Why this works:Let\u2019s face it\u2014most product descriptions online are a snooze. But good copy sells. Whether you\u2019re running your own shop or helping someone else with theirs, compelling product descriptions convert clicks into customers. Use ChatGPT to punch up the language, fine-tune for SEO, and speak directly to your ideal buyer.",
      "DON\u2019T SCAM YOURSELF WITH THE TRICKS HACKERS DON\u2019T WANT ME TO SHARE",
      "Remember: people don\u2019t just want to buy a weird mug. They want to buy what it says about them. That\u2019s where a smart rewrite can turn browsers into buyers.",
      "3. Social Posts That Sell",
      "Prompt to use:\"Create 5 attention-grabbing Instagram captions to promote this [product/service]. Keep the tone [fun, confident, expert] and include a strong call to action.\"",
      "Why this works:We live in a scroll-happy world. Your social captions need to grab attention in less than three seconds. But not everyone\u2019s a copywriter\u2014and not everyone has time to be. AI can help you crank out engaging content in the tone and style that fits your brand. Add a great photo, post consistently, and you\u2019re suddenly a one-person content agency without the overhead (or endless Zoom meetings).",
      "A photo taken on October 4, 2023 in Manta, near Turin, shows a smartphone and a laptop displaying the logos of the artificial intelligence OpenAI research company and ChatGPT chatbot. (MARCO BERTORELLO/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "If you\u2019re managing social for clients or your own biz, this prompt is gold. Use it to build content calendars, write reels scripts, or even draft ad copy.",
      "4. Polite Emails That Save You Money",
      "Prompt to use:\"Write a short, polite email to ask for a lower rate or discount on [tool/service/platform]. Mention that I\u2019m a loyal customer comparing alternatives.\"",
      "Why this works:Negotiating discounts doesn\u2019t always feel comfortable but it absolutely works. Companies often have unpublished deals, especially for longtime users or small businesses. And customer service reps? They're human beings. A kind, well-written email might be all it takes to get a discount on that software you\u2019re using every month.",
      "20 TECH TRICKS TO MAKE LIFE BETTER, SAFER OR EASIER",
      "I\u2019ve personally saved hundreds of dollars just by sending quick, respectful emails like this. AI can help you strike the perfect tone confident but kind, assertive but not pushy.",
      "5. Your Passive Income Kit",
      "Prompt to use:\"Give me 3 high-demand, low-competition ideas for a short e-book or low-content book I can sell on Amazon. I have experience in [insert topic].\"",
      "Why this works:You have knowledge people want. Package it. Sell it. Repeat. Whether it\u2019s a short guide on starting a backyard garden or a workbook for productivity hacks, e-books and low-content books (like journals or planners) sell surprisingly well. And AI can help you brainstorm ideas, outline chapters, even draft content to polish up.",

      "Upload it to Amazon KDP or Gumroad, and now you\u2019ve got a digital product that can earn money in your sleep. People pay for convenience, and you have life experience worth sharing.",
      "Final Thought",
      "You don\u2019t need to master AI to start earning with it. You just need to start using it. These five prompts are a low-risk, high-potential way to get your feet wet. And if you need a hand turning these sparks into something bigger, I\u2019m here.",
      "I built my multimillion-dollar business with no investors and no debt. I\u2019ve done this without a big team or expensive consultants. And I\u2019d love to help you do the same.",

    "story": [
      "President and CEO of Focus on the Family Jim Daly joins Fox News Digital to share the real-world implications for their ministry after the Southern Poverty Law Center designated them a hate group last week.",
      "In a wide-ranging exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, Focus on the Family President Jim Daly responded to the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s (SPLC) recent decision to classify his organization as a \"hate group,\" calling the label \"discouraging,\" \"dangerous,\" and a reflection of \"what\u2019s wrong with the culture right now.\"",
      "Focus on the Family, a Colorado-based nonprofit founded in 1977 by Dr. James Dobson, is one of the most visible Christian ministries in the United States, offering counseling, crisis intervention, parenting resources, foster care support, and more.According to Daly, the group reaches six million radio listeners and several million digital viewers, with a mission of \"helping parents to be the best parents they could be, all with the undertone of a Christian understanding.\"",
      "But now, the nonprofit finds itself added to a controversial SPLC list typically associated with white supremacists and violent extremists.GRASSLEY ALLEGES FBI USED BIASED SOURCES IN ANTI-TRADITIONAL CATHOLIC MEMOS UNDER BIDEN ADMINISTRATION",
      "Focus on the Family President Jim Daly defends the organization\u2019s work as loving and faith-driven, responding to its inclusion on the SPLC\u2019s \"hate group\" list. (Courtesy of Focus on the Family)",
      "\"Southern Poverty Law Center made the decision in some kind of criteria that they, and only they know, and that is to put us on the hate list,\" Daly said. \"I think, again, it exemplifies what's wrong with the culture right now\u2014that we can't have differing opinions on things.\"",
      "At the core of the SPLC\u2019s issue is Focus\u2019s belief in traditional marriage. Daly was direct: \"Our Christian tradition is marriage between one man and one woman, and that's what we believe and we believe we can advocate for that.\"",
      "While Daly acknowledged that society is shifting, he said Focus will not abandon its scriptural roots to satisfy cultural trends. \"For us, we can't relent on changing what we believed to be scriptural truth for the current place of where the culture is at.\"",
      "\"For some reason that then deems us as a hate group,\" he said. \"It\u2019s very discouraging really, because I think the SPLC started in a good place\u2026 but they have turned that muscle now on the Christian community.\"CONCERNED PARENTS OF TRANS KIDS COMPARED TO 'HATE GROUPS' BY COLORADO DEM: WOULDN'T 'ASK THE KKK' FOR OPINION",
      "The Focus on the Family headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The Christian nonprofit, founded in 1977, provides counseling, foster care resources, and pro-family advocacy. (Courtesy of Focus on the Family)",
      "The implications, Daly warned, are not just reputational.",
      "He recalled the 2012 shooting at Family Research Council (FRC), another Christian nonprofit SPLC labeled as hateful. A gunman entered the FRC office with the intent to kill, and was later quoted saying he was inspired by the SPLC\u2019s \"hate map.\"",
      "\"He said\u2026 his motivation was aroused because Family Research Council had been placed on the SPLC hate list,\" Daly said. \"They are dancing on very dangerous territory when they put these labels out.\"",
      "That danger isn\u2019t theoretical. According to Daly, Focus had protestors at its doorstep within 24 hours of the SPLC\u2019s announcement.",
      "\"We had protesters harassing our employees coming into the door here\u2026 so we had to get and pay for extra police presence on our campus,\" Daly said. \"It raises danger for everybody. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s their motivation, but it is a consequence.\"",
      "But even in the face of hostility, Daly says Focus remains committed to \"doing the work that the Lord has called us to do.\" That includes extensive work in foster care and pregnancy resource services.",
      "\"My wife and I both have been foster parents for 15 years,\" he shared. \"We support pregnancy resource centers with ultrasound machines.\"",

(Photo by Andy Cross/The Denver Post via Getty Images) (Andy Cross/The Denver Post via Getty Images)",
      "He also pointed to Focus\u2019s measurable impact. \"Last year we helped 140,000 couples get through a marital crisis, 540,000 couples to strengthen their marriage,\" he said. \"That\u2019s a good thing.\"",
      "And he asked a pointed question to the SPLC directly: \"Why would you go after an organization doing that much good and label us a hate group? It just, it makes no sense.\"",
      "Daly was clear that the mission isn\u2019t about political gain or culture war bravado, but the gospel.",
      "\"This is not hate,\" Daly said. \"This is the love of Christ trying to show people God's design for marriage and parenting and people.\"",
      "That message, however, is increasingly misunderstood in a culture that Daly says punishes theological conviction. He referenced a meeting with the late Pastor Tim Keller and gay rights activists in New York City as a model.",
      "\"Tim Keller said it so well. He said, \u2018New York City works because we don't go out of our way to put our finger in the other group's eye',\" Daly recounted. \"We need to accept where we're at together and then be at the table of pluralism and say, how do we coexist?\"",
      "He continued: \"Creating a hate list because of your views, your theology, your ideology, just isn't helpful.\"",
      "Asked whether Focus planned a legal response, Daly said it\u2019s under serious consideration. \"There has to be a line where an organization that creates a hate list has to be responsible for that,\" he said. \"If we were to go to court, I think they would be hard-pressed to win that defamation lawsuit.\"",
      "Still, Daly struck a hopeful note. He said the biggest response they\u2019ve received wasn\u2019t fear or funding loss, but support.",
      "\"People that do know us, people that have experienced us helping them through a crisis in their marriage or a crisis with their teenager, they know us,\" Daly said. \"This isn\u2019t who you are, and they get it.\"",
      "Above all, Daly urged believers to respond to cultural hostility with character.",
      "\"Romans 2:4 says it\u2019s God\u2019s kindness that leads one to repentance\u2014and I believe in that,\" he said. \"You can have the most crusty person who hates out for a reason you may not even know, and you start to dialog with them\u2026 and then you find a hurt, a pain that occurred in their life.\"",
      "And for churches wondering how to speak into culture without compromising biblical convictions, Daly offered a closing challenge: don\u2019t just preach orthodoxy: live it.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"We know truth. We know orthodoxy, the spoken word. We need more orthopraxy, the doing of the word,\" Daly said. \"We could literally wipe out the foster care list if we just got engaged\u2014one family per church.\"",
      "That vision, he said, is what keeps him going. \"Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if Fox News and the New York Times ran a headline that said: \u2018Christian Church wipes out waiting foster care list\u2019? I\u2019m looking forward to that headline. And that\u2019s what I work for every day.\"",

However, attorneys for the plaintiffs argue that the law doesn't apply to regulatory matters like cannabis, an industry that is regulated in California.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Jun 2025 13:21:59 -0400",
    "summary": "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer unveiled plans to boost the U.K. military to &quot;war-fighting readiness&quot; and support NATO with new innovations.",
    "story": [
      "Sen. David McCormick, R-Pa., discusses the Russia-Ukraine war, President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies and the Gaza humanitarian crisis on \u2018Fox News Sunday.\u2019",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced Monday that he is moving the United Kingdom's military into \"war-fighting readiness\" to address growing threats from Russia.",
      "During a visit to BAE Systems'Govan facility, a navy ship-building yard in Glasgow, Scotland, the prime minister laid out \"three fundamental changes\" to be made in response to the country's strategic defense review.",
      "\"First, we are moving to war-fighting readiness as the central purpose of our armed forces,\" Starmer said. \"When we are being directly threatened by states with advanced military forces, the most effective way to deter them is to be ready. And frankly, to show them that we're ready, to deliver peace through strength.\"",
      "\u2018MAKE NATO GREAT AGAIN\u2019: HEGSETH PUSHES EUROPEAN ALLIES TO STEP UP DEFENSE EFFORTS",
      "Starmer continued, \"Now Britain has the finest service men and women in the world. We're showing them the respect that they deserve by delivering the biggest armed forces pay rise in 20 years and by pledging today that we will end the hollowing out of our armed forces. \"We'll build a fighting force that is more integrated, more ready, more lethal than ever, backed by a stronger strategic reserve, fully trained and ready to mobilize at any time.\"",

      "The new approach comes as President Donald Trump has warned European nations to take more responsibility for their own security. Starmer's announcement focused on a \"new era\" of threats, citing the war in Ukraine, new nuclear risks and \"daily cyberattacks,\" as well as reversing the post-Cold War defense decline. He called out \"growing Russian aggression\" in U.K. waters and skies, blaming \"their reckless actions\" for the increased cost of living \"hitting working people the hardest.\"",
      "\"The threat we now face is more serious, more immediate and more unpredictable than at any time since the Cold War,\" Starmer said.",
      "The U.K. government announced military plans in response to a strategic defense review commissioned by Starmer and led by George Robertson, a former U.K. defense secretary and NATO secretary general.",
      "It's the first such review since 2021. Months after Britain's last major defense review was published in 2021, then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson said with confidence that the era of \"fighting big tank battles on European landmass\" are over. Three months later, Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine. Starmer's center-left Labour Party government says it will accept all 62 recommendations made in the review, aiming to help the U.K. confront growing threats on land, air, sea and in cyberspace.",
      "The second change, Starmer explained from Scotland, is ensuring \"everything we do will add to the strength of NATO.\"",
      "\"As we step up to take greater responsibility for our collective defense, the NATO alliance means something profound, that we will never fight alone,\" Starmer said. \"It is a fundamental source of our strategic strength. That's why our defense policy will always be NATO first, something that's written through this review. The transformation we are driving in our defense must add up to Britain's biggest contribution to NATO since its creation. So that when we're building new capabilities at home, we are making our allies safer too, strengthening Europe, and strengthening our bridge to the US as Britain's first partner in defense.\"",
      "Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer delivers his speech during a visit to the BAE Systems'Govan facility, in Glasgow, Scotland, on Monday, June 2, 2025.\u00a0 (Andy Buchanan, Pool Photo via AP)",
      "RUBIO DEMANDS NATO PONY UP, DISMISSES 'HYSTERIA' OVER US ROLE UNDER TRUMP",
      "The third change laid out by Starmer is for the U.K. to \"innovate and accelerate at a wartime pace so we can meet the threats of today and of tomorrow as the fastest innovator in NATO.\" He said such advancements would not mean \"replacing people\" or hardware, but would rather mean \"learning the lessons of Ukraine\" and ensuring \"every capability we have works seamlessly together.\"",
      "\"Drones, destroyers, AI, aircraft, each different branch of our armed services, fully integrated to create an army which is 10 times more lethal by 2035,\" Starmer said.",
      "The U.K. government said it's expanding the country's armed, nuclear-powered submarine fleet with up to 12 new SSN-AUKUS boats through a partnership with Australia and the United States. The government also says it will invest 15 billion pounds in Britain\u2019s nuclear arsenal, which consists of missiles carried on a handful of submarines. Details of those plans are likely to be kept secret.",
      "Starmer has already pledged to increase defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, a boost from the current 2.3%, and to eventually get that up to 3%.",
      "Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer delivers his speech during a visit to the BAE Systems'Govan facility, in Glasgow, Scotland, Monday June 2, 2025.\u00a0 (Andy Buchanan, Pool Photo via AP)",
      "GB News noted at the press conference Monday that Starmer hasn\u2019t committed to having 3% of the GDP go to defense spending within the next nine years, even as Germany\u2019s defense chief warned Russia could invade a NATO ally within the next four years. In his response, Starmer reiterated the U.K. as a \"steadfast ally\" to Ukraine and said the changes coming as a result of the review would be the best way to deter further conflict.",
      "The U.K. government will also increase Britain\u2019s conventional weapons stockpiles with up to 7,000 U.K.-built long-range weapons.",

    "summary": "A federal judge ordered the Trump administration Wednesday to provide hundreds of migrants sent to CECOT, a maximum-security terrorism confinement center in El Salvador, with habeas relief, ordering the government to give them opportunities to challenge their detentions and removals under President Donald Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge ordered the Trump administration Wednesday to provide hundreds of migrants sent to CECOT, a maximum-security terrorism confinement center in El Salvador, with habeas relief, ordering the government to give them opportunities to challenge their detentions and removals under President Donald Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The order applies to all noncitizens removed from U.S. custody and transferred to CECOT \"on March 15 and 16, 2025, pursuant solely to the Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of The United States by Tren De Aragua.'\"",
      "It will not apply to migrants such as Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man removed from the country around the same time, but for reasons other than Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "\u201cDefendants plainly deprived these individuals of their right to seek habeas relief before their summary removal from the United States \u2014 a right that need not itself be vindicated through a habeas petition,\u201d U.S. District Judge James Boasberg of Washington, D.C., wrote in the order. \u201cPerhaps the President lawfully invoked the Alien Enemies Act. Perhaps, moreover, Defendants are correct that Plaintiffs are gang members. But \u2014 and this is the critical point \u2014 there is simply no way to know for sure, as the CECOT Plaintiffs never had any opportunity to challenge the Government\u2019s say-so.\u201d",
      "Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act in March to target members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang the administration deems a foreign terrorist organization and accuses of engaging in \"mass illegal migration to the United States to further its objectives of harming United States citizens.\" By invoking the wartime law, Trump was able to swiftly detain and remove immigrants he claimed were members of the gang.",
      "One day after he invoked the Act, the Trump administration announced it had deported hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members on at least two planes to El Salvador, even as Boasberg in a ruling at the time blocked the deportations and ordered any flights carrying migrants subject to the presidential proclamation to return to the United States.",
      "The Trump administration challenged the block on its Alien Enemies Act deportations, but the ruling was upheld by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for Washington, D.C. The U.S. Supreme Court later faulted the administration for giving the Venezuelan detainees only 24 hours to challenge their deportations before it returned the case to an appeals court for further proceedings.",
      "Boasberg noted in his ruling that the Supreme Court unanimously agreed \"that those subject to removal under the Act must be allowed to challenge their removability in federal court before being deported.\"",
      "\"Defendants instead spirited away planeloads of people before any such challenge could be made. And now, significant evidence has come to light indicating that many of those currently entombed in CECOT have no connection to the gang and thus languish in a foreign prison on flimsy, even frivolous, accusations,\" he wrote.",
      "Boasberg has given the government a week to propose a plan about \"how they intend to facilitate the ability of the CECOT class to seek habeas relief,\" making it clear that the Venezuelan migrants must be granted the opportunity to contest their removals under the Alien Enemies Act but conceding that \"such a remedy may implicate sensitive diplomatic or national-security concerns.\"",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Lawyers for the nonprofit groups representing the migrants praised the ruling as affirming that the right to due process extends to people who are in the country illegally.",
      "\u201cThe court properly recognized that the government cannot send people to a notorious foreign gulag without due process and then wash its hands of the situation,\u201d said American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt, the lead counsel in the case."

      "For many Puerto Ricans, the nightly chirping of \u201ccoh-KEE\u201d \u2014 the sound of a tiny frog known as the coqu\u00ed \u2014 is like a national lullaby.",
      "But for one purported tourist, the noise felt more like a nightmare, according to a now-deleted Reddit post from May on the Puerto Rico Travel thread.",
      "The post, titled \u201cSpray to keep the noisy frogs quiet?\u201d alarmed residents and lovers of the amphibian. In the last month, dozens have voiced their concerns across social media about their fears that visitors to the island appear to want to silence the creature.",
      "On TikTok, videos pleading to leave the coqu\u00eds alone have millions of views. Some users have urged people not to come to Puerto Rico if they don\u2019t like the sound of the coqu\u00cds. Others have joined in the chorus of voices calling on people to protect coqu\u00eds from possible harm.",
      "Alejandro R\u00edos-Franceschi, an associate professor of ecology, biodiversity and evolution at the University of Puerto Rico, Ponce Campus, said that before the social media post, he had never heard of people in Puerto Rico attempting to kill coqu\u00eds. Puerto Rican environmental officials have not weighed in on the online uproar.",
      "However, R\u00edos-Franceschi isn\u2019t surprised by the fears expressed by many locals and environmental enthusiasts online, given how beloved the frog is. On the island, many Puerto Ricans are taught from a young age to care for and appreciate them.",
      "\u201cThe coqu\u00cd is not noise \u2014 it\u2019s a living soundtrack of the Puerto Rican identity,\u201d R\u00edos-Franceschi said.",
      "There are 17 species of coqu\u00eds, most of which are endemic to Puerto Rico, according to R\u00edos-Franceschi. The creatures are tiny, muddy and brown. Males are known for making \u201cco\u201d sounds to dissuade other males, while the \u201cqui\u201d sound is meant to attract females.",
      "As a U.S. territory, Puerto Rico is subject to the rules and laws of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, which means anyone who harms a coqu\u00cd could face serious legal trouble. As of 2017, some coqu\u00cds were listed as endangered. But the common coqu\u00cd, which makes the iconic sound, are not endangered.",
      "The frog is also an invasive species in Hawaii, R\u00edos-Franceschi said. In 2003, The Associated Press reported that state and federal officials were trying to eradicate the Oahu coqu\u00cd frog population, citing the need to control them.",
      "The superstar rapper and singer Bad Bunny, who is from Puerto Rico, has even posted about the creature. Last week, he appeared to allude to the ongoing discussion about them by sharing an Instagram story featuring their croaking in the background of a clipped version of his song \u201cLo Que Le Pas\u00f3 a Hawaii,\u201d which translates to \u201cWhat Happened to Hawaii.\u201d",
      "R\u00edos-Franceschi, who is also a research director for the nonprofit conservation group Proyecto Coqui, said if tourists are actually coming to Puerto Rico and trying to spray the coqu\u00ed with chemicals, it could enter the groundwater and spread to other creatures, possibly disrupting the entire ecosystem of the island.",
      "To Puerto Ricans, the sound of the frogs, R\u00edos-Franceschi said, is \"melody for our ears, but I can understand that for tourists that are not used to it, it can be bothering.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that when tourists come here, they have the right to kill them just because they\u2019re annoying.\u201d"

      "Trump frequently uses Biden as a political foil and has sought to undo a number of policies from his predecessor's administration since he returned to office.",
      "The announcement Wednesday directs the White House counsel and Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate whether anyone \"conspired to deceive the public about Biden's mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the President.\" It is an escalation of an issue that Trump and his allies have frequently raised, possibly paving the way for Republicans to argue that many of Biden\u2019s actions as president were invalid.",
      "\"This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history,\" Trump wrote in a memo. \"The American public was purposefully shielded from discovering who wielded the executive power, all while Biden\u2019s signature was deployed across thousands of documents to effect radical policy shifts.\"",
      "Trump has acknowledged using the autopen himself in office. In March, he said he turned to it \u201conly for very unimportant papers,\u201d such as responses to letters.",
      "\u201cBut to use them for \u2014 for what they\u2019ve used them for is terrible,\u201d he added, referring to the Biden administration.",

      "Biden defended his record in a statement Wednesday, arguing that the probe was a \u201cdistraction\u201d from Trump and Republican lawmakers.",
      "\u201cLet me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn\u2019t is ridiculous and false,\u201d Biden said.",
      "Trump has previously claimed without evidence that Biden used an autopen to sign pre-emptive pardons for the members of Congress who investigated the events surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021, attack at the U.S. Capitol, rendering them \u201cvoid.\u201d",
      "Autopens have long been a mechanical tool to reproduce signatures in the White House, with Barack Obama being the first president to use it to sign legislation, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Previous administrations have pointed to a 2005 Office of Legal Counsel memo stating that the president \u201cneed not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law.\u201d",
      "Biden has frequently defended himself against claims about his mental fitness and memory.",
      "Former special counsel Robert Hur said in a report last year that Biden would probably present to a jury as a \"sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory\" in explaining his decision not to prosecute Biden after an investigation of his handling of classified documents.",

      "In an interview with ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d in May, Biden again denied having suffered from mental decline when he was president.",
      "\u201cThey are wrong,\u201d he said of the allegations.",

    "story": [
      "A casual viewer could be forgiven for mistaking Democrats\u2019 first New York City mayoral debate for the roast of Andrew Cuomo.",
      "All eight of his primary opponents took turns throwing verbal daggers Wednesday evening at Cuomo, who arrived on the debate stage at 30 Rockefeller Plaza with multiple suitcases of baggage to go with his status as the polling frontrunner.",
      "Cuomo, the former governor, has consistently led polls of the nine-candidate field, leveraging his name recognition as a longtime public official in New York and the scion of a storied political family. He resigned as governor in 2021 amid multiple sexual misconduct allegations and an investigation into the claims, but he is now attempting a comeback in New York City, where Democratic Mayor Eric Adams is running for re-election as an independent.",
      "Cuomo\u2019s front-runner status in the Democratic primary made him a constant target Wednesday night at the debate hosted by NBC New York, WNJU Telemundo and Politico. When Cuomo sidestepped a question about a 2021 report from the state attorney general accusing him of undercounting nursing home deaths during the Covid-19 pandemic, his opponents laughed in his face and jeered him.",
      "When Cuomo cited \u201cthe state of the Democratic Party\u201d when he was asked to name his biggest regret in his political career, Adrienne Adams, speaker of the New York City Council, pounced.",
      "\u201cNo regrets when it comes to cutting child care?\u201d Adams asked. \u201cNo regrets when it comes to slow-walking PPE and vaccinations in the season of Covid to Black and brown communities? Really, no regrets?\u201d",
      "And when Cuomo was asked about allegations of sexual harassment and responded by attacking his opponents for calling for the defunding of police, former state Assemblyman Michael Blake turned to the cameras to speak directly to the women of New York.",
      "\u201cEvery woman watching tonight: He was just given a chance to actually address the clear claims that were stated and ignored it,\u201d Blake said. Cuomo would later repeat his denial of the allegations, which mushroomed into an investigation led by state Attorney General Letitia James; it found that Cuomo had harassed 11 women and subjected some of them to unwanted touching and groping.",
      "Each candidate took a different tack attacking Cuomo, 67. His most viable opponent, according to recent polls, is state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, democratic socialist, who cast Cuomo as having been bought and paid for by billionaires.",
      "\u201cThe difference between myself and Andrew Cuomo is that my campaign is not funded by the very billionaires who put Donald Trump in D.C.,\u201d said Mamdani, 33.",
      "After Cuomo dodged difficult questions about his controversies, Mamdani said he is \u201callergic to any accountability or acknowledgment of a mistake.\u201d",
      "Cuomo did not hang back, instead trying to give as good as he was getting when he was attacked. And Mamdani, the youngest candidate onstage, also received his own slew of barbs. After he confidently proclaimed, \u201cI am Donald Trump\u2019s worst nightmare,\u201d Cuomo replied, \u201cDonald Trump would go through Mr. Mamdani like a hot knife through butter.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been in government 27 minutes. He passed three bills. That\u2019s all he\u2019s done,\u201d Cuomo said, contrasting his own experience with that of his opponent, who is less than half of his age.",
      "State Sen. Jessica Ramos got a jab in Mamdani when she was asked about her biggest regret. \u201cI regret not running for mayor in 2021,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI had been in the Senate for two years. I\u2019d already passed over a dozen bills. I thought I needed more experience, but turns out, you just need to make good videos,\u201d she said, poking fun at Mamdani\u2019s social media strategy, which has propelled his candidacy.",
      "Issues, including the city\u2019s housing crisis and public safety, took a back seat to bickering, with debate moderators struggling to control the nine candidates\u2019 speaking over one another and jousting for airtime ahead of the June 24 primary.",
      "In addition to Cuomo and Mamdani, who has burst onto the New York City political scene on a progressive platform, candidates jockeyed for position in the city\u2019s unpredictable ranked-choice voting system, which allows voters to choose multiple candidates and rank them on their ballots. The stage also included the current and former city comptrollers, Brad Lander and Scott Springer; state Sens. Ramos and Zellnor Myrie; and former hedge fund executive Whitney Tilson.",
      "While candidates outlined their proposals on major issues facing the city, like housing and public safety, quarrels overshadowed the substance.",
      "The city\u2019s most recent Housing and Vacancy Survey, conducted last year, found that the vacancy rate for apartments in the city dropped to 1.4%, the lowest rate since 1968. When it comes to units that cost less than $2,400 per month, the vacancy rate is below 1%.",
      "While Mamdani, Blake and Ramos have vowed to freeze the rent of rent-stabilized apartments, which are home to nearly 1 million New Yorkers, Tilson, the businessman on the stage, came at the issue from a different angle.",
      "\"I think we need to drop rents by 20% by unleashing the private sector to build a lot more housing,\" he said.",
      "Despite recent encouraging crime data from the city, which showed a record low 264 shootings citywide from January to May, the issue was a point of contention.",
      "Candidates presented their plans to combat crime in the subway system, which has become a front-of-mind concern for New Yorkers after a series of high-profile and gruesome acts of violence, including a woman\u2019s death after she was set on fire last year.",
      "Myrie called for 150 police-clinician teams to patrol subway cars and platforms at all hours of the day.",
      "Cuomo made a promise about his first month in office, should he become mayor.  \"In my first 30 days, I will take every homeless person off the trains and the subway stations and get them the help they need,\" he said.",
      "Blake called for 1,000 mental health professionals on the subways and streets, increasing bandwidth for police officers to handle other issues. \"The police will indicate they were not trained on addressing mental health,\" said Blake, who served in the Obama administration."

      "President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he will deny visas for foreign students trying to come to the United States to attend Harvard University, his latest attack on the prominent Ivy League college.",
      "The administration tried late last month to revoke Harvard\u2019s ability to enroll foreign students \u2014 a move that was swiftly blocked by a federal judge.",
      "In a proclamation Wednesday, Trump said Harvard failed to present sufficient information about its foreign students to the federal government.",
      "\u201cHarvard provided data on misconduct by only three students, and the data it provided was so deficient that the DHS could not evaluate whether it should take further actions,\u201d Trump said, referring to the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Harvard said it would fight to protect its international students.",
      "\"This is yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard\u2019s First Amendment rights,\" a spokesperson for the university said Wednesday night.",
      "Trump made his pledge as he announced what amounts to a travel ban for 12 countries and limitations on seven others.",
      "The proclamation said the president would \u201crestrict the entry of foreign nationals who seek to enter the United States solely or principally to participate in a course of study at Harvard University or in an exchange visitor program hosted by Harvard University.\u201d",
      "It added that the State Department would review existing foreign students under F, M or J visas to see whether their visas should be revoked.",
      "Trump and his administration have attacked Harvard, saying it has not done enough to combat antisemitism on campus during demonstrations against the Israel-Hamas war.",
      "Harvard in April rejected Trump administration demands that included auditing viewpoints of the student body. In response, the federal government said it was freezing more than $2 billion in federal grants.",
      "The administration previously sought to limit Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students by revoking its certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, Harvard said. The government also sought to prohibit Harvard from sponsoring F and J visas.",
      "Harvard President Alan M. Garber responded in a letter on May 23 that Harvard was being retaliated against for refusing to surrender to the Trump administration's illegal attempts to control it and its students.",
      "\"We condemn this unlawful and unwarranted action,\" Garber said. \"It imperils the futures of thousands of students and scholars across Harvard and serves as a warning to countless others at colleges and universities throughout the country who have come to America to pursue their education and fulfill their dreams.\""

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A Texas hospital that repeatedly sent a woman who was bleeding and in pain home without ending her nonviable, life-threatening pregnancy violated the law, according to a newly released federal investigation.",
      "The government\u2019s findings, which have not been previously reported, were a small victory for 36-year-old Kyleigh Thurman, who ultimately lost part of her reproductive system after being discharged after receiving no help from her hometown emergency room for her dangerous ectopic pregnancy.",
      "But a new policy the Trump administration announced Tuesday has thrown into doubt the federal government\u2019s stance on hospitals' denying women emergency abortions, even when they are at risk for serious infection, organ loss or severe hemorrhaging.",
      "Thurman had hoped the federal government\u2019s investigation, which was concluded last year and issued a report in April, would send a clear message that ectopic pregnancies must be treated by hospitals in Texas, which has one of the nation\u2019s strictest abortion bans.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want anyone else to have to go through this,\u201d Thurman said in an interview with the Associated Press from her Texas home this week. \u201cI put a lot of the responsibility on the state",
      "Uncertainty about emergency abortion access",
      "Women around the country have been denied emergency abortions for their life-threatening pregnancies after states swiftly enacted abortion restrictions in response to a 2022 ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court, which includes three appointees of President Donald Trump.",
      "The guidance issued by the Biden administration in 2022 was an effort to preserve access to emergency abortions for extreme cases in which women were in medical emergencies. It directed hospitals \u2014 even ones in states with severe restrictions \u2014 to provide abortions in those emergency cases. If hospitals did not comply, they would be in violation of a federal law and risk losing some federal funds.",
      "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency responsible for enforcing the law and inspecting hospitals, announced on Tuesday it would revoke the Biden-era guidance around emergency abortions. CMS administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said in a social media post on Wednesday that the revocation of the policy would not prevent pregnant women from getting treatment in medical emergencies.",
      "\u201cThe Biden Administration created confusion, but EMTALA is clear and the law has not changed: women will receive care for miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, and medical emergencies in all fifty states\u2014this has not and will never change in the Trump Administration,\u201d Oz wrote, using the acronyms for the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act.",
      "The law, which remains intact and requires doctors to provide stabilizing treatment, was one of the few ways that Thurman was able to hold the emergency room accountable after she didn\u2019t receive any help from staff at Ascension Seton Williamson in Round Rock, Texas, in February 2023, a few months after Texas enacted its strict abortion ban.",
      "An ectopic pregnancy left untreated",
      "Emergency room staff observed that Thurman\u2019s hormone levels had dropped, a pregnancy was not visible in her uterus and a structure was blocking her fallopian tube \u2014 all telltale signs of an ectopic pregnancy, when a fetus implants outside of the uterus and has no room to grow. If left untreated, ectopic pregnancies can rupture, causing organ damage, hemorrhage or even death.",
      "Thurman, however, was sent home and given a pamphlet on miscarriage for her first pregnancy. She returned three days later, still bleeding, and was given an injected drug intended to end the pregnancy, but it was too late. Days later, she showed up again at the emergency room, hemorrhaging because the fertilized egg growing on Thurman\u2019s fallopian tube ruptured it. She underwent an emergency surgery that removed part of her reproductive system.",
      "CMS launched its investigation of how Ascension Seton Williamson handled Thurman\u2019s case late last year, shortly after she filed a complaint. Investigators concluded the hospital failed to give her a proper medical screening exam, including an evaluation with an OB-GYN. The hospital violated the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, which requires emergency rooms to provide stabilizing treatment to all patients. Thurman was \u201cat risk for deterioration of her health and wellbeing as a result of an untreated medical condition,\u201d the investigation said in its report, which was publicly released last month.",
      "Ascension, a vast hospital system that has facilities across multiple states, did not respond to questions about Thurman\u2019s case, saying only that it is \u201cis committed to providing high-quality care to all who seek our services.\u201d",
      "Penalties for doctors, hospital staff members",
      "Doctors and legal experts have warned that abortion restrictions like the one Texas enacted have discouraged emergency room staff from aborting dangerous and nonviable pregnancies, even when a woman\u2019s life is imperiled. The stakes are especially high in Texas, where doctors face up to 99 years in prison if convicted of performing an illegal abortion. Lawmakers in the state are weighing a law that would remove criminal penalties for doctors who provide abortions in certain medical emergencies.",
      "\u201cWe see patients with miscarriages being denied care, bleeding out in parking lots. We see patients with nonviable pregnancies being told to continue those to term,\u201d said Molly Duane, an attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights that represented Thurman. \u201cThis is not, maybe, what some people thought abortion bans would look like, but this is the reality.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration routinely warned hospitals that they needed to provide abortions when a woman\u2019s health was in jeopardy, even suing Idaho over its state law that initially prohibited nearly all abortions, unless a woman\u2019s life was on the line.",
      "Questions about hospital investigations remain",
      "But CMS\u2019 announcement on Tuesday raises questions about whether such investigations will continue if hospitals do not provide abortions for women in medical emergencies.",
      "The agency said it will still enforce the law, \u201cincluding for identified emergency medical conditions that place the health of a pregnant woman or her unborn child in serious jeopardy.\u201d",
      "While states like Texas have clarified that ectopic pregnancies can legally be treated with abortions, the laws do not provide for every complication that might arise during a pregnancy. Several women in Texas have sued the state for its law, which has prevented women from terminating pregnancies in cases where their fetuses had deadly fetal anomalies or they went into labor too early for the fetus to survive.",
      "Thurman worries pregnant patients with serious complications still won\u2019t be able to get the help they may need in Texas emergency rooms.",
      "\u201cYou cannot predict the ways a pregnancy can go,\u201d Thurman said. \u201cIt can happen to anyone, still. There\u2019s still so many ways in which pregnancies that aren\u2019t ectopic can be deadly.\u201d"

      "In a return of one of the most controversial policies of his first term, President Donald Trump signed a proclamation Wednesday banning nationals from a dozen countries, including Afghanistan, Haiti and the Republic of Congo, from entering the United States.",
      "Trump framed the new restrictions, which primarily target African and Asian countries, as necessary to fortify national security and combat terrorism.",
      "\"As President, I must act to protect the national security and national interest of the United States and its people. I remain committed to engaging with those countries willing to cooperate to improve information-sharing and identity-management procedures, and to address both terrorism-related and public-safety risks,\" the proclamation read.",
      "Nationals of 12 countries will be barred from entering the United States: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.",
      "Several of the countries on the list, according to Trump\u2019s proclamation, regularly declined to accept the return of their nationals or had visa overstay rates the administration deemed \u201cunacceptable\u201d and indicative of \u201ca blatant disregard for United States immigration laws.\u201d",
      "Others on the list, like Sudan, Yemen and Somalia, were included for inadequate screening and vetting measures, the proclamation noted.",
      "An additional seven countries came under partial travel restrictions, in which entrance into the country under several visa programs was suspended but an outright ban was not implemented. Those countries are Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.",
      "The proclamation includes exemptions for any lawful permanent resident of the United States, recipients of Afghan Special Immigrant Visas, diplomatic visas, immediate family member immigrant visas and visas \u201cfor ethnic and religious minorities in Iran.\u201d It also included exceptions for adoptions, dual nationals traveling on passports from unrestricted countries and athlete or members of athletic teams traveling to the country for the World Cup or the Olympics.",
      "The travel restrictions are set to go into effect at 12:01 a.m. ET Monday.",
      "The travel ban risks worsening already strained geopolitical tensions, with the United States' role on the global stage having been shaken in recent months by Trump's efforts to enact tariffs on dozens of countries nationwide, cut humanitarian aid to poorer nations and force countries to accept immigrants he's seeking to deport while punishing those that do not.",
      "In a video the White House shared Wednesday night, Trump called the travel restrictions \"a key part of preventing major foreign terror attacks on American soil.\"",
      "He began the message by pointing to recent violence in Boulder, Colorado, where a man injured at least 12 demonstrators in what city officials called an antisemitic attack, as justification for a renewed travel ban.",
      "\u201cA recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, has underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas. We don\u2019t want them,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The suspect in the attack, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is from Egypt, and he entered the country on a tourist visa before he applied for asylum. His tourist visa expired as his asylum case was pending. Egypt is not on the list of countries under the newly announced travel bans.",
      "Soliman's family were taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Tuesday and were being processed for removal proceedings, according to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. A judge subsequently issued an order Wednesday to prevent the deportation of Soliman's wife and five children.",
      "Trump added that his administration considered \u201cthe large-scale presence of terrorists, failure to cooperate on visa security, inability to verify travelers identities, inadequate record-keeping of criminal histories, and persistently high rates of illegal visa overstays\u201d in determining the countries that would be affected by the ban.",
      "Alex Nowrasteh, the vice president for economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan and independent public policy research organization, noted that even though Trump cited terrorism-related concerns in announcing the new restrictions, terrorist attacks by people from the 12 countries facing outright bans are rare.",
      "\u201cA single terrorist from those countries murdered one person in an attack on US soil: Emanuel Kidega Samson from Sudan, who committed an attack motivated by anti-white animus in 2017. The annual chance of being murdered by a terrorist from one of the banned countries from 1975 to the end of 2024 was about 1 in 13.9 billion per year,\u201d Nowrasteh wrote.",
      "The new travel restrictions mark the return of one of the most divisive policies of Trump's first term, a 2017 travel ban that he called one of his \u201cmost successful policies\" Wednesday.",
      "During his first term, Trump similarly banned foreigners from six Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, citing terrorism concerns. Despite Democratic backlash and several legal challenges to the effort, the Supreme Court ultimately upheld the policy in a split decision, with Chief Justice John Roberts making it clear that the ability to regulate immigration falls within the president\u2019s purview.",
      "The president can block non-nationals from coming into the United States, Roberts said at the time, if the determination is made that allowing them to enter \u201cwould be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\u201d Meanwhile, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissent that based on the evidence in the case, \u201ca reasonable observer would conclude that the Proclamation was motivated by anti-Muslim animus.\u201d",
      "Iran, Libya, Somalia and Yemen are the only countries included across both of Trump\u2019s travel bans.",
      "Those restrictions remained in place until Jan. 20, 2021, when then-newly elected President Biden overturned them after he signed a proclamation titled \u201cEnding Discriminatory Bans on Entry to The United States.\u201d",
      "Trump has for years expressed a desire to limit immigration from Haiti and African nations, deriding them as \"shithole\" countries and making clear his preference for European immigrants in discussing the visa lottery system at a White House meeting in 2018.",
      "Shortly after he took office for the second time, Trump limited refugee admissions from almost all countries, including Afghanistan, Sudan, the Republic of Congo and Myanmar. In May, however, he granted refugee status to 59 South Africans from the white ethnic group that ruled South Africa during apartheid.",
      "The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration Friday to revoke the temporary legal status of more than 500,000 immigrants that was granted by the Biden administration, making them subject to deportation. Those parolees came from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.",
      "The Trump administration canceled an extension of Haiti\u2019s Temporary Protected Status in February after the Biden administration extended the designation into 2026 because of violence and political turmoil on the island. It has also undertaken similar attempts to end TPS for the millions of Venezuelans who entered the country under the protection."

    "summary": "Offensive pace and defensive pressure are hallmarks for the Thunder and Pacers as they begin the NBA Finals.",
    "story": [
      "OKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 There are many ways to describe the NBA Finals.",
      "Some see Oklahoma City vs. Indiana as the small-market Finals. To others, it\u2019s known as the fiscal Finals \u2014 a rare championship matchup between non-luxury-tax-paying teams.",
      "On the court, it is a showdown between two of the league\u2019s best guards, Thunder MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Pacers All-Star Tyrese Haliburton.",
      "Yet how these teams reached this point, just four victories from a title, can also be captured in a different way.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the two hardest-playing teams in the NBA,\u201d a Western Conference coach told NBC News.",
      "Since Jan. 1, the Thunder own the NBA\u2019s best record and the Pacers the second-best, in large part because of how each has blitzed the rest of the league through its frenetic pace and pressure. The Thunder's harassing defense has become one of the best in playoff history at forcing steals.",
      "Indiana, meanwhile, plays as if driven to push the ball upcourt as fast as possible. It\u2019s common for teams to play fast off opponents\u2019 turnovers and missed shots \u2014 but the Pacers have lived up to their name by running hard even after made baskets, and in the process they have created flurries of scoring opportunities that have knocked off the Eastern Conference\u2019s No. 1 (Cleveland) and No. 3 (New York) seeds en route to the team\u2019s first Finals appearance in 25 years.",
      "NBC News spoke with NBA insiders to help analyze the series, which begins with Thursday\u2019s Game 1. All were afforded anonymity in exchange for their candor and analysis, which their teams don\u2019t permit them to voice publicly.",
      "The Pacers are \u201corganized chaos,\u201d said a scout for a Western Conference team. \u201cThey suck you into their style of play, where it\u2019s not going to be a lot of defense but they\u2019re just going to race the ball up and down the court, spread you out, shoot 3s, get to the basket, try to turn you over and just get in a rat race type of game. If you can match up with teams that struggle to do that, like New York, then you\u2019re going to have a good chance to win.",
      "\u201cThe problem with Oklahoma City is they can play multiple ways. They enjoy playing fast, but they also can slow it down and use Shai in the halfcourt. It\u2019ll be a chess match to see which style of play wins out. Who breaks first and wants to play one way and not the other?\u201d",
      "Oklahoma City, which won 68 regular-season games to earn the West\u2019s top seed, was a heavy favorite to reach the Finals all season, even though it had the second-youngest roster ever to do so. The Thunder ranked No. 1 in defense during both the regular season and the postseason, owing to their phalanx of strong defenders. The challenge begins beyond the 3-point arc, where Lu Dort was successful during Oklahoma City's 2-0 record against Indiana during the regular season at limiting how often Haliburton touched the ball. The rim, meanwhile, is protected by Isaiah Hartenstein and Chet Holmgren.",
      "\u201cI think OKC is so strong defensively that they can kind of take you away from your first and second options,\u201d an Eastern Conference scout said. \u201cThey\u2019ve found a way to identify players that fit the modern style of play, which is being able to defend and shoot, and then you have obviously a transcendent MVP who can create opportunities for others.\u201d",
      "The West scout said some teams construct defenses around a few excellent players, while others try to elevate five otherwise average defenders through a system that makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts.",
      "\u201cBut I think with OKC, you\u2019re getting kind of both,\u201d the West scout said. \u201cYou\u2019re getting great individual performance while also very well-connected with each other. And it shows in the off-the-court stuff with them, where they like being with each other, like playing for one another.\u201d",
      "Haliburton on Wednesday called the Thunder \u201chistorically great on both sides of the ball.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the best team in the NBA,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been the best team in the NBA all year. They\u2019re well-coached. They just do everything so well. There\u2019s no shortcuts to beating this team.\u201d",
      "Beating Indiana will require Oklahoma City to do the one thing no one has yet to do consistently \u2014 force the Pacers to beat themselves. Indiana's preferred pace is fast, yet it rarely turns the ball over. In the postseason, Indiana has gone 6-2 on the road by owning the highest road assist-to-turnover ratio, and it has assisted on a playoff-high 65% of its baskets because it plays lineups often with five players capable of hitting 3-pointers, including center Myles Turner, whose ability to shoot \"always messes teams up from a matchup perspective,\" the West coach said.",

      "That offensive depth makes the Pacers trickier to guard than Oklahoma City's past playoff opponents; it could focus its defensive efforts to take away Ja Morant of Memphis, Nikola Joki\u0107 of Denver and Anthony Edwards of Minnesota. Though Oklahoma City is heavily favored to win the series, Indiana can't be underestimated, an executive for an Eastern team said.",
      "\"They understand how they\u2019re playing, and they\u2019re very stubborn in their approach,\" he said. \"They kind of grind you with the way they play. They wear you down.\"",
      "Both franchises reflect the realities of the modern NBA, in which the league\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with its players has instituted rules aimed at penalizing teams that build expensive rosters by making it harder to draft or make trades when their payrolls cross a certain threshold. Though Oklahoma City has a star in Gilgeous-Alexander and the Pacers claim Haliburton as their own, both have found success in building deep teams that can punish opponents by coming at them in waves of long arms and fresh legs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s why the day of the aging superstar will be over in the next two years,\u201d the West coach said. \u201cIndiana\u2019s best talent for the majority of their roster is how hard they play. TJ McConnell, Aaron Nesmith, Benedict Mathurin, throw Pascal Siakam in there \u2014 they\u2019re just junkyard dogs, and they do it every single night.\u201d"

      "For the crowds outside Nintendo\u2019s store in New York\u2019s Rockefeller Center on Wednesday, a long wait was well worth getting their hands on the new Switch 2 console.",
      "Some camped out for hours, bringing their own makeshift waterproof tents and lawn chairs. Others stood in the line, which stretched several city blocks. A handful even dressed up as iconic Nintendo characters, including Luigi, the beloved brother and sidekick in the video game \u201cSuper Mario.\u201d",
      "\u201cReally, it\u2019s just all about the community and sort of sharing that love of Nintendo with each other,\u201d said Lauren Hyde, who has been in line since she traveled from Maryland on Monday.",
      "The Japanese gaming giant is releasing the coveted console Thursday, eight years after the original version hit shelves. The first iteration of the Switch was a major hit for Nintendo, selling roughly 150 million units, according to the company, making it the third-best-selling console of all time, behind the PS2 and the Nintendo DS.",
      "The hype for the Switch 2 has been building for months, with Nintendo teasing a brief first look at it in January. With a bigger screen, better graphics and larger controls, the next iteration of the console has drummed up enough enthusiasm among gamers that many showed up early at stores like Best Buy and GameStop to pick up their units at midnight.",
      "\u201cWe have a lot of wonderful products that create buzz,\u201d said Jason Bonfig, Best Buy\u2019s senior executive vice president in charge of customer offerings and fulfillment. \u201cSwitch is very, very special. They\u2019re a passionate community.\u201d",
      "Bonfig estimated that 70% of Best Buy\u2019s customers indicated they wanted to pick up their Switch 2s in-store, \u201cand the vast majority of those customers will be there at midnight to do so.\u201d",
      "\u201cSomething about consumer electronics in general with that instant gratification is really important,\u201d he added.",
      "Meanwhile, the Nintendo Store is selling units at midnight only to those who secured reservations on its website, meaning many lining up outside its New York City location were doing so mostly for fun.",
      "Nintendo even warned in a message on its website that \u201cdelivery by June 5 is not guaranteed\u201d for customers who had not already secured pre-order invitations.",
      "Though consumers have been fatigued by high prices amid the ongoing global trade war, Nintendo said in April that it would not hike the price of the $449.99 device at launch.",
      "There is also hope among some in the gaming world that the Switch 2 could spur the creation of new games and therefore new jobs. The industry has taken a hit in recent years after widespread layoffs affected many studios, and a performers strike has continued into 2025.",
      "While some companies release consoles to reviewers early, Nintendo has remained quiet about many of the details of the Switch 2, holding off on review copies for gaming news sites like IGN.",
      "Nintendo has not commented on how many customers have pre-ordered the Switch 2."

      "A federal judge ordered the Trump administration Wednesday to provide hundreds of migrants sent to CECOT, a maximum-security terrorism confinement center in El Salvador, with habeas relief, ordering the government to give them opportunities to challenge their detentions and removals under President Donald Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The order applies to all noncitizens removed from U.S. custody and transferred to CECOT \"on March 15 and 16, 2025, pursuant solely to the Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of The United States by Tren De Aragua.'\"",
      "It will not apply to migrants such as Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man removed from the country around the same time, but for reasons other than Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "\u201cDefendants plainly deprived these individuals of their right to seek habeas relief before their summary removal from the United States \u2014 a right that need not itself be vindicated through a habeas petition,\u201d U.S. District Judge James Boasberg of Washington, D.C., wrote in the order. \u201cPerhaps the President lawfully invoked the Alien Enemies Act. Perhaps, moreover, Defendants are correct that Plaintiffs are gang members. But \u2014 and this is the critical point \u2014 there is simply no way to know for sure, as the CECOT Plaintiffs never had any opportunity to challenge the Government\u2019s say-so.\u201d",
      "Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act in March to target members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang the administration deems a foreign terrorist organization and accuses of engaging in \"mass illegal migration to the United States to further its objectives of harming United States citizens.\" By invoking the wartime law, Trump was able to swiftly detain and remove immigrants he claimed were members of the gang.",
      "One day after he invoked the Act, the Trump administration announced it had deported hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members on at least two planes to El Salvador, even as Boasberg in a ruling at the time blocked the deportations and ordered any flights carrying migrants subject to the presidential proclamation to return to the United States.",
      "The Trump administration challenged the block on its Alien Enemies Act deportations, but the ruling was upheld by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for Washington, D.C. The U.S. Supreme Court later faulted the administration for giving the Venezuelan detainees only 24 hours to challenge their deportations before it returned the case to an appeals court for further proceedings.",
      "Boasberg noted in his ruling that the Supreme Court unanimously agreed \"that those subject to removal under the Act must be allowed to challenge their removability in federal court before being deported.\"",
      "\"Defendants instead spirited away planeloads of people before any such challenge could be made. And now, significant evidence has come to light indicating that many of those currently entombed in CECOT have no connection to the gang and thus languish in a foreign prison on flimsy, even frivolous, accusations,\" he wrote.",
      "Boasberg has given the government a week to propose a plan about \"how they intend to facilitate the ability of the CECOT class to seek habeas relief,\" making it clear that the Venezuelan migrants must be granted the opportunity to contest their removals under the Alien Enemies Act but conceding that \"such a remedy may implicate sensitive diplomatic or national-security concerns.\"",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Lawyers for the nonprofit groups representing the migrants praised the ruling as affirming that the right to due process extends to people who are in the country illegally.",
      "\u201cThe court properly recognized that the government cannot send people to a notorious foreign gulag without due process and then wash its hands of the situation,\u201d said American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt, the lead counsel in the case."

    "summary": "Immigration and Customs Enforcement made the highest number of arrests in a single day in its history on Tuesday, detaining more than 2,200 people.",
    "story": [
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement made the most immigrant arrests in a single day in its history Tuesday, detaining more than 2,200 people, according to a source familiar with the arrests and an ICE spokesperson who confirmed the numbers, as the agency responds to pressure from the White House to rapidly and dramatically increase arrests.",
      "Hundreds of the people who were arrested had been enrolled in ICE\u2019s Alternative to Detention (ATD) program, three sources familiar with the arrests said. Under the program, ICE releases undocumented immigrants who are deemed not to be threats to public safety and then keeps track of them through ankle monitors, smartphone apps or other geolocating programs, along with periodic check-ins at ICE facilities.",
      "At least some of the arrests appear to be the result of a new ICE tactic: Immigration attorneys across the country told NBC News that some of their clients on ATD were asked in a mass text message ICE sent out to show up ahead of schedule for check-ins at ICE offices, only to be arrested when they arrived.",
      "An NBC News reporter saw seven people who had come for check-ins at a New York City ICE office Wednesday being led out in cuffs and put into unmarked cars. One, a 30-year-old Colombian man, was followed close behind by his wife, who was sobbing loudly, and his daughter, who tried to chase after him as law enforcement agents in masks led him and two other men in handcuffs into waiting vehicles.",
      "Margaret Cargioli, the directing attorney at the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, who represents the family, told reporters afterward that the man had gone \u201cto every single [ICE] appointment. He was, you know, very cooperative with all of the requirements that were made of him.\u201d",
      "Veronica Navarrete was waiting outside the immigration office for a friend, an asylum-seeker from Ecuador, who had been told to report to the office Wednesday. She told NBC News she had seen immigrants pacing outside the building all day, some of them seeming to her to be contemplating whether to show up for their appointments at all.",
      "\u201cIf you enter, there\u2019s a possibility that they\u2019ll take you into custody,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t enter, you\u2019ve missed your appointment, and that\u2019s automatic deportation. We have no way out.\u201d",
      "About the arrests of immigrants with ankle monitors who were reporting for appointments, the ICE spokesperson said, \u201cThose arrested had executable final orders of removal by an immigration judge and had not complied with that order.\u201d",
      "Asked for clarification, as multiple lawyers who have spoken with NBC News said their clients did not have final orders of removal, the spokesperson did not immediately respond.",
      "The White House deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller, threatened in a meeting with ICE leadership last month to fire senior officials if the agency does not start making 3,000 arrests per day, according to two sources who spoke to attendees.",
      "President Donald Trump has promised to deport \u201cmillions,\u201d while his border \u201cczar,\u201d Tom Homan, has said the administration will focus on deporting the \u201cworst of the worst.\u201d But former ICE officials say it will not be possible for ICE to hit the numbers Trump that has talked about and that it is under increasing demands to reach quickly while it focuses only on people with criminal histories.",
      "As of late last month, more than 20,000 ankle monitors were in use by ICE, according to ICE data. According to the same data, 98.5% of people on ATD appear for their check-ins, making them easy targets as ICE moves to increase its arrest numbers.",
      "\u201c[With] mass arresting of people on Alternatives to Detention or at their ICE check ins or at immigration court hearings, the dragnet is so wide that there\u2019s no possible valid argument that could be made that these individuals are all dangerous,\u201d said Atenas Burrola Estrada, an attorney with the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights.",
      "Greg Chen, the senior director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said he is hearing that more immigrant clients are afraid to show up in court or at check-ins out of fear they will be arrested.",
      "\u201cPeople are now increasingly afraid and intimidated because of the way that ICE is executing these kinds of enforcement priorities on such a widespread, indiscriminate and mass scale.\u201d Chen said.",

      "Bryana Bongolan, a friend of Diddy\u2019s former girlfriend Casandra Ventura, testified today to a terrifying moment involving the music mogul in September 2016. Bongolan said she was sleeping on the couch at Ventura\u2019s 17th-floor Los Angeles apartment when Diddy banged on the door. She went out to the balcony to smoke marijuana, and Diddy, who had gotten inside, \u201ccame behind me and lifted me up and had me on top of the rail,\u201d she testified. He held her for about 10 to 15 seconds, she said, and \u201cfor a second, I thought I was going to fall.\u201d She said Diddy was yelling at her and she didn\u2019t know why.",
      "Here\u2019s what else to know about today\u2019s testimony:",
      "Bongolan testified that while upset, Diddy once threw a knife in Ventura\u2019s direction, and she threw it back; both their throws missed. In another interaction, Bongolan said, Diddy allegedly told her something along the lines of, \u201cI am the devil and I can kill you.\u201d She testified that Diddy had taken cocaine at the time he made the comments.During cross-examination, defense lawyer Nicole Westmoreland tried to discredit Bongolan\u2019s memory of the alleged dangling incident. Bongolan answered, \u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d multiple times when challenged.The government also called Frank Piazza, a forensic video expert, who testified about the authenticity of the hotel security video of Diddy assaulting Ventura in March 2016 as well as related cellphone videos. The hotel video, which has been central to the prosecution\u2019s case, was not altered, according to Piazza.",

      "\ud83d\udd0e The view from inside",
      "By Adam Reiss and Jing Feng",
      "Diddy watched the jury closely when they first took their seats. He was also attentive when it came to the testimony. Much of today was spent looking at security footage and cellphone videos, and he peered at the monitor in front of him.",
      "Piazza\u2019s testimony going over the videos may have seemed technical, but the long stretch spent looking at Diddy assaulting Ventura could also have a cumulative effect on the jury.",
      "In other news: Diddy\u2019s lawyers complained to Judge Arun Subramanian that although Diddy has 300 minutes for phone calls, for some reason, he can\u2019t get in touch with lawyers at night. Defense lawyer Xavier Donaldson called it \u201cunacceptable.\u201d Subramanian said he would reach out to the jail and see what could be done.",
      "\ud83d\udc68\u200d\u2696\ufe0f Analysis: Is the video relevant?",
      "By Danny Cevallos",
      "The last two days have featured testimony about the 2016 hotel beating video. The government first called a hotel security officer who testified that Diddy paid $100,000 in cash in a brown paper bag in exchange for the video. Today, prosecutors called a forensic video expert, who narrated the events on screen, frame by frame. So why is the video relevant if Diddy was not charged with the assault that was recorded?",
      "The defense tried mightily to exclude the video, arguing, in part, that any relevance was outweighed by the prejudicial effect. It lost.",
      "How the video fits into the government\u2019s theory of the case appears to be this: Prosecutors allege the drug-fueled sexual encounters known as \u201cfreak offs\u201d constituted commercial sex acts (for purposes of sex trafficking).",
      "The video shows Diddy using force or coercion \u2014 one of the necessary elements of sex trafficking \u2014 to prevent Ventura from escaping a \u201cfreak off,\u201d as she said during her testimony.",
      "The cash payment to hotel security is then an effort to conceal that conduct. Plus, racketeering charges are often about a boss corrupting his own company.",
      "Finally, the government is very skilled at finding a way to introduce the most devastating evidence against a defendant \u2014 which it's done here.",
      "\ud83d\uddd3\ufe0f What\u2019s next",
      "Tomorrow: The defense plans to continue cross-examining Bongolan as court resumes later than usual. Also, a Diddy accuser who will go by the pseudonym \u201cJane\u201d is expected to begin multiple days of testimony. Jane, who was identified as \u201cVictim-2\u201d in the prosecution\u2019s indictment, was allegedly engaged in commercial sex acts \u201cas a result of force, fraud or coercion.\u201d",

    "summary": "Just days after he left his role as one of Trump\u2019s closest advisers, Elon Musk has launched a campaign to sink the tax and spending bill tied to Trump's policy agenda.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Just days after he left his powerful position as one of Donald Trump\u2019s closest advisers, Elon Musk is orchestrating a pressure campaign to sink the mammoth tax and spending package that is the centerpiece of the president\u2019s policy agenda.",
      "Musk used X, his social media site, on Wednesday to implore Americans to call Congress and urge it to \u201ckill\u201d the bill that Trump hails as \u201cbig\u201d and \u201cbeautiful.\u201d",
      "He also urged lawmakers to rewrite the bill from scratch, putting him squarely at odds with Trump, who had invited him into Cabinet meetings and empowered him to dismantle whole agencies and shrink the government workforce.",
      "The bill, which has already passed the House, faces an uncertain fate in the Senate, where just four Republican defections would spell defeat.",
      "It doesn\u2019t sit well with Trump world that Musk is the messenger. Trump is considering when and how to respond to Musk\u2019s gambit, a White House official said. He was \u201ccaught off guard\u201d but \"not entirely surprised\" by Musk\u2019s opposition, a senior official said.",
      "Trump had sent Musk off in style, giving him a golden key and staging a goodbye ceremony in the Oval Office that the media covered live.",
      "\u201cThe president wanted to be a nice guy,\u201d the senior official said.",
      "Musk\u2019s posts come a day after his surprising break with Trump over the bill\u2019s merits. On Tuesday, he called the measure a \u201cdisgusting abomination,\u201d warning that it would push the nation deeper into debt.",
      "Having elevated Musk and made him a prized sidekick, Trump may discover that the world\u2019s richest man is a potential nemesis beyond his control.",
      "A White House official downplayed the notion of a falling-out with Musk.",
      "\u201cEveryone here in a senior role understands who Elon Musk is, understands how he acts, understands how he plays,\u201d the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cThere\u2019s been no surprise when it comes to Elon Musk, because he\u2019s been such a friend to the administration.",
      "\u201cAnd we all know this is coming from a place of business and is not personal.\u201d",
      "But people in Trump\u2019s orbit were angry that Musk skewered the bill. They were particularly outraged by his not-so-veiled warning that Republicans who vote for it could lose their jobs come November 2026, a person familiar with the matter said. That assertion came after Musk said late last month that he would do \u201ca lot less\u201d political spending going forward.",
      "A Republican lawmaker, in a private text chain with colleagues, wrote sarcastically of Musk: \u201cTeam Player.\u201d",
      "Trump is normally quick to clap back at those who publicly oppose his interests. When Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., objected Tuesday on CNBC that the bill would inflate the national debt, Trump swiftly denounced him.",
      "\u201cThe people of Kentucky can\u2019t stand him,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social.",
      "In the case of Musk, Trump so far has been silent. The disparate treatment may be rooted in cold political reality. Paul doesn\u2019t have a national following, while Musk, with his capacity to influence the midterm elections, is someone Trump may not wish to antagonize.",
      "Musk spent more than $250 million to boost Trump last year and is free to pour money into a midterm campaign season in which control of Congress is up for grabs. If Democrats seize the majority, they could saddle Trump with serial investigations and perhaps impeachment proceedings in the back half of his term.",
      "Republican lawmakers, too, trod carefully Wednesday when they were asked about Musk\u2019s evisceration of Trump\u2019s key legislative priority. Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana quipped: \u201cWell, let me say this about Elon. I wish he wouldn\u2019t sugarcoat stuff.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s really smart,\u201d Kennedy added. \u201cI think he\u2019s entitled to his opinion. He\u2019s frustrated. I think he believes, in my judgment correctly, that we\u2019re quickly becoming debt slaves.\u201d",
      "Still, Musk\u2019s apostasy shows the inherent risks in Trump\u2019s executive style. As a centibillionaire, Musk never fit neatly in the Trump administration\u2019s chain of command. He squabbled with at least two Cabinet secretaries and found that his private interests clashed at times with Trump\u2019s policy goals.",
      "Trump\u2019s bill would curtail the electric vehicle and residential solar tax credits that are important to Musk\u2019s Tesla car and clean energy divisions. The measure would also impose a new annual $250 fee on EV drivers.",
      "Musk spoke to Trump personally about extending the electric vehicle credit, a person familiar with the matter said.",
      "He also pressed some senior lawmakers on Capitol Hill, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., in recent weeks \u2014 before his recent X posts \u2014 to keep tax credits in the bill that would incentivize electric vehicle purchases, three people familiar with the conversations said. One of the sources said Musk had lobbied Johnson as recently as in the past few days.",
      "The tax credits had been eliminated to get the most conservative House members on board as part of the delicate negotiations to ensure the bill\u2019s passage.",
      "\u201cAbruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America\u2019s energy independence and the reliability of our grid \u2014 we urge the senate to enact legislation with a sensible wind down\u201d of the credits, Tesla Energy posted on X on May 28, the day Musk officially left his government role.",
      "In opposing the bill, Musk has amplified a point that the more fiscally conservative Republicans also find troubling: The measure would greatly add to America\u2019s whopping debt. A new analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office holds that the House-passed version of the bill would inflate the debt by $2.4 trillion over the next decade.",
      "Paul, the senator from Kentucky, wrote Tuesday that he wants trillions in new debt \u201cremoved\u201d from the measure and that four of his colleagues \u201cfeel this way.\u201d",
      "An open question is the degree to which Americans care what Musk thinks. His public approval rating was underwater amid his association with the Department of Government Efficiency and the drastic cuts that left many government workers suddenly unemployed. An NBC News poll in March found that 51% of registered voters held negative views of Musk, with only 39% viewing him positively.",
      "Lawmakers seeking campaign donations may be solicitous of Musk and the news media may treat him with outsize interest because of the role Trump gave him, but can he shape public opinion on controversial legislation?",
      "Newt Gingrich, the Republican former House speaker, suggested the answer is no.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t seen any\u201d public constituency for Musk, Gingrich told NBC News. \u201cIf you can find one, call me.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a big admirer of his as an entrepreneur, but he never understood the political business, and he doesn\u2019t now,\u201d he added.",
      "That having been said, \u201cI\u2019m sure no one on the Trump team thinks it\u2019s helpful,\u201d Gingrich added.",
      "Democrats are delighted by Musk\u2019s dissent and the rift it exposes inside GOP ranks.",
      "\u201cMusk is right about this,\u201d Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., told NBC News. \u201cHe\u2019s been wrong about a whole lot of other things.\u201d"

    "summary": "Prince Royce brings classics to a new generation with bilingual bachata album \"Eterno.\" He talks about the covers included on the album in a TODAY.com interview.",
    "story": [
      "When Prince Royce released his first hit song, \u201cStand By Me,\u201d in 2010, the singer wasn\u2019t very excited about the moment.",
      "\u201cI was actually bummed out when I recorded 'Stand By Me' because originally I had released a song called \u2018Coraz\u00f3n Sin Cara\u2019 that was this song about inner beauty. It was this beautiful song that I had written and I thought was definitely a hit,\u201d Royce, 36, tells TODAY.com. \u201cAnd I put that song out, and it didn\u2019t work.\u201d",
      "His record label suggested three songs to cover, including Ben E. King\u2019s \u201cStand By Me.\u201d He reluctantly recorded the song but with a Spanglish bachata twist and without any expectations.",
      "The song became a hit, peaking at No. 8 on Billboard's Hot Latin Songs chart.",
      "The success of \u201cStand By Me,\u201d Royce says, really opened up a \u201clot of doors for me, and I realized what the power of a cover could do.\u201d",
      "Now, 15 years later, Royce is having a full-circle moment with his latest album, \u201cEterno,\u201d which translates to \"Eternal\" and is a 13-track record of cover songs.",
      "The singer brings his signature sultry bachata sound with the arrangements of classic hits from the Backstreet Boys, Bee Gees, the Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, Stevie Wonder and more \u2014 and yes, they include that Spanglish twist.",
      "\u201cBeing able to bring certain people that remember the song back into their time, and reintroducing the song to a different generation,\u201d he says, \u201cI think that that\u2019s what the concept of this album was, bringing that nostalgia back from the eras of the \u201870s, \u201880s, \u201890s, and reintroducing it to Latin America and to today.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year during Premio Lo Nuestro, Royce teased his album, out now, with a performance medley of the Temptations\u2019 \u201cMy Girl,\u201d \u201cHow Deep Is Your Love\u201d by Bee Gees and King Harvest\u2019s \u201cDancing in the Moonlight.\u201d",
      "Most recently, Royce and Richard Marx came together to sing the Spanglish version of \u201cRight Here Waiting,\u201d which is included in \u201cEterno.\u201d The moment was captured on Instagram and shows the two artists switching in Spanish and English as they sing a verse and the chorus.",
      "\u201cI love that you\u2019re going to turn a whole other generation on to this song,\u201d Marx says in the video.",
      "\"I'm 100% Latino, Dominican, and also 100% American,\" Royce tells TODAY.com, adding, \u201cThis is so much more than just a covers album. It\u2019s bringing all these cultures together.\u201d",
      "Below, Royce shares his insight into the creation of \u201cEterno,\u201d touring and the growth of bachata in recent decades.",
      "This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.",
      "What are some of the biggest challenges when selecting the covers for the album?",
      "For me, it was getting educated on, getting very in depth with each song. Who wrote it, what genre was it, when did it come out? What did they do? I like respecting the record.",
      "For the translations, I really wanted to be the closest to the original song, as far as the meaning of what they were trying to say \u2014 and then try to bring in my essence to it. You know, keep some things that I thought were key moments, but bring things that I felt could be different in my style or change it up. That's kind of how I went about each song.",
      "You wrote all the new renditions. Talk to me about the process of putting your personal spin on the songs.",
      "I think it was actually more difficult than doing my own albums because when I'm recording my own song, if I don't like something, I'll just change it. If I don't like a chord, if I don't like a melody, if I don't like a change that they presented to me, I would just change it and then that's it.",
      "Here, I was more forced to stay in the box of what the original song was, because I didn't want to change it too much. I didn't want to be, like, crazy change and people be like, \"Whoa, that wasn't what the song was.\" That'd be maybe an interpolation instead of a cover. That was really more the challenge, which, I like the challenge. I think the challenge was fun to do things with my voice that I normally wouldn't do.",
      "The Backstreet Boys cover of \"I Want It That Way\" is a fun one and more modern. Tell me why you chose that song.",
      "Everything was from back in the day and I said, \"I don't know if this album is about just songs from the '70s or just the '80s. What about something from the '90s?\" It was actually my producer who was like, \"Yo, what about Backstreet?\" And I thought, is that song old enough or is that too recent? But then I Googled it and it's 25 years old.",
      "I think it\u2019s safe to say that it\u2019s (old) enough to say it\u2019s a classic. And I think that\u2019s been one of the favorites, for real. I feel like a lot of people genuinely have been drawn to that song, and I\u2019m happy I included it because I was reluctant, thinking, \u201cMan, is it too recent in comparison to the other songs?\u201d",
      "Were there any songs that you wanted to cover but weren't able to?",
      "One of the songs was \u201cHuman Nature\u201d by Michael Jackson. I had recorded it and I wasn\u2019t sure if it perfectly fit in there. I decided to just leave it out because I was unsure if it flowed. I keep thinking, \u201cWell, maybe I should have tried something else or tried harder.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s so many artists that were left out. I mean, there\u2019s just thousands of songs. There\u2019s so many ways you can go.",
      "You're planning on going on tour. What can fans expect and what will the songs from this album look like onstage?",
      "There's no tour dates yet, but there should be a tour hopefully by the end of the year.",
      "With every tour and every album, I always bring in hits from all the albums. I am going a little more theatrical with this album. I have 13 music videos and they all kind of connect. It goes a different way than the traditional music video, so I may go a little bit that route for the tour.",
      "In your opinion, what is the state of bachata at the moment and how has it evolved since you released \"Stand By Me\"?",
      "I think it\u2019s always been good. In music and in fashion, anything, there\u2019s always ups and downs. There\u2019s always new trends, new sounds and new artists emerging in the art world, in acting and everything. As for me, as a bachata singer, and not just a singer of the genre but as a person who\u2019s representing it as well, I feel like it\u2019s almost my responsibility to still put that on people\u2019s faces, help (the genre) grow and do collaborations.",
      "In comparison to when I first started, a couple years ago now, I\u2019ve seen it grow to a point where Colombian artists like Manuel Turizo are recording bachata. Shakira, she recorded her first bachata with me, she did another one with Ozuna. Rosal\u00eda sang bachata with The Weeknd. So many artists that aren\u2019t just Dominican \u2014 because at first it was only maybe, like, Dominicans recording bachata. So I think it\u2019s definitely grown into another space where people have been experimenting with it a little more in other countries.",
      "Looking back on the last 15 years, what would you say is the biggest lesson you've learned, professionally or personally?",
      "I\u2019ve learned to have perseverance, to just keep going, to keep swimming. I\u2019ve run two marathons, I\u2019m running a third one, actually, this year. I\u2019ve kind of applied that to life \u2014 like, you got to just keep going. You got to go through the rain, through the fire, through the wind and just keep going. I think that\u2019s how music is. You got to just keep going and keep re-creating and believe in yourself and creating new ideas."

      "As The Roots, Fallon\u2019s on-set band, played off Johnson\u2019s joke with some percussion, Fallon looked up at the sky and said, \u201cI can\u2019t even look there. I don\u2019t know what to do. Now, I\u2019m confused.\u201d",
      "As Fallon attempted to start the interview, asking the actor about the last time they saw one another in 30 Rock for the \"SNL\" 50th anniversary special, Johnson sat motionless due to her outfit, attempting to hold back laughter.",

      "\u201cI\u2019ll keep my posture real good,\u201d she joked, sitting up straight and requesting a blanket to drape over herself.",

      "At the end of their conversation, Fallon told Johnson that her dad, Don Johnson, gifted him a cardigan sweater, which he subsequently pulled out from behind the desk.",
      "When Fallon suggested Johnson \u201cborrow\u201d the sweater, she gave him a hard time, saying he probably just didn\u2019t like the cardigan for himself.",
      "Nevertheless, Johnson took the clothing and draped it over her chest, before sitting back into her chair and sighing, \u201cPhew!\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The Russian military will likely surpass 1 million casualties in its war on Ukraine this summer, according to one of the world\u2019s leading think tanks, reflecting the staggering human toll of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s assault on his neighbor.",
      "Around 250,000 of these Russian soldiers have died, the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)  said in a report Tuesday.",
      "The Ukrainian military has also suffered heavy losses, with 400,000 casualties, including 60,000 to 100,000 soldiers killed, it said.",
      "Surpassing 1 million killed and wounded would be \u201ca stunning\" and grisly milestone for Russia and showed \u201cPutin\u2019s blatant disregard for his soldiers,\u201d according to the report. To put this figure in historical perspective, it is five times as many deaths as all Soviet and Russian wars since World War II.",
      "The figure is stark but roughly tallies with previous estimates given by Western intelligence agencies, which have said that around 1,000 Russian troops are killed or injured every day.",
      "Putin annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimea Peninsula and began supporting pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country in 2014. But the CSIS figures relate to the period starting with the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022."

      "The closures were announced following a string of deadly incidents which saw the Israeli military accused of firing at Palestinians as they sought to collect aid. Health officials in the enclave said dozens of people were killed and hundreds injured.",

      "In video posted on X by the film\u2019s co-director, Yuval Abraham, an Israeli soldier tells a group of international journalists that there is \u201cno passage\u201d in the area because of a military order. Basel Adra, a Palestinian co-director of the film who lives in the area, said the military then blocked the journalists from entering two Palestinian villages they had hoped to visit.",
      "Israel\u2019s military said in a statement that entry into Khallet A-Daba was banned because it was in a live-fire training zone. Tuwani is not in the firing zone, but the military said it had barred \u201cindividuals who might disrupt order from entering the area,\u201d in order to \u201cmaintain public order and prevent friction.\u201d",

      "Some of the surrounding area, including a collection of small Bedouin villages known as Masafer Yatta, was declared by the military to be a live-fire training zone in the 1980s. Some 1,000 Palestinians have remained there despite being ordered out, and journalists, human rights activists and diplomats have visited the villages in the past.",
      "Palestinian residents in the area have reported increasing settler violence since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel and kickstarted the war in the Gaza Strip. Israeli soldiers regularly move in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards \u2014 and Palestinians fear outright expulsion could come at any time.",
      "Adra said the journalists were eventually able to enter one of the villages in Masafer Yatta but were barred from entering Tuwani, the village where he lives, and Khallet A-Daba, where he had hoped to take them.",
      "Adra said settlers arrived in Khallet A-Daba on Monday and took over some of the caves where village residents live, destroying residents\u2019 belongings and grazing hundreds of sheep on village lands. The military demolished much of the village last month.",
      "It said in a statement to AP that the structures in the village were built illegally and demolished after the residents had the chance to present their cases against demolition.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land,\u201d which won the Oscar this year for best documentary, chronicles the struggle by residents to stop the Israeli military from demolishing their villages. The joint Palestinian-Israeli production was directed by Adra and Hamdan Ballal, another Palestinian activist from Masafer Yatta, along with Israeli directors Yuval Abraham and Rachel Szor.",
      "The film has won a string of international awards.",

      "HONG KONG \u2014 The concert was set to be small but significant: the first by an all-Korean K-pop band in mainland China after an unofficial ban on such shows for almost a decade.",
      "That was exciting news for fans like Haerin Ouyang, a university student in the coastal Chinese city of Fuzhou, where the South Korean boy band Epex had been scheduled to perform on Saturday.",
      "But the show was canceled earlier this month, less than two weeks after it was announced, leaving Ouyang \u201cheartbroken.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe venue is only a 10-minute ride from my school, and it would have been fun to go with friends,\u201d she said.",
      "C9 Entertainment, which manages Epex, cited \u201clocal circumstances\u201d in announcing the cancellation on May 9, dashing hopes that China was opening its doors to K-pop shows for the first time since 2016.",
      "The ban, which China has never officially acknowledged, began after South Korea announced the deployment of an American anti-ballistic missile defense system that China said was aimed at constraining its power in the region.",
      "Before the ban, China \u2014 the second-biggest music market in Asia after Japan \u2014 was one of the fastest-growing markets for K-pop and other South Korean pop culture, whose rapid rise in global popularity is known as the Korean Wave, or hallyu.",
      "\u201cIn the K-content and K-pop markets as well, China\u2019s consumer power is regarded as top-tier,\u201d said Kang Soyoung, a professor at Seoul Digital University.",
      "The China ban is estimated to have cost the South Korean economy almost $16 billion since 2016, she said.",
      "But the Epex concert\u2019s cancellation does not necessarily reflect the official position of the Chinese government, Kang cautioned, as China has been gradually reopening to South Korean culture after years of tension.",
      "While K-pop acts have been blocked, other South Korean bands have been allowed to play. In April, the South Korean hip-hop trio Homies became the first all-Korean act to perform in mainland China in eight years. A South Korea-based Korean American musician in a one-man indie rock band performed in the Chinese cities of Xi'an, Wuhan and Zhengzhou in late 2024 and early 2025.",
      "A large-scale K-pop joint concert is also scheduled to be held in September at a 40,000-seat stadium in the Chinese island province of Hainan. The Korea Entertainment Producers\u2019 Association, which announced the event in April, did not reply to an email asking whether that concert is still going ahead.",
      "Kang said she believed the hallyu ban would soon be lifted and the Hainan concert would \u201cproceed without issue.\u201d",
      "There are also signs of growing business ties. Hybe, the South Korean entertainment company that manages the global K-pop sensation BTS, recently opened an office in Beijing, according to South Korean media. On Friday, China\u2019s Tencent Music was set to become the second-largest shareholder in the other major K-pop label, SM Entertainment, after Hybe said in a regulatory filing that it would sell Tencent its entire stake.",
      "\u201cIt shows that there is a greater opportunity for collaboration between the two countries, especially in the entertainment industry,\u201d said Ellen Kim, director of academic affairs at the Korea Economic Institute of America. \u201cIt might be a starting point for industry-level cooperation that could open more doors between the two countries.\u201d",
      "The diplomatic thaw extends beyond culture. In November, China said it would grant visa exemptions for South Korean visitors, and South Korea has said it will do the same for visitors from China.",
      "China\u2019s growing friendliness toward South Korea might be partly motivated by the unstable situation on the international stage, Kim said. Both countries face increasingly hostile and unpredictable U.S. trade policies under President Donald Trump.",
      "In addition, China is struggling with weak domestic consumption that would be aided by K-pop\u2019s high-spending fans.",
      "China has also been strengthening its own entertainment industry and has more confidence in it, Kang said, pointing to the record-breaking success this year of the Chinese film \u201cNe Zha 2,\u201d the world\u2019s highest-grossing animated film ever.",
      "\u201cIt now has robust resilience against the \u2018invasion\u2019 of foreign content,\u201d she said.",
      "China\u2019s potential thaw toward South Korean entertainment comes as it further restricts the number of Hollywood films allowed to be screened in its theaters in response to Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "China-South Korea ties could also get a boost from next week\u2019s South Korean presidential election. The front-runner, Lee Jae-myung, is considered friendlier to China than his predecessor.",
      "\u201cIf he wins, it might be a matter of time that things will change, which will allow the Korean entertainers to come into the country and play their music,\u201d Kim said."

      "The prosecutor\u2019s office in the Paris suburb of Nanterre, where victim Nahel Merzouk grew up and was killed in 2023, said in a statement that magistrates decided Tuesday to send the police officer to trial after a two-year investigation.",
      "The officer, identified in legal documents only as Florian M., was initially detained but released a few months later pending further investigation. He is expected to face trial in the third quarter of 2026, the prosecutor\u2019s office said.",
      "Merzouk\u2019s family and lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the announcement.",
      "The teenager was shot during a traffic stop in Nanterre. Video showed two officers at the window of the Mercedes the youth was driving, one with his gun pointed at Merzouk. As the car pulled forward, the officer fired once.",
      "After the killing, Nanterre prosecutor Pascal Prache said his initial investigation led him to conclude that the officer\u2019s use of his weapon was not legally justified.",
      "Protests over his killing spread around France and some turned violent, with stores looted and public buildings torched. Thousands of people were arrested as the government ratcheted up its law enforcement response to quell the unrest, and hundreds of people were injured. In related protests in the overseas territory of French Guiana in South America, a 54-year-old died after being hit by a stray bullet.",
      "The reaction to the killing was a potent reminder of the persistent poverty, discrimination, unemployment and other lack of opportunity in neighborhoods around France where many residents trace their roots to former French colonies."

    "story": [
      "A liberal lawyer was elected president of South Korea on Tuesday, ending months of political instability in the key U.S. ally that began with a botched declaration of martial law.",
      "Lee Jae-myung, leader of the Democratic Party, was sworn into office Wednesday. His conservative rival, Kim Moon-soo, of the People Power Party, said he humbly accepted \u201cthe choice of the people.\u201d",
      "According to the National Election Commission, Lee received 49.4% of the vote, while Kim received just over 41%. Another conservative candidate, Lee Jun-seok of the upstart Reform Party, received 8.3%.",
      "In his inauguration speech, Lee, 61, emphasized national unity after the martial law episode and said he would be \u201ca president who ends the politics of division.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will fully uncover the truth, assign proper responsibility and establish firm measures to prevent recurrence,\u201d he said.",
      "Lee said he would lead a \u201cpragmatic, market-oriented government\u201d and strengthen U.S.-South Korea relations and trilateral cooperation with the U.S. and Japan.",
      "In a departure from his predecessor, Lee also said he would engage in dialogue with rival North Korea while responding strongly to its nuclear and military provocations.",
      "\u201cWe will restore the military\u2019s honor and the public\u2019s trust, which were damaged by illegal martial law, and ensure that the military is never again mobilized for politics,\u201d he said.",
      "The election took place six months to the day after President Yoon Suk Yeol shocked the East Asian democracy of more than 50 million people by abruptly declaring martial law, citing threats from \u201canti-state forces\u201d and accusing the opposition-controlled parliament of paralyzing the government.",
      "Lawmakers pushed past soldiers Yoon had sent to parliament to vote unanimously against the order, which Yoon then withdrew.",
      "Led by Lee, lawmakers impeached Yoon on Dec. 14 over the short-lived order, after which South Korea was led by a series of acting presidents. The leadership vacuum has hampered South Korea in Washington as it is trying to negotiate with the Trump administration over a 25% \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff and other levies.",
      "Lee, who narrowly lost to Yoon in 2022, had been considered the most likely next president since Yoon was impeached. The election was triggered in April when the Constitutional Court upheld his impeachment.",
      "But South Korean voters were animated more by anger at Yoon and his party than by an affinity for Lee.",
      "\u201cHis victory is not thanks to any particular policy proposals, but rather a result of Yoon\u2019s spectacular collapse,\u201d said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.",
      "The martial law episode has deeply unsettled South Korea, which spent decades under military-authoritarian rule. It has also worsened polarization between liberals and conservatives, with regular rallies held for and against Yoon and a presidential campaign filled with personal attacks.",
      "Some voters directed their anger at Kim, the candidate for Yoon\u2019s former People Power Party, even though Yoon left the party last month to help his campaign.",
      "\u201cI believe that Lee will restore the democratic system and establish a democratic government,\u201d said Lee Jung Sup, a company executive in Seoul. \u201cThen our economy will be revitalized.\u201d",
      "Kim, who was labor minister under Yoon, criticized the martial law declaration but opposed his impeachment. Supporters pointed to Kim\u2019s squeaky-clean record, contrasting it with Lee\u2019s involvement in several criminal trials.",
      "\u201cIt is unfair to reflect the martial law declared by the former president onto Kim,\u201d said Oh Chang-soo, a retired religious leader in his 60s.",
      "Lee\u2019s vows to punish those involved in the martial law order have raised fears of further political turmoil. Yoon is still standing trial on charges of insurrection, a crime that is punishable by death or life in prison.",
      "Lee said this week that besides addressing economic concerns and internal division, his main priority is reaching a trade deal with the United States.",
      "In addition to the 25% tariff \u2014 which is set to take effect July 9 \u2014South Korea\u2019s trade-dependent economy is vulnerable to sector-specific U.S. levies on some of its most important exports, such as steel and automobiles.",
      "Asked about President Donald Trump\u2019s tendency to pressure his negotiating partners, Lee said, \u201cThat\u2019s a kind of political behavior exhibited by powerful nations, and we must endure it well.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf the president of the Republic of Korea\u2019s kowtowing briefly would allow 52 million people to thrive, then he must do so,\u201d he told South Korea\u2019s Christian Broadcasting System on Monday, using the country\u2019s formal name.",
      "While Trump is a formidable figure, Lee said, diplomacy should be mutually beneficial, and \u201cI\u2019m not an easy opponent, either.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have a fair number of cards to play,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are things to give and take on both sides.\u201d"
