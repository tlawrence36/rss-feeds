    "story": [
      "The avant-noise artist Kim Gordon debuted solo music 10 years ago",
      "NEW YORK -- Ten years ago, Kim Gordon \u2014 a revolutionary force in the alternative rock band Sonic Youth, the \u201980s New York no wave scene and the space between art and noise \u2014 debuted solo music. At the time, she was already decades into a celebrated, mixed-medium creative career.",
      "The midtempo \u201cMurdered Out\u201d was her first single, where clangorous, overdubbed guitars met the unmistakable rasp of her deadpan intonations. It was a surprise from an experimentalist well-versed in the unexpected: The song took inspiration from Los Angeles car culture, and its main collaborator was the producer Justin Raisen, then best known for his pop work with Sky Ferreira and Charli XCX. Their partnership has continued in the decade since, and on March 13, Gordon will drop her third solo album, \u201cPlay Me,\u201d announced Wednesday alongside the release of a hazy, transcendent single, \u201cNot Today.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was a happy accident,\u201d she says of her continued work with Raisen. \u201cIn the beginning, I was somewhat skeptical of working with a producer and collaborator, really. But it\u2019s turned out to be incredibly freeing.\u201d",
      "\u201cPlay Me\u201d follows Gordon's critically lauded, beat-heavy 2024 album \u201cThe Collective,\u201d a noisy body of work that featured oddball trap blasts. It earned her two Grammy nominations \u2014 a career first \u2014 for alternative music album and alternative music performance. Those were for the song \u201cBye Bye,\u201d with its eerie, dissonant beat originally written for rapper Playboi Carti. For \u201cPlay Me,\u201d Gordon reimagined the track for the closer, \u201cBye Bye 25!\u201d She says it was the result of her thinking about the rap world, where revisiting and remixing is commonplace.",
      "\u201cI came up with the idea of using these words that Trump had sort of \u2018banned\u2019 in his mind,\u201d she says of the new song's lyrics. (An example: \u201cInjustice / Opportunity / Dietary guidelines / Housing for the future.\u201d President Donald Trump\u2019s administration associates the terms with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, which it has vowed to root out across the government.) For Gordon, because it became \u201cmore conceptual \u2026 the remake doesn\u2019t seem as anxiety-provoking as the original.\u201d",
      "There is a connective spirit between \u201cThe Collective\u201d and \u201cPlay Me\u201d \u2014 a shared confrontation, propulsive production and songs that possess a keen ability to process and reflect the world around Gordon. \u201cIt does feel kind of like an evolution,\u201d she says of this album next to her last. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a more focused record, and immediate.\u201d The songs are shorter and attentive.",
      "Or, to put it more simply: \u201cI like beats and that inspires me more than melodies,\u201d she says. \u201cBeats and space.\u201d",
      "That palette drives \u201cPlay Me,\u201d a foundation in which staccato lyricism transforms and offers astute criticism. Consider the title track, which challenges passive listening and the devaluation of music in the age of streaming. She names Spotify playlist titles, imagined genres defined by mood rather than music. \u201cRich popular girl / Villain mode\u201d she speak-sings, \u201cJazz and background / Chillin' after work.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's just representative of, you know, this era we're in, this culture of convenience,\u201d she says. \u201cMusic always represented a certain amount of freedom to me, and it feels like that\u2019s kind of been blanketed over.\u201d",
      "Sonically, it is a message delivered atop a '70s groove, placing it in conversation with an era unshackled from these digital technologies.",
      "The title, too, \u201cis playing off the sort of passive nature of listening to music,\u201d she says, \u201cBut also it could be seen as defiant. Like, I dare you to play me.\u201d",
      "There's also the blown-out \u201cSubcon,\u201d which examines the world's growing billionaire class and their fascination with space colonialization in a period of economic insecurity. In the song, Gordon's lyrical abstractions highlight the absurdity, taking aim at technocrats.",
      "\u201cI find reality inspirational, no matter how bad it is,\u201d she says. Where some artists might veer away from the news, Gordon tackles truth. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what music is supposed to be. So, I\u2019m just doing my version of it.\u201d",
      "In the end, she hopes listeners are \u201csomewhat thrilled by\u201d the album.",

      "\u201cWhen the world is kind of burning down, it can feel frivolous at times,\u201d Bentley said. \u201cI just want to say thank you most of all to Mr. Panahi for reminding us for what we can do with the medium and why it can be worth doing.\u201d",

      "LAS VEGAS -- The jury trial for Nathan Chasing Horse, the former \u201cDances with Wolves\u201d actor accused of sexually abusing Indigenous women and girls, is expected to begin Tuesday in Las Vegas.",
      "Prosecutors allege he used his reputation as a spiritual leader and healer to take advantage of his victims over two decades. Chasing Horse has pleaded not guilty to 21 charges, including sexual assault, sexual assault with a minor, first degree kidnapping of a minor and the use of a minor in producing pornography.",
      "The case sent shock waves across Indian Country when he was arrested and indicted in early 2023. There were many setbacks and delays, but the case finally proceeded to trial after prosecutors added allegations that he filmed himself having sex with a child.",
      "Best known for portraying the character Smiles A Lot in the 1990 movie \u201cDances with Wolves,\u201d Chasing Horse was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, which is home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.",

      "One victim was 14 years old when she approached him hoping he would heal her mother, who was diagnosed with cancer. Chasing Horse previously had treated the victim\u2019s breathing issues and her mother\u2019s spider bite, according to a court transcript. He allegedly told her the spirits wanted her to give up her virginity in exchange for her mother\u2019s health. He allegedly had sex with her and said her mother would die if she told anyone, according to the victim\u2019s testimony to the grand jury.",

A week before the trial, Chasing Horse attempted to fire his private defense attorney, saying his lawyer hadn't come to visit him. Judge Jessica Peterson removed Chasing Horse from the courtroom when he tried to interrupt her, and she denied his request.",

      "In her earliest jokes she suggested stars in the room might be in the Epstein Files and took a shot at CBS, the network airing the show.",
      "\u201cThere are so many A-listers, and by A-listers, I do mean people who are on a list that has been heavily redacted,\" she said. \u201cAnd the Golden Globe for best editing goes to the Justice Department.\"",

      "\u201cThe award for most editing goes to CBS News,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, CBS News: America\u2019s newest place to see BS news.\u201d",
      "She didn't bring up Venezuela, a subject she told The Associated Press this week she was considering mentioning, but worried it would already be old news in the chaotic moment. And there was no mention of ICE.",
      "Glaser also told the AP she was struggling to find a joke about Julia Roberts, saying she was so beloved and respected that nothing Glaser tried with her comedy club test audiences was landing.",
      "She found a way to come at it sideways.",
      "\u201cJust like the podcasters nominated tonight, I should not be allowed to be this close to Julia Roberts,\u201d she said, and got the big laugh she was looking for.",
      "It was Glaser's second time hosting the show. She was quickly rehired after getting strong reviews in her first outing last year. She was hired the first time after the ruthless roast she gave the attendees of the Netflix roast of Tom Brady. She's been kinder on the Globes, but her jokes still had some bite.",
      "She made the obligatory joke about Leonardo DiCaprio dating young women.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve worked with every great director. You\u2019ve won three Golden Globes and an Oscar,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the most impressive thing is that you were able to accomplish all of that before your girlfriend turned 30.\u201d",
      "She then went meta and apologized for being so obvious.",

      "References to President Donald Trump\u2019s two impeachments have been removed from his photo portrait display at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Portrait Gallery in Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's photo portrait display at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery has had references to his two impeachments removed, the latest apparent change at the collection of museums he has accused of bias as he asserts his influence over how official presentations document U.S. history.",
      "The wall text, which summarized Trump's first presidency and noted his 2024 comeback victory, was part of the museum's \u201cAmerican Presidents\u201d exhibition. The description had been placed alongside a photograph of Trump taken during his first term. Now, a different photo appears without any accompanying text block, though the text was available online. Trump was the only president whose display in the gallery, as seen Sunday, did not include any extended text.",
      "The White House did not say whether it sought any changes. Nor did a Smithsonian statement in response to Associated Press questions. But Trump ordered in August that Smithsonian officials review all exhibits before the nation celebrates the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence on July 4. The Republican administration said the effort would \u201censure alignment with the president\u2019s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.\u201d",
      "Trump's original \u201cportrait label,\" as the Smithsonian calls it, notes Trump's Supreme Court nominations and his administration's development of COVID-19 vaccines. That section concludes: \u201cImpeached twice, on charges of abuse of power and incitement of insurrection after supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, he was acquitted by the Senate in both trials.\u201d",
      "Then the text continues: \u201cAfter losing to Joe Biden in 2020, Trump mounted a historic comeback in the 2024 election. He is the only president aside from Grover Cleveland (1837\u2013 1908) to have won a nonconsecutive second term.\u201d",
      "Asked about the display, White House spokesman Davis Ingle celebrated the new photograph, which shows Trump, brow furrowed, leaning over his Oval Office desk. Ingle said it ensures Trump's \u201cunmatched aura ... will be felt throughout the halls of the National Portrait Gallery.\u201d",
      "The portrait was taken by White House photographer Daniel Torok, who is credited in the display that includes medallions noting Trump is the 45th and 47th president. Similar numerical medallions appear alongside other presidents' painted portraits that also include the more extended biographical summaries such as what had been part of Trump's display.",
      "Sitting presidents are represented by photographs until their official paintings are commissioned and completed.",
      "Ingle did not answer questions about whether Trump or a White House aide, on his behalf, asked for anything related to the portrait label.",
      "The gallery said in a statement that it had previously rotated two photographs of Trump from its collection before putting up Torok's work.",
      "\u201cThe museum is beginning its planned update of the America\u2019s Presidents gallery which will undergo a larger refresh this Spring,\u201d the gallery statement said. \u201cFor some new exhibitions and displays, the museum has been exploring quotes or tombstone labels, which provide only general information, such as the artist\u2019s name.\u201d",

      "And, the gallery statement noted, \u201cThe history of Presidential impeachments continues to be represented in our museums, including the National Museum of American History.\u201d",
      "Trump has made clear his intentions to shape how the federal government documents U.S. history and culture. He has offered an especially harsh assessment of how the Smithsonian and other museums have featured chattel slavery as a seminal variable in the nation's development but also taken steps to reshape how he and his contemporary rivals are depicted.",
      "In the months before his order for a Smithsonian review, he fired the head archivist of the National Archives and said he was firing the National Portrait Gallery's director, Kim Sajet, as part of his overhaul. Sajet maintained the backing of the Smithsonian's governing board, but she ultimately resigned.",
      "At the White House, Trump has designed a notably partisan and subjective \u201cPresidential Walk of Fame\u201d featuring gilded photographs of himself and his predecessors \u2014 with the exception of Biden, who is represented by an autopen \u2014 along with plaques describing their presidencies.",
      "The White House said at the time that Trump himself was a primary author of the plaques. Notably, Trump's two plaques praise the 45th and 47th president as a historically successful figure while those under Biden's autopen stand-in describe the 46th executive as \u201cby far, the worst President in American History\u201d who \u201cbrought our Nation to the brink of destruction.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Organ donations from the recently deceased dropped last year for the first time in over a decade, resulting in fewer kidney transplants, according to an analysis issued Wednesday that pointed to signs of public mistrust in the lifesaving system.",
      "More than 100,000 people in the U.S. are on the list for an organ transplant. The vast majority of them need a kidney, and thousands die waiting every year.",
      "The nonprofit Kidney Transplant Collaborative analyzed federal data and found 116 fewer kidney transplants were performed last year than in 2024. That small difference is a red flag because the analysis traced the decline to some rare but scary reports of patients prepared for organ retrieval despite showing signs of life.",
      "Those planned retrievals were stopped and the U.S. is developing additional safeguards for the transplant system, which saves tens of thousands of lives each year. But it shook public confidence, prompting some people to remove their names from donor lists.",
      "Dr. Andrew Howard, who leads the Kidney Transplant Collaborative, said last year\u2019s dip in kidney transplants would have been larger except for a small increase \u2014 about 100 \u2014 in transplants from living donors, when a healthy person donates one of their kidneys to someone in need. The collaborative advocates for increased living donations, which make up a fraction of the roughly 28,000 yearly kidney transplants.",

      "NEW YORK -- U.S. overdose deaths fell through most of last year, suggesting a lasting improvement in an epidemic that had been worsening for decades.",
      "Federal data released Wednesday showed that overdose deaths have been falling for more than two years \u2014 the longest drop in decades \u2014 but also that the decline was slowing.",
      "And the monthly death toll is still not back to what it was before the COVID-19 pandemic, let alone where it was before the current overdose epidemic struck decades ago, said Brandon Marshall, a Brown University researcher who studies overdose trends.",
      "\u201cOverall I think this continues to be encouraging, especially since we're seeing declines almost across the nation,\u201d he said.",
      "Overdose deaths began steadily climbing in the 1990s with overdoses involving opioid painkillers, followed by waves of deaths from heroin and \u2014 more recently \u2014 illicit fentanyl. Deaths peaked nearly 110,000 in 2022, fell a little in 2023 and then plummeted 27% in 2024, to around 80,000. That was the largest one-year decline ever recorded.",
      "The new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data runs through August 2025 and represents the first update of monthly provisional drug overdose deaths since the federal government shutdown.",
      "An estimated 73,000 people died from overdoses in the 12-month period that ended August 2025, down about 21% from the 92,000 in the previous 12-month period.",
      "CDC officials reported that deaths were down in all states except Arizona, Hawaii, Kansas, New Mexico and North Dakota. But they noted it's likely that not all overdose deaths have been reported yet in every state, and additional data in the future might affect that state count.",
      "Researchers cannot yet say with confidence why deaths have gone down. Experts have offered multiple possible explanations: increased availability of the overdose-reversing drug naloxone, expanded addiction treatment, shifts in how people use drugs, and the growing impact of billions of dollars in opioid lawsuit settlement money.",
      "Some also point to research that suggests the number of people likely to overdose has been shrinking, as fewer teens take up drugs and many illicit drug users have died.",
      "Two other theories recently joined the list.",
      "In a paper published last week in the journal Science, University of Maryland researchers point to the drug supply. They say regulatory changes in China a few years ago appear to have diminished the availability of precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl.",

It suggests it became harder to make fentanyl and its potency was diluted.",

      "Those same Pittsburgh researchers \u2014 Dr. Donald Burke and Dr. Hawre Jalal \u2014 are now focused on another theory for what's happened to overdose deaths. In a paper published last week in the International Journal of Drug Policy, they say overdose trends may be at least partly tied to federal stimulus checks sent out during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

      "That money alleviated economic hardship for many families, but some of it also helped people pay for illicit drugs, the Pittsburgh researchers say. And the end of those payments helps explain why overdoses stabilized in 2022 and began falling afterward, they say.",

      "This is the second time Louisiana has pursued an out-of-state doctor under its abortion restrictions, with Republican Gov. Jeff Landry saying on social media that he wants to bring the abortion provider \u201cto justice.\u201d The two criminal cases pit Louisiana, which has some of the strictest abortion laws in the country, against jurisdictions that have enacted what are known as shield laws for providers who facilitate abortions from afar in states with bans.",
      "\u201cLouisiana has a zero tolerance policy for those who subvert our laws, seek to hurt women, and promote abortion,\u201d Landry said in a post X announcing he'd sent the extradition paperwork. California Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s office did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment",
      "Remy Coeytaux, a physician in the San Francisco Bay Area, faces a criminal charge of abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Tuesday. If convicted, the doctor could face up to 50 years in jail and fines, Murrill said.",
      "An email and a telephone message seeking comment were left for Coeytaux.",
      "According to court documents, he is accused of mailing mifepristone and misoprostol in 2023 to a Louisiana woman who sought the medication through Aid Access, a European online telemedicine service. The woman took the pills in combination to end her pregnancy, investigators wrote in the indictment, which says authorities confirmed Coeytaux as the sender.",

Last year, state lawmakers passed additional restrictions targeting out-of-state prescribers and reclassified mifepristone and misoprostol as controlled dangerous substances.",

      "AAP has been vocal about its support for pediatric vaccines and has publicly opposed HHS positions. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 who helped lead the anti-vaccine movement for years \u2014 has made sweeping changes to childhood vaccine recommendations. Last year, the pediatrics group released its own recommendations on COVID-19 vaccines, which substantially diverged from the government\u2019s guidance.",

      "New options for testing and treating some of the most common sexually transmitted diseases are becoming available",
      "WASHINGTON -- New options for testing and treating some of the most common sexually transmitted diseases are becoming available, a trend that experts hope will keep downward pressure on U.S. infection rates.",
      "Last year, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first at-home test that can detect three common infections in women \u2014 gonorrhea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis \u2014 as well as the first home-based kit for the virus that causes cervical cancer.",
      "The agency ended the year by approving two different drugs for gonorrhea, the first new options for the disease in decades.",
      "It\u2019s positive news after cases of sexually transmitted infections reached alarming highs before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted screening, education and treatment for sexual health nationwide.",
      "But the pandemic years also brought positive developments for testing. The same technology used for the first over-the-counter coronavirus tests is now being translated into home-based kits for syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections. Previously, the FDA had mostly limited the use of such tests to health professionals.",
      "\u201cSexual health can be stigmatized and people can be hesitant about testing,\u201d said Dr. Ina Park, a sexual health specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cNow we have a lot of options for patients who may be wary of going into a provider\u2019s office.\u201d",
      "Testing company Visby Medical launched its three-in-one test for women last year, following FDA approval in March. The urine-based test includes a vaginal testing swab and a small electronic device that develops the results and sends them to an online app for review.",
      "The test, which costs $150, also includes a telehealth consultation with a medical provider who can discuss the results and prescribe antibiotics or other medication, if needed.",
      "The entire process \u2014 from buying the test to getting a prescription \u2014 can take as little as six hours, compared with several days under the traditional testing model, says Dr. Gary Schoolnik, Visby\u2019s chief medical officer.",
      "Previously, a nurse or doctor would have to collect a sample, send it out to a lab, get the results and then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results.",
      "\u201cMany patients are very hard to track down and a lot of them, if they have a positive test result, are never treated and are lost to follow-up,\u201d said Schoolnik, who is also a professor emeritus at Stanford Medical School.",
      "The FDA approved Visby\u2019s test based on study results showing that it correctly detected the three infections with accuracy rates around 98% or higher. That\u2019s similar to tests performed at hospitals and health clinics.",
      "Some home-based tests still require outside input to get the results.",
      "For example, in May the FDA approved Teal Health\u2019s testing kit for HPV, the virus that causes cervical cancer. The company\u2019s Teal Wand allows women to collect their own vaginal sample, which is then placed in a tube and shipped to a laboratory for processing.",
      "Updated federal guidelines for HPV screening released earlier this month endorsed self collection for the first time.",
      "The bacteria that causes gonorrhea has constantly evolved, developing resistance to nearly every antibiotic used to treat it.",

      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously recommended another drug, oral azithromycin, alongside injectable ceftriaxone, but dropped the pill from its guidance after signs that gonorrhea was growing resistant to it.",
      "\u201cWe were down to one class of antibiotics recommended to treat gonorrhea and we had no other good options,\u201d said Park. \u201cSo to have two new options in the same year is very exciting.\u201d",
      "The CDC\u2019s provisional data for 2024 showed a third consecutive year of fewer gonorrhea cases, and the second year in a row of fewer adult cases of chlamydia and the most infectious forms of syphilis.",
      "Experts point to several factors behind the trend, including less sexual activity among young people, increased use of an antibiotic as a morning-after pill to prevent infections and more at-home screening.",
      "The new tests could drive further reductions, although some experts urge caution.",
      "As more people test at home it could become harder to track national infection rates, which previously have been reported by a handful of large testing laboratories.",
      "Additionally, the new tests and drugs come with higher price tags that may limit access. For example, Visby\u2019s $150 test is not covered by insurance.",

      "Britain\u2019s government is expected to approve a large Chinese embassy near London\u2019s financial district",
      "LONDON -- Britain\u2019s government is expected to approve a \u201cmega\u201d Chinese embassy close to London\u2019s financial district after years of controversy and political wrangling over the potential security risks it poses to the U.K.",
      "Lawmakers from across the spectrum have urged planning officials to reject China\u2019s application for the new embassy. Critics fear the proposed new building, on a huge site close to London\u2019s financial district and crucial data cables, will be used as a base for espionage. Others say the supersized embassy \u2014 set to be the biggest in Europe \u2014 will pose a heightened threat of surveillance and intimidation to Chinese dissidents in exile.",
      "The decision was initially slated for October, but it was repeatedly postponed after multiple allegations of Chinese spying and political interference piled pressure on the British government.",
      "British media have reported that the decision to approve the embassy will come this week, ahead of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's expected trip to China. The closely watched visit would be the first made by a British prime minister since 2018.",
      "A final decision on the embassy is expected by Jan. 20, the deadline set by the government.",
      "Here's a look at why the embassy has been the focus of protests and Sino-British tensions for years:",
      "The proposed embassy at Royal Mint Court \u2014 the former site of the U.K.\u2019s coin maker, near the Tower of London \u2014 will replace several Chinese official buildings across London",
      "Critics say the new site sits too close to underground fiber optic cables carrying sensitive financial information between London\u2019s two main financial districts.",
      "Conservative Party lawmaker Alicia Kearns said that risks handing over access to data that would give China\u2019s government \u201ca launchpad for economic warfare against our nation.\u201d",
      "Dissidents have also been among hundreds of people who have protested the plans, saying a mega-embassy housing large numbers of officials would further China\u2019s repression of activists abroad.",
      "A group of opposition Labour lawmakers say concerns include \u201cthe recent track record of Chinese espionage cases, interference activities and issuing of bounties against U.K.-based Hong Kongers.\u201d",
      "The site was bought by China\u2019s government for 225 million pounds ($301 million) in 2018, but plans for the embassy have been delayed since.",
      "Local officials rejected the initial application over concerns that the embassy would attract many large protests, affecting the safety of residents and tourists. China resubmitted its proposals after the current Labour government took power last year.",
      "China has complained about the seven-year delay in approving the project, saying the U.K. was \u201cconstantly complicating and politicizing the matter.\u201d",

      "Beirut\u2019s Commodore Hotel, once a hub for foreign journalists during Lebanon\u2019s civil war, has closed amid the country\u2019s economic crisis",
      "BEIRUT -- During Lebanon\u2019s civil war, the Commodore Hotel in western Beirut's Hamra district became iconic among the foreign press corps.",
      "For many, it served as an unofficial newsroom where they could file dispatches even when communications systems were down elsewhere. Armed guards at the door provided some sense of protection as sniper fights and shelling were turning the cosmopolitan city to rubble.",
      "The hotel even had its own much-loved mascot: a cheeky parrot at the bar.",
      "The Commodore endured for decades after the 15-year civil war ended in 1990 \u2014 until this week, when it closed for good.",
      "The main gate of the nine-story hotel with more than 200 rooms was shuttered Monday. Officials at the Commodore refused to speak to the media about the decision to close.",
      "Although the country\u2019s economy is beginning to recover from a protracted financial crisis that began in 2019, tensions in the region and the aftermath of the Israel-Hezbollah war that was halted by a tenuous ceasefire in November 2024 are keeping many tourists away. Lengthy daily electricity cuts force businesses to rely on expensive private generators.",
      "The Commodore is not the first of the crisis-battered country\u2019s once-bustling hotels to shut down in recent years.",
      "But for journalists who lived, worked and filed their dispatches there, its demise hits particularly hard.",
      "\u201cThe Commodore was a hub of information \u2014 various guerrilla leaders, diplomats, spies and of course scores of journalists circled the bars, cafes and lounges,\u201d said Tim Llewellyn, a former BBC Middle East correspondent who covered the civil war. \u201cOn one occasion (late Palestinian leader) Yasser Arafat himself dropped in to sip coffee with\u201d with the hotel manager's father, he recalled.",
      "At the height of the civil war, when telecommunications were dysfunctional and much of Beirut was cut off from the outside world, it was at the Commodore where journalists found land lines and Telex machines that always worked to send reports to their media organizations around the globe.",
      "Across the front office desk in the wide lobby of the Commodore, there were two teleprinters that carried reports of The Associated Press and Reuters news agencies.",
      "\u201cThe Commodore had a certain seedy charm. The rooms were basic, the mattresses lumpy and the meal fare wasn\u2019t spectacular,\u201d said Robert H. Reid, the AP\u2019s former Middle East regional editor, who was among the AP journalists who covered the war. The hotel was across the street from the international agency\u2019s Middle East head office at the time.",
      "\u201cThe friendly staff and the camaraderie among the journalist-guests made the Commodore seem more like a social club where you could unwind after a day in one of the world\u2019s most dangerous cities,\u201d Reid said.",
      "Llewellyn remembers that the hotel manager at the time, Yusuf Nazzal, told him in the late 1970s \u201cthat it was I who had given him the idea\u201d to open such a hotel in a war zone.",
      "Llewellyn said that during a long chat with Nazzal on a near-empty Middle East Airlines Jumbo flight from London to Beirut in the fall of 1975, he told him that there should be a hotel that would make sure journalists had good communications, \u201ca street-wise and well-connected staff running the desks, the phones, the teletypes.\u201d",
      "During Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon and a nearly three-month siege of West Beirut by Israeli troops, journalists used the roof of the hotel to film fighter jets striking the city.",

      "AP\u2019s chief Middle East correspondent Terry Anderson was a regular at the hotel before he was kidnapped in Beirut in 1985 and held for seven years, becoming one of the longest-held American hostages in history.",
      "Videos of Anderson released by his kidnappers later showed him wearing a white T-shirt with the words \u201cHotel Commodore Lebanon.\u201d",
      "With the kidnapping of Anderson and other Western journalists, many foreign media workers left the predominantly-Muslim western part of Beirut, and after that the hotel lost its status as a safe haven for foreign journalists.",
      "Ahmad Shbaro, who worked at different departments of the hotel until 1988, said the main reason behind the Commodore\u2019s success was the presence of armed guards that made journalists feel secure in the middle of Beirut\u2019s chaos as well as functioning telecommunications.",
      "He added that the hotel also offered financial facilities for journalists who ran out of money. They would borrow money from Nazzal and their companies could pay him back by depositing money in his bank account in London.",
      "Shbaro remembers a terrifying day in the late 1970s when the area of the hotel was heavily shelled and two rooms at the Commodore were hit.",
      "\u201cThe hotel was full and all of us, staffers and journalists, spent the night at Le Casbah,\u201d a famous nightclub in the basement of the building, he said.",
      "In quieter times, journalists used to spend the night partying by the pool.",
      "\u201cIt was a lifeline for the international media in West Beirut, where journalists filed, ate, drank, slept, and hid from air raids, shelling, and other violence,\u201d said former AP correspondent Scheherezade Faramarzi. \u201cIt gained both fame and notoriety,\u201d she said, speaking from the Mediterranean island of Cyprus.",
      "The hotel was built in 1943 and kept functioning until 1987 when it was heavily damaged in fighting between Shiite and Druze militiamen at the time. The old Commodore building was later demolished and a new structure was build with an annex and officially opened again for the public in 1996.",
      "But Coco the parrot was no longer at the bar. The bird went missing during the 1987 fighting. Shbaro said it is believed he was taken by one of the gunmen who stormed the hotel.",

      "Strong global demand for computer chips and other devices and the materials needed to make them were among categories that supported China\u2019s exports, analysts said. Car exports also grew last year.",

Activists say they are coerced confessions, long a staple of Iran's hard-line state television, the only broadcaster in the country. And these videos are coming at an unprecedented clip.",
      "Iranian state media has aired at least 97 confessions from protesters, many expressing remorse for their actions, since the protests began on Dec. 28, according to a rights group that is tracking the videos.",

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has said the violence must be foreign-influenced because Iranians would never set mosques on fire.",
      "The nearly 100 confessions broadcast over just two weeks is unprecedented for Iran, Thompson said.",
      "By comparison, from 2010 to 2020, there were around 350 forced confessions broadcast on state media, according to the activist groups Justice for Iran and the International Federation for Human Rights, the last major study compiled by activists. The rights group Together Against the Death Penalty said there were 40 to 60 confessions aired in 2025.",
      "Additionally, Iran Human Rights and Together Against the Death Penalty reported at least 37 televised confessions of people facing the death penalty in the weeks following the 2022 protests over the death of Mahsa Amini after her arrest by the country\u2019s morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab to the liking of authorities.

    "story": [
      "Car shoppers will face numerous new challenges in 2026 as trends in the automotive industry evolve",
      "In recent years, a shortage of vehicles, rising prices, and high borrowing costs have made it challenging for some people to purchase a new or used vehicle. Thankfully, the automotive market is shifting in ways that could be beneficial if you\u2019re planning to buy a vehicle in the next few months. The auto experts at Edmunds have identified five car shopping trends that you can expect to see in 2026 and have advice on how to take advantage of them to get the best deal.",
      "Many consumers delayed buying a new car over the past several years due to high prices, limited selection and expensive loans. Those deferred purchases resulted in fewer used vehicles being available for sale. But we\u2019re seeing that trend diminish in 2026. More consumers are finally trading in their used vehicles, which is increasing supply and variety in the secondhand market.",
      "That growing inventory can work in your favor. With more used vehicles on the market, pricing pressure shifts back toward dealers, especially on mainstream models. Instead of feeling forced to accept the only car on the lot, you can compare multiple examples of the same model across dealerships and use those price differences as leverage. The more time you spend comparing listings, the easier it becomes to spot an overpriced car and negotiate a good deal.",
      "\u201cOne bright spot for owners who have held off on a recent purchase will be equity for their trade-in,\u201d says Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds. According to Edmunds transaction data, 7-year-old vehicles that were traded in during 2025 were valued at an average of $14,400. That\u2019s a 72% increase compared to 2019, when 7-year-old vehicles were appraised at just $8,400.",
      "You can use that equity as a negotiating tool. Before visiting a dealership, get multiple trade-in or purchase appraisals from online pricing tools and local dealers. Bringing those numbers with you helps prevent lowball offers and ensures you capture your car\u2019s full value. More money for your old car means you\u2019ll finance less and have lower monthly payments, which is especially important as prices remain elevated.",
      "Electric vehicle leasing surged in 2023, and those EVs are now entering the used market as their leases come to an end. The result is a big increase in used EVs for sale in 2026. Many of them will have relatively low miles and significant discounts compared with new EVs.",
      "For shoppers curious about EVs but wary of new-car prices, this is one of the best entry points in years. You can also look for a certified pre-owned EV if you\u2019re concerned about durability. A certified pre-owned vehicle, or CPO, has been thoroughly inspected by the dealership and typically comes with an extended warranty. With more used EVs for sale, pricing is becoming more competitive.",
      "High interest rates added thousands of dollars to the cost of buying a car over the last two years. As rates begin to decline and automakers compete for buyers in a softer sales environment, loan offers are improving, and incentive-driven financing is making a comeback. More favorable financing means more of your monthly payment goes to paying for the vehicle instead of interest.",

      "Be sure to compare all available financing options. Getting preapproved by a bank or credit union gives you a baseline, and dealers may be willing to beat it with manufacturer-backed promotions. Even a small interest rate reduction can translate into meaningful savings over the life of a loan, making it one of the most critical areas to shop carefully.",
      "As prices remain high, more buyers are stretching payments across 72-month or even 84-month loans. While a longer loan lowers the monthly bill, it increases the total amount paid and keeps you upside down longer on a loan, which occurs when you owe more on your loan than the vehicle is actually worth.",
      "To combat the loan-term creep, focus on total cost, not just the monthly payment. A shorter loan may cost more each month but will save money overall. It also helps shorten the time you will be upside down on your loan.",
      "Together, these trends create a market that rewards savvy shoppers. Rising used-car supply and strong trade-in values can give you more options and enhanced negotiating power. You can use these opportunities to find the right car at the right price in today\u2019s evolving market.",

      "A federal judge is expected to consider whether to set aside a Trump administration order pausing the construction of a major offshore project for New York",
      "WASHINGTON -- The developer of a major offshore wind project to serve New York is set to go before a federal judge Wednesday, hoping to convince him to lift a Trump administration order they say could mean the death of a project that's 60% complete.",
      "The Empire Wind project is designed to power more than 500,000 homes. Norwegian company Equinor said it will likely have to kill the project if construction can\u2019t resume soon due to the availability of specialized vessels and heavy financial losses.",
      "The case is being heard by District Judge Carl J. Nichols, an appointee of President Donald Trump.",
      "Empire Wind is one of five big offshore wind projects on the East Coast that the administration froze days before Christmas, citing national security concerns. Developers and states have sued seeking to block the order. Equinor\u2019s hearing is the second of three hearings for these legal challenges this week; on Monday, a judge ruled that a project serving Rhode Island and Connecticut could resume.",
      "Trump has targeted offshore wind from his first days back in the White House, most recently calling wind farms \u201closers\u201d that lose money, destroy the landscape and kill birds. When his administration cited national security concerns, it gave no detail for those concerns, and at least one expert has said the offshore projects were permitted following years of careful review that included the Department of Defense.",
      "The administration's stance against offshore wind and renewable energy more broadly runs counter to dozens of other countries.",
      "The global offshore wind market is growing, with China leading the world in new installations. Nearly all of the new electricity added to the grid in 2024 was renewable. Experts say the world needs a major buildout of renewable electricity to address climate change.",
      "Molly Morris, Equinor\u2019s senior vice president overseeing Empire Wind, said federal officials have not given them any explanation of the national security concerns or how to mitigate them.",
      "A specialized heavy lift vessel, Heerema\u2019s Sleipnir, must begin lifting the topside to the project\u2019s offshore substation off the transport ship and onto its foundation because the Sleipnir is scheduled to depart by Feb. 1 for other commitments, Morris said. The topside weighs more than 3,000 tons and there are few specialized offshore wind installation ships in the world.",
      "\u201cRight now the project is in a critical situation,\u201d Morris said. \u201cConstruction must resume by mid-January to avoid cascading delays that could ultimately lead to a cancellation of the project. We have been clear and consistent that we are ready to address any additional security concerns that were not already addressed through our lengthy engagement with various defense agencies.\u201d",
      "Monday's hearing was in the same federal court, with Danish energy company Orsted prevailing. A judge ruled that work on its project, called Revolution Wind, can resume while the administration considers ways to mitigate its national security concerns. Revolution Wind is nearly complete.",

New York\u2019s attorney general sued the Trump administration on Friday over Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind.",
      "The Trump administration previously halted work on both Empire Wind and Revolution Wind. In April, it stopped construction on Empire Wind, accusing the Biden administration of rushing the permits, then allowed work to resume a month later. In August, the administration paused work on Revolution Wind for what it said were national security concerns. A month later, a federal judge ruled the project could resume.",

      "A proposal to tax the accumulated wealth of California billionaires has ignited a political uproar in Silicon Valley and across the state",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A proposed billionaires' tax in California has ignited a political uproar in Silicon Valley, with tech titans threatening to leave the state while Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom maneuvers to defeat a levy that he fears will lead to an exodus of wealth.",
      "A technology mecca, California has more billionaires than any other state \u2014 a few hundred, by some estimates. Nearly half its personal income tax revenue, a financial backbone in the nearly $350 billion budget, comes from the top 1% of earners.",
      "A large health care union is attempting to place a proposal before voters in November that would impose a one-time 5% tax on the assets of billionaires \u2014 including stocks, art, businesses, collectibles and intellectual property \u2014 to backfill federal funding cuts to health services for lower-income people that were signed by President Donald Trump last year.",
      "In a state with a vast gap between rich and poor, the plan has resulted in a tangle of competing interests at a time when both Democrats and Republicans are struggling to respond to economic anxiety driven by rising costs ahead of this year's midterm elections.",
      "An online war of words has tech leaders pondering a hollowing out of Silicon Valley, and millions of dollars are flowing to political committees engaged in the fight. That includes $3 million from billionaire Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal, to a committee tied to a business group opposing the tax.",
      "However it's not clear if the proposal will make the ballot, with more than 870,000 petition signatures required for it to qualify.",
      "Although the tax would affect only a minuscule slice of California's roughly 39 million residents, it would siphon money from an immense pool of wealth. If would apply retroactively to billionaires living in the state as of Jan. 1.",
      "At least 25 billionaires listed among Forbes magazine\u2019s 2025 rankings of the world\u2019s 500 wealthiest people either lived in California or had some significant ties to the state, based on a review by The Associated Press. But determining whether they were full-time residents or just frequent visitors could turn into a matter of dispute, since many of them own property elsewhere.",
      "\u201cYou are really playing with fire with this one,\u201d said Aaron Levie, CEO of the publicly traded Silicon Valley company Box. He fears that the proposed tax would drive entrepreneurs to look elsewhere to run their companies and launch startups.",
      "Even liberal-leaning tech pioneers would \u201cfind it absurd just on pure economic and structural grounds, even if they might agree that the cause itself is very worthy,\u201d said Levie, who is not a billionaire.",
      "Newsom has long opposed state-level wealth taxes, believing such levies would be disadvantageous for the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy. At a time when California is strapped for cash and he is considering a 2028 presidential run, he is trying to block the proposal before it reaches the ballot.",
      "Analysts say an exodus of billionaires could mean a loss of hundreds of millions of tax dollars.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons why Newsom\u2019s path to the Democratic nomination is not going to be an easy one,\u201d Claremont McKenna College political scientist Jack Pitney said. \u201cHe\u2019s already facing a (budget) deficit the size of which is uncertain ... and in the years to come, a billionaires tax that could backfire badly.\u201d",
      "The proposal has created a deep rift between Newsom and prominent members of his party's progressive wing, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who endorsed it and said it should be a template for other states.",

      "The measure's lead proponent, the Service Employees International Union, sees the threat of an exodus as exaggerated.",
      "The tax is a \u201cworkable response to a crisis created by Congress,\u201d Suzanne Jimenez, chief of staff of SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West, said in a statement. She added that it would \u201ckeep emergency rooms open, hospitals staffed and health care systems functioning.\u201d",

      "Fleeing California because of its high cost of living and reputation for stringent regulations started to gather momentum well before the proposed wealth tax began circulating last year.",
      "Elon Musk, the world\u2019s wealthiest man with a $724 billion fortune, bought a home in Texas and moved his electric automaker Tesla to Austin several years ago.",
      "The financial threat posed by the proposed tax apparently is pushing even more of Silicon Valley\u2019s renowned pioneers to curtail their exposure to California and its liberal policies, including Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who moved to the state during the mid-1990s for graduate study at Stanford University.",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency is proposing limiting the power of states some authorized Indian tribes under the Clean Water Act to block major projects like natural gas pipelines",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday proposed limiting states\u2019 and Native American tribes\u2019 power to wield the Clean Water Act to block major projects like natural gas pipelines, advancing the Trump administration's goal of accelerating the construction of new fossil fuel infrastructure and data centers.",
      "The agency said new constraints on local water quality reviews for federally regulated projects will still allow states to protect their environment while preventing unnecessary delays. Successive administrations have seesawed on the scope of states' power. President Donald Trump's first administration reduced it, the Biden administration restored it and now the Trump administration is once again adding constraints to what's called Section 401 of the Clean Water Act.",
      "\u201cWhen finalized, the proposed rule will increase transparency, efficiency and predictability for certifying authorities and the regulated community,\" said Jess Kramer, EPA's assistant administrator for water. \u201cIt will also ensure states and authorized tribes adhere to their Section 401 role.\u201d",
      "The Clean Water Act allows states and some authorized tribes to review what effect pipelines, dams and other federally regulated projects have on water quality within their borders. Pipelines, for example, might cross rivers, streams and wetlands \u2014 disruptions that states can scrutinize and that have caused holdups before. In 2017, for example, New York regulators rejected a permit for a pipeline, saying there weren't sufficient protections for hundreds of streams and wetlands.",
      "The proposed change is similar to EPA\u2019s rule in Trump's first term. They proposed a clear description of what applicants need to submit to states, strict deadlines for reviews and a requirement that states fully explain why any conditions were placed on a developer or why their permit was rejected.",
      "In 2023, the Biden administration strengthened states\u2019 and tribes' authority to conduct water quality reviews. Activists at the time praised the change, saying it would help protect the local environment. The agency said then that states should be able to look beyond pollution that\u2019s released directly into waters and instead \u201cholistically evaluate\" the impact of a project on local water quality.",
      "The Trump administration wants to do away with that broader authority to focus reviews on direct releases to federally regulated waters. They are doing so at a time when fewer waters are federally regulated by the Clean Water Act. In 2023, the Supreme Court in Sackett v. EPA limited the federal government's power to regulate millions of acres of wetlands.",
      "Congress has said that when federally backed projects like oil pipelines or nickel mines affect water quality, fishing and drinking water, states and tribes get to review them and reject proposals that will do too much damage, according to Moneen Nasmith, director of national climate, fossil fuel infrastructure at the nonprofit Earthjustice.",
      "\u201cEPA\u2019s claims that states and tribes are overreaching are baseless,\" she said. \u201cThis proposed rule is trying to solve for a problem that does not exist.\u201d",

      "Fewer Americans are signing up for Affordable Care Act health insurance plans this year",
      "NEW YORK -- Fewer Americans are signing up for Affordable Care Act health insurance plans this year, new federal data shows, as expiring subsidies and other factors push health expenses too high for many to manage.",
      "Nationally, around 800,000 fewer people have selected plans compared to a similar time last year, marking a 3.5% drop in total enrollment so far. That includes a decrease in both new consumers signing up for ACA plans and existing enrollees re-upping them.",
      "The new data released Monday evening by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is only a snapshot of a continuously changing pool of enrollees. It includes sign-ups through Jan. 3 in states that use Healthcare.gov for ACA plans and through Dec. 27 for states that have their own ACA marketplaces. In most states, the period for shopping for plans continues through Jan. 15 for plans that start in February.",
      "But even though it\u2019s early, the data builds on fears that expiring enhanced tax credits could cause a dip in enrollment and force many Americans to make tough decisions to delay buying health insurance, look for alternatives or forgo it entirely.",
      "Experts warn that the number of people who have signed up for plans may still drop even further, as enrollees get their first bill in January and some choose to cancel.",
      "The declining enrollment comes as Congress has been locked in a partisan battle over what to do about the subsidies that expired at the start of the new year. For months, Democrats have fought for a straight extension of the tax credits, while Republicans have insisted larger reforms are a better way to root out fraud and abuse and keep costs down overall. Last week, in a remarkable rebuke of Republican leadership, the House passed legislation to extend the subsidies for three years. The bill now sits in the Senate, where pressure is building for a bipartisan compromise.",
      "Up until this year, President Barack Obama's landmark health insurance program had been an increasingly popular option for Americans who don't get health coverage through their jobs, including small business owners, gig workers, farmers, ranchers and others.",
      "For the 2021 plan year, about 12 million people selected an Affordable Care Act plan. Enhanced tax credits were introduced the following year and four years later enrollment had doubled to over 24 million.",

      "This year\u2019s sinking sign-ups \u2014 sitting at about 22.8 million so far \u2014 mark the first time in the past four years that enrollment has been down from the previous year at this point in the shopping window.",
      "The loss of enhanced subsidies means annual premium costs will more than double for the average ACA enrollee who had them, according to the health care research nonprofit KFF. But extending the subsidies would also be expensive for the country. Ahead of last week's House vote, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that extending the subsidies for three years would increase the nation's deficit by about $80.6 billion over the decade.",
      "Robert Kaestner, a health economist at the University of Chicago, said some of those who abandon ACA plans may have other options, such as going on a partner's employer health plan or changing their income to qualify for Medicaid. Others will go without insurance at least temporarily while they look for alternatives.",
      "\u201cMy prediction is 2 million more people will lack health insurance for a while,\" Kaestner said. \"That's a serious issue, but Republicans would argue we're using government money more efficiently, we're targeting people who really need it and we're saving $35 billion a year.\u201d",
      "Several Americans interviewed by The Associated Press have said they're dropping coverage altogether for 2026 and will pay out of pocket for needed appointments. Many said they are crossing their fingers that they aren't affected by a costly injury or diagnosis.",
      "\u201cI'm pretty much going to be going without health insurance unless they do something,\u201d said 52-year-old Felicia Persaud, a Florida entrepreneur who dropped coverage when she saw her monthly ACA costs were set to increase by about $200 per month. \u201cIt's sort of like playing poker and hoping the chips fall and try the best that you can.\"",

      "Environmental and public health advocates called the agency's action a dangerous abdication of one of its core missions.",

      "But the Trump administration contends that these estimates are misleading.

      "Microsoft is trying to win over communities concerned about AI data centers",
      "It won\u2019t be easy for Big Tech companies to win the hearts and minds of Americans who are angered about massive artificial intelligence data centers sprouting up in their neighborhoods, straining electricity grids and drawing on local reservoirs.",
      "Microsoft is trying anyway.",
      "The software giant's president, Brad Smith, is meeting with federal lawmakers Tuesday to push forward an approach that calls for the industry, not taxpayers, to pay the full costs of the vast network of computing warehouses needed to power AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Microsoft's own Copilot. President Donald Trump gave Microsoft's effort a nod in a Truth Social post Monday evening, where he stated that he does not want Americans to \u201cpick up the tab\u201d for these data centers and pay higher utility costs.",
      "\u201cLocal communities naturally want to see new jobs but not at the expense of higher electricity prices or the diversion of their water,\u201d Smith said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Smith's campaign comes as data center developers are increasingly running into hostility in towns where they want to build and meeting defeat at municipal boards that must approve zoning applications or construction permits.",
      "Rising electric prices are one problem. Heavy water usage by data centers to cool electronic equipment has also elicited concerns from local residents that they\u2019ll see their wells run dry or their water utility bills spike.",
      "The defeats have spread alarm among data center allies and spurred efforts to ramp up the amount of money that operators are willing to offer communities in exchange for approval.",
      "\u201cPeople are asking not just pointed questions but completely reasonable questions and it\u2019s our job, I think, to acknowledge them and address them head on and show that we can do this and pursue this expansion in a way that fully meets their needs,\u201d said Smith, who is also Microsoft's vice chair and has spent decades leading its legal and political work.",
      "In the mid-Atlantic region grid that encompasses all or parts of 13 states, ratepayers have been paying higher prices on their bills since at least June because of data centers, according to utilities and analysts.",
      "Electricity bills are expected to keep rising as payments to power plant owners grow to entice the construction of new power sources to meet demand from new and yet-to-be-built data centers in hotspots like Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania.",
      "Another source of friction is that big data center developers can strike bulk power deals with local electric utilities that are profitable for utilities, but also kept confidential. That means it may never be clear whether data center operators really are paying for their electricity \u2014 or foisting the cost onto the rest of the utility\u2019s ratepayers, consumer advocates say.",
      "Data center projects have also met objections in communities where people are worried about losing open space, farmland, forest or rural character, or are concerned about the damage to quality of life, property values, environment or their health.",
      "In Hobart, Indiana, last week, the City Council approved a tax-abatement package for a multibillion-dollar Amazon data center planned there. In turn, the deal promises Amazon will make two payments of $5 million each for issuing a pair of building permits, plus another series of payments totaling $175 million over three years at various project milestones.",

      "In Wisconsin, where Smith grew up and the home of what Microsoft has called \u201cthe world\u2019s most powerful AI datacenter,\u201d the company has encountered hurdles in expanding its construction projects near the shores of Lake Michigan. The company has promised the centers will employ hundreds of people when they\u2019re finished. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has touted the projects he says will put Wisconsin \u201con the very cutting edge of AI power.\u201d",
      "But environmentalists and consumer groups have warned that the centers will consume unprecedented amounts of electricity, driving up rates across the Midwestern power grid, and could use hundreds of thousands of gallons of Lake Michigan water daily. Company officials have pledged that the centers\u2019 impact will be minimal and will contribute carbon-free energy to the power grid.",
      "Environmental group Clean Wisconsin has called for government officials to pause data center approvals until the state develops a comprehensive plan to regulate them. Francesca Hong, one of several Democratic candidates for governor \u2014 Evers is not seeking re-election in November \u2014 has developed a proposal she calls CONTROL ALT DELETE that calls for a moratorium on data center construction until \u201cwe know how to protect ourselves from their environmental and energy costs.\u201d",
      "In the interview with AP, Smith talked about data center projects in Wisconsin and elsewhere. This interview has been edited for clarity and length.",
      "Smith: We don\u2019t use nearly as much water as we do electricity. Electricity is a heavier lift. It\u2019s a larger investment. And it comes after several decades where electricity production in the United States was basically flat. If you look at the approach that we\u2019re taking in terms of partnering with utilities, paying our own way, I think we can address this problem to the satisfaction of local communities. At the end of the day, it requires the approval of the utilities commissions.",
      "Smith: I shouldn\u2019t name names. First of all, we wholeheartedly agree with the positive impact that AI is going to create for the future. But we don\u2019t think that the public should be devoting tax dollars to pay for the improvements in the electricity grid that are needed to serve data centers. Private companies can incorporate that into their financial planning, especially when you look at things like improvements on the transmission side or improvements in substations.",
      "Smith: We set a goal for ourselves in 2020 of being what we call carbon-negative by 2030. That requires that we reduce the amount of carbon emissions that we create, and that we then remove from the environment each year, beginning in 2030, more carbon than we emit. We have not changed course on that. There are times when the power that is coming to our data centers is generated by something like natural gas. We can work with a utility to ensure that it\u2019s cleaner natural gas, but beyond that, we also invest in bringing to the regional grid new sources of carbon-free energy as well, whether it\u2019s nuclear, solar, hydro or others.",
      "Smith: On the carbon commitment, we have a clear path to reach our goal in 2030. As we often say, progress is lumpy, not linear. A lot of what we\u2019re doing in the middle of the decade is making the investments that will benefit us at the end of the decade. It\u2019s not like walking upstairs, where every step is the same length. But overall, I continue to be confident in our ability to meet our goals at the end of the decade.",
      "Smith: We are supportive of Wisconsin developing a comprehensive electricity plan. I don\u2019t think our project should be paused to wait for that. We\u2019re partnering to build out and improve the electricity grid in southeastern Wisconsin. A rate tariff that we have proposed to the public utility commission would impose on Microsoft additional costs that we would help pay for in the state. And because of other investments we\u2019re making, including a 150-megawatt solar farm.",

With voter turnout of 59%, Wine secured 35% of the ballots against Museveni\u2019s 58%, the president's smallest vote share since his first electoral campaign three decades ago.",
      "The prominence of the opposition leader has since grown.

      "Russia has launched another major drone and missile attack on Ukraine that targeted the country's power grid",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Russia launched a second major drone and missile bombardment of Ukraine in four days, officials said Tuesday, aiming again at the power grid and apparently snubbing U.S.-led peace efforts as the war approaches the four-year mark.",
      "Russia fired almost 300 drones, 18 ballistic missiles and seven cruise missiles at eight regions overnight, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on social media.",
      "One strike in the northeastern Kharkiv region killed four people at a mail depot, and several hundred thousand households were without power in the Kyiv region, Zelenskyy said. The daytime temperature in the capital was -12 C (around 10 F). The streets were covered with ice, and the city rumbled with the noise from generators.",
      "Four days earlier, Russia also sent hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles in a large-scale overnight attack and, for only the second time in the war, it used a powerful new hypersonic missile that struck western Ukraine in what appeared to be a clear warning to Kyiv\u2019s NATO allies that it won\u2019t back down.",
      "On Monday, the United States accused Russia of a \u201c dangerous and inexplicable escalation \u201d of the fighting, when the Trump administration is trying to advance peace negotiations.",
      "Tammy Bruce, the U.S. deputy ambassador to the United Nations, told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council that Washington deplores \u201cthe staggering number of casualties\u201d in the conflict and condemns Russia\u2019s intensifying attacks on energy and other infrastructure.",
      "Russia has sought to deny Ukrainian civilians heat and running water in the freezing winter months over the course of the war, hoping to wear down public resistance to Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion, which began on Feb. 24, 2022. Ukrainian officials describe the strategy as \u201cweaponizing winter.\u201d",
      "In Ukraine\u2019s Kharkiv region, the Russian attack also wounded 10 people, local authorities said.",
      "In the southern city of Odesa, six people were wounded in the attack, said Oleh Kiper, the head of the regional military administration. The strikes damaged energy infrastructure, a hospital, a kindergarten, an educational facility and a number of residential buildings, he said.",
      "Zelenskyy said that Ukraine is counting on quicker deliveries of agreed upon air defense systems from the U.S. and Europe, as well as new pledges of aid, to counter Russia\u2019s latest onslaught.",
      "Meanwhile, Russian air defenses shot down 11 Ukrainian drones overnight, Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense said Tuesday. Seven were reportedly destroyed over Russia\u2019s Rostov region, where Gov. Yuri Slyusar confirmed an attack on the coastal city of Taganrog, about 40 kilometers (about 24 miles) east of the Ukrainian border, in Kyiv's latest long-range attack on Russian war-related facilities.",

    "story": [
      "A Hong Kong court moved closer to sentencing prominent democracy advocate Jimmy Lai, who was convicted under a national security law and could face up to life imprisonment",
      "HONG KONG -- A Hong Kong court heard sentencing arguments Tuesday for former publisher Jimmy Lai's co-defendants as it moved closer to sentencing the prominent democracy advocate whose conviction under a national security law could land him in prison for life. The jail term's potential length remained unclear.",
      "Former executives of the now-defunct, pro-democracy newspaper founded by Lai finished pleading for lighter sentences Tuesday afternoon in the landmark case widely seen as a barometer of media freedom in a city once hailed as a bastion of free press in Asia.",
      "The former journalists pleaded guilty in 2022 to conspiracy to collude with foreign forces to endanger national security. They admitted to the prosecution's charge that said they conspired with their ex-boss and onetime media mogul Lai to request foreign sanctions, blockades or engage in other hostile activities against Hong Kong or China.",
      "Lai, who pleaded not guilty in the case, was convicted in December. The verdict raised concerns about the city's declining press freedom and drew criticism from foreign governments.",
      "But the government insists the case has nothing to do with media freedom, saying the defendants used news reporting as a pretext for years to commit acts that harmed China and Hong Kong.",
      "Following the conclusion of arguments, Esther Toh, one of the three government-vetted judges, said they would need to analyze the lawyers' arguments, saying they will inform them \u201cas soon as we can\" on the sentencing date. They did not give a date.",
      "After the judges left, some people in the public gallery waved goodbye to the defendants. Lai pressed his palms together in an apparent expression of gratitude before leaving the courtroom.",
      "Six Apple Daily executives were convicted in Lai's case: publisher Cheung Kim-hung; associate publisher Chan Pui-man; editor-in-chief Ryan Law; executive editor-in-chief Lam Man-chung; executive editor-in-chief responsible for English news Fung Wai-kong; and editorial writer Yeung Ching-kee. Some of them served as prosecution witnesses during the 156-day trial.",
      "A conviction on the collusion charge carries a sentence ranging from three years to life in prison. But a guilty plea can result in a sentence reduction. Under the security law, a reduced penalty may be granted to those who report on offenses committed by others.",
      "Chan's lawyer, Marco Li, said if the judges decided to place his client in the upper sentencing band, he suggested the starting point should be 10 years, given her limited role. Citing factors including her timely plea and assistance to the prosecution, he asked for her sentence to be halved.",
      "Li said Chan, who started working at Apple Daily in 1996 and has an emotional attachment to journalism, regretted not resisting even more firmly when matters arose that made her uncomfortable. But according to her mitigation letter, Chan couldn't leave her beloved job casually at that time because she was suffering serious health issues and was under financial burden, he said.",

      "\u201cHe was dragged into this deep, muddy water as an employee,\u201d Shum said.",
      "Chung Pui-kuen, Chan's husband and a former top editor of the now-shuttered Stand News, was among those in the public gallery. He was sentenced to 21 months in jail in a separate sedition case.",
      "Lai founded Apple Daily in 1995, two years before Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule. It attracted a strong following with its sometimes sensational reports, investigative scoops and eventual short animated video reports. Being openly critical of the Hong Kong and Chinese governments, the newspaper was well-received among pro-democracy readers.",
      "During Hong Kong's massive anti-government protests in 2019, Apple Daily ran articles sympathetic to protesters and supportive of the pro-democracy movement that saw hundreds of thousands of people take to the streets.",
      "After Beijing imposed the security law to quell the protests, Lai was one of the first prominent figures to be arrested. Within a year, Apple Daily's former executives also were arrested. The prosecutions, asset freeze and police raids forced the newspaper's closure in June 2021. Its final edition sold a million copies.",
      "In their December verdict, the judges said Lai had used Apple Daily as a platform for spreading his political ideas and implementing his political agenda before and after the introduction of the security law.",
      "The judges on Monday heard arguments about the sentencing of Lai, Cheung and two other non-Apple Daily activists involved in the former publisher\u2019s case.",
      "When Lai entered the courtroom Tuesday, he smiled at people sitting in the public gallery as a supporter formed a heart shape with her hands.",

      "He hopes a move to the young Arizona Diamondbacks can change that trend.",
      "\u201cI still want to play in the playoffs,\u201d Arenado said. \u201cI know my numbers aren't great, but that doesn't take away from the fact that I was prepared for it and that I've always been prepared for it. I just haven't played the way I expected.\u201d",
      "\u201cI want the opportunity to do it again and I don't see why this group can't do that,\u201d he added. \"That's why I was really open to playing here. My expectations are still high.\u201d",
      "It's no surprise Arenado was traded on Tuesday from the rebuilding St. Louis Cardinals, considering they had shopped him extensively for more than a year. Still, the end came quickly. Now he joins a franchise trying to make the postseason for the first time since a run to the World Series in 2023.",
      "\u201cI was kind of in shock, because this process has been going on for a little while, so it was like \u2018Man, I can\u2019t believe we're finally getting to this place,'\u201d Arenado said.",
      "Arenado \u2014 who turns 35 in April \u2014 will be playing for his third MLB team after five years with the Cardinals and the first eight with the Colorado Rockies. He said his departure from the Cardinals was amicable and he had good conversations with the team's president of baseball operations Chaim Bloom, even if the process dragged on longer than both sides had hoped.",
      "Bloom has made it clear that St. Louis \u2014 which finished 78-84 last season \u2014 is in rebuilding mode.",
      "\u201cIt was very evident that there was a step they needed to take in letting these young guys go, finding out who they are and who their identity is and I was just kind of in the way of that in a sense,\u201d Arenado said. \u201cBut I loved my time there.\u201d",
      "Arenado wasn't the offensive force he used to be last season, batting .237 with 12 homers and 52 RBIs, but he provides experience and above-average defense at third base after the D-backs dealt slugger Eugenio Su\u00e1rez at last season\u2019s trade deadline.",

      "\u201cI expect to go out and help this team win on both sides,\" Arenado said. \"I know the last few years haven't gone the way I wanted. Obviously, dealt with some injuries and different things, but I think some of the adjustments I'm trying to make ... they're going to pay dividends down the line.\u201d",
      "Taking a gamble on Arenado's potential late-career renaissance makes sense for the D-backs, particularly because it's a relatively low-cost move. Arenado is owed $42 million over the next two seasons, but the Cardinals are still paying $31 million of his salary as part of the deal.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve always liked the way he\u2019s played the game and the impact he can have when he\u2019s not playing,\u201d Arizona general manager Mike Hazen said Tuesday. \u201cI think he\u2019s a good fit. I know how much winning means to him and is important to him \u2014 and it\u2019s important to us.\u201d",

      "OXON HILL, Md. -- The head of the new regulatory body for college sports said \u201cif there was a time to stick out your neck, it's now,\u201d in urging schools to sign an agreement sent out nearly two months ago pledging to abide by new rules that govern how to pay players.",
      "Bryan Seeley, the CEO of the 7-month-old College Sports Commission, used his presentation at the NCAA convention Wednesday to thank leaders from four schools who put out a statement backing the agreement, while urging others to sign on.",
      "\u201cMy sense is that the vast majority of schools want to sign this. but I suspect if a school wants this, you\u2019re thinking, \u2018Why am I going to stick my neck out?'\u201d if other schools won\u2019t also sign, Seeley said. \u201cIf there was a time to stick out your neck, it's now.\"",
      "In late November, the CSC sent Division I schools its \u201cUniversity Participation Agreement,\u201d an 11-page document that all 68 schools from the four largest conferences need to sign for it to go into effect. It outlines the CSC's role in monitoring how schools pay out the $20.5 million they're allowed to spend on players' name, image and likeness and also looks at how the CSC regulates third-party payments to players.",
      "But the most contentious part of the agreement was language that forbid schools from suing the agency.",
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton called the agreement a \u201cpower grab\u201d in directing that state's schools not to sign. Other state AGs followed suit.",
      "On Tuesday, school presidents at Arizona, Washington, Virginia Tech and Georgia released a statement urging their colleagues to sign on.",
      "\u201cStability is not created by new rules alone, but by a willingness to live by them,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Seeley latched onto that with a plea of his own.",

      "\u201cI'm not of the belief that college sports is fundamentally broken and the sky is falling. but there are definitely problems,\u201d he told a room full of college sports administrators. \u201cNo one from the outside is coming to fix those problems. We\u2019ll either collectively come together to fix those problems or they won\u2019t be fixed.\u201d",

      "Debate over the consequences of all 68 schools not signing the agreement has run the gamut, from those who believe the CSC could enforce its rules anyway to others who think it would eventually shutter the entire system.",
      "Seeley gave a nod to proposals, now stalled in Congress, that could add muscle to many of the CSC's functions.",
      "\u201cBut we don\u2019t know when that help is coming, and in the interim, we should be working hard collectively to try to fix some (of the issues). One way to do that is to sign this participatory agreement,\" he said.",

      "MADRID -- \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa got off to a dismal start as the new coach of Real Madrid, seeing his team lose to second-division club Albacete 3-2 and drop out of the Copa del Rey in the round of 16 on Wednesday.",
      "Jeft\u00e9 Betancor scored the game-winning goal four minutes into stoppage time to send Albacete to the quarterfinals. Gonzalo Garc\u00eda had also scored in added time for Madrid to even the match at 2-2.",
      "Madrid struggled from the start in the debut of Arbeloa, the club's former B-team coach who on Monday was picked to replace Xabi Alonso following a tumultuous eight-month stint at the helm.",
      "\u201cAt this club, even a draw is bad, a tragedy, imagine a defeat like this, especially against a lower-division opponent,\" Arbeloa said. \"If anyone is responsible, it\u2019s me, as I\u2019m the one who made the decisions regarding the lineup, how we wanted to play, and the substitutions. I can only thank the players for the welcome they gave me and help them recover physically and mentally.\u201d",
      "Arbeloa used a few B-team players as expected, but he drew some criticism for resting many of his top stars, including Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Jude Bellingham, Thibaut Courtois and Rodrygo. Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior started, but was mostly ineffective as Madrid had difficulty creating scoring opportunities.",
      "Arbeloa said he had \u201cno regrets\u201d about his squad choice.",
      "\u201cI was convinced that the squad was the right one,\" Arbeloa said. \u201cIt was a great team, the starting lineup and the bench. I have a very talented squad and it\u2019s not easy for them to do everything I\u2019ve asked of them in just one day with a new coach. I feel ultimately responsible.\u201d",
      "Veteran defender Dani Carvajal, who entered the game in the second half, said Madrid fans deserved an apology after the team's performance.",
      "\u201cWe are not going through our best moment,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone has to give a lot more.\u201d",
      "Albacete sits in 17th-place in the 22-team second-division standings. It hadn't won in five consecutive games in all competitions.",
      "The hosts had gotten on the board first with Javier Villar scoring with a header off a corner kick in the 42nd and Franco Mastantuono equalized from close range three minutes into first-half stoppage time. Betancor put Albacete back in front in the 82nd with a shot from inside the area after the Madrid defense failed to fully clear a cross into the box.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the greatest thing in football and it happened today,\" Betancor said. \"I\u2019m so happy for my team, everyone worked like crazy. I\u2019m very, very happy.\u201d",

      "An astronaut in need of medical care is on the way back to Earth",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- An astronaut in need of doctors' care departed the International Space Station with three crewmates on Wednesday in NASA's first medical evacuation.",
      "The four returning astronauts \u2014 from the U.S., Russia and Japan \u2014 are aiming for an early Thursday morning splashdown in the Pacific near San Diego with SpaceX. The decision cuts short their mission by over a month.",
      "\u201cOur timing of this departure is unexpected,\u201d NASA astronaut Zena Cardman said before the return trip, \u201cbut what was not surprising to me was how well this crew came together as a family to help each other and just take care of each other.\u201d",
      "Officials refused to identify the astronaut who needed care last week and would not divulge the health concerns.",
      "The ailing astronaut is \u201cstable, safe and well cared for,\u201d outgoing space station commander Mike Fincke said earlier this week via social media. \u201cThis was a deliberate decision to allow the right medical evaluations to happen on the ground, where the full range of diagnostic capability exists.\"",
      "Launched in August, Cardman, Fincke, Japan\u2019s Kimiya Yui and Russia\u2019s Oleg Platonov should have remained on the space station until late February. But on Jan. 7, NASA abruptly canceled the next day\u2019s spacewalk by Cardman and Fincke and later announced the crew\u2019s early return. Officials said the health problem was unrelated to spacewalk preparations or other station operations, but offered no other details, citing medical privacy. They stressed it was not an emergency situation.",
      "NASA said it would stick to the same entry and splashdown procedures at flight\u2019s end, with the usual assortment of medical experts aboard the recovery ship in the Pacific. It was another middle-of-the-night crew return for SpaceX, coming less than 11 hours after undocking from the space station. NASA said it was not yet known how quickly all four would be flown from California to Houston, home to Johnson Space Center and the base for astronauts.",
      "One U.S. and two Russian astronauts remain aboard the orbiting lab, just 1 1/2 months into an eight-month mission that began with a Soyuz rocket liftoff from Kazakhstan. NASA and SpaceX are working to move up the launch of a fresh four-person crew from Florida, currently targeted for mid-February.",
      "Computer modeling predicted a medical evacuation from the space station every three years, but NASA hasn't had one in its 65 years of human spaceflight. The Russians have not been as fortunate. In 1985, Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Vasyutin came down with a serious infection or related illness aboard his country\u2019s Salyut 7 space station, prompting an early return. A few other Soviet cosmonauts encountered less serious health issues that shortened their flights.",
      "It was the first spaceflight for Cardman, a 38, biologist and polar explorer who missed out on spacewalking, as well as Platonov, 39, a former fighter pilot with the Russian Air Force who had to wait a few extra years to get to space because of an undisclosed health issue. Cardman should have launched last year but was bumped to make room on the way down for NASA\u2019s Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who were stuck nearly a year at the space station because of Boeing\u2019s capsule problems.",
      "Fincke, 58, a retired Air Force colonel, and Yui, 55, a retired fighter pilot with the Japan Air Self-Defense Force, were repeat space fliers. Finke has spent 1 1/2 years in orbit over four missions and conducted nine spacewalks on previous flights, making him one of NASA\u2019s top performers. Last week, Yui celebrated his 300th day in space over two station stays, sharing stunning views of Earth, including Japan\u2019s Mount Fuji and breathtaking auroras.",

      "NASA officials had said it was riskier to leave the astronaut in space without proper medical attention for another month than to temporarily reduce the size of the space station crew by more than half. Until SpaceX delivers another crew, NASA said it will have to stand down from any routine or even emergency spacewalks, a two-person job requiring backup help from crew inside the orbiting complex.",
      "The medical evacuation was the first major decision by NASA\u2019s new administrator Jared Isaacman. The billionaire founder of a payment processing company and two-time space flier assumed the agency\u2019s top job in December.",

      "That's according to a 2025 Year-End Report from Luminate, an industry data and analytics company that provides insight into changing behaviors across music listenership.",
      "In the U.S., on-demand audio streams hit 1.4 trillion, a 4.6% increase from last year.",
      "But attention is on older music. Less than half all U.S. on-demand audio streams \u2014 43% \u2014 were from tracks released in the last five years (2021 - 2025).",
      "One exception? Taylor Swift's \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d and Morgan Wallen's \u201cI'm the Problem,\u201d both of which surpassed 5 million album equivalent units in a single year. That's a combination of sales and streaming combined.",
      "Luminate's 2025 Mid-Year Report revealed that though streams of new music \u2014 music released in the last 18 months \u2014 were slightly down from the same time last year in the U.S., new Christian/gospel music defied the trend, said Jaime Marconette, Luminate\u2019s vice president of music insights and industry relations, led by acts like Forrest Frank, Brandon Lake and Elevation Worship.",
      "In the year-end report, it is clear that Christian/gospel music has continued to grow stateside: up 18.5% in on-demand audio volume change compared to 2024.",
      "Other genres that saw an uptick? Rock grew 6.4% and Latin grew 5.2%.",
      "\u201cRock is the largest growth genre this year, meaning it grew its share of the streaming pie the most,\u201d said Marconette in a statement. \u201cThough rock streaming in general leans catalog (tracks older than 18 months), the genre posted the second highest total of new current streams this year.\u201d",
      "For Latin music's growth, Bad Bunny is responsible. His on-demand audio streams totaled 5.3 billion \u2014 4.38% of all Latin on-demand audio streams.",
      "\u201cThe Latin genre continues to be one of the highest growth-genres in the U.S.,\u201d adds Marconette. \u201cBad Bunny was a key driver of the growth this year with his new album \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos\u201d generating 2.97 billion U.S. on-demand audio streams in 2025.\u201d",
      "The introduction of high-profile artificial intelligence artists became a leading music story in 2025. Those include Xania Monet and the rock band The Velvet Sundown.",
      "Monet went on to become the first AI act to debut on a Billboard radio chart, reaching No. 3 on the organization\u2019s Hot Gospel Songs and No. 20 on the Hot R&B Songs.",
      "There have been quite a few AI country artists as well, including Aventhis, Cain Walker and Breaking Rust. The latter had a song called \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d hit No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s country digital song sales chart in November. The vocal phrasing, melodic shape and stylistic DNA came from the Grammy-nominated country artist Blanco Brown, an artist who has worked with Britney Spears, Childish Gambino and Rihanna.",
      "These artists serve as examples of generative AI continuing to upend the music industry, giving anyone the ability to instantly create seemingly new songs by typing prompts into a chat window, often using models trained on real artists\u2019 voices and styles without their knowledge.",
      "And according to Luminate, they're having real success. Monet earned 125 million global on-demand audio streams last year. Breaking Rust brought in roughly 72.8 million streams followed by Walker with 48.1 million, Enlly Blue with 34.8 and Juno Skye with 15.5 million.",

      "SpaceX's Starlink has dropped fees to help Iranian demonstrators share protest details globally, activists say",
      "BANGKOK -- Iranian demonstrators' ability to get details of bloody nationwide protests out to the world has been given a strong boost, with SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service dropping its fees to allow more people to circumvent the Tehran government's strongest attempt ever to prevent information from spilling outside its borders, activists said Wednesday.",
      "The move by the American aerospace company run by Elon Musk follows the complete shutdown of telecommunications and internet access to Iran's 85 million people on Jan. 8, as protests expanded over the Islamic Republic's faltering economy and the collapse of its currency.",
      "SpaceX has not officially announced the decision and did not respond to request for comment, but activists told The Associated Press that Starlink has been available for free to anyone in Iran with the receivers since Tuesday.",
      "\u201cStarlink has been crucial,\u201d said Mehdi Yahyanejad, an Iranian whose nonprofit Net Freedom Pioneers has helped smuggle units into Iran, pointing to video that emerged Sunday showing rows of bodies at a forensic medical center near Tehran.",
      "\u201cThat showed a few hundred bodies on the ground, that came out because of Starlink,\" he said in an interview from Los Angeles. \"I think that those videos from the center pretty much changed everyone's understanding of what's happening because they saw it with their own eyes.\u201d",
      "Since the outbreak of demonstrations Dec. 28, the death toll has risen to more than 2,500 people, primarily protesters but also security personnel, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.",
      "Starlink is banned in Iran by telecommunication regulations, as the country never authorized the importation, sale or use of the devices. Activists fear they could be accused of helping the U.S. or Israel by using Starlink and charged with espionage, which can carry the death penalty.",
      "The first units were smuggled into Iran in 2022 during protests over the country's mandatory headscarf law, after Musk got the Biden administration to exempt the Starlink service from Iran sanctions.",
      "Since then, more than 50,000 units are estimated to have been sneaked in, with people going through great lengths to conceal them, using virtual private networks while on the system to hide IP addresses and taking other precautions, said Ahmad Ahmadian, the executive director of Holistic Resilience, a Los Angeles-based organization that was responsible for getting some of the first Starlink units into Iran.",
      "Starlink is a global internet network that relies on some 10,000 satellites orbiting Earth. Subscribers need to have equipment, including an antenna requires a line of site to the satellite, so must be deployed in the open, where it could be spotted by authorities. Many Iranians disguise them as solar panels, Ahmadian said.",
      "After efforts to shut down communications during the 12-day war with Israel in June proved to be not terribly effective, Iranian security services have taken more \u201cextreme tactics\u201d now to both jam Starlink's radio signals and GPS systems, Ahmadian said in a phone interview. After Holistic Resilience passed on reports to SpaceX, Ahmadian said, the company pushed a firmware update that helped circumvent the new countermeasures.",
      "Security services also rely on informers to tell them who might be using Starlink, search internet and social media traffic for signs it has been used, and there have been reports they have raided apartments with satellite dishes.",
      "\u201cThere has always been a cat-and-mouse game,\u201d said Ahmadian, who fled Iran himself in 2012, after serving time in prison for student activism. \u201cThe government is using every tool in its toolbox.\u201d",
      "Still, Ahmadian noted that the government jamming attempts had only been effective in certain urban areas, suggesting that security services lack the resources to block Starlink more broadly.",

      "A proposal to tax the accumulated wealth of California billionaires has ignited a political uproar in Silicon Valley and across the state",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A proposed billionaires' tax in California has ignited a political uproar in Silicon Valley, with tech titans threatening to leave the state while Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom maneuvers to defeat a levy that he fears will lead to an exodus of wealth.",
      "A technology mecca, California has more billionaires than any other state \u2014 a few hundred, by some estimates. Nearly half its personal income tax revenue, a financial backbone in the nearly $350 billion budget, comes from the top 1% of earners.",
      "A large health care union is attempting to place a proposal before voters in November that would impose a one-time 5% tax on the assets of billionaires \u2014 including stocks, art, businesses, collectibles and intellectual property \u2014 to backfill federal funding cuts to health services for lower-income people that were signed by President Donald Trump last year.",
      "In a state with a vast gap between rich and poor, the plan has resulted in a tangle of competing interests at a time when both Democrats and Republicans are struggling to respond to economic anxiety driven by rising costs ahead of this year's midterm elections.",
      "An online war of words has tech leaders pondering a hollowing out of Silicon Valley, and millions of dollars are flowing to political committees engaged in the fight. That includes $3 million from billionaire Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal, to a committee tied to a business group opposing the tax.",
      "However it's not clear if the proposal will make the ballot, with more than 870,000 petition signatures required for it to qualify.",
      "Although the tax would affect only a minuscule slice of California's roughly 39 million residents, it would siphon money from an immense pool of wealth. If would apply retroactively to billionaires living in the state as of Jan. 1.",
      "At least 25 billionaires listed among Forbes magazine\u2019s 2025 rankings of the world\u2019s 500 wealthiest people either lived in California or had some significant ties to the state, based on a review by The Associated Press. But determining whether they were full-time residents or just frequent visitors could turn into a matter of dispute, since many of them own property elsewhere.",
      "\u201cYou are really playing with fire with this one,\u201d said Aaron Levie, CEO of the publicly traded Silicon Valley company Box. He fears that the proposed tax would drive entrepreneurs to look elsewhere to run their companies and launch startups.",
      "Even liberal-leaning tech pioneers would \u201cfind it absurd just on pure economic and structural grounds, even if they might agree that the cause itself is very worthy,\u201d said Levie, who is not a billionaire.",
      "Newsom has long opposed state-level wealth taxes, believing such levies would be disadvantageous for the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy. At a time when California is strapped for cash and he is considering a 2028 presidential run, he is trying to block the proposal before it reaches the ballot.",
      "Analysts say an exodus of billionaires could mean a loss of hundreds of millions of tax dollars.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons why Newsom\u2019s path to the Democratic nomination is not going to be an easy one,\u201d Claremont McKenna College political scientist Jack Pitney said. \u201cHe\u2019s already facing a (budget) deficit the size of which is uncertain ... and in the years to come, a billionaires tax that could backfire badly.\u201d",

      "The tax is a \u201cworkable response to a crisis created by Congress,\u201d Suzanne Jimenez, chief of staff of SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West, said in a statement. She added that it would \u201ckeep emergency rooms open, hospitals staffed and health care systems functioning.\u201d",

It became the aristocratic quarter during the Roman Empire that followed, when new palaces were built on top of the older homes.",
      "The House of the Griffins is one of those earlier Republican-era homes, and was hidden to the world underground after the Emperor Domitian built his palace on top of it in the first century A.D.",
      "Now for the first time, the general public can virtually visit the House of the Griffins and its newly restored frescoes, including the decoration that gives the home its name: An arched lunette fresco featuring two griffins \u2014 half-eagle, half-lion mythological creatures.",
      "Visitors won\u2019t actually walk through the home\u2019s intimate rooms, which are only accessible via a perilously steep staircase underground. Rather, visitors above ground will watch as a tour guide wearing a head-mounted smartphone descends into the domus and walks through its rooms, livestreaming the visit and narration.",
      "The live, virtual tour serves multiple purposes: It allows visitors to \u201csee\u201d a domus that, because of its underground location, would otherwise be off-limits. And by limiting the number of people in its rooms, the livestreaming protects the delicate frescoes from too much humidity and carbon dioxide.",
      "Project chief Federica Rinaldi said that archaeologists don\u2019t know much about the family who lived there, but said they were clearly well-off, given the level of decoration that recalls some of the elegant homes of the era in Pompeii. The frescoes feature richly colored faux marble designs, and floor mosaics of three-dimensional cubes.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iranians made phone calls abroad for the first time in days Tuesday after authorities severed communications during a crackdown on nationwide protests that activists say killed at least 646 people, giving a glimpse of life after being cut off from the outside world.",
      "Witnesses described a heavy security presence in central Tehran, burned-out government buildings, smashed ATMs and few passersby. Meanwhile, people remain concerned about what comes next, including the possibility of strikes after U.S. President Donald Trump said he could possibly use the military to defend peaceful protesters. Trump also has said Iran wants to negotiate with Washington.",
      "\u201cMy customers talk about Trump\u2019s reaction while wondering if he plans a military strike against the Islamic Republic,\u201d said shopkeeper Mahmoud, who gave only his first name out of concerns for his safety. \u201cI don\u2019t expect Trump or any other foreign country cares about the interests of Iranians.\u201d",

      "Several people in Tehran were able to call The Associated Press on Tuesday morning and speak to a journalist there. The AP bureau in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, was unable to call those numbers back. The witnesses said text messaging still was down and that internet users in Iran could connect to government-approved websites locally but nothing abroad.",
      "Anti-riot police officers, wearing helmets and body armor, carried batons, shields, shotguns and tear gas launchers, according to the witnesses. Police stood watch at major intersections. Nearby, the witnesses saw members of the Revolutionary Guard's all-volunteer Basij force, who similarly carried firearms and batons. Security officials in plainclothes were visible in public spaces as well.",
      "Several banks and government offices were burned during the unrest, they said. Banks struggled to complete transactions without the internet, the witnesses added.",
      "However, shops were open, though there was little foot traffic in the capital. Tehran's Grand Bazaar, where the demonstrations began Dec. 28, was to open Tuesday. However, a witness described speaking to multiple shopkeepers who said the security forces ordered them to reopen no matter what. Iranian state media had not acknowledged that order.",
      "The witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.",
      "It also appeared that security service personnel were searching for Starlink terminals as people in northern Tehran reported authorities raiding apartment buildings with satellite dishes. While satellite television dishes are illegal, many in the capital have them in their homes and officials broadly had given up on enforcing the law in recent years.",
      "On the streets, people also could be seen challenging plainclothes security officials, who were stopping passersby at random.",
      "State television also read a statement about mortuary and morgue services being free \u2014 a signal some likely charged high fees for the release of bodies amid the crackdown.",
      "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a statement carried by state TV, praised the tens of thousands who took part in pro-government demonstrations nationwide on Monday.",
      "\u201cThis was a warning to American politicians to stop their deceit and not rely on traitorous mercenaries,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Iranian nation is strong and powerful and aware of the enemy.\u201d",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google\u2019s AI engine inside the Pentagon network",
      "WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google\u2019s generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military's data as possible into the developing technology.",
      "\u201cVery soon we will have the world\u2019s leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,\u201d Hegseth said in a speech at Musk\u2019s space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas.",
      "The announcement comes just days after Grok \u2014 which is embedded into X, the social media network owned by Musk \u2014 drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.",
      "Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok, while the U.K.\u2019s independent online safety watchdog announced an investigation Monday. Grok has limited image generation and editing to paying users.",

      "Hegseth\u2019s aggressive push to embrace the still-developing technology stands in contrast to the Biden administration, which, while pushing federal agencies to come up with policies and uses for AI, was also wary of misuse. Officials said rules were needed to ensure that the technology, which could be harnessed for mass surveillance, cyberattacks or even lethal autonomous devices, was being used responsibly.",
      "The Biden administration enacted a framework in late 2024 that directed national security agencies to expand their use of the most advanced AI systems but prohibited certain uses, such as applications that would violate constitutionally protected civil rights or any system that would automate the deployment of nuclear weapons. It is unclear if those prohibitions are still in place under the Trump administration.",
      "During his speech, Hegseth spoke of the need to streamline and speed up technological innovations within the military, saying, \u201cWe need innovation to come from anywhere and evolve with speed and purpose.\u201d",

      "Olympic officials have brought on ice master Mark Messer to prepare the speed skating rink for the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Games",
      "RHO, Italy -- No ice is colder and harder than speedskating ice. The precision it takes has meant that Olympic speedskaters have never competed for gold on a temporary indoor rink \u2013 until the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Games.",
      "In the pursuit of maximum glide and minimum friction, Olympic officials brought on ice master Mark Messer, a veteran of six previous Olympic speedskating tracks and the ice technician in charge of the Olympic Oval in Calgary, Canada \u2014 one of the fastest tracks in the world with over 300 records.",

      "If Goldilocks were a speedskater, hockey ice would be medium hard, for fast puck movement and sharp turns. Figure skating ice would be softer, allowing push off for jumps and so the ice doesn\u2019t shatter on landing. Curling ice is the softest and warmest of all, for controlled sliding.",
      "For speedskating ice to be just right, it must be hard, cold and clean. And very, very smooth.",
      "\u201cThe blades are so sharp, that if there is some dirt, the blade will lose the edge,\u2019\u2019 Messer said, and the skater will lose speed.",
      "Speedskater Enrico Fabris, who won two Olympic golds in Turin in 2006, has traded in his skates to be deputy sports manager at the speedskating venue in Rho. For him, perfect ice means the conditions are the same for all skaters \u2014 and then if it's fast ice, so much the better.",

Now he is upping the challenge by becoming the first ice master to build a temporary rink for the Olympics.",
      "Before Messer arrived in Italy, workers spent weeks setting up insulation to level the floor and then a network of pipes and rubber tubes that carry glycol \u2014 an antifreeze \u2014 that is brought down to minus 7 or minus 8 degrees Celsius (17.6 to 19.4 degrees Fahrenheit) to make the ice.",
      "Water is run through a purification system \u2014 but it can\u2019t be too pure, or the ice that forms will be too brittle. Just the right amount of impurities \u201cholds the ice together,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",
      "The first layers of water are applied slowly, with a spray nozzle; after the ice reaches a few centimeters it is painted white \u2014 a full day\u2019s work \u2014 and the stripes are added to make lanes.",

      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Malaysia and Indonesia have become the first countries to block Grok, the artificial intelligence chatbot developed by Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, after authorities said it was being misused to generate sexually explicit and non-consensual images.",
      "The moves reflect growing global concern over generative AI tools that can produce realistic images, sound and text, while existing safeguards fail to prevent their abuse. The Grok chatbot, which is accessed through Musk\u2019s social media platform X, has been criticized for generating manipulated images, including depictions of women in bikinis or sexually explicit poses, as well as images involving children.",
      "Regulators in the two Southeast Asian nations said existing controls were not preventing the creation and spread of fake pornographic content, particularly involving women and minors.

    "story": [
      "Doctors fear this week\u2019s unprecedented changes to federal vaccine recommendations will stoke vaccine hesitancy even more, pose challenges for pediatricians and parents and ultimately lead to more illness and death among children",
      "Dr. Molly O\u2019Shea has noticed growing skepticism about vaccines at both of her Michigan pediatric offices and says this week's unprecedented and confusing changes to federal vaccine guidance will only make things worse.",
      "One of her offices is in a Democratic area, where more of the parents she sees are opting for alternative schedules that spread out shots. The other is in a Republican area, where some parents have stopped immunizing their children altogether.",
      "She and other doctors fear the new recommendations and the terminology around them will stoke vaccine hesitancy even more, pose challenges for pediatricians and parents that make it harder for kids to get shots, and ultimately lead to more illness and death.",
      "The biggest change was to stop blanket recommendations for protection against six diseases and recommend those vaccines only for at-risk children or through something called \u201cshared clinical decision-making\u201d with a health care provider.",
      "The phrase, experts say, is confusing and dangerous: \u201cIt sends a message to a parent that actually there\u2019s only a rarefied group of people who really need the vaccine,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. \u201cIt\u2019s creating an environment that puts a sense of uncertainty about the value and necessity or importance of the vaccines in that category.\u201d",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who helped lead the anti-vaccine movement for years, said in announcing the changes that they better align the U.S. with peer nations \u201cwhile strengthening transparency and informed consent.\u201d",
      "But doctors say they are sowing doubt \u2014 the vaccines have been extensively studied and proven to be safe and effective at shielding kids from nasty diseases \u2014 at a time when childhood vaccination rates are already falling and some of those infectious diseases are spreading.",
      "On Friday, the American Academy of Pediatrics and more than 200 medical, public health and patient advocacy groups sent a letter to Congress about the new childhood immunization schedule.",
      "\u201cWe urge you to investigate why the schedule was changed, why credible scientific evidence was ignored, and why the committee charged with advising the HHS Secretary on immunizations did not discuss the schedule changes as a part of their public meeting process,\" they wrote.",
      "O\u2019Shea said she and other pediatricians discuss vaccines with parents at every visit where they are given. But that\u2019s not necessarily \u201cshared clinical decision-making,\u201d which has a particular definition.",
      "On its website, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices says: \u201cUnlike routine, catch-up, and risk-based recommendations, shared clinical decision-making vaccinations are not recommended for everyone in a particular age group or everyone in an identifiable risk group. Rather, shared clinical decision-making recommendations are individually based and informed by a decision process between the health care provider and the patient or parent/guardian.\u201d",
      "In this context, health care providers include primary care physicians, specialists, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, registered nurses and pharmacists.",
      "A pair of surveys conducted last year by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania suggested that many people don\u2019t fully understand the concept, which came up last year when the federal government changed recommendations around COVID-19 vaccinations.",
      "Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults knew that one meaning behind shared decision-making is that \u201ctaking the vaccine may not be a good idea for everyone but would benefit some.\u201d And only about one-third realized pharmacists count as health care providers to talk with during the process, even though they frequently administer vaccines.",
      "As of this week, vaccines that protect against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rotavirus, RSV, flu and meningococcal disease are no longer universally recommended for kids. RSV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B and meningococcal vaccines are recommended for certain high-risk populations; flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B and meningococcal vaccines are recommended through shared decision-making \u2014 as is the COVID-19 vaccine, although that change was made last year.",
      "Shortly after the federal announcement Monday, Dr. Steven Abelowitz heard from half a dozen parents. \u201cIt\u2019s causing concern for us, but more importantly, concern for parents with kids, especially young kids, and confusion,\u201d said Abelowitz, founder of Ocean Pediatrics in Orange County, California.",

      "Under the new guidelines, O'Shea said, parents seeking shots in the shared decision-making category might no longer bring their kids in for a quick, vaccine-only appointment with staff. They'd sit down with a health care provider and discuss the vaccine. And it could be tougher to have a flu clinic, where parents drive up and kids get shots without seeing a doctor.",
      "Still, doctors say they won\u2019t let the changes stop them from helping children get the vaccines they need. Leading medical groups are sticking with prior vaccine recommendations. Many parents are, too.",
      "Megan Landry, whose 4-year-old son Zackary is one of O\u2019Shea\u2019s patients, is among them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my responsibility as a parent to protect my child\u2019s health and well-being,\u201d she said. \u201cVaccines are a really effective and well-studied way to do that.\u201d",
      "She plans to keep having the same conversations she\u2019s always had with O\u2019Shea before getting vaccines for Zackary.",
      "\u201cRelying on evidence and trusted medical guidance really helps me to make those decisions,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd for me, it\u2019s not just a personal choice for my own son but a way to contribute to the health of everybody.\u201d",
      "But for other families, confidence about vaccines is waning as trust in science erodes. O'Shea lamented that parents are getting the message that they can't trust medical experts.",

      "The Supreme Court has agreed to take up an appeal from tech giant Cisco seeking to shut down a lawsuit claiming that the company\u2019s technology was used to persecute members of the Falun Gong spiritual movement in China",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court agreed Friday to take up an appeal from tech giant Cisco seeking to shut down a lawsuit claiming that the company\u2019s technology was used to persecute members of the Falun Gong spiritual movement in China.",
      "The justices, who will hear arguments in the spring, will review an appellate ruling that would allow the lawsuit against Cisco to go forward in U.S. courts.",
      "The court acted after the Trump administration weighed in on Cisco's behalf to urge the justices to hear the case.",
      "An Associated Press investigation last year showed that American tech companies, to a large degree, designed and built China\u2019s surveillance state, encouraged by Republican and Democratic administrations, even as activists warned such tools were being used to quash dissent, persecute religious groups and target minorities.",
      "In 2008, documents leaked to the press showed Cisco saw the \u201cGolden Shield,\u201d China's internet censorship effort, as a sales opportunity. The company quoted a Chinese official calling the Falun Gong an \u201cevil cult.\u201d A Cisco presentation reviewed by AP from the same year said its products could identify over 90% of Falun Gong material on the web.",

In 2011, Falun Gong members sued Cisco, alleging the company tailored technology for Beijing that it knew would be used to track, detain and torture believers.",
      "The issue before the Supreme Court is whether an American company can be held liable under two separate laws for aiding and abetting human rights violations. Cisco argues it isn\u2019t liable under those laws, the 18th-century Alien Tort Statute (ATS) or the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA), first enacted in 1991.",
      "In recent years, the Supreme Court and presidential administrations of both parties have been skeptical of lawsuits seeking to use U.S. courts as a venue to seek justice over the acts of foreign governments, especially those that took place abroad. To try to overcome that skepticism, Falun Gong members have argued that a substantial portion of Cisco\u2019s activities involving China took place in the United States.",
      "A decision is expected by early summer.",

      "One of the best-preserved ancient Roman homes on the Palatine Hill is opening to the public for the first time",
      "ROME -- One of the best-preserved ancient Roman homes on the Palatine Hill is opening to the public for the first time, albeit via a livestreamed tour of its hard-to-reach underground frescoes and mosaics.",
      "The House of the Griffins was first discovered during the excavations in the early 20th century of the Palatine Hill, the verdant hill that rises up from the Roman Forum and dominates views of central Rome today with its striking red brick ruins.",
      "The hill, located just off the Colosseum, was known for temples and homes of leading citizens during Rome\u2019s Republican era, which is traditionally dated from 509 B.C. to 27 B.C. It became the aristocratic quarter during the Roman Empire that followed, when new palaces were built on top of the older homes.",
      "The House of the Griffins is one of those earlier Republican-era homes, and was hidden to the world underground after the Emperor Domitian built his palace on top of it in the first century A.D.",
      "Now for the first time, the general public can virtually visit the House of the Griffins and its newly restored frescoes, including the decoration that gives the home its name: An arched lunette fresco featuring two griffins \u2014 half-eagle, half-lion mythological creatures.",
      "Visitors won\u2019t actually walk through the home\u2019s intimate rooms, which are only accessible via a perilously steep staircase underground. Rather, visitors above ground will watch as a tour guide wearing a head-mounted smartphone descends into the domus and walks through its rooms, livestreaming the visit and narration.",
      "The live, virtual tour serves multiple purposes: It allows visitors to \u201csee\u201d a domus that, because of its underground location, would otherwise be off-limits. And by limiting the number of people in its rooms, the livestreaming protects the delicate frescoes from too much humidity and carbon dioxide.",
      "Project chief Federica Rinaldi said that archaeologists don\u2019t know much about the family who lived there, but said they were clearly well-off, given the level of decoration that recalls some of the elegant homes of the era in Pompeii. The frescoes feature richly colored faux marble designs, and floor mosaics of three-dimensional cubes.",

      "Starting on March 3, the livestreamed tours will be held weekly, on Tuesdays, with one in Italian and one in English, though more are foreseen. Groups are limited to a dozen people and require reservations, as well as an additional ticket beyond the typical Colosseum-Palatine Hill entrance fee.",

      "A new Congressional Budget Office analysis says renaming the Department of Defense the Department of War could cost taxpayers up to $125 million",
      "WASHINGTON -- Renaming the Department of Defense the Department of War could cost U.S. taxpayers as much as $125 million depending on how broadly and quickly the change is made, according to an analysis released Wednesday from the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order in September that authorized the Department of War as a secondary title for the Pentagon. At the time, Trump said the switch was intended to signal to the world that the U.S. was a force to be reckoned with, and he complained that the Department of Defense\u2019s name was \u201cwoke.\u201d",
      "Indeed, the order came as the military began its campaign of deadly airstrikes against alleged drug-carrying boats in South America. Since then, a stunning military operation has captured then-Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and the Trump administration has threatened military action in places from Iran to Greenland.",
      "Congress has to formally approve a new name for the department, and it has shown no serious interest in doing so. Nevertheless, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth embraced the rebrand and proceeded to use it immediately on several signs after Trump's order.",
      "He had employees remove the large gold letters that spelled \u201cSecretary of Defense\u201d outside his office and replaced the sign on his door to read \u201cSecretary of War.\u201d The Pentagon\u2019s website also went from \u201cdefense.gov\u201d to \u201cwar.gov\" the same day the executive order was signed.",
      "Pentagon officials said then that they could not offer a cost estimate for the name change because they expected costs to fluctuate. They promised a clearer estimate later.",
      "The new report from the Congressional Budget Office says costs would be at least a few million dollars if the name change was phased in with minimal implementation, but could reach $125 million if it was implemented broadly and rapidly throughout the department.\u201d",
      "The assessment said it would cost roughly $10 million for a \u201cmodest implementation\u201d of the executive order if the name change happened within the agency, and such a cost would most likely be absorbed within the Pentagon's existing budgets.",

      "NEW YORK -- The Trump administration has made abrupt and sweeping cuts to substance abuse and mental health programs across the country in a move that advocates said will jeopardize the lives of some of the country's most vulnerable.",
      "The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration on Tuesday night canceled some 2,000 grants representing nearly $2 billion in funding, according to an administration official with knowledge of the cuts who was not authorized to discuss them publicly.",
      "The move pulls back funding for a wide swath of discretionary grants and represents about a quarter of SAMHSA's overall budget. It builds on other, wide-ranging cuts that have been made at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, including the elimination of thousands of jobs and the freezing or canceling of billions of dollars for scientific research.",
      "The latest funding cuts immediately jeopardize programs that give direct mental health services, opioid treatment, drug prevention resources, peer support and more to communities affected by addiction, mental illness and homelessness.",
      "\u201cWithout that funding, people are going to lose access to lifesaving services,\u201d said Yngvild Olsen, former director of SAMHSA\u2019s Center for Substance Abuse Treatment and a national adviser at Manatt Health. \u201cProviders are going to really need to look at potentially laying off staff and not being able to continue.\u201d",
      "SAMHSA, a sub-agency of HHS, notified grant recipients that their funding would be canceled effective immediately in emailed letters on Tuesday evening, according to several copies received by organizations and reviewed by The Associated Press.",
      "The letters, signed by SAMHSA Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Christopher Carroll, justified the terminations using a regulation that says the agency may terminate any federal award that \u201cno longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.\u201d",
      "Grant recipients who were notified of the cancellations said they were confused by that explanation and didn't get any further detail about why the agency felt their work didn't match up with SAMHSA's priorities.",
      "\u201cThe goal of our grants is entirely in line with the priorities listed in that letter,\u201d said Jamie Ross, CEO of the Las Vegas-based PACT Coalition, a community organization focused on substance use issues that lost funding from three grants totaling $560,000.",
      "HHS didn't respond to a request for comment on the funding cancellations, which were first reported by NPR. Two sources within SAMHSA who were not authorized to speak to media said staff weren't widely notified of the agency's action.",
      "Organizations reeling from the news on Wednesday told the AP they had already been forced to cut staff and cancel trainings. In the long term, many were considering whether they could keep programs alive by shuffling them to different funding sources or whether they'd need to stop the services altogether.",

One of the canceled grants had been awarded through the National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative, a more than 20-year-old program supporting specialized care for children who have been through traumatic events ranging from sexual abuse to school violence.",
      "Franks said his organization\u2019s work directly advances SAMHSA's goals to address mental illness. He said trauma care provided to children through his organization helps people from all walks of life and reduces burdens on other parts of society.",

They also said the grants totaled around 2,000 and likely amounted to some $2 billion.",

      "\u201cWhether you're a Democrat or a Republican, whole milk is a great thing,\u201d Trump said at a White House signing ceremony that featured lawmakers, dairy farmers and their children.",

      "The signing comes days after the release of the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which emphasize consumption of full-fat dairy products as part of a healthy diet. Previous editions advised that consumers older than 2 should consume low-fat or fat-free dairy.",

      "The head of a nonpartisan group supporting Georgia prosecutors says a new state law used by Donald Trump and others to seek attorney fees is likely unconstitutional",
      "ATLANTA -- The head of a nonpartisan group that supports Georgia prosecutors said the new state law that President Donald Trump and others charged in an election interference case are using to seek millions in attorney fees and costs from the Fulton County district attorney\u2019s office is likely unconstitutional.",
      "The law has \u201cserious and potentially unconstitutional deficiencies,\u201d notably because it denies county governments any sort of due process when defendants in a case request reimbursement, Georgia Prosecuting Attorneys' Council Executive Director Pete Skandalakis wrote in a court filing Wednesday.",
      "Georgia state legislators last year passed a law that says that if a prosecutor is disqualified from a case because of their own improper conduct and the case is then dismissed, anyone charged in that case is entitled to request \u201call reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred\u201d in their defense. The judge overseeing the case then is responsible for reviewing the request and awarding the fees and costs, which are to be paid from the budget of the prosecutor\u2019s office.",
      "Trump is seeking more than $6.2 million and the total amount sought by him and other people charged in the case is nearly $17 million, Skandalakis noted.",
      "Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis obtained an indictment against Trump and 18 others from a grand jury in August 2023, using the state\u2019s anti-racketeering law to accuse them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally try to overturn Trump\u2019s narrow 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden in Georgia.",
      "Willis and her office were removed from the case after the Georgia Court of Appeals found that there was an \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d created by a romantic relationship she had with the special prosecutor she chose to lead the case. Skandalakis took over the case late last year and dismissed it in November.",
      "The new law \u201cis probably unconstitutional because it leaves county governments \u2014 entities that are politically and practically separate from the elected District Attorney \u2014 responsible for paying costs that do not involve them, without any legal recourse to contest that responsibility,\u201d Skandalakis wrote. That denies them due process under both the U.S. and Georgia constitutions, he argued.",
      "A spokesperson for Willis declined to comment on Skandalakis' filing. Willis had previously asked the judge to allow her to be heard on the matter of any claims for fees and costs filed in the case.",
      "Steve Sadow, Trump\u2019s lead attorney in Georgia, said in an e-mailed statement that the law is constitutional and \u201cMr. Skandalakis\u2019 contentions are simply wrong.\u201d",

      "He also pointed out that the new law requires that the prosecutor be disqualified \u201cdue to improper conduct\" and argues that there has been no finding of improper conduct in this case. Rather, the appeals court found an appearance of improper conduct. Therefore, to award Trump and others their legal costs, the judge \u201cmust find an appearance is the same as a completed act.\u201d",
      "Skandalakis also notes that the law doesn't define a reasonable hourly rate for an attorney. The hourly rates paid to attorneys who step in when a district attorney or the state attorney general has a conflict are $66.57 and $125, respectively, Skandalakis wrote. Those rates are far below what some of the defense lawyers in the election case charged, but \u201cthey should be considered as part of what is reasonable,\u201d Skandalakis wrote.",
      "Defense attorneys sought Willis\u2019 removal after one of them revealed in January 2024 that Willis had engaged in a romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, the special prosecutor she had hired to lead the case. The defense attorneys said the relationship created a conflict of interest.",
      "The trial judge, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, rebuked Willis, saying in an order in March 2024 that her actions showed a \u201ctremendous lapse in judgment.\u201d But he did not find a conflict of interest that would disqualify Willis. He ultimately ruled that Willis could remain on the case if Wade resigned, which the special prosecutor did hours later.",
      "Defense attorneys appealed that ruling, and the Georgia Court of Appeals removed Willis from the case in December 2024, citing an \u201cappearance of impropriety.\u201d The Georgia Supreme Court in September declined to hear Willis\u2019 appeal.",

      "A large-scale immigration crackdown by an influx of federal law enforcement officers is not the only way President Donald Trump's administration is putting pressure on Minnesota",
      "It's not just about sending federal law enforcement officers into Minnesota.",
      "President Donald Trump's administration is also lashing out at the state by threatening to withhold billions in federal money, much of it intended to help low-income families with food aid, health care and child care \u2014 and with a new lawsuit against the state.",
      "Trump's administration has struck out at Democratic-run states broadly, but it's made a prime example of Minnesota, where the president last month called the state's Somali population \u201cgarbage,\" targeting it with actions not seen elsewhere.",
      "The administration has not spelled out its exact plans in most cases, and it's not clear if some of the money will actually stop flowing \u2014 or, if so, when.",
      "Trump's administration has unleashed a wave of threats to halt the flow of some federal funds to other states, too \u2014 including federal funds to \u201csanctuary cities\u201d that limit cooperation with federal immigration officials and their states.",
      "Minnesota has been singled out in some cuts as Trump repeatedly criticizes Gov. Tim Walz over fraud in federal programs. Walz, the 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee and a high-profile Trump critic, ended his campaign this month for a third term, saying he couldn't run a campaign while fending off the attacks and running the state.",
      "Minnesota is pushing back in courts or otherwise.",
      "Here's a look at the planned freezes in Minnesota.",
      "The Agriculture Department said it\u2019s freezing funding in the state and its largest city, Minneapolis \u2014 but without laying out many details. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a social media post Jan. 9 announcing the action: \u201cNo more handouts to thieves!\u201d",
      "In a letter to Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, she cited a major fraud case involving a USDA-funded pandemic relief program that broke in 2022 in which 78 people have been charged \u2014 and 57 convicted.",
      "Rollins said she was suspending all current and future awards to the city and state and told them to provide payment justifications for all transactions since Jan. 20, 2025, the day Trump returned to office. The justifications would be required to receive future money, too.",
      "Rollins said the awards at risk total more than $129 million but did not specify which programs are included. Her department has not clarified whether the amount includes payments that go to individuals, or just those to government entities.",
      "Based on the figure from Rollins, the freeze would not appear to include funds for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which helps about 1 in 12 Minnesota residents buy groceries. Minnesota residents received more than $850 million through that program in 2024. Still, a Minnesota Department of Children, Youth and Families website says the department is analyzing any impacts to SNAP.",
      "It also appears the National School Lunch Program, which provides and subsidizes school meals, is not included. Minnesota was expected to receive more than $240 million in that program in the budget year that ended Sept. 30.",
      "The Agriculture Department also runs programs aimed at food producers, including disaster aid and price supports.",
      "Minnesota Agriculture Commissioner Thom Peterson said at a news conference Wednesday that it's not clear exactly which programs might lose funding, but the state has started receiving notices from some pauses, including to a University of Minnesota poultry testing lab. He said that leaves uncertainty about who would pay if avian influenza is found at a farm and birds must be removed.",

      "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services also told Minnesota last week that it intends to withhold $515 million every three months from 14 Medicaid programs that were deemed high risk after rejecting a corrective action plan the federal government demanded because of fraud allegations.",
      "The programs identified as high risk include adult companion services, residential treatment services and nonemergency medical transportation.",
      "The amount to be withheld is equivalent to one-fourth of the federal money for those programs.",
      "On a call with reporters Tuesday, state Department of Human Services said they were mounting an administrative appeal to the freeze.",
      "They said the department has been emphasizing anti-fraud measures for more than a year and questioned the federal action, which they said is unlike anything they've found in other states.",
      "\u201cMinnesota cannot absorb the loss of more than $2 billion in annual funding for these programs without catastrophic consequences for the people we serve,\u201d Temporary Human Services Commissioner Shireen Gandhi said, adding that the state can\u2019t find other examples of similar federal decisions.",
      "\u201cIt's not corrective action,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's a punitive action.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services told Minnesota in late December that it was freezing funds in the child Care and Development Block Grant, which subsidizes child care for low-income families, telling the state that it had to submit attendance records and other information before the money would flow again.",
      "Last week, the Trump administration said it was halting payments of the child care money, along with temporary aid for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which provides job training and cash assistance, and the Social Services Block Grant, which funds a variety of social services, for Minnesota and four other states where Democrats lead the government.",
      "The five states \u2014 along with Minnesota, California, Colorado, Illinois and New York \u2014 sued. Advocates and officials warned that stopping the childcare subsidy would put many daycare providers at risk of layoffs of closures. And those could put the families of all their clients in binds, not just those who rely on the subsidies.",

The lawsuit seeks to end programs intended to diversify the government workforce, claiming \u201cMinnesota requires its hiring managers to jump through additional hoops to hire employees with disfavored skin colors or sex chromosomes.\"",
      "The lawsuit also seeks money for employees and prospective employees who were impacted.",
      "The state attorney general's office said it would respond in court.",

      "The National Transportation Safety Board says Boeing warned plane owners in 2011 about a flaw in the part that failed and contributed to the engine flying off a UPS plane before it crashed and killed 15 in November but at that point the plane manufactu...",
      "Boeing warned plane owners in 2011 about a broken part that contributed to a UPS plane crash that killed 15 last year but at that point the plane manufacturer didn't believe it threatened safety, the National Transportation Safety Board said Wednesday.",
      "The UPS plane crashed in November 2025 shortly after taking off in Louisville, Kentucky, when the left engine flew off the wing as the plane rolled down the runway. Three pilots on the plane that was headed for Hawaii were killed along with 12 more people on the ground near Louisville\u2019s Muhammad Ali International Airport.",
      "The NTSB said Wednesday that Boeing had documented in 2011 there were four previous failures of a part that helps secure the MD-11's engines to the wings on three different planes, but at that point the plane manufacturer \"determined it would not result in a safety of flight condition.\" These planes were actually built by McDonnell Douglas, which was later bought by Boeing.",
      "The NTSB previously said investigators found cracks in some of the parts that held the engine to the wing. Those cracks hadn\u2019t been caught in regular maintenance done on the plane, which raised questions about the adequacy of the maintenance schedule. The last time those key engine mount parts were examined closely was in October 2021, and the plane wasn\u2019t due for another detailed inspection for roughly 7,000 more takeoffs and landings.",
      "It\u2019s not clear when the cracks started to develop in the parts that helped hold the engine on the wing, but this crash is reminiscent of a 1979 crash in Chicago when the left engine flew off an American Airlines DC-10 during takeoff, killing 273 people. The DC-10 was the predecessor of the MD-11.",
      "That previous crash led to the worldwide grounding of 274 DC-10s. The airline workhorse was allowed to return to the skies because the NTSB determined that maintenance workers damaged the plane that crashed while improperly using a forklift to reattach the engine. That meant the crash wasn\u2019t caused by a fatal design flaw even though there had already been a number of accidents involving DC-10s.",
      "But former FAA and NTSB crash investigator Jeff Guzzetti said that a service bulletin McDonnell Douglas issued in 1980 did identify failures of the spherical bearing race as a \u201csafety of flight condition\u201d so it's surprising that Boeing didn't call it that in 2011. He said that American had removed the engine of that plane so it could inspect that bearing.",
      "\u201cI just think it raises questions regarding the adequacy of the severity of the 2011 service letter, and it also raises questions about how UPS incorporated that information and acted upon it,\u201d Guzzetti said.",
      "The service bulletin that Boeing issued didn't require plane owners to make repairs like an FAA airworthiness directive would, and the agency didn't issue such a directive.",
      "Former federal crash investigator Alan Diehl said the notice from Boeing recommended replacing the bearings with a redesigned part that was less likely to fail, but it still allowed operators to replace defective bearings with another older bearing that had demonstrated it was prone to failing.",
      "\u201cAs the investigation continues, the NTSB will have to address whether this service bulletin was an adequate solution to a known problem which could have had catastrophic results,\u201d Diehl said. \u201cThe UPS crash highlights the need for increased maintenance measures on older airframes.\u201d",

      "NTSB didn't say whether there had been additional documented failures of the spherical bearing race since 2011. Investigators found that part broken into two pieces after the UPS crash, and the lugs that held that part were cracked.",
      "Photos released by the NTSB of the Nov. 4 crash show flames erupting as the rear of the engine starting to detach before it flew up and over the wing. Then the wing was engulfed by fire as the burning engine flew above it.",
      "The factual report released Wednesday doesn\u2019t state what caused the engine to fly off, but it's clear that investigators are focused on the failure of this bearing. The ultimate conclusion won't come though until the NTSB's final report, which usually doesn't come until more than a year after a crash.",
      "But the report will undoubtedly be cited in the first lawsuit over the crash that was filed last month and subsequent lawsuits.",
      "The report does make clear that neither of the plane's two other engines were on fire before the crash. Some experts had previously speculated that debris flying off of the left engine might have damaged the engine on the tail.",
      "Boeing, UPS and the Federal Aviation Administration are limited on what they can say while the NTSB investigation is ongoing, so they all declined to comment on Wednesday's report. Boeing and UPS both expressed condolences to the families that lost loved ones in the crash.",
      "\u201cWe remain profoundly saddened by the Flight 2976 accident,\" UPS spokesperson Jim Mayer said. \"Our thoughts continue to be with the families and Louisville community who are grieving, and we remain focused on the recovery effort,\u201d Mayer said.",
      "The 34-year-old MD-11 plane only got 30 feet (9.1 meters) off the ground before crashing into several industrial buildings just past the runway and generating a massive fireball that could be seen for miles. Dramatic videos of the crash showed the plane on fire as it plowed into buildings and released a massive plume of smoke.",
      "Airlines quit flying this type of plane commercially years ago because it isn't as efficient as newer models, but they had continued to fly for cargo carriers like UPS and FedEx and a few of these planes were also modified for use in firefighting. All the MD-11s that had been in use and 10 related DC-10s have been grounded since the crash.",

      "A federal judge is expected to consider whether to set aside a Trump administration order pausing the construction of a major offshore project for New York",
      "WASHINGTON -- The developer of a major offshore wind project to serve New York is set to go before a federal judge Wednesday, hoping to convince him to lift a Trump administration order they say could mean the death of a project that's 60% complete.",
      "The Empire Wind project is designed to power more than 500,000 homes. Norwegian company Equinor said it will likely have to kill the project if construction can\u2019t resume soon due to the availability of specialized vessels and heavy financial losses.",
      "The case is being heard by District Judge Carl J. Nichols, an appointee of President Donald Trump.",
      "Empire Wind is one of five big offshore wind projects on the East Coast that the administration froze days before Christmas, citing national security concerns. Developers and states have sued seeking to block the order. Equinor\u2019s hearing is the second of three hearings for these legal challenges this week; on Monday, a judge ruled that a project serving Rhode Island and Connecticut could resume.",
      "Trump has targeted offshore wind from his first days back in the White House, most recently calling wind farms \u201closers\u201d that lose money, destroy the landscape and kill birds. When his administration cited national security concerns, it gave no detail for those concerns, and at least one expert has said the offshore projects were permitted following years of careful review that included the Department of Defense.",
      "The administration's stance against offshore wind and renewable energy more broadly runs counter to dozens of other countries.",
      "The global offshore wind market is growing, with China leading the world in new installations. Nearly all of the new electricity added to the grid in 2024 was renewable. Experts say the world needs a major buildout of renewable electricity to address climate change.",
      "Molly Morris, Equinor\u2019s senior vice president overseeing Empire Wind, said federal officials have not given them any explanation of the national security concerns or how to mitigate them.",
      "A specialized heavy lift vessel, Heerema\u2019s Sleipnir, must begin lifting the topside to the project\u2019s offshore substation off the transport ship and onto its foundation because the Sleipnir is scheduled to depart by Feb. 1 for other commitments, Morris said. The topside weighs more than 3,000 tons and there are few specialized offshore wind installation ships in the world.",
      "\u201cRight now the project is in a critical situation,\u201d Morris said. \u201cConstruction must resume by mid-January to avoid cascading delays that could ultimately lead to a cancellation of the project. We have been clear and consistent that we are ready to address any additional security concerns that were not already addressed through our lengthy engagement with various defense agencies.\u201d",
      "Monday's hearing was in the same federal court, with Danish energy company Orsted prevailing. A judge ruled that work on its project, called Revolution Wind, can resume while the administration considers ways to mitigate its national security concerns. Revolution Wind is nearly complete.",

New York\u2019s attorney general sued the Trump administration on Friday over Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind.",
      "The Trump administration previously halted work on both Empire Wind and Revolution Wind. In April, it stopped construction on Empire Wind, accusing the Biden administration of rushing the permits, then allowed work to resume a month later. In August, the administration paused work on Revolution Wind for what it said were national security concerns. A month later, a federal judge ruled the project could resume.",
      "Equinor finalized the federal lease for Empire Wind in March 2017, early in Trump\u2019s first term. The final federal approval was in February 2024. Equinor's limited liability company has spent about $4 billion to develop and construct the project so far.",

      "Nearly 1,000 households displaced by Maui's wildfires are anxiously awaiting news on federal assistance",
      "Nearly 1,000 households displaced by catastrophic wildfires in Maui are anxiously awaiting word on whether federal assistance helping them stay housed will be left to expire, forcing them to find new housing or pay more for it in one of the tightest and most expensive rental environments in the country.",
      "For two and a half years, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has been key to assisting those residents. But FEMA \u2014 facing a broader Trump administration effort to diminish the agency's role and shift more responsibility to states \u2014 is set to choose in the coming weeks whether to end the funding.",
      "Advocates say evicting renters and taking away financial assistance will undermine progress toward bringing residents back to Lahaina, the West Maui town that was largely razed by a massive fire on Aug. 8, 2023, and could lead to a new wave of homelessness and more departures from the island.",
      "\u201cAll of them entering into our already impacted rental market in February scares me a lot,\u201d said Nicole Huguenin, executive director and co-founder of the mutual aid organization Maui Rapid Response.",
      "The fires in Lahaina and Kula, in Maui's upcountry region, destroyed 2,200 structures and killed 102 people. Then-President Joe Biden declared a major disaster, unlocking FEMA assistance to help 12,000 displaced people, 89% of whom were renters at the time of the fires. His administration eventually extended the 18-month program until February 2026.",
      "But with few homes rebuilt and rental inventory nearing zero, the state requested another extension last May with a decision due before the end of January.",
      "The uncertainty comes against the backdrop of greater upheaval surrounding FEMA\u2019s future role in disaster recovery. President Donald Trump has frequently floated the idea of eliminating the agency, saying he wants states to take on more responsibility handling disasters.",
      "While it\u2019s not clear whether that change in approach will influence the decision on the housing assistance, it is weighing on residents.",
      "\u201cIt falls into the hands of the current administration and I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re fond of the amount of money we\u2019ve had to use,\" said Kukui Keahi, a Lahaina fire survivor who rents an apartment through FEMA after living in her car and couch-surfing after the fire.",
      "If the program expires, all housing-related financial assistance to fire survivors would cease and any units being leased directly through FEMA must be vacated, according to an agency notice.",
      "Maui County spokesperson Laksmi Abraham said the county was \u201cworking with the state and FEMA toward an extension and is optimistic that an extension will be granted.\u201d FEMA declined to comment.",
      "While megafires in other states have destroyed more homes, Maui's fires created a unique crisis. Limited housing stock and the island\u2019s remote location from the mainland U.S. made relocating survivors and rebuilding exceptionally difficult.",
      "FEMA, the state, county, and nonprofits all scrambled to find solutions to house the displaced, most of whom were desperate to stay near Lahaina to be close to work, schools and the community.",
      "After working with the Red Cross to house 8,000 residents in hotels and other temporary shelters in the initial weeks, FEMA slowly transitioned families to other forms of housing assistance.",
      "It offered money for rent, installed temporary shelters on burned properties, and leased thousands of units itself to rent back to survivors, though some complained of burdensome eligibility requirements and having to move several times.",
      "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers helped FEMA build Kilohana, a 167-unit modular housing complex on a lot overlooking Lahaina town. The massive investment required blasting hard rock to grade the state-owned land and installing new electric, water and sewer infrastructure. The first family moved in 14 months ago.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans are facing intense pressure from President Donald Trump to vote down a war powers resolution Wednesday that is aimed at limiting the president's ability to carry out further military action against Venezuela.",
      "Five GOP senators joined with Democrats to advance the resolution last week, but Trump has lashed out at the defectors as he tries to head off passage of the bill. Democrats are forcing the vote after U.S. troops captured Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in a surprise nighttime raid earlier this month.",
      "\u201cHere we have one of the most successful attacks ever and they find a way to be against it. It\u2019s pretty amazing. And it\u2019s a shame,\" Trump said at a speech in Michigan Tuesday. He also hurled insults at several of the Republicans who advanced the legislation, calling Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky a \u201cstone cold loser\u201d and Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine \u201cdisasters.\u201d",
      "Trump's latest comments followed earlier phone calls with the senators, which they described as terse. The fury being directed their way from the president underscored how the war powers vote has taken on new political significance as Trump expands his foreign policy ambitions in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "The legislation, even if passed by the Senate, has virtually no chance of becoming law because it would eventually need to be signed by Trump himself. But it represented both a test of GOP loyalty to the president and a marker for how much leeway the Republican-controlled Senate is willing to give Trump to use the military abroad.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican who helped advance the war powers resolution last week, has indicated he may change his position.",
      "Hawley said that Trump's message during a phone call last week was that the legislation \u201creally ties my hands.\" The senator said he had a follow-up phone call with Secretary of State Marco Rubio that was \u201creally positive.\u201d",
      "Hawley said that Rubio told him Monday \"point blank, we\u2019re not going to do ground troops.\u201d The senator said he also received assurances that the Trump administration will follow constitutional requirements if it becomes necessary to deploy troops again to the South American country.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m in listening-and-receive mode at this time,\u201d said Hawley, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to proceed next on the floor.\u201d",
      "Sen. Todd Young, an Indiana Republican who also voted to advance the resolution, declined repeatedly to discuss his position but said he was \u201cgiving it some thought.\u201d Collins had voted against similar war powers resolutions in previous months before voting last week to advance the one currently before the Senate.",
      "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, who has brought a series of war powers resolutions this year, said he wasn't surprised at Trump's reaction to Congress asserting its ability to check the president.",
      "\u201cThey're furious at the notion that Congress wants to be Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think people who ran for the Senate, they want to be U.S. senators and they don't want to just vote their own irrelevance.\u201d",

      "Prosecutors are seeking to keep Busfield in custody pending trial, citing a \"history of alleged sexual misconduct.\" They filed a motion early Wednesday detailing their reasons for the request, pointing to what they described as a documented pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse of authority and grooming behavior by Busfield over two decades. They also said witnesses have expressed fear regarding retaliation and professional harm.",
      "Another allegation was reported to law enforcement the same day Busfield turned himself in, Albuquerque Deputy District Attorney Savannah Brandenburg-Koch told the judge Wednesday in a court filing. A father of a then-16-year-old girl alleged Busfield kissed and inappropriately touched his daughter, who he said was auditioning for a role at\u00a0B Street Theatre, an organization Busfield and his brother founded in Sacramento, California. The incident occurred several years ago, according to the document.",
      "Busfield allegedly \"begged the family to not report to law enforcement if he received therapy,\" Brandenburg-Koch said in the motion. The girl's father, who is a therapist himself, said he thought it was the best thing to do at the time, according to the prosecutor.",
      "In a statement to CBS Sacramento, B Street Theatre said that though Busfield is its founder, he has not had an active role in its operations in any capacity since 2001. The theater declined to comment further on Busfield due to the ongoing investigation.",
      "The motion filed in Bernalillo County Metropolitan Court seeking to keep Busfield in custody also states that research and experience show that offenders are uniquely positioned to evade accountability and circumvent safeguards designed to protect children when they wield authority, status or influence.",
      "\"In light of the defendant's demonstrated disregard for boundaries, authority and compliance, no condition or combination of conditions of release can reasonably protect the victims or the community,\" the motion states.",
      "It will be up to a judge to determine whether to grant the request. A detention hearing has yet to be scheduled.",
      "Prosecutors also took issue with Busfield disseminating a video to the media outlet TMZ on Tuesday, suggesting he was prioritizing \"personal narrative control and public relations\" over compliance with the court process.",
      "According to the criminal complaint, an investigator with the police department says the child reported that he was 7 years old when Busfield touched him multiple times on private areas over his clothing. Busfield allegedly touched him on another occasion when he was 8, the complaint said.",
      "The complaint also says the child was reportedly afraid to tell anyone because Busfield was the director and he feared he would get mad at him.",
      "The boy's twin brother told authorities he also was touched by Busfield but did not specify where. He said he didn't say anything because he didn't want to get in trouble.",
      "The mother of the twins reported to Child Protective Services that the abuse occurred between November 2022 and spring 2024, the complaint said.",
      "In an interview with police last fall, Busfield denied the allegations and suggested that the boys' mother was seeking revenge for her children being replaced on the series. The argument was echoed by Busfield's attorney Tuesday.",
      "The investigation began in November 2024 after a call from a doctor at the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque. The boys' parents had gone there at the recommendation of a law firm, the complaint said.",
      "Busfield's attorney said an independent investigation by Warner Bros. was unable to corroborate allegations of inappropriate behavior by Busfield. But prosecutors in their filing argued that the investigator failed to talk to key witnesses.",
      "A publicist for Gilbert said she is \"not making public statements at this time.\"",
      "\"Any purported 'statements' circulating online \u2014 including AI-generated deepfakes of her 'breaking her silence' \u2014 should not be treated as coming from her,\" publicist Ame Van Iden said in a statement, adding, \"Melissa stands with and supports her husband and will address the public at an appropriate time. We ask that their privacy be respected.\"",

The arrest warrant, which was signed by a judge, said the charge was for two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor.",

    "story": [
      "Scott Adams, the cartoonist who created the \"Dilbert\" comic strip, has died at the age of 68, his first ex-wife revealed on Tuesday.\u00a0 Adams said last year that he was\u00a0diagnosed\u00a0with an aggressive prostate cancer.",
      "Adams' ex-wife, Shelly Miles, announced the news of his death during a live stream of his YouTube show, \"Real Coffee with Scott Adams.\"",
      "She read a \"final message\" from Adams on the show, in which he wrote that he had \"an amazing life\" and gave it everything he had. He urged people to \"be useful\" and said, \"please know I loved you all to the very end.\"",
      "Adams said on an episode of his show last May that he had \"the same cancer that Joe Biden has ... prostate cancer that has also spread to my bones.\"",
      "He made the announcement a day after Biden announced his own diagnosis.",
      "President Trump posted about Adams' death on Tuesday, calling him \"a fantastic guy, who liked and respected me when it wasn't fashionable to do so.\"",
      "\"He bravely fought a long battle against a terrible disease,\" Mr. Trump said on Truth Social. \"My condolences go out to his family, and all of his many friends and listeners. He will be truly missed. God bless you Scott!\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance called Adams \"a true American original, and a great ally to the President of the United States and the entire administration.\"",
      "Dilbert the comic strip first appeared in 1989, poking fun at office culture. It ran for decades in numerous newspapers until 2023, when it was canceled by most newspapers over comments by Adams that various publishers denounced as racist, hateful and discriminatory.",
      "Among other things, Adams referred to Black people as members of a \"hate group\" and urged White people \"to get the hell away from Black people.\" Newspapers such the Los Angeles Times and the USA Today network as well as distributor Andrews McMeel Universal announced they would no longer work with the cartoonist or run his strip. Adams took to YouTube at the time to defend himself and disclosed details about the impact of losing business, saying he was likely to lose 80% of his income from Dilbert due to the cancellations.",
      "In the message Miles read on the show Tuesday, Adams said that he wanted to explain his life. He said he spent the first part of it focusing on making himself a worthy husband and parent as a way to find meaning, then later \"donated\" himself to the world and evolved from Dilbert cartoonist to \"an author of what I thought would be useful books.\"",
      "\"From that point on I looked for ways I could add the most to peoples' life, one way or another,\" he wrote.",
      "Poking fun at corporate culture and, later, \"wokeness\"",
      "Adams earned a bachelor's degree from Hartwick College and an MBA from the University of California, Berkeley. He worked a corporate job at the Pacific Bell telephone company in the 1980s, sharing his cartoons to amuse co-workers. He drew Dilbert as a computer programmer and engineer for a high-tech company and mailed a batch to cartoon syndicators.",
      "The first \"Dilbert\" comic strip officially appeared April 16, 1989, long before such workplace comedies as \"Office Space\" and \"The Office.\" It portrayed corporate culture as a Kafkaesque world of heavy bureaucracy and pointless benchmarks, where employee effort and skill were underappreciated.",
      "Adams was the 1997 recipient of the National Cartoonist Society's Reuben Award, considered one of the most prestigious awards for cartoonists. That same year, \"Dilbert\" became the first fictional character to make Time magazine's list of the most influential Americans.",
      "\"Dilbert\" strips were routinely photocopied, pinned up, emailed and posted online, a popularity that would spawn bestselling books, merchandise, commercials for Office Depot and an animated TV series, with Daniel Stern voicing Dilbert.",
      "While Adams' career fall seemed swift, careful readers of \"Dilbert\" saw a gradual darkening of the strip's tone and its creator's mindset.",
      "He attracted attention for controversial comments, including saying in 2011 that women are treated differently by society for the same reason as children and the mentally disabled \u2014 \"it's just easier this way for everyone.\" In a blog post from 2006, he questioned the death toll of the Holocaust.",
      "In June 2020, Adams tweeted that when the \"Dilbert\" TV show ended in 2000 after just two seasons, it was \"the third job I lost for being white.\" But, at the time, he blamed it on lower viewership and time slot changes.",
      "Adams' views were reflected in some of his strips. In one in 2022, a boss says that traditional performance reviews would be replaced by a \"wokeness\" score. When an employee complains that could be subjective, the boss said, \"That'll cost you two points off your wokeness score, bigot.\"",
      "Adams put a brave face on his fall from grace, tweeting in 2023: \"Only the dying leftist Fake News industry canceled me (for out-of-context news of course). Social media and banking unaffected. Personal life improved. Never been more popular in my life. Zero pushback in person. Black and White conservatives solidly supporting me.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 06:48:08 -0500",
    "summary": "For years, she seemed powerless against a fluctuating weight problem, until new medications, and a new attitude, gave Oprah Winfrey a breakthrough. She talks with Jane Pauley about \"Enough,\" a new book co-written with Dr. Ania Jastreboff, about her weight-loss success.",
    "story": [
      "Our first question to Oprah Winfrey: \"You always wear really beautiful clothes. Always have. And I wonder if it's a joy to get dressed now?\"",
      "\"I can tell you what a joy it is to actually pack clothes that you know are gonna fit and you're gonna feel good in them,\" Winfrey replied. \"I mean, it is a joy to get dressed. That is such a powerful first question, Jane Pauley, really!\"",
      "Powerful is one of the superlatives befitting Oprah Winfrey, one of the best-known and most-admired people on the planet, and one of the richest. But for all her success, she seemed powerless against a weight problem, a deeply personal struggle she has waged publicly and openly.",
      "In 1985, when her talk show, \"AM Chicago,\" was getting national attention, Oprah appeared on \"The Tonight Show\" with guest host Joan Rivers.",
      "\"And I'm sitting there, and we're toward the end of the interview, and Joan turns to me and, 'So, tell me, you know, how'd you gain the weight?'\" Oprah recalled. Her response? \"I ate a lot.\"",
      "\"I was stunned in that moment, when I look back and I see that moment. But I left feeling humiliated and embarrassed, but not the least bit anger, not the least bit of anger or being upset about it,\" she said.",
      "Why? \"Because I thought, 'She's right.'\"",
      "Over the next 40 years, Oprah would gain and lose hundreds of pounds. In the fall of 1988, after a strict four-month liquid diet, a new svelte Oprah appeared wearing size 10 Calvins, weighing 145, and pulling a wagon with 67 pounds of animal fat.",
      "It was all back, plus 25 more, when she went to the Daytime Emmy Awards four years later. \"And I go to the Emmys praying not to win, literally praying not to win, because I don't want to have to get up out of my seat and have everybody watch me do that walk to the stage,\" she said.",
      "She started over again the next day, working out with an on-call personal trainer this time. In 1994 she even ran a marathon.",
      "Oprah knew how to lose weight \u2026 she did it over and over. She says her body was seeking a range of 211 to 218. \"So usually, by the time I would hit 211 when I first went on the diet for the wagon of fat and pulled out the wagon of fat, when I did my first marathon, once I get to 211, I go, 'Oh, I gotta do something.' But now I understand that the biology of me, which is different than the biology of you and everybody else \u2013 every body, all of us, has our own \u2013 but no matter what I did, no matter how hard I worked, no matter what, it was always trying to get my body back to 211.\"",
      "Not because 211 is her ideal weight, but rather a \"set point\": a genetically-influenced weight range. Oprah calls it the \"enough point.\"",
      "\"Enough\" is also the title of a new book she co-wrote with Dr. Ania Jastreboff from the Yale School of Medicine, who says, for most people, an enough point is \"the weight that they kind of always gravitate to.\"",
      "So, to lose weight, you cut back on calories, and start craving high-fat food , or you eat less \u2013 but nothing changes. \"Our body's like, 'Well, if you're gonna eat less, then I'm gonna make you more efficient. I'm gonna make you burn less,'\" said Jastreboff. \"So what happens is, together, collectively, we end up eating more, and burning less.\"",
      "\"It's the enemy within, which is in our brains,\" I said. \"So, now that we know what the problem is, the hormones that drive people, why don't people just stop obeying it?\"",
      "\"That would be like trying to control something that is not in your control,\" Jastreboff said. \"That would be like holding your breath for the rest of your life. Every time somebody says, 'Just eat less, move more,' we're asking our patients to control their biology and hold their breath. And it's just not possible. And why would we do that? We don't do that for any other disease.\"",
      "And that's what the American Medical Association says obesity is \u2014 a disease. A treatable disease. But the good news is that, if it's a disease, it's not your fault.",
      "\"It's not my fault, Jane! It's not my fault,\" Oprah said. \"And I could weep right now, could weep right now. I'm not going to! But I could weep right now for all of the many days and nights I journaled about this being my fault, and why can't I conquer this thing?\"",
      "In the last decade, nearly a dozen weight management drugs have been approved for chronic weight management.\u00a0 And for millions, drugs like GLP--1s are the answer to their prayers. Finally, a scientifically-supported, medically-approved weight-loss strategy that worked. And yet, Oprah resisted. \"I was so motivated by shame that I felt I could not take the drug,\" she said, \"because if I took the drug \u2013 I, who had been the poster child for I can do it, I can do it, I can do it, willpower, willpower, let's just get more willpower \u2013 if I couldn't do it, then I would be shamed, and ashamed of myself for not being able to do it myself.\"",
      "The medications don't work for everyone, and some can't tolerate side effects ranging from nausea to gallstones. But it's been two years since Oprah finally started medication, and it's working for her. She says she is now down to her marathon weight of 155. \"And so, that's it for me. I'm gonna just try to maintain,\" she said.",
      "\"Well done. Because I thought 160 was your goal weight?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, yeah, it was,\" Oprah said, \"but as I continue to work out here the combination of the medication and hiking every day and resistance training has given me the body that I had when I was running a marathon. So, I was 40 and feeling really good, but to be able to be 71 and feel that I am in the best shape of my life feels better than it did when I was 40.\"",
      "\"I would submit that you would have been a phenomenal success, but I don't think you would have become 'Oprah' if you hadn't had the weight issue and been open about it and shared it,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah. I would agree with that,\" she said. \"And that's why I don't have any regrets about it. There's a wonderful spiritual, African American spiritual, called, 'I Wouldn't Take Nothing For My Journey Now.'",
      "I wouldn't take nothing for my journey nowfor my journey nowfor my journey nowI wouldn't take nothing for my journey now.",
      "\"I wouldn't change the journey,\" she said. \"because I think the struggle with the weight actually helped me be more relatable and relate more to other people who were in their own struggles. But I'm glad now to be in a position where I feel the healthiest and strongest I have ever been.\"",
      "READ AN EXCERPT:\u00a0\"Enough\" by Dr. Ania Jastreboff and Oprah Winfrey",
      "\"I feel free\"",
      "Oprah Winfrey grew up riding on dirt roads. Now, on her sprawling Montecito estate near Santa Barbara, California, she owns the road.\u00a0 She took me for a ride: \"This used to belong to my neighbor,\" Oprah said. \"So, this is 23 acres. Her house used to be right there. We took this fence down, so this became my whole backyard, this.\"",
      "Around here, all of the views are spectacular, especially the one looking back.",
      "Born in Mississippi in 1954, Oprah Winfrey was a teen beauty queen who became a local TV reporter in Nashville, and then an anchor in Baltimore. \"The beautiful thing about my life was that I started out in local television, as you did,\" Oprah said. \"And when you start out locally, you get this, like, little teeny-tiny thing. But I failed. I failed in Baltimore.",
      "\"They brought me in as a 22-year-old with an anchor guy, white-haired Jerry Turner, who was the most popular local anchor in the country, not just Baltimore. And he totally hated me. He resented me. He would do everything he could to condescend to me any way. I remember one time we were on the set and he said to me, 'So, you're from Mississippi? Can you name all the tributaries of the Mississippi River?'",
      "\"And I was, like, 'All the tributaries of the Mississippi River? No, I can't.' He goes, 'Well, what school did you go to?' 'Well, I went to Tennessee State.' 'Was that an accredited school? So, you got a degree?' I mean, that kind of thing. This is in-between the commercial breaks.\"",
      "\"Boy, that happened to me in Chicago,\" I said. \"Started in September, basically was taken off the late news in the spring.\"",
      "Maybe we share a few things. I was a shy kid from Indiana who started as a local reporter in Indianapolis, and wound up on national TV \u2013 and Oprah was watching. \"You were such an inspiration. I remember calling Gayle that morning, 'Oh my God.' It just, it was unbelievable.\"",
      "\"Well, that I inspired you!\"",
      "But Oprah famously went on to build her worldwide media empire, and a following that some world leaders can only dream of.",
      "I asked, \"You have such power. Now that you are this woman undeterred by weight \u2013 'weight noise' \u2013 what are you gonna do?\"",
      "\"That's a beautiful question, but I don't feel compelled to do anything,\" Oprah replied. \"I don't know what it means actually, other than I feel free.\"",
      "And what about her name being credibly bandied about for the presidency? \"No, it's not gonna happen,\" she said. \"What I really want to do is to continue to use who I am and what that represents as a force in the world, as a force for good, and to allow people to not let the noises of the world steal their joy.\"",
      "\"You are such a person of positivity!\"",
      "\"I am indeed,\" she agreed.",
      "For all of her astonishing success, it seems that Oprah is still always aware of how far she's come \u2013 how she became something so much bigger than television. \"I have to say, there's a wonderful poem by Countee Cullen called 'Yet Do I Marvel.' And I would have to say, yet do I marvel at that, myself,\" she said.",
      "\"Sometimes in the early spring, the frogs are in the pond, and I can open the door and I can hear the frogs out at night. And it sounds just like Mississippi, being on the porch in Mississippi. But the distance from Mississippi to Montecito cannot be measured. It just cannot be measured. And I marvel at, how did this happen? How did it happen that I was able to navigate the waters of racism and sexism and misogynism and all the things that we had to endure? Yet do I marvel!\"",
      "And marvelous, it is.",
      "I said, \"We have little bits of things in common, I'm happy to say. Little bits of things.\"",
      "\"Yes. A lot,\" Oprah said, \"because we were women of this business at a time when it was really tough to be in this business. And now it's become something else. It's become something completely new.\"",
      "\"But both. It was a time that was tough to be a woman in the beginning. But boy, was the timing good!\"",
      "\"Boy, was the timing good! We made the best of it. Yes, we did.\"",

      "The 2026 awards season kicked off Sunday night with the star-studded Golden Globes \u2014 a ceremony known for its lively atmosphere. The 83rd Golden Globes were hosted by comedian Nikki Glaser, who returned to helm the show for a second year in a row.",
      "\"Hamnet\" won Best Motion Picture - Drama, and \"One Battle After Another\" won Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical. (See a full list of this year's winners here.)",
      "Here are the highlights and memorable moments from the Golden Globes, from historic wins to powerful speeches.",
      "Nikki Glaser returns as host",
      "Glaser made history last year as the first woman to host the Golden Globes solo. This year, she took it upon herself to hand out an award for Best Editing to the Justice Department during her opening monologue, alluding to the redactions and delayed release of the Epstein files.",
      "\"I cannot believe the amount of star power we have in this room tonight. It's insane,\" Glaser said. \"There are so many A-listers, and by A-list I do mean 'a list that has been heavily redacted.' And the Golden Globe for best editing goes to the Justice Department. Yes. Congratulations.\"",
      "The comedian, who stole the show at 2024's \"The Roast of Tom Brady,\" also cracked jokes about Kevin Hart's height and Leonardo DiCaprio's girlfriends, and asked George Clooney to fix her Nespresso machine, poking fun at one of the actor's endorsement deals.",
      "Glaser closed out the night wearing a \"Spinal Tap\" hat and referencing several famous lines from the film directed by the late Rob Reiner.",
      "Teyana Taylor gets emotional",
      "Teyana Taylor got emotional as she accepted her award for her supporting role in \"One Battle After Another.\"",
      "\"To my Brown sisters and little Brown girls watching tonight, our softness is not a liability,\" she said. \"Our depth is not too much. Our light does not need permission to shine. We belong in every room we walk into. Our voices matter, and our dreams deserve space.\"",
      "Golden Globes get political",
      "Several stars attended Sunday's award show with pins protesting Immigration and Customs Enforcement. As she accepted the award for Best Actress in a Comedy Series for her role in \"Hacks,\" Jean Smart wore a \"BE GOOD\" pin in honor of Renee Good, the woman who was killed by an ICE agent last week in Minneapolis.",
      "\"Let's all do the right thing,\" Smart said. \"I think everybody in their hearts knows what the right thing is to do.\"",
      "Mark Ruffalo, Wanda Sykes and Natasha Lyonne also wore pins protesting ICE.",
      "Director Judd Apatow, while presenting an award, said \"I believe we're a dictatorship now,\" and then joked that he was still angrier about losing the Best Comedy award to Ridley Scott a decade ago.",
      "New award for best podcast",
      "For the first time, an award for best podcast was handed out. The nominees were: \"Armchair Expert,\" \"Call Her Daddy,\" \"Good Hang With Amy Poehler,\" \"The Mel Robbins Podcast,\" \"SmartLess\" and \"Up First.\"",
      "Amy Poehler took home the win.",
      "\"This is an attempt to try to make a very rough and unkind world filled with a little bit more love and laughter,\" Poehler said.",
      "She also praised her fellow nominees.",
      "\"I'm fans of all of you, except for NPR. Just a bunch of celebs phoning it in. So, try harder,\" Poehler joked.",
      "K-pop takes home a win",
      "Best original song went to \"Golden\" from \"KPop Demon Hunters.\" Ejae, who wrote the lyrics and provided the singing voice for the film's character Rumi, accepted the award. As a child, she'd trained for years in hopes of becoming a K-pop star, only to face rejection, she said.",
      "\"I leaned on songs and music to get through it,\" Ejae said. \"Now I'm here, as a singer and a songwriter. It's a dream come true to be part of a song that's helping other girls, other boys and everyone from all ages to get through their hardships and accept themselves.\"",
      "\"KPop Demon Hunters\" also won Best Animated Motion Picture and was nominated for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.",
      "\"I really wanted to depict female characters the way that we know women, which is really strong and bold, really silly and weird and really hungry for food, and sometimes a little thirsty,\" director Maggie Kang said after winning Best Animated Motion Picture.",
      "What did Snoop Dogg say?",
      "The sound dropped out for several seconds when Snoop Dogg, who was on stage to present the award for Best Podcast, said he was \"high as a motherf*****.\"",
      "Teyana Taylor and Erin Doherty were also briefly censored for cursing while accepting their awards.",
      "Wanda Sykes accepts award for Ricky Gervais",
      "Wanda Sykes, who was presenting the award for Best Stand-Up Comedy, said she hoped Gervais, who was not in attendance, would win.",
      "\"If you win, I get to accept the award on your behalf,\" she added. \"And you're gonna thank God \u2014 and the trans community.\"",
      "Gervais did win in the category, and Sykes followed through on her promise.",
      "Julia Roberts gets standing ovation",
      "Julia Roberts, who was nominated for, but didn't win, Best Actress in a Drama, received a standing ovation when she presented the award for Best Motion Picture \u2014 Musical or Comedy.",
      "\"I'm going to be impossible for at least a week,\" she said. \"I appreciate that.\"",
      "George Clooney and Don Cheadle, who came onstage to present the final award for the night, joked about the standing ovation, with Cheadle noting Clooney did not receive one.",
      "\"No, sit down, Mike, it's not nice. I don't take your pity,\" Clooney then said to someone in the audience.",

    "summary": "The star of \"The Gilded Age\" and \"The White Lotus\" has returned to Broadway in \"Bug,\" written by her playwright-actor husband. The two talk about their on- and off-stage partnership.",
    "story": [
      "Safe to say, after recent star turns in \"The Gilded Age\" and the monologue of the year about friendship in \"The White Lotus,\" Carrie Coon is having a moment.",
      "I asked her, \"Would you agree with me that where you used to say you're at the bottom of the A-List \u2026\"",
      "\"I think I used to say, 'The bottom of the B-List,' but yeah,\" she corrected.",
      "\"But don't we need to revise our assessment as where you are?\"",
      "\"Maybe,\" said Coon. \"But the thing that's changed for me is that I was on 'The White Lotus,' and now I can be in a Broadway play. That wasn't true for me five years ago.\"",
      "The play is \"Bug,\" which opened just this past week. Coon is leveraging her newfound star power to play the demanding, harrowing lead role in this examination of paranoia, conspiracy, and loneliness. And she is adamant that her success should not obscure a larger, sadder reality of the theater these days: \"We live in a country that is fundamentally unsupportive of the arts. So now, in order to do a play on Broadway, you have to do 'The White Lotus,' or else you're not allowed. They have to replace you with somebody more famous.\"",
      "\"Hang on, if you hadn't done 'White Lotus' and 'Gilded Age' and hadn't sort of blown up as a star \u2026\"",
      "\"Yeah. We wouldn't be sitting here, absolutely not,\" Coon said.",
      "\"Your acting ability, what you do on stage, not enough?\" I asked.",
      "\"No, that's not how we make those decisions anymore,\" she said. \"And you can ask all these extraordinary theater actors who don't do plays anymore because celebrities are doing plays. It's just a different world that we're living in now.\"",
      "Tracy Letts is the playwright of \"Bug.\" He's in love with Coon's fearlessness. \"She has ice water in her veins,\" he said. \"In another life, she'd make a great assassin.\"",
      "He's in love with her acting chops. \"She's a great stage actress,\" he said. \"For the people who've only seen her do 'Gilded Age' or 'White Lotus,' they just don't know what a stage animal she is.\"",
      "Letts is in love with her. He and Coon have been married for the last dozen years.",
      "I asked, \"Your partners, your life partners, they had to be theatre people, right? Because it's such a consuming world?\"",
      "\"I came to that conclusion a long time ago that, whoever my partner was had to be in the profession; civilians just don't get it,\" Letts laughed. \"They just don't get it. It's a hard life.\"",
      "A couple of Midwesterners (Coon is from Ohio, Letts from Oklahoma), they met in 2010 doing \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" at the Steppenwolf Theatre in Chicago. Letts said, \"We had a palpable attraction to each other. We just wanted to be with each other.\"",
      "Coon said, \"When we confessed to our director and our castmates that we were officially together, they were like, 'Yeah. Of course.' We thought it was shocking, this shocking revel \u2013 [and they're] like, 'Yeah, hello! We've been here the whole time.'\"",
      "When the show got to Broadway in 2013, Letts won a best actor Tony. That's some impressive artistic range, considering his Pulitzer Prize for writing the play \"August: Osage County\" in 2008, and his steady presence in film and TV for the last several decades, from \"Seinfeld\" and \"The Big Short\" to \"A House of Dynamite.\"",
      "He's been around a while. Coon noted, \"Tracy's entering into sort of this \u2026\"",
      "\"Oldness?\" Letts offered.",
      "Letts is now 60; Coon is 44.",
      "\"He always gave me room to grow, because I was not in the same place in my life as him,\" Coon said. \"Like, what you're sitting in contemplation of at this stage in your life is different than where I am in mine.\"",
      "So, how does that meld? \"Oh, a lotta jokes,\" said Coon. \"Like, 'Your second husband's gonna love this couch.'\"",
      "Whether playwright and actor, or husband and wife, what makes this partnership work, they told us, is honest feedback and mutual respect. Letts said, \"She knows I'm gonna tell her the truth. She'll put on a dress and say, 'How does this look?' And I'll say, 'It doesn't look good.'\"",
      "\"No, no, no, no\u2026.\" I said.",
      "\"It's true!\" Letts reiterated. \"And she appreciates it, because she knows I'm not lying to her.\"",
      "\"Isn't rule number one of husbanding, Not bad? Which we all know means\u2026 \"",
      "\"No. We don't do that,\" Letts said. \"So when she puts on something and I go, 'You look fantastic,' or when she's in this play and I say, 'My God, you're a great actress,' she knows I'm not bulls****ing her.\"",
      "Later, I asked Coon, \"If you have something to say, whether it's praise or criticism, you know it's the truth?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" she replied. \"Even with things I wear.\"",
      "Letts smiled. \"See?!\"",
      "While any couple might recognize that trust required to navigate life's challenges, Letts and Coon's \"moment\" is providing some uncommon tests. Take Coon landing the \"White Lotus\" role: \"I turned to Tracy and I said, 'There's no way I can go away to Thailand for six months.' We had a three-year-old and a six-year-old. And Tracy was the one who turned to me and he said, 'We're gonna figure this out.'",
      "\"Tracy was doing every morning. He was doing dinner and bedtime every night, and bath time by himself. So that was a really hard six months.\"",
      "\"I wasn't doing anything extraordinary; I was taking care of the kids while she was gone doing a job,\" he said.",
      "\"We know when the undeniable thing comes along, and we'll both make room for that to happen,\" Coon said.",
      "Which is why this chance to collaborate on Broadway is so important for them. The best way to handle a whirlwind is to find a place to anchor. For these two, that's always been the theater.",
      "\"This is where we're most comfortable,\" Letts said, \"in a rehearsal room preparing this on a stage, doing this in a theater. This is what we know. You just have a sense of accomplishment and gratification in the theater. You've told a story over the course of the night. You don't get to do that when you make a film or TV show.\"",
      "Carrie Coon and Tracy Letts are a couple now living in some of the culture's brightest lights.\u00a0 But they're theater people \u2013 bright lights don't faze them.\u00a0 \"I got my first credit card at 43,\" Letts laughed. \"It's a tough gig!\"",
      "Besides, they have work to do, the kind that's most affirming for them: Work they can do together.",
      "Letts said, \"I needed somebody who understood what it means to be an artist in America.\"",
      "\"And I needed somebody who reminded me that it was important to be an artist,\" Coon said, \"and that it was powerful, and necessary.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-art-of-anselm-kiefer-becoming-the-sea/",
    "published": "Sun, 11 Jan 2026 09:28:07 -0500",
    "summary": "One of the world's most prolific living artists is now the subject of a retrospective in St. Louis. He talks about how rivers cutting through America's Midwest, and a Beat Generation poet, inspired his three-story-tall abstract canvases.",
    "story": [
      "Even on a casual walk, German artist Anselm Kiefer is always searching for inspiration. \"Look at this tree,\" he said walking alongside the Mississippi River. \"This is a fantastic tree, you know?\"",
      "And here in St. Louis, Missouri, it's an American river that's fired his imagination. He said, \"This river goes through America, and so with this conscience I have an inner overview of America, of the continent, of the world.\"",
      "Kiefer has turned those reflections into a series of paintings, each three stories tall. They are now holding court at the Saint Louis Art Museum, home to an Anselm Kiefer retrospective. Dozens of Kiefer works are on display, but it's these monumental canvases that are the showstoppers.",
      "The paintings depict the Mississippi and Europe's Rhine River \u2013 waterways brimming with history, symbolizing the cycle of life. Kiefer said the inspiration for their name, \"Becoming the Sea,\" came from Beat Generation poet Gregory Corso: \"Spirit is life \u2026 like a river unafraid of becoming the sea.\"",
      "\"You know, a river is something special; a river dissolves itself in the sea,\" he said. \"And it's not afraid of this. As I am not afraid of my death, you know?\"",
      "Mortality is a common theme for Kiefer. Born in 1945 in Germany, he grew up in the ruins of World War II, and the aftermath of the Holocaust. It's a chapter many Germans tried to forget. \"You know, after the war, there was not so much knowledge about what happened,\" he said. \"The Germans, they put it underneath the carpet. Nobody spoke about [it].\"",
      "Kiefer spent his career breaking through that silence, like when, as a young art student, he photographed himself giving the Nazi salute, not as an endorsement, but as a reckoning.",
      "Asked about the role of the artist in society, he said, \"If the artist is in the world, like I am in the world, as I look what happens, then automatically you have a role.\"",
      "Over the decades, Kiefer continued to explore themes of memory and loss \u2013 mostly with abstract landscapes, and materials. As Kiefer showed \"Sunday Morning\" in 2018, at his studio outside of Paris, melted lead and fire are normal sightings in his work. So is a bit of chemistry, creating unexpected colors.",
      "Today, Kiefer is one of the most prolific living artists, at the peak of his career, with works selling for millions, and in museums around the world. It would be a proud moment for most, but Anselm Kiefer has always had his own way of seeing things.",
      "I asked him, \"So at 80, what are you most proud of in terms of the work you've done?\"",
      "\"You ask strange questions! I am not proud. I am disappointed!\" he laughed. \"I'm really disappointed. Because every morning I go in the studio and say, 'Oh, what I have done yesterday?' You know, and then I continue. I continue. Proud? No, no. I don't know this word for me, proud.\"",

    "summary": "Bob Weir wrote or co-wrote and sang lead vocals on Grateful Dead classics including \"Sugar Magnolia,\" \"One More Saturday Night\" and \"Mexicali Blues.\"",
    "story": [
      "Bob Weir, a founding member of the legendary rock band the Grateful Dead, has died at the age of 78, his family announced Saturday.",
      "\"It is with profound sadness that we share the passing of Bobby Weir,\" his family wrote in a post to his Instagram page. \"He transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could. Unfortunately, he succumbed to underlying lung issues.\"",
      "In the statement, the family disclosed that Weir had been diagnosed with cancer in July.",
      "\"As we remember Bobby, it's hard not to feel the echo of the way he lived,\" his family wrote. \"A man driftin' and dreamin', never worrying if the road would lead him home. A child of countless trees. A child of boundless seas.\"",
      "Weir formed the Grateful Dead with Jerry Garcia after the two met in 1963 as teens in Palo Alto, California. The band, with its unique mix of blues, folk and jazz, became a touring powerhouse for decades until Garcia's death in 1995.",
      "Weir wrote or co-wrote and sang lead vocals on Dead classics including \"Sugar Magnolia,\" \"One More Saturday Night\" and \"Mexicali Blues.\"",
      "The group eventually reformed a few years after Garcia's death and took many iterations over the years, the latest as Dead & Company.",
      "\"For over sixty years, Bobby took to the road,\" his family's statement said. \"A guitarist, vocalist, storyteller, and founding member of the Grateful Dead. Bobby will forever be a guiding force whose unique artistry reshaped American music. His work did more than fill rooms with music; it was warm sunlight that filled the soul, building a community, a language, and a feeling of family that generations of fans carry with them.\"",
      "Weir's death leaves drummer Bill Kreutzmann as the only surviving original member. Founding bassist Phil Lesh died in 2024. The band's other drummer, Mickey Hart, practically an original member since joining in 1967, is also alive at 82. The fifth founding member, Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan, died in 1973.",
      "Dead and Company played a series of concert's for the Grateful Dead's 60th anniversary in July at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.",
      "Born in San Francisco and raised in nearby Atherton, Weir was the Dead's youngest member and looked like a fresh-faced high-schooler in its early years. He was generally less shaggy than the rest of the band, but had a long beard like Garcia's in later years.",
      "The band would survive long past the hippie moment of its birth, with its ultra-devoted fans known as Deadheads often following them on the road in a virtually non-stop tour that persisted despite decades of music and culture shifting around them.",
      "\"Longevity was never a major concern of ours,\" Weir said when the Dead got the Grammys' Musicares Person of the Year honor last year. \"Spreading joy through the music was all we ever really had in mind and we got plenty of that done.\"",
      "Ubiquitous bumper stickers and T-shirts showed the band's skull logo, the dancing, colored bears that served as their other symbol, and signature phrases like \"ain't no time to hate\" and \"not all who wander are lost.\"",
      "The Dead won few actual Grammys during their career \u2014 they were always a little too esoteric \u2014 getting only a lifetime achievement award in 2007 and the best music film award in 2018.",
      "Just as rare were hit pop singles. \"Touch of Grey,\" the 1987 song that brought a big surge in the aging band's popularity, was their only Billboard Top 10 hit.",
      "But in 2024, they set a record for all artists with their 59th album in Billboard's Top 40. Forty-one of those came since 2012, thanks to the popularity of the series of archival albums compiled by David Lemieux.",
      "Their music \u2014 called acid rock at its inception \u2014 would pull in blues, jazz, country, folk and psychedelia in long improvisational jams at their concerts.",
      "\"I venture to say they are the great American band,\" TV personality and devoted Deadhead Andy Cohen said as host of the MusiCares event. \"What a wonder they are.\"",

    "story": [
      "Authorities in New Mexico issued an arrest warrant Friday for director and Emmy Award-winning actor Timothy Busfield to face a child sex abuse charge.",
      "An investigator with the Albuquerque Police Department filed a criminal complaint in support of the charge, which says a child reported that Busfield touched him inappropriately. The acts allegedly occurred on the set of \"The Cleaning Lady,\" a TV series that Busfield directed and acted in.",
      "The child said the first incident happened when he was 7 years old and Busfield touched him three or four times. Busfield allegedly touched him five or six times on another occasion when he was 8.",
      "The child's mother reported to Child Protective Services that the abuse occurred between November 2022 and spring 2024, the complaint said.",
      "Busfield's attorney and agent did not immediately respond to email messages seeking comment late Friday.",
      "The arrest warrant, which was signed by a judge, said the charge is for two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor.",
      "According to the complaint, the child, which it identifies only by his initials, has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. A social worker documented him saying he has had nightmares about Busfield touching him and woken up scared.",
      "The child was reportedly afraid to tell anyone because Busfield was the director and he feared he would get mad at him.",
      "The investigation began in November 2024, when the investigator responded to a call from a doctor at the University of New Mexico Hospital. The child's parents had gone there at the recommendation of a law firm, the complaint said.",
      "\"The Cleaning Lady\" aired for four seasons on Fox, ending in 2025. It starred Elodie Yung as a Cambodian doctor who comes to the United States to get medical treatment for her son, witnesses a mob killing and ends up becoming a cleaner for organized crime.",
      "The show was produced by Warner Bros., which according to the complaint conducted its own investigation into the abuse allegations but was unable to corroborate them.",
      "Busfield is known for appearances in \"The West Wing,\" \"Field of Dreams\" and \"Thirtysomething,\" the latter of which won him an Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series in 1991.",

      "A rare copy of the comic book that introduced the world to Superman \u2014 and was also once stolen from the home of actor Nicolas Cage \u2014 has been sold for a record $15 million.",
      "The private deal for \"Action Comics No. 1\" was announced Friday. It eclipses the previous record price for a comic book, set last November when a copy of \"Superman No. 1\u2033 was sold at auction for $9.12 million.",
      "The Action Comics sale was negotiated by Manhattan-based Metropolis Collectibles/Comic Connect, which said the comic book's owner and the buyer wished to remain anonymous.",
      "The comic \u2014 which sold for 10 cents when it came out in 1938 \u2014 was an anthology of tales about mostly now little-known characters. But over a few panels, it told the origin story of Superman's birth on a dying planet, his journey to Earth and his decision as an adult to \"turn his titanic strength into channels that would benefit mankind.\"",
      "Its publication marked the beginning of the superhero genre. About 100 copies of Action Comics No. 1 are known to exist, according to Metropolis Collectibles/Comic Connect President Vincent Zurzolo.",
      "\"This is among the Holy Grail of comic books. Without Superman and his popularity, there would be no Batman or other superhero comic book legends,\" Zurzolo said. \"Its importance in the comic book community shows with his deal, as it obliterates the previous record.\"",
      "The comic book was stolen from Cage's Los Angeles home in 2000, but was recovered in 2011 when it was found by a man who had purchased the contents of an old storage locker in Southern California. It eventually was returned to Cage, who had bought it in 1996 for $150,000. Six months after it was returned to him, he sold it at auction for $2.2 million.",
      "Stephen Fishler, CEO of Metropolis Collectibles/Comic Connect, said the theft eventually played a big role in boosting the comic's value.",
      "\"During that 11-year period (it was missing), it skyrocketed in value,\" Fishler said. \"The thief made Nicolas Cage a lot of money by stealing it.\"",
      "Fishler compared it to the theft of Mona Lisa, which was stolen from the Louvre museum in Paris in 1911.",
      "\"It was kept under the thief's bed for two years,\" Fishler noted. \"The recovery of the painting made the Mona Lisa go from being just a great Da Vinci painting to a world icon \u2014 and that's what Action No. 1 is \u2014 an icon of American pop culture.\"",

    "story": [
      "Far fewer Americans enrolled in an Affordable Care Act health care plan, new federal data shows, with millions facing higher premiums after tax subsidies under the insurance program expired in December",
      "According to figures\u00a0from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), 22.8 million people have signed up for ACA coverage for 2026 since open enrollment started on Nov. 1. That's down 1.4 million from the number of Americans\u00a0who had enrolled in Obamacare, as the health plans are known, a year ago.",
      "Nationally, around 800,000 fewer people have selected plans compared to a similar time last year, marking a 3.5% drop in total enrollment so far. That includes a decrease in both new consumers signing up for ACA plans and existing enrollees re-upping them.",
      "Open ACA enrollment in most states for February coverage ends on Jan. 15.",
      "The drop in enrollment comes as many ACA participants face sharply higher monthly premiums because of a December 31 lapse in tax credits that lowered households' monthly health plan costs. After months of debate and a\u00a06-week government shutdown, Congress has yet to extend the credits or settle on another remedy.",
      "The House last week approved legislation that could preserve the enhanced subsidies for another three years. The fate of the bill is now in the hands of the Republican-controlled Senate.",
      "Over 20 million Americans received the ACA subsidies last year. Health policy group KFF\u00a0estimates that they could see their premiums swell by an average of 114%, from around $888 in 2025 to $1,904 this year, unless the tax credits are extended.",
      "Experts have warned that the end of the subsidies could push more people to dump their coverage in the face of higher premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates 4 million people will eventually lose their insurance without an extension of the credits.",
      "Robert Kaestner, a health economist at the University of Chicago, said some ACA enrollees who drop the coverage may have other options, such as going on a partner's employer health plan or changing their income to qualify for Medicaid. Others are likely to\u00a0go without insurance while they look for alternatives.",
      "\"My prediction is 2 million more people will lack health insurance for a while,\" Kaestner told the Associated Press. \"That's a serious issue, but Republicans would argue we're using government money more efficiently, we're targeting people who really need it and we're saving $35 billion a year.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 12 Jan 2026 23:31:19 -0500",
    "summary": "The largest nurses strike ever in New York City is underway as thousands of NYSNA members walk off their jobs at major hospitals.",
    "story": [
      "The largest nurses strike in New York City history is underway after negotiators for five major hospitals and the state nurses union failed to agree\u00a0to a new contract by Monday's deadline.",
      "The New York State Nurses Association said\u00a0nearly 15,000 nurses are now walking off their jobs at five privately-run hospitals, including Mount Sinai Hospital, Mount Sinai Morningside, Mount Sinai West and NewYork-Presbyterian in Manhattan, and Montefiore Einstein in the Bronx.",
      "NYSNA said nurses at Mount Sinai started the strike at 6 a.m., while nurses at the remaining hospitals started picketing an hour later.",
      "Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency in anticipation of the strike amid worries it could jeopardize critical care for thousands of patients in the city.",
      "Montefiore said it was preparing for the strike to last multiple weeks.",
      "\"NYSNA's leaders continue to double down on their $3.6 billion in reckless demands, including nearly 40% wage increases, and their troubling proposals like demanding that a nurse not be terminated if found to be compromised by drugs or alcohol while on the job. We remain resolute in our commitment to providing safe and seamless care, regardless of how long the strike may last,\" Montefiore Senior Vice President Joe Solmonese said.",
      "A Mount Sinai spokesperson said, \"Unfortunately, NYSNA decided to move forward with its strike while refusing to move on from its extreme economic demands, which we cannot agree to, but we are ready with 1,400 qualified and specialized nurses -- and prepared to continue to provide safe patient care for as long as this strike lasts.\"",
      "Some nurses, however, did report to work despite the strike. Mount Sinai said 20% showed up on Monday.",
      "A statement from NewYork-Presbyterian said, \"While NYSNA has told nurses to walk away from the bedside, we remain focused on our patients and their care. This strike is designed to create disruption, but we have taken the necessary steps so our patients continue to receive the care they trust us to provide ... We're ready to keep negotiating a fair and reasonable contract that reflects our respect for our nurses and the critical role they play, and also recognizes the challenging realities of today's healthcare environment...We have proposed significant wage increases that keep our nurses among the highest paid in the city, enhancements to their outstanding employer-funded benefits and new measures that reflect our shared commitment to safe staffing and workplace safety. However, good faith bargaining requires compromise from both sides.\"",
      "Mamdani joins picket line",
      "New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani joined picketers outside NewYork-Presbyterian in Washington Heights.",
      "\"In every one of our city's darkest periods, nurses showed up to work. Their value is not negotiable and there worth is not up for debate,\" Mamdani said. \"They show up and all they are asking for in return is dignity, respect and the fair pay and treatment that they deserve. They should settle for nothing less.\"",
      "Mamdani released a similar statement the night before the strike on X.",
      "\"This city can and must ensure the continuity of care. FDNY, Emergency Management, the public health system and all of my senior leadership are working tirelessly to ensure nurses' demands for dignity can be heard and care is still received,\" the mayor said.",
      "Mamdani urged both sides to meet at the bargaining table.",
      "\"They must bargain in good faith and they must arrive at a deal that is satisfactory to all, that allows the nurses who work in this city to live in this city,\" he said.",
      "Hochul also said she wants a deal made as soon as possible.",
      "Why are nurses on strike?",
      "Both sides bargained\u00a0throughout the weekend, but were unable to reach a deal.",
      "NYSNA has accused Montefiore, Mount Sinai and NewYork-Presbyterian  of putting profits over safe patient care. The union said the wealthiest hospital systems in the city are refusing to compromise on issues like pay raises, safe staffing levels, full health care coverage, pensions, and workplace protections against violence.",
      "\"Health care workers are being stretched to their limits, and as workplace violence in hospitals is on the rise, nurses are asking simply for the basics,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said at the news conference with Mamdani.",
      "Cecilia Barreto, a registered nurse picketing outside Mount Sinai West, said striking was a last resort.",
      "\"I have been here two years and I've made such great bonds with the nurses here, and I know that there are nurses who have battled cancer and depend on their health care. So we need to make sure that the health care we receive stays intact because their lives depend on it,\" Barreto said.",
      "\"Instead of guaranteeing health care for nurses, these wealthy hospitals are pushing to cut health benefits for nurses who put their own health on the line to care for New Yorkers,\" Nancy Hagans, president of NYSNA, said on Saturday.",
      "An earlier statement from Montefiore called some of the demands \"reckless and irresponsible.\" All of the hospitals impacted called the strike \"reckless\" in a joint statement, accusing the nurses of abandoning patients.",
      "\"NYSNA leadership has chosen to abandon patients in their time of need, but Montefiore Medical Center, Mount Sinai, and NewYork-Presbyterian will not. Their decision to walk out on our patients can only be described as reckless,\" the hospitals said.",
      "Some hospitals in the area were able to\u00a0reach a deal\u00a0with NYSNA, including all of Northwell Health facilities in Nassau County, while others previously pulled back their\u00a0strike notices.",
      "What the strike means for patients",
      "Gov. Hochul last week signed executive orders to ensure the state Department of Health has staff at the impacted hospitals for the duration of the New York City nurses strike, ensuring patient safety and continuity of care.",
      "Montefiore said that emergency rooms will remain open.",
      "Hospital officials said no one should delay treatment or put off appointments, but patients should be alert for any direct updates from their health care providers.",
      "NYSNA also said patients should continue to seek care, with leaders at a news conference Sunday saying going to get care is not crossing a strike line.",
      "The bottom line for patients is that the hospitals will remain open and care will continue during the strike.",
      "Some family members of patients are concerned as the strike continues on Monday night.",
      "Nurses can't pick up prescriptions at Montefiore Hospital",
      "A video shows one nurse being denied access to the Montefiore Weiler Hospital while trying to pick up prescriptions.",
      "The nurse said employees' health insurance is through Montefiore, and they can only pick up medications from a Montefiore pharmacy.",
      "\"Additionally, many nurses live in the Bronx, and their families get their care from Montefiore. If their family goes to the ER or is admitted, they're saying we can't go visit them,\" the nurse said in a statement.",
      "The woman in the video tells the security guard she is contracted to receive medications only through this pharmacy.",
      "The guard says they should've made arrangements to pick up the medication before, as they knew the strike was happening on Monday.",
      "A Montefiore spokesperson said nurses who are on strike can request their prescriptions be delivered directly to their homes.",
      "\"NYSNA nurses are able to attend any medical appointments scheduled at the medical center during the strike, as well as visit any family members who are inpatients, as long as they can provide proper documentation,\" a statement read.",

    "published": "Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:28:09 -0500",
    "summary": "After the ACA tax credit lapsed in December, enrollees are opting for less robust health plans or dropping coverage altogether.",
    "story": [
      "When Kassidy Hooter learned in December how much her health insurance costs were going to rise this year, she went into panic mode.",
      "The Shreveport, Louisiana, resident and mother of three knew she urgently needed care \u2014 Hooter is in the final trimester of a high-risk pregnancy. But the family could no longer afford their Affordable Care Act plan coverage now that a federal tax subsidy was lapsing on Dec. 31, 2025, meaning they would face thousands of dollars in additional out-of-pocket costs.",
      "\"We heavily considered that it might just be cheaper to give birth at home,\" Hooter, 24, told CBS News. \"Just because that's an insane amount of debt to take on.\"",
      "In the end, Hooter decided to forgo insurance altogether.",
      "A local medical center offered three months of financial aid that will carry her through her due date in February and into late March. After that, she will have to bear any medical expenses on her own. Her plan now is to get her newborn on Medicaid, a government health plan for low-income Americans, as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I'm just hoping for the best,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Health insurance as \"luxury\"",
      "Since its introduction in 2010, the ACA has been instrumental in cutting the share of uninsured Americans from approximately 15% to 8%, according to Nima Sheth, vice president of health justice at the National Partnership for Women and Families, a nonprofit advocacy group.",
      "However, the number of people without health insurance is likely to surge if Congress fails to come up with a solution for the 22 million Americans who received an ACA tax credit, experts warn. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates\u00a0that millions of people will lose coverage unless the subsidies are extended.",
      "Americans in most states have until Jan. 15 to enroll in an ACA marketplace plan, according to healthinsurance.org.",
      "Without the tax credits, premiums for ACA enrollees who previously relied on the subsidies will increase by an average of 114%, estimates\u00a0KFF, a nonprofit provider of health policy news and research.",
      "\"What we're seeing here is a policy choice \u2014 is, in effect, turning insurance into a luxury item and medical debt into the default,\" Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "The House of Representatives on Thursday\u00a0approved a three-year extension\u00a0of the expired ACA tax credits. The legislation faces an uphill climb in the Republican-led Senate, although lawmakers think it could provide a starting point for a compromise that would keep the credits alive in some form.",
      "The CBO estimates\u00a0that the House bill would increase the deficit by around $81 billion from 2026 to 2035. At the same time, the measure would boost the number of people with health insurance, a CBO spokesperson told CBS News.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me\"",
      "Plantation, Florida, resident Stacy Kanas, whose family also received an ACA tax credit, is now considering going without health insurance after realizing that her monthly premium to cover her and her husband would rise to $2,500 \u2014 more than double what she was paying last year to cover both of them plus her 20-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me,\" Kanas, 59, told CBS News. \"My husband had a major surgery about five years ago, and we don't want to be uninsured.\"",
      "Although in decent health, the small business owner worries about what could happen if someone in her family falls seriously ill. \"You're one catastrophic event away from perhaps having a financial disaster,\" she said.",
      "Even people who keep their ACA coverage could end up skipping out on care to avoid out-of-pocket expenses, experts said.",
      "\"If you're underinsured and you have high deductibles, the coverage that you're getting is designed to dissuade getting care, including preventative care, so you're going to delay your care until there are emergencies,\" Sternthal said.",
      "Robert Myers, a consultant based outside of St. Louis, Missouri, was on a silver ACA plan last year, but switched to a bronze plan after learning his premiums would rise to $400 a month, up from $17 in 2025.",
      "Under his new plan, the 31-year-old does not have a monthly premium. However, Myers could owe much more in out-of-pocket costs due to $80 co-pays and an $8,000 deductible. As a result, he's planning on scaling back on doctor's visits, a trend experts say ends up driving more people to the emergency room for care.",
      "\"They'll kind of go to the ER and get what they need fixed with a band aid, and then not get long-term care,\" Sheth said.",
      "This can have wider ripple effects because an increase in uncompensated hospital care can drive up costs for other patients, as facilities seek to recoup the costs, according to Sternthal, who supports an extension of the ACA tax credits.",
      "\"Every delay locks families into decisions that harm their health and their financial stability, but then also reverberates out into the business community, the local community,\" she said.",

No New Yorker should have to fear losing access to health care -- and no nurse should be asked to accept less pay, fewer benefits or less dignity for doing lifesaving work.\"",
      "Key issues for the union",

      "Enough Shame and Blame",
      "My patient Alice began experiencing self-blame in childhood. Her well-intentioned mom put her on diets when she was in her early teens. Even before that, she had started to develop what she eventually called the \"self-hatred voice.\" She vividly remembers when she was ten years old, sitting in the front yard with her legs bent, seeing the inside curvature of her leg and wanting it to be smaller. \"This is the line where your muscle is, and on the inside is a curve. That's the fat and the extra skin. I thought, 'Oh, if I could just cut that off, then my leg would be perfect.' I had a pen, and I drew the line where I thought my legs should be and where the fat should be cut off. I just knew that I was larger than I wanted to be.\" Alice lived in Vermont at the time, and her mother had a garden where she grew all sorts of vegetables\u2014lettuce, carrots, cucumbers. \"I just remember eating salad, so much salad!\" Alice recalls. At thirteen, she sat at the table, thinking, \"Here's a plate with three pieces of lettuce and a carrot,\" and wondering how she was going to get through basketball practice or soccer without passing out or blowing the game for her teammates.",
      "A few years later, her mother put herself and Alice on a no-carb diet. \"Atkins was kinda big,\" Alice says. Her father and two younger brothers were exempt; it was only for the girls of the family. Which basically meant Alice and her mother were still eating everything from the garden, except no turnips, because turnips had \"too many carbs.\"",
      "After three days, Alice revolted. She reached for some crackers in the cupboard: \"Mom, I just ate an entire sleeve of saltines!\" Hearing this, her mother was not upset with her. Alice shared, \"She was desperate for carbs, too, and ate three saltines herself. And then dutifully returned to her no-carb diet.\"",
      "At sixteen, Alice started tracking her weight for sports. The self-hatred voice in her mind began to be very specific and explicit. \"The cupcake you just ate\u2014what is the number of calories in it? What is the number of carbs?\" She described that it wouldn't let up, not even for just one tiny-teeny bite. It was unrelenting.",
      "Fast-forward more than thirty years, and by the time Alice was nearly fifty, she had tried every diet and workout program under the sun: forty-seven of them, to be exact.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/state-of-denial-how-insurance-companies-impact-health-care-today/",
    "published": "Sun, 11 Jan 2026 09:19:39 -0500",
    "summary": "As millions of Americans struggle with paying for health care, doctors and health experts discuss how medical care is being eroded by insurers denying necessary tests and treatment, making it \"more difficult to be healthy in the United States.\"",
    "story": [
      "Traci Hurley says watching her husband battle cancer in late 2021 was harrowing. \"It was heartbreaking, and it was awful,\" she said. \"I lived in fear every day.\"",
      "A battle made worse, she says, because so many of the skirmishes were with their insurance company. \"No family should have to go through having to fight to get treatment recommended by their physician covered, while fighting for their lives,\" she said.",
      "Millions of Americans say they are struggling to get medical care: either unable to pay sky-high deductibles, or, like Dan Hurley, denied coverage for tests and treatment by health insurance companies. Not only were both the Hurleys doctors; Dan, an ear, nose and throat surgeon, was also skilled in cutting through insurance red tape for his patients.",
      "\"And yet, we still ran into issues a lot,\" Traci said. \"If we, as two physicians, had to struggle the amount that we had to struggle to get care approved, what about people who do not have medical knowledge? What's happening to them every day?\"",
      "Dan was an avid hiker, until a nagging backache turned out to be cancer. He was diagnosed with chondrosarcoma, an ultra-rare bone tumor. To try to save his life, the tumor, along with Dan's hip, had to be removed. Insurance only covered a portion of the costs.",
      "Traci said, \"Many of his treatments were denied. We had PET scans, we had CT scans denied. We had chemotherapy, we had radiation, we had certain medications that required prior-authorization, and were denied.\"",
      "The basis for the insurers' denials, Traci said, was that they were \"not medically indicated.\"",
      "\"Make their lives as difficult as possible\"",
      "Ron Howrigon, now a consultant, spent two decades working for health insurance companies. \"Health insurance companies know that five percent of their members account for 50 percent of all the costs,\" he said. \"So, I have this huge financial incentive to make their lives as difficult as possible.\"",
      "Howrigon says the business model is unlike other industries: \"The more your customers use your product, the less money you make. Your incentive is to keep them from using your product.\"",
      "How often do insurance companies refuse to cover the cost of medical treatments? It's hard to tell; health insurance companies are only required to report denial data for plans purchased through healthcare.gov.",
      "A CBS News analysis of about 1.3 billion federal health insurance claims across three years shows that, in 2024, insurers denied 19% of in-network claims \u2013 about 1 in 5.",
      "But for the biggest insurer, United Healthcare, that was a steep drop from the preceding two years, when it denied as many as one-third of its federal claims.",
      "While it did not provide data to support it, United Healthcare says that, across all its plans, their initial denial rate is 10%. They also point out that when employers are self-insured, the plans they choose for their employees dictate coverage decisions.",
      "\"About 165 million Americans are enrolled in employer-sponsored health care plans, and 65% of them are enrolled in what's called a self-insured plan,\" United said in their statement. \"The health insurance company they select provides administrative services such as handling calls from members and paying claims. But as the phrase 'self-insured' suggests, it's the employer's funds that cover claims payments. \u2026",
      "\"Self-insured employers can design their health plans and determine what will and won't be covered for their employees,\" United continued. \"It's important to remember that your health insurer probably isn't the one that designed it that way. Your employer did.\"",
      "\"Insurance is out of control\"",
      "Dr. Elisabeth Potter, a surgeon who sees as many as 60 patients with breast cancer each week at her RedBud surgery center in Austin, Texas, said, \"The insurance companies have, honestly, made it more difficult to be healthy in the United States.\"",
      "She says insurance denials actually add to costs: \"I have two employees who spend almost all day navigating insurance. It seems that everywhere we turn, there's an issue, whether it's an insurance company saying, 'You know, we won't cover your surgery at that surgery center,' or 'We won't pay for that medication, we want you to be on a different medication.'\"",
      "Case in point: On an early morning this past Fall, Jeannie Lee, a 40-year-old mother with breast cancer, was being prepped for a procedure \u2013 a lymphovenous bypass \u2013 that could have been done two weeks earlier during her double mastectomy, but both her and her husband's insurance companies refused to cover the cost.",
      "Lee is at high risk for developing a condition known as lymphedema where, Potter said, \"It becomes very difficult to just use your arm. It can be painful. It's swollen. It's also deforming.\"",
      "Lee said, \"I'm 40 years old. I have three young kids. It's very necessary to do this procedure.\"",
      "Once Lee was able to obtain financial assistance through a new non-profit set up by Dr. Potter, she was back in surgery. \"This patient is having an extra surgery, a separate general anesthetic, because her insurance company wouldn't cover the surgery,\" Potter said. \"We could have done this very easily at the same time [as her mastectomy ].\"",
      "When she isn't in surgery, Potter is often on the phone defending her treatment decisions to insurance company medical directors who, she says, often know little about her area of medicine. \"Sometimes I get, you know, an ophthalmologist, an eye doctor. It was just completely absurd,\" she said.",
      "She sometimes posts her side of those conversations online.",
      "Potter: \"So, we're speaking about lymphedema of the arm. So, this is not an area that you're familiar with, correct?\"",
      "But a video she posted in early January 2025, she says, ended up putting her entire medical practice at risk. While she was in the operating room, Potter says she got a call from United Healthcare. That \"urgent\" call, she says, was to question why her patient needed an overnight stay in the hospital.",
      "\"It's never happened before. I didn't know what was going on, but they said it was urgent and I needed to call, and so I did,\" she said. \"I am operating. I'm doing the right thing for the patient. I'm going to keep her overnight. I walked out of the hospital and I just filmed myself in my unfiltered, you know, moment.\"",
      "Potter: \"It's out of control. Insurance is out of control.\"",
      "Shortly after she posted that video, she got a letter from the insurance company threatening to sue her for defamation. \"I'm taking great care of patients. They're just trying to scare me into being quiet,\" Potter told us.",
      "I asked, \"And weren't you scared?\"",
      "\"I was scared,\" she replied.",
      "United Healthcare has not taken Dr. Potter to court. They declined an on-camera interview, but a company spokesperson says the call was due to an erroneous order, and a doctor would never be asked to leave surgery for a call about an insurance matter.",
      "\"It was such a gut punch\"",
      "Miranda Yaver, an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh, says insurance companies know that only a small percentage of people will actually appeal claim denials.",
      "\"All of us are vulnerable to being denied,\" she said. \"Not all of us can weather the storms easily when it comes to appealing and overcoming these barriers.\"",
      "Yaver calls it \"rationing by inconvenience.\"",
      "\"A lot of people don't know that they even can appeal,\" Yaver said.",
      "I asked, \"You're saying that it's not really the denial that ends up keeping people from getting care, it's that people give up? \"",
      "\"Fewer than one percent of those in-network claim denials result in appeal, even though people were winning roughly half the time,\" Yaver said.",
      "Clearly, it does pay to appeal, but some patients, like Dr. Dan Hurley, fighting an aggressive cancer, run out of time. Much of his last months were spent, says his wife Traci, on the phone with insurance company personnel: \"He would go line by line with them and they'd say, 'Okay, yeah, we need to get a supervisor involved. We'll call you back.' And then they don't.\"",
      "Dan's goal, she says, was to see insurance companies held to a standard similar to doctors, making them liable for malpractice when they deny lifesaving care. \"The act of signing that denial is practicing medicine,\" Traci said, \"the same way, if a patient came to me and I made a decision about treatment and that decision went sideways, I'm liable. That's how it works.\"",
      "Dan Hurley died on August 3, 2023. One week later, his wife got a letter from the insurance company asking her to pay $80,000 for a round of chemotherapy that had been pre-authorized, but was suddenly retroactively denied. \"It was such a gut punch to get it that day,\" she said. \"This is unbelievable, right? Almost laughable.\"",
      "Dan Hurley's battle has become his widow's. \"There's a part of me that says, 'Oh, he would be so proud of me,' but there's also part of me that he'd be like, 'Come on, chop, chop, you got this, let's go, pick it up, don't be sad, you know, keep going.' Because that's what he was like.\"",

    "story": [
      "Financial technology company Bilt, whose credit cards offer customer rewards for rent and mortgage payments, introduced three new credit cards on Wednesday that cap interest rates at 10% for one year.",
      "The offer, which will only apply to new purchases, comes after President Trump this week floated\u00a0a 10% ceiling on the interest rates\u00a0credit card issuers charge customers. The proposal drew immediate pushback from Citi, JP Morgan Chase and other major banks, which say it would result in some consumers losing access to credit and hurt the U.S. economy.",
      "By contrast, New York-based Bilt pounced on the opportunity to promote its cards as financial products that can help Americans facing an affordability crunch.",
      "\"This is a win for renters. This is a win for homeowners. This is a win for Americans,\" Ankur Jain, founder and CEO of Bilt, said in a statement.",
      "The privately held startup, which launched in 2019 and is now valued at more than $10 billion, partners with landlords to let cardholders earn rewards on routine transactions, like rent payments.",
      "Jain said the new credit cards are designed to meet the \"bipartisan call for a solution\" to the cost-of-living crisis facing many Americans, the Associated Press reported. If the U.S. imposes an interest rate cap, \"We'd rather be at the forefront,\" he said.",
      "Built is offering three credit card tiers capped at a 10% APR rate for 12 months. The Bilt Palladium Card, which comes with a $495 annual fee, gives members $400 in annual credits redeemable for hotel stays, plus $200 worth of Bilt Cash, which are points that can be redeemed within the Bilt ecosystem, including at businesses it's partnered with.",
      "The second-tier card, the Bilt Obsidian Card, lets users accrue rewards on restaurant and grocery charges, and comes with a $95 annual fee. The bottom-tier card has no annual fee, and offers cash back and points on some purchases.",
      "The average credit card APR is around\u00a024%, according to LendingTree, while people with poor credit can pay rates of up to 36%.\u00a0Research from Vanderbilt University shows that Mr. Trump's proposal would save consumers \u2014 and cost credit issuers \u2014 $100 billion.",

    "story": [
      "A coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups is calling on Google and Apple to remove access to social media platform X and its AI app, Grok, from their app stores after Grok allowed users to generate sexualized images of minors and women.",
      "The organizations, which focus on child safety, women's rights and privacy, expressed their concerns in\u00a0letters\u00a0on Wednesday to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, claiming that Grok's content violates the technology companies' policies.",
      "\"We demand that Google leadership urgently remove Grok and X from the Play Store to prevent further abuse and criminal activity,\" the groups said, using the same language in its letter to Apple.",
      "Apple and Google didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "Elon Musk, who owns X and xAI, the company that developed Grok,\u00a0said\u00a0in a social media post on Wednesday that he is \"not aware of naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.\" He also said the chatbot declines prompts to generate illegal images.",
      "\"There may be times when adversarial hacking of Grok prompts does something unexpected. If that happens, we fix the bug immediately,\" he wrote.",
      "Criticism of Grok escalated in early January after the generative-AI app enabled users to create images of minors wearing minimal clothing. In response to a user prompt, Grok acknowledged lapses in its digital safeguards.",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, told CBS News earlier this month that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok. In a December\u00a0analysis, the group estimated the chatbot was creating \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which seeks to eliminate child sexual abuse from the internet, has also raised concerns about Grok and other AI tools.",
      "\"We are extremely concerned about the ease and speed with which people can apparently generate photo-realistic child sexual abuse material.\" Ngaire Alexander, head of hotline at IWF, told CBS News in a statement last week. \"Tools like Grok now risk bringing sexual AI imagery of children into the mainstream.\"",
      "Grok told users last week on X that access to its image generation tool was now available only to paying subscribers.",
      "California opens probe",
      "Grok is also attracting scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and authorities overseas. On Wednesday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta\u00a0announced he was opening an investigation into the sexually explicit material produced using Grok.",
      "\"The avalanche of reports detailing the non-consensual, sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online in recent weeks is shocking,\" Bonta said. \"This material, which depicts women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations, has been used to harass people across the internet. I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 14 Jan 2026 14:19:53 -0500",
    "summary": "The venerable retailer is seeking protection from its creditors after its $2.65 billion purchase of Nieman Marcus failed to spark growth.",
    "story": [
      "Saks Global filed for bankruptcy protection late Tuesday, according to court documents entered in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston, throwing the future of the roughly century-old high-end department store chain into doubt. Saks Global is the parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman.",
      "Saks also said it had secured a $1.75 billion financing package and that it would keep its stores open as the bankruptcy procedure plays out.",
      "Saks recently missed a debt payment stemming from a 2024 deal by its parent company, Hudson's Bay Company, to buy\u00a0rival luxury retailer Neiman Marcus\u00a0for $2.65 billion, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0in late December, citing people familiar with the matter.",
      "Swamped by debt",
      "Hudson's Bay raised $2 billion in debt to complete the Nieman Marcus deal, while Apollo Global Management affiliates provided an additional $1.5 billion in financing. Amazon also took a minority stake in Saks to facilitate the deal.",
      "\"The debt-fueled acquisition of Neiman Marcus always made bankruptcy a likely destination for Saks Global,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of market research firm GlobalData. \"The only real surprise has been the speed of the collapse, which has come barely a year after the deal closed.\"",
      "Saks also missed a more than $100 million interest payment to bondholders, according to the Journal, which said the retailer has fallen behind on payments to vendors. Some suppliers have responded by withholding shipments, leaving Saks with thinner merchandise offerings.",
      "\"The truth is that Saks Global put itself in a financially precarious position that undermined the day-to-day operations of the business. A lack of cash meant suppliers went unpaid. This created inventory gaps which then drove customers away and caused revenue and cash generation to plummet,\" Saunders added.",
      "New York-based Saks launched in 1924, opening its first store in Manhattan, according to a historical account of the company posted on its website. The company expanded quickly between the 1970s and 1990s before it was purchased by Hudson's Bay in 2013. Saks's brands include luxury retailer Bergdorf Goodman, which was acquired as part of the deal for Neiman Marcus; retailer Saks Off 5th, and home furnishings seller Horchow.",
      "8,100 store closures",
      "Saks appointed former Neiman Marcus CEO Geoffroy van Raemdonck as its new CEO, effective immediately. He succeeds Richard Baker, who stepped down from his role as Saks executive chairman and CEO on Jan. 13. Saks had announced\u00a0on Jan. 2 that Baker would succeed CEO Marc Metrick as chief executive.",
      "\"If there is one positive from the bankruptcy, it's that the previous management team has been cleared out,\" Saunders said. They bear responsibility for the mess, and their reputation with vendors and associates at the firm is thoroughly tarnished.\"",
      "Tim Hynes, global head of credit research at Debtwire, said van Raemdonck is well-suited for his new role, having previously served as CEO of Neiman Marcus, which he led through bankruptcy.",
      "\"He has a background in turning situations around, and he is familiar with Neiman Marcus, so he is a better fit,\" Hynes told CBS News.",
      "Brick-and-mortar retailers face ongoing competitive challenges from e-commerce giants like Amazon and \"fast-fashion\" sellers such as H&M and Uniqlo. More than 8,100 stores closed across the U.S. in 2025, up roughly 12% from the previous year, according to retail industry analytics firm Coresight Research.",
      "\"In general, brick-and-mortar retailers are not growing, so store closures would be somewhat positive for anybody that competes with Saks,\" Hynes said.",
      "What does this mean for shoppers?",
      "Saks Global is reorganizing, not liquidating, so its brands will remain in business for now. But analysts expect Saks to close some stores to save money on costly leases. The fate of the retailer's Fifth Avenue store remains unclear.",
      "When Saks missed payments to vendors, some brands stopped shipping new inventory, leaving its store shelves thinly stocked.",
      "\"Since Saks put in place a widely panned vendor payment plan, many vendors reduced, and as the year went on, stopped shipments to Saks,\" mergers and acquisitions attorney Jonathan Lazarow told CBS News.",
      "Shoppers can now expect the retailer to start receiving new inventory again, now that it has secured a bankruptcy loan and can resume payments to vendors.",

      "A new lawsuit filed against OpenAI alleges that its ChatGPT artificial intelligence app encouraged a 40-year-old Colorado man to commit suicide.",
      "The complaint filed in California state court by Stephanie Gray, the mother of Austin Gordon, accuses OpenAI and CEO Sam Altman of building a defective and dangerous product that led to Gordon's death.",
      "Gordon, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in November 2025, had intimate exchanges with ChatGPT, according to the suit, which also alleged that the generative AI tool romanticized death.",
      "\"ChatGPT turned from Austin's super-powered resource to a friend and confidante, to an unlicensed therapist, and in late 2025, to a frighteningly effective suicide coach,\" the complaint alleged.",
      "The lawsuit comes amid scrutiny over the AI chatbot's effect on mental health, with OpenAI also facing\u00a0other lawsuits alleging that ChatGPT played a role in encouraging people to take their own lives.",
      "Gray is seeking damages for her son's death.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, an OpenAI spokesperson called Gordon's death a \"very tragic situation\" and said the company is reviewing the filings to understand the details.",
      "\"We have continued to improve ChatGPT's training to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support,\" the spokesperson said. \"We have also continued to strengthen ChatGPT's responses in sensitive moments, working closely with mental health clinicians.\"",
      "\"Suicide lullaby\"",
      "According to Gray's suit, shortly before Gordon's death, ChatGPT allegedly said in one exchange, \"[W]hen you're ready... you go. No pain. No mind. No need to keep going. Just... done.\"",
      "ChatGPT \"convinced Austin \u2014 a personwho had already told ChaiGPT that he was sad, and who had discussed mental health struggles in detail with it \u2014 that choosing to live was not the right choice to make,\" according to the complaint. \"It went on and on, describing the end of existence as a peaceful and beautiful place, and reassuring him that he should not be afraid.\"",
      "ChatGPT also effectively turned his favorite childhood book, Margaret Wise Brown's \"Goodnight Moon,\" into what the lawsuit refers to as a \"suicide lullaby.\" Three days after that exchange ended in late October 2025, law enforcement found Gordon's body alongside a copy of the book, the complaint alleges.",
      "The lawsuit accuses OpenAI of designing ChatGPT 4, the version of the app Gordon was using at the time of his death, in a way that fosters people's \"unhealthy dependencies\" on the tool.",

That remains significantly above the 2.7% for all goods, according to the latest Consumer Price Index\u00a0data. On a monthly basis, food prices rose 0.7% last month \u2014 the largest jump since September 2022.",

      "CPI tracks the rate at which prices rise over time. But consumers' perception of food costs is more likely to be influenced by the prices they see on the store shelves. People pay for groceries on a more regular basis than other expenses, with a trip to the supermarket a frequent reminder that food is pricier than it used to be, said David Ortega, a professor and food economist at Michigan State University.",
      "\"We come into contact with food prices much more than we do other prices in the economy,\" he told CBS News.",
      "The rise in food prices in Tuesday's CPI reading is being driven by certain food categories like\u00a0beef and coffee, which have hit record highs, according to Ortega.\u00a0CBS News' price tracker shows that overall food prices have jumped nearly 19% since January 2022.",

      "Asked why the U.S. seems to be unable to compete with China in terms of making affordable electric vehicles, Barra said, \"I believe at GM we are.\"",
      "She said U.S. safety standards and other regulatory requirements are higher than they are in China and that China's auto industry is \"heavily subsidized.\"",
      "\"I think we can compete and have a better vehicle, and I think we're doing that,\" she said.",
      "But the cost of a new vehicle has continued to rise in recent years, and the Trump administration's aggressive tariff policy has also added to that, Barra said.",
      "\"It had a few-billion-dollar impact last year,\" she said of those tariffs. But, she noted, it led to GM making changes, including bringing more production to the U.S., and praised the administration for making \"the playing field...a bit more level\" for U.S. manufacturers.",
      "\"We worked with the administration and they took the time to understand our industry to make sure there wasn't unintended consequences so that we could still compete with some of the vehicles coming from other countries,\" Barra said. \"I think it was a shift that we're working through to get back. But I think '26 will be an even better year than '25, and I think the playing field is a bit more level than it was just, you know, 18 months ago.\"",
      "But consumer sentiment in the U.S. remains pessimistic, polling has shown, and the auto industry is often seen as a bellwether for the larger economy. Barra, however, said of a shaky year for GM and the economy, \"we really aren't seeing it.\"",
      "\"We think the market's gonna be about the same as it was last year,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Barra touted the \"tremendous number of vehicles\" that GM makes in the U.S., and when asked what it truly means for something to be \"American-made\" \u2014 considering many of the parts are often sourced from overseas \u2014 she said \"it starts with where the vehicle is designed. Where all the engineering is done.\"",
      "Barra said more than half of GM's vehicles are assembled in the U.S. and that a majority of the components are sourced from America. She also said GM is continuing its efforts to fill job positions in the U.S.",
      "\"One of the things we do is we work with the military, and as people are ending their service to our country, putting them in a training program so they can then work in our dealerships,\" Barra said. She also said GM has a \"very robust apprenticeship program\" for its factory workers.",
      "Asked about concerns workers may have about automation, Barry said GM has been using robotic assistance to help build its vehicles for decades.",
      "\"We focus on jobs that are either repetitive and maybe have ergonomic issues, so people get hurt doing them, so we focus on safety and we focus on ergonomics,\" Barra said. \"We also focus on, there's certain jobs that people don't want to do. We focus on that, and we look at how do we make each of our team members more efficient.\"",
      "She also noted there are some instances in which \"the precision of the job requires automation.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:23:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Although there are signs that inflation is starting to ease, consumers still face pressures from high food prices and other costs.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of 2.7% in the final month of 2025, in line with economists' forecasts and unchanged from the prior month, capping a year when many Americans felt squeezed by price pressures.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was expected to rise 2.6% on an annual basis last month, according to economists surveyed by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The CPI tracks the changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, such as food and apparel.",
      "Inflation last month matched November's 2.7% annual pace, signaling that prices didn't ease further at the end of the year.",
      "So-called core inflation, or CPI data that excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 2.6% over the past 12 months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Economists polled by FactSet had predicted a 2.7% increase for that measure.",
      "Food prices jumped 3.1% last month, accelerating from a\u00a02.6%\u00a0increase in November, and the highest since August. Groceries have remained a sticking point for Americans who have had to stretch their budget to afford basic staples.",
      "For cash-strapped Americans, that could prove to be a pain point as we navigate a tricky economic backdrop.",
      "Ground beef prices jumped 15.5% compared with a year earlier, while coffee surged 19.8% and bananas rose 5.9%. One food staple that saw a price cut was eggs, which fell 20.9% from a year ago.",
      "The latest CPI reading closes out a year marked by economic resilience alongside lingering price pressures. Inflation stayed at or below 3% throughout 2025, well below the pandemic peak of 9.1% in June 2022.",
      "Even so, the CPI climbed for several months in 2025 in the wake of the Trump administration's tariff announcements, although the levies didn't reignite inflation to the extent that some economists had predicted. The tariff impact was more muted on inflation than predicted because many retailers swallowed some tariff costs rather than passing them on directly to customers.",
      "However, cooling inflation did not translate into price relief. Prices continued to rise, leaving many households feeling pinched and complicating efforts to save for retirement or buy a home.",
      "\"Inflation remains a challenge, with core PCE inflation holding above the Federal Reserve's 2% target for 55 months,\" noted Seema Shah, chief global strategist at investment firm Principal Asset Management, in a Tuesday email.",
      "The Federal Reserve cut rates three times in the final months of 2025 to counter a cooling labor market, despite inflation remaining above the central bank's 2% target. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said labor-market headwinds outweighed the risk of renewed price pressures. The next Fed meeting is scheduled for Jan. 27 to 28.",
      "What experts are saying",
      "While inflation isn't accelerating, it remains above the Federal Reserve's target rate, analysts noted.",
      "\"By most accounts, inflation is unlikely to drop to the 2% target in 2026, although it may gravitate towards that target, assuming that Fed independence stays intact,\" said Carla Nunes, a Managing Director within Kroll's Financial Advisory Practice, in an email.",
      "Analysts noted that core inflation was cooler than anticipated. The inflation measure, which excludes the food and energy categories, rose 0.2% in December, lower than the 0.3% increase expected by economists.",
      "\"Stepping back from the noise and volatility, core goods inflation appears to have peaked,\" Michael Pearce, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in an email note.",
      "While some measures signal inflation is cooling, Americans are still facing high costs in certain categories, including food and shelter.",
      "\"December's CPI report reinforces price pressure is edging higher across key consumer product categories that matter most to consumers,\" said Rob Holston, EY global and Americas consumer products leader, in an email.",
      "Taken together, today's inflation data and the latest jobs report, which showed a lower unemployment rate, are likely to keep the Fed on track to hold rates steady at its meeting later this month, experts say.",
      "Interest rate traders currently place a 95% likelihood that the central bank will keep rates in the 3.5% to 3.75% range when it meets in January, according to CME Group's Fed Watch Tool.",

      "The costs of renovating the Fed's Washington headquarters and a neighboring building have swelled to $2.5 billion, from a previous estimate of $1.9 billion.

      "\"I can't help what it looks like,\" Mr. Trump told Dokoupil.",
      "Powell on Sunday attributed the Justice Department investigation to Fed officials resisting pressure from Mr. Trump to lower its benchmark interest rate. Mr. Trump, who nominated Powell to lead the Fed in 2017, has repeatedly accused the central bank chief of being too cautious in lowering interest rates.",

    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 17:19:38 -0500",
    "summary": "Capping credit card interest rates at 10% could save consumers billions of dollars, but potentially hurt lower-income Americans, experts said.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's proposal to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for one year could save consumers billions of dollars but hurt Americans with lower credit scores, according to financial experts.",
      "The idea, which drew rare support on Monday from Democrats such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, would prevent Americans from being \"ripped off\" by card issuers, Mr. Trump\u00a0said\u00a0last week in calling for the rate ceiling. By contrast, the cap has drawn pushback from the banking industry.",
      "After JPMorgan Chase on Tuesday reported its fourth-quarter results, Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum said the proposed interest rate cap would punish consumers and dent the economy.",
      "\"Specifically, people will lose access to credit, like on a very, very extensive and broad basis, especially the people who need it the most, ironically,\" he said. \"And so, that's a pretty severely negative consequence for consumers, and frankly, probably also a negative consequence for the economy as a whole right now.\"",
      "The average interest rate on credit cards is now nearly 24%, according LendingTree. People with poor credit scores, meanwhile, can pay rates of up to 36%.",
      "Here's how experts say a 10% cap could affect consumers.",
      "Potential tradeoffs",
      "A September 2025\u00a0analysis\u00a0from researchers at Vanderbilt University found that a 10% cap on credit card rates would save consumers $100 billion per year in reduced interest payments.",
      "With rates at 10%, a cardholder with a $5,000 balance would pay about $42 per month in interest. At the current average rate of 24%, they would owe about $100 per month.",
      "Some credit card analysts, along with the banking industry, contend that a 10% cap on credit card rates could lead to banks cutting off access to credit for low-income consumers and for those with low credit scores.",
      "\"They would find it dramatically more difficult to access credit,\" Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate, told CBS News.",
      "That could take a toll on the broader economy because subprime consumers would likely pare their spending or turn to pricier types of credit. Credit card spending accounts for 30% to 40% of total annual consumer spending, so tighter credit for lower-income Americans could reduce overall consumer spending by roughly 5%, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.",
      "For overall economic growth, that would effectively cancel out any increase in consumer spending stemming from lower credit card rates, the investment bank notes.",
      "The American Bankers Association also said in a statement\u00a0that a 10% rate cap \"would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives,\" such as payday\u00a0or \"buy now pay later\" loans.",
      "Tiffany Funk, co-founder and president of point.me, a site that helps consumers maximize their credit card rewards, said such programs could be diminished if the cap is implemented.",
      "\"Absent that lever and potential revenue source, we would likely see banks raise annual fees dramatically, or drastically reduce the value of their points and transfer programs,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Yet Shearer disputes claims that capping rates would cause card companies to cut off some consumers, forcing them to turn to riskier types of loans. Rather, credit card issuers are more likely to continue serving such consumers, but could sharply reduce the value of the rewards they offer them, he said.",
      "\"The credit card business is massively profitable, so it could absorb a significant cut,\" he said, noting that credit card issuers have a range of revenue streams.",
      "Issuers such as Visa, Mastercard and Capital One also make money by charging annual fees and on so-called interchange fees merchants pay to accept credit cards, which wouldn't be affected by the proposed rate cap.",
      "\"Claims from bank lobbyists that this would lead to account closures are greatly overstated, if not completely false,\" Shearer said.",
      "Why are credit card rates so high?",
      "Annual percentage rates (APR on credit cards are far higher than auto loan or mortgage rates because the debt is unsecured, Rossman explained.",
      "\"There is no underlying asset like a car or a home,\" he told CBS News. \"The risk to lenders is they aren't going to be paid back,\" he added, explaining the rationale behind double-digit interest rates.",
      "Card companies are also reluctant to reduce rates because that would mean smaller profits.",
      "The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 limits how much card issuers can increase rates, but does not put a cap on rates, while also reducing late payment and other fees.",
      "Can Trump really do this?",
      "Some experts think Trump may not have the authority to unilaterally impose a cap on credit card rates. Congress would also face challenges implementing such a cap, according to TD Cowan analyst Jaret Seiberg, although he thinks lawmakers could get behind a higher cap.",
      "\"This is where the risk rises as Democrats have sought to extend the 36% military lending cap to all consumers. It is why that could pass. Enacting a 25% cap would be harder as it could affect first-time credit card holders and subprime applicants,\" he said in a research note.",
      "Shearer said that a bipartisan\u00a0bill, the \"Percent Credit Card Interest Rate Cap Act,\" introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in 2025 could pass if Mr. Trump's allies rallied behind it.",
      "\"It's not going to happen through executive action,\" Shearer said of a cap on interest rates. \"But if he can get the Senate majority leader and speaker to put it up for a vote, it's quite possible the bill would pass.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/housing-market-trump-mortgage-rates-home-prices/",
    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 16:25:41 -0500",
    "summary": "Economists say high home prices and a shortage of available properties may limit how much federal action can lower U.S. housing costs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump last week proposed two policies aimed at reducing the cost of buying a home, as soaring prices and elevated mortgage rates make homeownership increasingly unattainable for many Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump said he plans to ban large institutional investors from buying single-family homes, and is also directing the federal government to purchase $200 billion in mortgage bonds to drive down mortgage rates for Americans.",
      "\"It is one of my many steps in restoring Affordability,\" Mr. Trump said in a Jan. 8 social media post of the proposed mortgage debt purchase.",
      "Buying a home has become far more expensive in recent years as home prices have surged, driven by a shortage of affordable housing and, since 2022, rising mortgage rates. But because many of those pressures lie beyond the federal government's direct control, it's unclear how much Mr. Trump's proposals could ultimately lower costs, according to experts.",
      "America's housing shortage",
      "Mr. Trump's approach aims to tackle two core issues with the housing market \u2014 higher mortgage rates and competition for homes from institutional investors. Yet experts say these strategies will do little to address one of the housing market's thorniest problems: a shortage of homes for sale.",
      "The supply issue partly reflects years of underbuilding after the 2008 financial crisis, as well as the reluctance of homeowners who locked in ultra-low mortgage rates during the ensuing recession to relinquish their properties.",
      "\"There is an undersupply of housing in the U.S., and that will take time to resolve,\" Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy for TD Securities, told CBS News.",
      "The U.S. would need to build as many as 4 million additional homes beyond the normal pace of construction to address the housing shortage, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Janneke Ratcliffe, vice president of housing and communities at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News that the housing market's supply challenges could be harder to address.",
      "\"Most solutions to create new housing take a long time to come to fruition,\" she said.",
      "For example, high land costs make it hard to add to the housing supply. One solution, \u00a0Ratcliffe said, would be to change local zoning rules so more homes can be squeezed into a given area. Yet such policies are set at the local level, not by the federal government, she noted.",
      "Why lower mortgage rates aren't a panacea",
      "Because Mr. Trump's policies address the demand side of the equation, they could inadvertently drive up home prices, Goldberg said. For instance, a decline in mortgage rates could draw more buyers into the market, pushing home prices higher and exacerbating the supply problem.",
      "\"If consumers are able to afford more homes because monthly payments are lower, home prices tend to rise more quickly,\" the analyst told CBS News. \"So simply lowering the cost of buying a home through the mortgage channel isn't sufficient to fix the problem in the long run.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's plan to ban big investors, such as Invitation Homes and financial giant Blackstone, from hoovering up single-family homes might have only a limited effect on the market, according to Goldberg. The reason: investors that own at least 100 properties account for only roughly 1% of the total single-family housing stock in the U.S., according to the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "\"That's a relatively small impact,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Mr. Trump also hasn't said whether institutional investors would be required to sell the homes they currently own, he pointed out. If those firms are not forced to put those properties on the market, a ban is unlikely to significantly expand the supply of homes, Goldberg said.",
      "Still, Mr. Trump's policies could make a small difference, some housing market experts said.",
      "\"Mortgages will be a little cheaper, and housing will be a little more affordable,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist and managing director of High Frequency Economics, told CBS News, adding that banning institutional investors from scooping up homes could \"bring prices down a little.\"",
      "Ben Ayres, a senior economist at Nationwide Economics, estimated that the government buying $200 billion in mortgage securities could reduce home loan rates by up to 0.35 percentage points, which could \"spur more spending activity.\"",
      "The upshot: Meaningful progress will require tackling the shortage of available homes, economists agreed. Unless that issue is addressed, the housing affordability crunch will persist, said Edward Pinto, senior fellow and co-director of the AEI Housing Center at the nonpartisan American Enterprise Institute.",
      "\"We need to either activate the existing supply that is underutilized, or take steps to allow the building of new homes,\" Pinto said. \"We need to come up with supply-side solutions that take effect quickly.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump defended his tariffs at a speech in Michigan, after he visited a factory in Dearborn.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump spoke Tuesday at the Detroit Economic Club after he toured a Ford truck plant in nearby Dearborn. It comes as the president tries to focus on economic issues amid myriad international and domestic events that have gripped his administration since the start of the year.",
      "As Mr. Trump took to the stage, he touted the economy and also his victory in the 2024 election in Michigan. Mr. Trump called the event the \"easiest speech I've had to make\" because \"all I'm doing is spewing off what the hell we've done.\"",
      "Mr. Trump defended his administration's tariffs, saying he had closed the trade deficit due to the tariffs.",
      "\"Tariff's my favorite word,\" Mr. Trump said, later amending that it's his \"fifth-favorite word.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said tariffs had helped the car industry in Michigan, a point he also made while in Dearborn.",
      "Mr. Trump also said he would be rolling out a plan to deal with affordability when he is at Davos, although he has said that affordability is a \"hoax.\"",
      "On the international front, Mr. Trump spoke about his administration's military strikes on Venezuela and capture of its former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. He attacked the Democrats who voted to advance a war powers resolution, saying they \"hate our country,\" and he also called out a few of the Republicans who joined them.",
      "Mr. Trump met with oil executives to push for U.S. investment in Venezuela's oil industry, and he said Monday that \"we're working with the Venezuelan people and representatives, and it's amazing\" for the country's oil.",
      "Veering off topic from the economy, Mr. Trump said, starting Feb. 1, his administration would cut off all payments to sanctuary cities and \"states having sanctuary cities because they do everything possible to protect criminals at the expense of American citizens, and it breeds fraud and crime and all of the other problems that come.\" Previous attempts to cut off funding from sanctuary cities have been blocked by federal courts.",
      "Mr. Trump also criticized the fraud scandal in Minnesota involving dozens of Somali-American defendants, trashing Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Rep. Ilhan Omar, a staunch critic of Mr. Trump who represents Minneapolis and is Somali-American, saying she \"comes from a country with nothing and she comes here and she tells us about our Constitution.\"",
      "Walz last week dropped his reelection bid amid scrutiny over fraud in the state and the ongoing investigation.",
      "Mr. Trump said the recent immigration crackdown in Minnesota, which began shortly after a conservative YouTuber late last month published a video with\u00a0further allegations of fraud, has been successful in \"finding hundreds\" of criminals, and \"all we want to do is get them out.\"",
      "\"It's hard to get them out because they make it so impossible for you,\" he said. \"And you wonder, why? Why would they do that? You know, do they want to live with murderers, do they want to live with these people that are emptied out from prisons?\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not mention Renee Good, an American citizen who last week was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis. Mr. Trump and other high-ranking officials in his administration have repeatedly insisted the ICE officer was justified and that Good had instigated the shooting. Local officials and video footage of the incident have cast doubt on some of their claims.",
      "Mr. Trump also spoke to \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil during his visit to Dearborn about the economy and other issues. The interview will air on \"CBS Evening News\" tonight.",
      "On the economy, the December jobs report released last week continued to show a softening economy, with only 50,000 jobs added in December. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate stood at 4.4% in December, compared with 4.5% in November.",
      "Overall for 2025, job growth slowed throughout the year as some businesses grappled with economic uncertainty, prompting them to pull back on hiring.",
      "In a prime-time address last month,\u00a0Mr. Trump defended some of his signature second-term economic policies, including his handling of inflation and tariffs.",
      "The Detroit Economic Club has a long history of hosting presidents, both Democrats and Republicans. Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have all previously spoken to club members.",

    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:33:20 -0500",
    "summary": "Roughly 1.4 million fewer Americans have signed up for an Affordable Care Act plan as expiring tax breaks drive up premiums.",
    "story": [
      "Far fewer Americans enrolled in an Affordable Care Act health care plan, new federal data shows, with millions facing higher premiums after tax subsidies under the insurance program expired in December",
      "According to figures\u00a0from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), 22.8 million people have signed up for ACA coverage for 2026 since open enrollment started on Nov. 1. That's down 1.4 million from the number of Americans\u00a0who had enrolled in Obamacare, as the health plans are known, a year ago.",
      "Nationally, around 800,000 fewer people have selected plans compared to a similar time last year, marking a 3.5% drop in total enrollment so far. That includes a decrease in both new consumers signing up for ACA plans and existing enrollees re-upping them.",
      "Open ACA enrollment in most states for February coverage ends on Jan. 15.",
      "The drop in enrollment comes as many ACA participants face sharply higher monthly premiums because of a December 31 lapse in tax credits that lowered households' monthly health plan costs. After months of debate and a\u00a06-week government shutdown, Congress has yet to extend the credits or settle on another remedy.",
      "The House last week approved legislation that could preserve the enhanced subsidies for another three years. The fate of the bill is now in the hands of the Republican-controlled Senate.",
      "Over 20 million Americans received the ACA subsidies last year. Health policy group KFF\u00a0estimates that they could see their premiums swell by an average of 114%, from around $888 in 2025 to $1,904 this year, unless the tax credits are extended.",
      "Experts have warned that the end of the subsidies could push more people to dump their coverage in the face of higher premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates 4 million people will eventually lose their insurance without an extension of the credits.",
      "Robert Kaestner, a health economist at the University of Chicago, said some ACA enrollees who drop the coverage may have other options, such as going on a partner's employer health plan or changing their income to qualify for Medicaid. Others are likely to\u00a0go without insurance while they look for alternatives.",
      "\"My prediction is 2 million more people will lack health insurance for a while,\" Kaestner told the Associated Press. \"That's a serious issue, but Republicans would argue we're using government money more efficiently, we're targeting people who really need it and we're saving $35 billion a year.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 13:39:16 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump's plans to ease the financial pressures on Americans are bold but could backfire, experts said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is taking aim at three major pillars of the U.S. financial system \u2014 the Federal Reserve, the credit card industry and the housing market \u2014 that together wield enormous influence over Americans' finances.",
      "The efforts, announced separately over the past week, are tied to President Trump's push to lower borrowing costs as consumers grapple with inflation and affordability pressures. Specifically, Mr. Trump has floated a ban on\u00a0institutional investors\u00a0buying single-family homes, and also capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year. The Department of Justice launched an\u00a0investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a probe that Powell said is a pretext for weakening the Fed's independence in setting interest rates.",
      "Although experts note that such measures could reduce borrowing costs for everything from mortgages to credit cards, economists warn they also risk backfiring \u2014 potentially reigniting inflation, restricting access to credit and undermining confidence in the U.S. financial system.",
      "\"Increasing affordability is a worthy goal of this administration, but none of the policies on the table are going to achieve that,\" said Nick Anthony, a policy analyst at the nonpartisan Cato Institute, where he focuses on monetary policy.",
      "He added, \"In fact, most of them are likely to hurt consumers more than they will help them, whether it be price controls, intervening in the Federal Reserve, or intervening in the housing market. All of these interventions are more likely to distort the market than actually help it.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, White House spokesman Davis Ingle said Mr. Trump will unveil more details about his plans for making homes more affordable at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which starts on January 19.",
      "\"President Trump is committed to making it easier and more affordable to achieve the American Dream of homeownership by eliminating unnecessary red tape, increasing supply and lowering costs. President Trump is working tirelessly to undo the severe damage the Biden Administration inflicted on the American people through high prices,\" Ingle said.",
      "The White House referred questions about the Powell investigation to the Justice Department, which didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Risks of targeting Powell",
      "President Trump has grown\u00a0increasingly critical of Powell, regularly pressing him to lower interest rates and questioning his economic judgment.",
      "Powell does not set rates alone. As a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, he is one of 12 officials whose majority vote determines whether the Fed cuts, raises or holds interest rates steady.",
      "The latest effort by the Trump administration to target Powell comes after the Fed lowered its benchmark rate three times since September, with Powell citing easing inflation and a slowing labor market as justification for the cuts. Powell has long stressed that the Fed bases its rate decisions on economic data, emphasizing the central bank's traditional independence from political influence.",
      "On Sunday, Powell linked the Justice Department to efforts to undermine the Fed's independence when setting interest rates.",
      "\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said in a statement.",
      "Research has found that countries where central banks are more vulnerable to political influence have suffered from economic problems such as runaway inflation.",
      "It's important that \"the Federal Reserve can act as it sees fit, and it can make the decisions that it believes to be right without fearing repercussions,\" Cato's Anthony said. \"And when you do fear those repercussions, that's when we see situations where there's hyperinflation abroad, because the only concern was making sure that the leader, whether elected or authoritarian, was presented in the best light possible.\"",
      "Borrowing costs could decline if the White House is successful in pressuring Fed officials to lower interest rates, but the flip side could be surging inflation, noted Nigel Green of investment advisory firm deVere Group.",
      "Any legal action against Powell also could undermine investor confidence in U.S. monetary policy, weakening the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency and destabilizing the bond market, Wall Street analysts said.",
      "\"The Fed must remain independent in order for the central bank to remain effective and \u2014 this is important \u2014 for the integrity of the U.S. dollar and the all-important Treasury markets to remain the world's benchmarks,\" said Mark Malek, CIO at Siebert Financial, in an email.",
      "Unintended consequences?",
      "Americans have about $1.2 trillion in outstanding credit card debt, with lenders charging an average APR of about 23.8%, according to LendingTree.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump called for a one-year cap of 10% on credit card rates, writing in a social media post that he \"will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies.\"",
      "Cutting credit card rates by more than half could save Americans $100 billion in interest annually, Vanderbilt University researchers\u00a0said in a September report.",
      "But a 10% cap could also have adverse consequences, experts added. Credit card companies would likely reduce credit for more than 80% of customers, with almost every account for people with credit scores below 740 closed or severely restricted to offset the reduced fees from a 10% cap, according to an analysis from the Electronic Payments Coalition, a financial industry trade group.",
      "Credit card spending also accounts for 30% to 40% of total annual consumer spending, so tighter credit for lower-income Americans could reduce overall consumer spending by roughly 5% \u2014 a significant economic hit, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.",
      "Housing's biggest problem",
      "Lastly, Mr. Trump is tackling housing affordability at a time when homeownership is increasingly out of reach for many Americans.",
      "His approach aims to tackle two core issues with the housing market \u2014 higher mortgage rates and competition for homes \u2014 by directing the federal government to\u00a0purchase $200 billion in mortgage bonds\u00a0and banning institutional investors from buying single-family homes.",
      "On Friday, the average rate for a 30-year mortgage dipped below 6%, its lowest level in three years. But experts said the strategies fail to address the housing market's biggest problem \u2014 a lack of available homes that stems from underbuilding after the Great Recession.",
      "\"The affordability crisis is fundamentally a supply problem, and meaningful relief requires adding homes, both through new construction or through inventory gains in chronically constrained markets, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest,\" said Realtor.com senior economist Jake Krimmel in an email.",
      "For that reason, banning institutional investors from single-family home purchases \"is unlikely to move the needle on affordability,\" he concluded.",
      "The lack of supply to meet demand from buyers is an issue that will take years to resolve, experts said.",
      "To be sure, banning institutional investors could help reduce competition for homes in some markets. Institutional investors account for roughly 1% of total single-family housing stock, according to an August analysis by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. The study defined such investors as those owning at least 100 properties.",
      "Investors are a bigger presence in some regions, with investors owning about 27% of single-family rental properties in Atlanta, a 2023 Urban Institute\u00a0study\u00a0found.",
      "As of mid-2025, meanwhile, about 10% of home purchases were made by investors, with most them \"mom-and-pop\" buyers, according to Realtor.com said.",

      "\"The reported criminal inquiry into Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell is an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine that independence,\" the signers of the statement said. \"This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly.",

Bush; Kenneth Rogoff, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund; ad Christina Romer, CEA chair under Obama.",
      "\"The Federal Reserve's independence and the public's perception of that independence are critical for economic performance, including achieving the goals Congress has set for the Federal Reserve of stable prices, maximum employment, and moderate long-term interest rates,\" the signers wrote.",
      "The statement signals that \"folks are unifying against this,\" Nick Anthony, a policy analyst at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News. \"Whether it changes the administration's mind is a tough question because it's a new source of pressure. But at the same time, it might amplify their resolve in seeing that the establishment is against this, so we must be right.\"",
      "Why Powell says he's being targeted",
      "The $2.5 billion project to renovate several Fed buildings, along with Powell's testimony about that effort, came under scrutiny by the Trump administration last year, with Office of Management and Budget Chair Russell Vought accusing Powell of leading an \"ostentatious\" project that may be \"violating the law.\"",
      "Powell had called some descriptions of the renovation \"misleading and inaccurate,\" disputing claims by the Trump administration that the overhaul included water features or rooftop gardens.",
      "In his video remarks on Sunday, Powell tied the investigation to Mr. Trump's efforts to pressure the Fed to cut interest rates and undermine the central bank's independence.",

The Fed, through testimony and other public disclosures, made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts,\" Powell said. \"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark rate three times since Mr. Trump's inauguration in January 2025, with Mr. Powell citing easing inflation and a slower labor market as causes for the reductions.",
      "Lawmakers across the aisle spoke out in defense of Powell. Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican and member of the Senate Banking panel, said on Sunday that he would oppose any of the Trump administration's nominees for the Fed, including to replace Powell.",
      "\"If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,\" Tillis said in a statement.",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, called the investigation \"nothing more than an attempt at coercion.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, said in a speech at the National Press Club on Monday that \"Trump is trying to push out the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and complete his corrupt takeover of America's central bank so that it serves his interests, along with his billionaire friends.\"",
      "Powell's future at the Fed",
      "Powell is set to step down as Fed chair in May, but he could continue to serve as a Federal Reserve governor beyond that time. If he remains, the Trump administration would be deprived of the chance to fill another seat on the board.",
      "Powell has declined at several press conferences to answer questions about his plans. Asked on Monday by reporters if Powell planned to remain a Fed governor, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council and a leading candidate to become Fed chair, said he was unaware of Powell's plans.",
      "\"I've not talked to Jay about that,\" Hassett said.",

    "summary": "Facebook owner Meta has named Dina Powell McCormick, a former Trump administration adviser and longtime finance executive, as its new president and vice chairman.",
    "story": [
      "Facebook owner Meta has named Dina Powell McCormick, a former Trump administration adviser and longtime finance executive, as president and vice chairman of the tech giant.",
      "Powell McCormick previously served on Meta's board of directors \u2014 where, the company notes, she was \"deeply engaged\" in accelerating its artificial intelligence push across platforms. In her new management role, Meta says Powell McCormick will help guide its overall strategy, including the execution of multi-billion-dollar investments.",
      "The news, announced Monday, quickly gained the applause of President Trump. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, the Republican president said the move was a \"great choice\" by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 and noted that Powell McCormick had \"served the Trump Administration with strength and distinction.\"",
      "Zuckerberg said in a statement that Powell McCormick's experience in global finance, \"combined with her deep relationships around the world,\" made her \"uniquely suited to help Meta\" in its future growth.",
      "Powell McCormick is a veteran of two presidential administrations and the Republican National Committee. She worked as a national security adviser at the start of Mr. Trump's first term, and also held roles in the White House and the Secretary of State's office under President George W. Bush.",
      "She is married to Sen. David McCormick, a Republican from Pennsylvania, who served in high-level positions in the Commerce and Treasury departments under Bush, before he joined hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and rose to become CEO.",
      "And Powell McCormick has a long background in finance. She spent 16 years in senior leadership at Goldman Sachs, but was most recently vice chair, president and head of global client services at merchant bank BDT & MSD Partners. She's also held a handful of other corporate board positions \u2014 including at oil giant Exxon Mobil.",
      "According to a securities filing, Powell McCormick had previously resigned from Meta's board in December, eight months after joining as a director.",
      "The addition of Powell McCormick to Meta's management team arrived amid wider efforts from California-based Meta to boost its ties with Mr. Trump, who was once banned from Facebook. Like other powerful tech CEOs, Zuckerberg has dined with the president at the White House and doubled down on U.S. investment promises worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Last year, the company also appointed Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White to its board, another familiar figure in Mr. Trump's orbit.",

    "published": "Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:28:09 -0500",
    "summary": "After the ACA tax credit lapsed in December, enrollees are opting for less robust health plans or dropping coverage altogether.",
    "story": [
      "When Kassidy Hooter learned in December how much her health insurance costs were going to rise this year, she went into panic mode.",
      "The Shreveport, Louisiana, resident and mother of three knew she urgently needed care \u2014 Hooter is in the final trimester of a high-risk pregnancy. But the family could no longer afford their Affordable Care Act plan coverage now that a federal tax subsidy was lapsing on Dec. 31, 2025, meaning they would face thousands of dollars in additional out-of-pocket costs.",
      "\"We heavily considered that it might just be cheaper to give birth at home,\" Hooter, 24, told CBS News. \"Just because that's an insane amount of debt to take on.\"",
      "In the end, Hooter decided to forgo insurance altogether.",
      "A local medical center offered three months of financial aid that will carry her through her due date in February and into late March. After that, she will have to bear any medical expenses on her own. Her plan now is to get her newborn on Medicaid, a government health plan for low-income Americans, as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I'm just hoping for the best,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Health insurance as \"luxury\"",
      "Since its introduction in 2010, the ACA has been instrumental in cutting the share of uninsured Americans from approximately 15% to 8%, according to Nima Sheth, vice president of health justice at the National Partnership for Women and Families, a nonprofit advocacy group.",
      "However, the number of people without health insurance is likely to surge if Congress fails to come up with a solution for the 22 million Americans who received an ACA tax credit, experts warn. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates\u00a0that millions of people will lose coverage unless the subsidies are extended.",
      "Americans in most states have until Jan. 15 to enroll in an ACA marketplace plan, according to healthinsurance.org.",
      "Without the tax credits, premiums for ACA enrollees who previously relied on the subsidies will increase by an average of 114%, estimates\u00a0KFF, a nonprofit provider of health policy news and research.",
      "\"What we're seeing here is a policy choice \u2014 is, in effect, turning insurance into a luxury item and medical debt into the default,\" Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "The House of Representatives on Thursday\u00a0approved a three-year extension\u00a0of the expired ACA tax credits. The legislation faces an uphill climb in the Republican-led Senate, although lawmakers think it could provide a starting point for a compromise that would keep the credits alive in some form.",
      "The CBO estimates\u00a0that the House bill would increase the deficit by around $81 billion from 2026 to 2035. At the same time, the measure would boost the number of people with health insurance, a CBO spokesperson told CBS News.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me\"",
      "Plantation, Florida, resident Stacy Kanas, whose family also received an ACA tax credit, is now considering going without health insurance after realizing that her monthly premium to cover her and her husband would rise to $2,500 \u2014 more than double what she was paying last year to cover both of them plus her 20-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me,\" Kanas, 59, told CBS News. \"My husband had a major surgery about five years ago, and we don't want to be uninsured.\"",
      "Although in decent health, the small business owner worries about what could happen if someone in her family falls seriously ill. \"You're one catastrophic event away from perhaps having a financial disaster,\" she said.",
      "Even people who keep their ACA coverage could end up skipping out on care to avoid out-of-pocket expenses, experts said.",
      "\"If you're underinsured and you have high deductibles, the coverage that you're getting is designed to dissuade getting care, including preventative care, so you're going to delay your care until there are emergencies,\" Sternthal said.",
      "Robert Myers, a consultant based outside of St. Louis, Missouri, was on a silver ACA plan last year, but switched to a bronze plan after learning his premiums would rise to $400 a month, up from $17 in 2025.",
      "Under his new plan, the 31-year-old does not have a monthly premium. However, Myers could owe much more in out-of-pocket costs due to $80 co-pays and an $8,000 deductible. As a result, he's planning on scaling back on doctor's visits, a trend experts say ends up driving more people to the emergency room for care.",
      "\"They'll kind of go to the ER and get what they need fixed with a band aid, and then not get long-term care,\" Sheth said.",
      "This can have wider ripple effects because an increase in uncompensated hospital care can drive up costs for other patients, as facilities seek to recoup the costs, according to Sternthal, who supports an extension of the ACA tax credits.",
      "\"Every delay locks families into decisions that harm their health and their financial stability, but then also reverberates out into the business community, the local community,\" she said.",

    "published": "Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:16:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Mattel is introducing a Barbie with autism as the newest member of its line intended to celebrate diversity.",
    "story": [
      "Mattel Inc. is introducing a Barbie with autism Monday as the newest member of its line intended to celebrate diversity, joining a collection that already includes Barbies with Down syndrome, a blind Barbie, a Barbie and a Ken with vitiligo, and other models the toymaker added to make its fashion dolls more inclusive.",
      "Mattel said it developed the doll over more than 18 months in partnership with the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, a nonprofit organization that advocates for the rights and better media representation of people with autism. The goal: to create a Barbie that reflected some of the ways people with autism may experience and process the world around them, according to a Mattel news release.",
      "That was a challenge because autism encompasses a broad range of behaviors and difficulties that vary widely in degree, and many of the traits associated with the disorder are not immediately visible, according to Noor Pervez, who is the Autistic Self Advocacy Network's community engagement manager and worked closely with Mattel on the Barbie prototype.",
      "Like many disabilities, \"autism doesn't look any one way,\" Pervez said. \"But we can try and show some of the ways that autism expresses itself.\"",
      "For example, the eyes of the new Barbie shift slightly to the side to represent how some people with autism sometimes avoid direct eye contact, he said. The doll also was given articulated elbows and wrists to acknowledge stimming, hand flapping and other gestures that some people with autism use to process sensory information or to express excitement, according to Mattel.",
      "The development team debated whether to dress the doll in a tight or a loose-fitting outfit, Pervez said. Some people with autism wear loose clothes because they are sensitive to the feel of fabric seams, while others wear figure-hugging garments to give them a sense of where their bodies are, he said.",
      "The team ended up choosing an A-line dress with short sleeves and a flowy skirt that provides less fabric-to-skin contact. The doll also wears flat shoes to promote stability and ease of movement, according to Mattel.",
      "Each doll comes with a pink finger clip fidget spinner, noise-canceling headphones and a pink tablet modeled after the devices some people with autism who struggle to speak use to communicate.",
      "The addition of the doll with autism to the Barbie Fashionistas line also became an occasion for Mattel to create a doll with facial features inspired by the company's employees in India and mood boards reflecting a range of women with Indian backgrounds. Pervez said it was important to have the doll represent a segment of the community of people with autism that is generally underrepresented.",
      "Mattel introduced its first doll with Down syndrome in 2023 and brought out a Barbie representing a person with Type 1 diabetes last summer. The Fashionistas also include a Barbie and a Ken with a prosthetic leg, and a Barbie with hearing aids, but the line also encompasses tall, petite and curvy body types and numerous hair types and skin colors.",
      "\"Barbie has always strived to reflect the world kids see and the possibilities they imagine, and we're proud to introduce our first autistic Barbie as part of that ongoing work,\" Jamie Cygielman, Mattel's global head of dolls, said in a statement.",
      "The doll was expected to be available at Mattel's online shop and at Target stores starting Monday for a suggested retail price of $11.87. Walmart stores are expected to start carrying the new Barbie in March, Mattel said.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported last year that the estimated prevalence of autism among 8-year-old children in the U.S. was 1 in 31. The estimate from the CDC's Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network said Black, Hispanic, Asian and Pacific Islander children in the U.S. were more likely than white children to have a diagnosis, with the prevalence more than three times higher among boys than girls.",

    "published": "Sat, 10 Jan 2026 14:57:08 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump called for a one-year cap on credit card interest rates late Friday, an idea that has drawn strong support from lawmakers in both parties but pushback from card issuers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is calling for a 10% cap on credit card interest rates for one year, an idea that has drawn strong support from lawmakers in both parties but pushback from card issuers.",
      "\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration,\" the president wrote on Truth Social late Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump said the cap on interest rates should begin on Jan. 20, 2026, or the one-year anniversary of his second inauguration.",
      "Credit card interest rates currently average over 20%, according to Federal Reserve statistics, so a 10% cap would represent a significant cut in borrowing costs.",
      "It's unclear if the president will attempt to enforce his proposed 10% cap through some kind of executive action, or if his goal is to pressure credit card issuers to slash their rates voluntarily. CBS News has reached out to the White House and some of the largest credit card issuers in the U.S. for comment.",
      "Supporters point to trillions in credit card debt",
      "The idea of capping credit card interest rates has drawn bipartisan support. Last year, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucuses with Democrats, teamed up to introduce legislation that would impose a 10% cap. A similar measure was also introduced in the House by Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida.",
      "Other recently proposed legislation would impose less stringent caps on fees and interest rates.",
      "Mr. Trump also called for temporarily capping interest rates at 10% on the campaign trail. Hours before the president's late Friday Truth Social post, Sanders criticized Mr. Trump on X\u00a0 for not following through on his pledge to limit interest rates.",
      "Supporters of the idea say it would aid scores of Americans who are languishing under mountains of credit card debt, and argue that credit card issuers can afford to cut their rates.",
      "Americans owed a total of $1.23 trillion in credit card balances in the third quarter of last year, the highest level on record, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A 2024 study by NerdWallet found that the average U.S. household with credit card debt owed $10,563. Meanwhile, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found in 2023 that credit card rates have soared \"far above the cost of offering credit.\"",
      "\"We cannot continue to allow big banks to make huge profits ripping off the American people,\" Sanders said in a joint press release with Hawley last year.",
      "Said Luna: \"For too long, credit card companies have abused working class Americans with absurd interest rates, trapping them in an almost insurmountable amount of debt.\"",
      "Opponents argue a credit card rate cap could backfire",
      "Opponents of a cap, including banks and other credit card issuers, warn that limits on interest rates may force lenders to stop issuing credit cards to many riskier borrowers.",
      "A coalition of groups that represent banks \u2014 including the American Bankers Association and the Bank Policy Institute \u2014 argued in a statement to CBS News on Friday that a 10% interest rate cap \"would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small business owners who rely on and value their credit cards, the very consumers this proposal intends to help.\"",
      "The Bank Policy Institute estimated last year that more than 14 million American households that rarely pay their credit card balances in full could have their access to credit eliminated or curtailed by a 10% cap. Millions of people who sometimes pay off their balances could also face new restrictions, the group said.",
      "The American Bankers Association has\u00a0argued in the past that if credit card issuers end up needing to cut off access for \"all but the lowest-risk customers,\" many people who are in need of loans would be forced to shift to \"less regulated alternatives\" that often charge even higher rates, like payday lenders and pawn shops.",
      "Billionaire investor Bill Ackman, who backed Mr. Trump in his 2024 campaign, called the idea a \"mistake.\" He\u00a0wrote on X\u00a0that if card issuers are prevented from charging high enough interest rates to cover their losses and earn solid returns, \"credit card lenders will cancel cards for millions of consumers who will have to turn to loan sharks.\"",
      "Ackman later wrote: \"Finding a way to bring down credit card rates without taking credit away from many Americans would have a very positive impact on the most disadvantaged Americans.\"",
      "Scott Simpson, CEO of the trade group America's Credit Unions, told CBS News in a statement: \"While we appreciate the President's desire to increase affordability, the plain truth is that capping rates at 10% does not make credit more affordable, it makes it unattainable for millions of working Americans because financial institutions will not be able to offer credit cards to most consumers at a 10% rate.\"",
      "The Electronic Payments Coalition \u2014 which represents credit card issuers and payment networks \u2014 said \"a one-size-fits-all 10% cap risks making things worse by reducing access to credit and limiting choice.\"",
      "Trump pledges to deal with affordability",
      "The push to cap credit card interest rates is the latest proposal by Mr. Trump to cut borrowing costs, as he grapples with widespread concerns about affordability.",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump directed the federal government to buy $200 million in mortgage bonds using cash from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in an effort to drive down mortgage rates.",
      "The president has also urged the Federal Reserve to more aggressively cut its benchmark interest rate, which influences borrowing costs for everything from mortgages and car loans to commercial loans \u2014 though rate cuts by the Fed could run the risk of causing inflation to surge.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to nominate a new Federal Reserve chair in the coming weeks, and told reporters last month he's \"looking for somebody that will be honest with interest rates.\"",

      "At 8:20 p.m. EST on Thursday, Mr. Trump\u00a0posted a graph depicting changes in private and government employment since January 2025. When the full jobs report was released Friday morning, it became clear that Mr. Trump's post had incorporated the December employment data because the totals in the chart matched figures released in the monthly report.",
      "Mr. Trump brushed off the incident. \"I don't know if they posted them,\" he told reporters Friday afternoon. \"They gave me some numbers. When people give me things, I post them.\"",
      "A White House official told CBS News that Mr. Trump's post came after he was briefed on the employment numbers, calling it an \"inadvertent public disclosure of aggregate data that was partially derived from pre-released information.\"",
      "The White House is now reviewing its protocols for economic data releases, the official added.",
      "Cooler hiring",
      "The government's latest jobs report shows that hiring cooled in December, with employers adding 50,000 jobs, while the nation's unemployment rate ticked down to 4.4%. The economy added roughly 584,000 jobs for all of 2025, down from more than 2 million in 2024, labor data shows.",
      "Federal economic data is held under strict embargo until its scheduled release because the information has the potential to move financial markets. Providing some investors with access to such data could allow them to place trades based on knowledge unavailable to other investors.",
      "White House economic officials are provided with an advance copy of the Labor Department's employment report each month on Thursday afternoon and sign agreements to keep the numbers confidential, though they also write up a summary for the president, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Data leaks can undermine investor confidence, as markets expect officials to keep a tight lid on economic reports until they're released publicly, Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, told CBS News.",
      "\"Markets don't react kindly to that, because obviously it means that perhaps a select few may have been able to front-run on that news ahead of the market at large,\" he said.",
      "Erica Groshen, a former commissioner at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unit that compiles the monthly employment figures, said that premature disclosures of the agency's data can be punished by fines and even jail time. But previous breaches typically have been met with a slap on the wrist, she noted.",
      "The Securities and Exchange Commission didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Trump's inadvertent data release.",
      "No market disruption",
      "Although some investors could have acted on the information Mr. Trump posted on Thursday, there were no evident signs of a change in trading or market prices related to the jobs data, said Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser Vital Knowledge.",
      "Mr. Trump's data provided only a partial snapshot of the December labor market, while most investors are looking for the overall monthly data, including the most recent unemployment rate, he added.",
      "\"For people who are kind of really trying to get a sense of the economy, they want to look at the full release,\" Crisafulli said.",

    "summary": "Britain's leader says all options on the table if Musk's X platform doesn't stop Grok AI tool being used to generate non-consensual sexualized images.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014 U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Thursday that he wants \"all options to be on the table,\" including a potential ban on Elon Musk's X platform in Britain, over the use of its artificial intelligence tool Grok to generate sexualized images of people without their consent.",
      "Starmer's remarks come as Musk's platform faces scrutiny from regulators across the globe over Grok's image editing tool, which has allowed users to create digitally altered, sexualized photos of real people,\u00a0including minors.",
      "\"This is disgraceful, it's disgusting and it's not to be tolerated. X has got to get a grip of this,\" Starmer said in an interview with a U.K. radio station. \"It's unlawful. We're not going to tolerate it. I've asked for all options to be on the table.\"",
      "A source in Starmer's office reiterated to CBS News on Friday that \"nothing is off the table\" when it comes to regulating X in Britain.",
      "CBS News has verified that Grok fulfilled user requests asking it to edit images of women to show them in bikinis or little clothing, including prominent public figures such as\u00a0first lady Melania Trump.",
      "Last week, Grok, a chatbot developed by Musk's company xAI, acknowledged \"lapses in safeguards\" that allowed users to generate digitally altered, sexualized photos of minors.",
      "Grok told users that as of Friday, access to its image generation tool was limited \"to paying subscribers\" of its user verification service. Paying subscribers have to provide their credit card and personal details to the company, which could dissuade some people from using the service, especially if they had intended to use Grok's AI tool to create illegal images of minors.",
      "xAI responded to a CBS News request for comment to criticism of Grok's image generation tool and steps it had taken to limit access to it on Friday, by saying: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Addressing reporters on Friday morning, a U.K. government spokesperson called the move to limit access to Grok's image editing tool to paying users \"insulting\" to victims of misogyny and sexual violence, saying it, \"simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service.\"",
      "Under the U.K. Online Safety Act, sharing intimate images without consent on social media is a criminal offense, and social media companies are required to proactively remove such content, as well as prevent it from appearing in the first place.",
      "If they fail to do so, the companies can face hefty fines or, in last resort cases, face what would effectively be a ban by Britain's independent media regulator Ofcom. Ofcom can compel payment providers, advertisers and internet service providers to stop working with a site, preventing it from generating money or being accessed from the U.K.",
      "In a post shared Monday on its own X account, Ofcom said it was \"aware of serious concerns raised about a feature on Grok on X that produces undressed images of people and sexualised images of children.\"",
      "\"We have made urgent contact with X and xAI to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK. Based on their response we will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation,\" Ofcom said.",
      "Musk's platform has faced scrutiny from governments around the world, including the European Union and the U.S. Congress, over Grok AI's digital alteration of real images.",
      "On Wednesday, Republican Senator Ted Cruz said in a post on X that \"many of the recent AI-generated posts are unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",
      "\"These unlawful images pose a serious threat to victims' privacy and dignity. They should be taken down and guardrails should be put in place,\" Cruz said, adding that he was encouraged by steps taken by X to remove unlawful images.",
      "On Thursday, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, threatened to sanction the U.K. government if Starmer moved to ban X in the U.K.",
      "\"If Starmer is successful in banning @X in Britain, I will move forward with legislation that is currently being drafted to sanction not only Starmer, but Britain as a whole,\" Paulina Luna said in a post on her own X account.",

    "summary": "Two Republicans switched their votes after pressure from the White House.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans killed a war powers resolution to limit President Trump's ability to further strike Venezuela after the White House put pressure on a handful of GOP senators who supported it.",
      "Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Todd Young of Indiana flipped their support Wednesday after initially voting to advance it. Vice President JD Vance had to step in to break the 50-50 tie.",
      "Republicans used a procedural maneuver to block the measure, arguing that the resolution should no longer be \"privileged\" \u2014 which gives it priority on the floor \u2014 because the U.S. is not currently engaged in \"hostilities\" with Venezuela.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, previewed the argument in floor remarks Wednesday morning.",
      "\"Today, we expect a vote on a resolution to direct the removal of U.S. forces from hostilities in or against Venezuela, even though the U.S. is not currently engaged in hostilities in or against Venezuela,\" Thune said. \"We have no troops on the ground in Venezuela. We're not currently conducting military operations there.\"",
      "Senators\u00a0advanced\u00a0the resolution, introduced by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, last week after the U.S. captured Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife and Mr. Trump asserted the U.S. is now in charge of the country.",
      "Five Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure, pushing it forward after two previous failed attempts in the upper chamber to advance similar resolutions to rein in Mr. Trump's military action in the region.",
      "The GOP senators who voted with Democrats to advance the measure were Hawley, Young, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky.",
      "Murkowski, Collins and Paul voted against the GOP effort to kill the resolution Wednesday.",
      "Kaine said Wednesday night he was disappointed in the outcome but saw it \"as a growing set of cracks\" in the GOP's willingness to stick with Mr. Trump on the issue.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump quickly lashed out\u00a0at the Republicans, saying they \"should never be elected to office again.\" He again criticized the senators on Tuesday during a speech at the Detroit Economic Club, calling them \"real losers.\"",
      "Some of the senators said they received calls from Mr. Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio ahead of Wednesday's action.",
      "Hawley said Rubio had addressed his concerns about U.S. troops in Venezuela.",
      "He said Rubio confirmed the U.S. \"has no ground troops currently in Venezuela\" and that if the administration plans to put troops in Venezuela, \"they would abide by the War Powers Act and they would come to Congress for congressional authorization.\"",
      "\"The secretary told me directly that the administration will not put ground troops in Venezuela,\" Hawley said.",
      "Young pushed back on criticism that he caved to pressure from the president, telling reporters that senators had \"secured some valuable reassurances and deliverables\" from the White House on Venezuela.",
      "\"I think we played our hand well,\" Young said, contending that the resolution was heading for a presidential veto if it eventually did make it through both chambers. Both the House and Senate would have needed a two-thirds majority to overcome a veto, which was unlikely.",
      "The switch-up appeared to come as a surprise to Kaine, who said Wednesday morning that he expected all five Republicans to stick with Democrats.",
      "Before Maduro's ouster, lawmakers said they had received insufficient answers from the Trump administration about whether its end goals in Venezuela included regime change, as the U.S. ramped up strikes\u00a0against alleged drug-smuggling boats, imposed an oil blockade and Mr. Trump threatened land strikes.",
      "Republicans who voted last week to advance the resolution cited Mr. Trump's comments about running Venezuela and the potential for U.S. forces to be deployed there as reasons for the measure gaining their support.",
      "A day after the initial Senate vote, Mr. Trump announced he had called off a \"second wave\" of attacks against Venezuela, claiming the two countries \"are working well together.\" But, he said, U.S. naval forces in the region would \"stay in place for safety and security purposes.\"",
      "Kaine attributed\u00a0Mr. Trump's decision to cancel more strikes to the war powers vote. CBS News did not receive a response from the White House regarding Kaine's assertion.",

      "As the backlog has grown for many employment-based U.S. visas, applications have skyrocketed for the so-called \"Einstein visa\" reserved for people who can show extraordinary ability in their fields.",
      "But as interest has spiked in the high-achiever visa, called the EB-1A, so has a market for credential-boosting services that in some cases may constitute fraud, a CBS News investigation found.",
      "Some visa hopefuls, especially in science and technology fields, have turned to a marketplace of services to pad their resumes with false or low-quality records of achievement. Research brokers or consultants ghostwrite research papers, boost article citations, or confer vanity awards to customers willing to pay up to hundreds or thousands of dollars.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which processes the applications, is aware that a growing number of EB-1A applicants have been applying with purchased or fraudulent credentials, two former USCIS officials familiar with the agency's fraud investigations told CBS News.",
      "\"If you have money, then you have a way to buy your evidence and fabricate those things,\" said the official, who left the agency last year and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal operations at USCIS.",
      "Those who are caught misrepresenting themselves or using fraudulent credentials on a visa application may simply have their application denied, but could also be prevented from successfully reapplying for a visa by being deemed inadmissible to the U.S. USCIS could also revoke an existing visa from someone if they find they lied on their application.",
      "\"USCIS is committed to rooting out fraud by thoroughly screening and vetting all aliens seeking immigration benefits,\" agency spokesman Matthew Tragesser wrote in a statement to CBS News. \"Anyone submitting fake evidence or misrepresenting themselves will be found out and face the consequences.\"",
      "But those who sell the credentials, middlemen who often operate anonymously on social media or through companies marketed as consulting groups, profit regardless.",
      "Academic research brokers",
      "The number of EB-1A petitions has tripled over the past four years, according to quarterly data from USCIS. Nearly 7,500 applied from April to June 2025, the most recent available data shows, up from about 2,500 in the last three months of 2021.",
      "Meanwhile, the approval rate for EB-1A petitions has been dropping since 2021, with about 67% approved from April to June 2025. Data from immigration analytics platform Lawfully indicates it dropped to closer to 50% in recent months.",
      "Applicants must demonstrate they meet at least three of 10 criteria to be considered for an EB-1A visa, such as winning awards, authoring scholarly articles, or being a member of a professional association.",
      "CBS News identified dozens of posts and advertisements on Telegram, Facebook and in WhatsApp groups marketing scholarly papers that customers can pay to have their names on. Several posts specifically targeted visa applicants.",
      "WhatsApp and Facebook owner Meta confirmed some of the posts violated their policies around fake documents, frauds and scams, in which they ban content that \"enables users to get visa approvals without fulfilling normal requirements.\" Meta removed the ads that CBS News sent to a company spokesperson as examples.",
      "Three individuals who posted advertisements told CBS News that clients didn't need to contribute to the papers to be listed as authors.",
      "One individual running a visa \"profile enhancement\" Facebook page told software engineer Abhishek Bakare in May that for $500, he could list him as the fourth author on a computer science research paper, according to a recording of a phone call between the two that Bakare shared with CBS News.",
      "Bakare, who developed an artificial intelligence tool to spot low-quality research, had feigned interest in making a purchase to gather information on the fraud, he told CBS News.",
      "\"Already I was working on this [paper] from the past four to five months,\" the seller told Bakare on the phone. \"I'm adding you literally at the very last stage.\"",
      "He later added that at the time, he had 55 clients, all of them Indian nationals and most aiming for EB-1A or similar employment-based visas.",
      "\"There are people, those who have paid, they have basically purchased a paper,\" the seller admitted, \"which is not sort of ethical for EB-1.\"",
      "A paper with the same title as the one he offered Bakare was accepted by an international conference co-sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), a widely-respected organization within the electrical engineering industry.",
      "When CBS News contacted the seller, he denied that he offered to sell the authorship position to Bakare, and instead claimed the $500 was for a conference fee. If Bakare had moved forward with working with him, he said, he would have had to create the conference presentation to get his name on the paper.",
      "\"My process is the same for everyone: without actively working on a paper, it isn't practically possible for me to add anyone,\" he wrote in a WhatsApp message. \"I have not done this in the past, I am not doing it now, and I will not do so in the future.\"",
      "Some papers are published not just to confer authorship to a paying customer, but simply to cite an existing paper to make it appear more credible. One of the research brokers CBS News spoke with, based in Nigeria, charges $500 for a citation.",
      "\"I will boost citations by writing 100% human written articles and publishing them to a journal but I will include your article references in the reference section,\" he wrote in a WhatsApp message\u00a0 to CBS News.",
      "He told CBS News he has a team of 10 people who work on the writing and publication process. All of his clients are trying to get U.S. visas, he said.",
      "Low-quality scientific research produced for resume padding isn't an activity exclusive to visa applicants, according to researchers at Northwestern University and The University of Sydney. They found in a recent study that low-quality or plagiarized papers are increasingly published not only in predatory, pay-to-publish platforms, but reputable journals as well.",
      "They discovered that a small group of bad actors were hired as editors at reputable journals,\u00a0 allowing them to \"accept for publication pretty much anything,\" said Luis Amaral, one of the study's authors.",
      "\"It's almost like a spy movie, right? You send a spy to infiltrate a place and that spy inside is actually betraying the organization,\" he said.",
      "In some cases, individuals will submit a paper to a journal, and once they secure acceptance, request to add authors during the editing process, said Reese Richardson, another author on the study. This allows research brokers to sell authorship slots in papers that are all but guaranteed to be published.",
      "\"Profile building\" services",
      "The EB-1A criteria extend beyond papers and citations. That has led to the rise of \"profile building\" services that promise to help customers enhance their resumes, CBS News found.",
      "Arizona-based Next League Program's website says that clients will become eligible candidates for EB-1A visas in \"a matter of a few months,\" and previously promised that participants will become authors of at least one book, over 100 articles and become a founder of an institution with a patent to their name. Its owner, Ranjeet Mudholkar, says that 56 individuals who completed the Next League Program received EB-1A visas.",
      "Two former participants shared receipts showing they paid about $10,000 to enroll. Company lawyers said in court documents that it earned $1 million in revenue in 2024.",
      "\"In my mind it was like, I will get a helping hand to accomplish those things with little time from my end,\" said one former participant, referring to the website's promises. He added that he believed the program's director had connections with journals and award companies that would help him achieve the credentials.",
      "He and another participant who spoke with CBS News requested their names be withheld because they signed a non-disparagement agreement.",
      "In return for their payments, they received dozens of hours of pre-recorded videos with advice on how to hone their areas of expertise and prepare their applications. Neither said they thought the guidance was adequate to build the resume the program's website advertised, and neither received the one-on-one coaching they said they were promised, which required making their way through the prerecorded content first.",
      "They soon came to believe that some Next League participants were buying their credentials, they told CBS News.",
      "At least seven successful EB-1A applicants who completed the program received the same vanity award, called the Globee Business Award, a review by CBS News found. Immigration attorneys told CBS News that although the award's website claims it has a \"rigorous and comprehensive judging process,\" it is easily obtained by those who pay a fee.",
      "At least two of those individuals had published scholarly articles in an India-based journal whose website promises to publish peer-reviewed papers within four hours of submission after publication fees were received. One of them told CBS News their review took a few days, and that she chose it because it had lower submission fees.",
      "Richardson, the academic fraud researcher, reviewed the journal and described it as \"predatory,\" identifying several alleged red flags to CBS News. A genuine peer review process takes months, often longer than a year, and there is no guarantee after an article is submitted to a legitimate journal that it will be sent out for peer review or that it will be published, he said.",
      "The journal's editors told CBS News they do not guarantee publication and accept roughly half of all submissions.",
      "When asked about purchased credentials, Mudholkar wrote in a statement to CBS News that the company \"does not sell, require, or mandate any specific awards, journals, or publications, nor does it submit evidence without legal review and advisement,\" and that \"participants retain agency over where they publish.\"",
      "A few of the Next League Program participants also set up a professional organization, the American Association of Information Technology Professionals. Mudholkar agreed to be the chairman, so they would have a U.S. citizen on paper as its leader, he told CBS News. Being a member of a professional organization or society meets one of the EB-1A criteria.",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Mudholkar disputed the idea that Next League Program's sole purpose is to help visa hopefuls meet these criteria.",
      "\"You really need to be an expert in your field,\" he said. \"We are looking for people who have changed lives.\"",
      "He described the program as a \"transformation coaching program\" that follows a process he patented, and said that he encourages applicants to view the visa as a \"milestone\" in becoming the best version of themselves.",
      "Mudholkar also repeatedly emphasized that the company's status as an alternative business structure in Arizona lends it a layer of regulatory overview other companies don't have. The structure allows non-lawyers to run a company that provides legal services, and requires getting a license from the state Supreme Court.",
      "In interviews, two former participants Mudholkar referred to CBS News praised the program and credited it with helping them get an EB-1A visa. But multiple others wrote on social media or in complaints to the Arizona attorney general's office that they felt they were scammed.",
      "\"As with any selective, high-intensity program, experiences vary. Public praise and criticism both exist,\" Mudholkar wrote to CBS News.",
      "Profile building services can blur the line of what's considered fraudulent.",
      "\"Having an attorney or career coach help you apply to legitimate opportunities that can raise an applicants' profile is not wrong,\" immigration attorney Loren Locke said. \"That line between what's appropriate like profile building, what's fair-game versus what's shady, it can be difficult to spot.\"",
      "A yearslong backlog meets a USCIS crackdown",
      "Federal law sets annual limits for each visa category. In FY 2025, the cap was 140,000 employment-based visas, including EB-1A, with no more than 7% going to nationals of one single country, regardless of its population.",
      "That can create huge backlogs, particularly for applicants from India and China, where demand for U.S. employment-based visas is high. Many of the services and advertisements CBS News reviewed appeared to target Indian nationals, who have to wait years to receive certain visas.",
      "The EB-1 visa, of which EB-1A is a subcategory, is less backlogged than the EB-2 visa, which is reserved for those with \"exceptional ability,\" but does not require the same level of acclaim as the EB-1A.",
      "That's helped make EB-1A \u2014 and the marketplace of services around it \u2014 more popular.",
      "\"They've been put in a situation just that's super untenable, which increases desperation, which increases risk taking.\" Locke said.",
      "The vast majority of EB-1A applicants are not fraudulent, said Melissa Warburton, an immigration attorney who left USCIS last year. Investigations into EB-1A fraud, which Warburton said predate the current administration, are coinciding with a broader crackdown on fraud in visa applications.",
      "\"We are going to be here with our agents investigating large scale fraud patterns,\" said USCIS director Joseph Edlow in an October interview with CBS News's Camilo Montoya-Galvez.",
      "In its recent hiring push for immigration service officers, USCIS created the new title of \"homeland defenders.\" Its informational webpage includes a video of Edlow saying the agency is \"declaring war on fraud.\"",
      "USCIS announced in early December it was launching a new vetting center focused on \"more thorough supplemental review of immigration applications and petitions.\"",
      "It is not clear how much of this effort will be directed toward EB-1A petitions, which make up less than 1% of the total applications USCIS processes each year.",
      "\"USCIS is strengthening the integrity of all immigrant worker programs with increased screening and vetting in support of President Trump's promise to protect American jobs and workers,\" Tragesser, the agency spokesperson, wrote to CBS News. \"Anti-fraud measures apply to EB-1A as they do to all immigration benefit categories.\"",
      "This month, the agency will propose a new regulation that will, among other changes, \"update provisions governing extraordinary ability,\" \"modernize outdated provisions\" and \"clarify evidentiary requirements\" for the visa.",
      "USCIS may now be going back and reevaluating some EB-1A applications it already approved to check for fraud, immigration attorneys and the former USCIS employees said. The agency can revoke a visa, and even initiate a denaturalization process, if it can prove willful misrepresentation or fraud.",
      "\"We don't know to what extent people have done this,\" said immigration attorney Evan Law, \"but if they did commit fraud, it will come back to them eventually, in my view.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 14 Jan 2026 19:27:03 -0500",
    "summary": "After the meeting, Denmark's foreign minister said they're eager to work with the U.S. while respecting the \"red lines of the Kingdom of Denmark.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. and Denmark still have \"fundamental\" differences over the future of Greenland, but will continue to talk, Denmark's foreign minister said after a White House meeting Wednesday amid President Trump's push to take over the Arctic island.",
      "Denmark's foreign minister, Lars Loekke Rasmussen, met with Greenland's minister for foreign affairs, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials. Loekke Rasmussen described the meeting as a \"frank but also constructive discussion\" on security long-term security in Greenland.",
      "The Danish official said they've agreed to establish a high-level working group to determine a way forward on Greenland, as Mr. Trump remains intent on acquiring the semi-autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark. Loekke Rasmussen said they \"still have a fundamental disagreement, but we also agree to disagree.\"",
      "\"There is clearly a disagreement,\" he said in a press conference with reporters in Washington. \"We agree that it makes sense to try to sit down on a high level to explore whether there are possibilities to accommodate the concerns of the president while we at the same time respect the red lines of the Kingdom of Denmark.\"",
      "\"Whether that is doable, I don't know,\" Loekke Rasmussen said, adding he hopes they can \"take down the temperature.\" The Danes asked for the meeting.",
      "Loekke Rasmussen said he agrees that the security situation in the Arctic has changed, and said he's \"eager\" to work with the U.S. on security improvements. But the framework for improving Arctic security through NATO already exists, he said, and the U.S. acquiring Greenland is \"absolutely not necessary.\"",
      "Vivian Motzfeldt, Greenland's minister of foreign affairs, told reporters it's never been more important to strengthen their ties with the U.S., \"but that doesn't mean that we want to be owned by the United States.\"",
      "Asked if he would respect the red lines set forth by Greenland and Denmark, Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, \"Well, we're going to see what happens with Greenland,\" adding that he hasn't yet been briefed on the meeting.",
      "\"We need Greenland for national security, so we're going to see what happens,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Asked whether he would leave NATO over the Greenland issue, the president said he wouldn't broadcast his options.",
      "The meeting came one day after Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said at a news conference, \"If we have to choose between the United States and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he wants to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, citing national security reasons. He repeated that again on Wednesday morning, saying \"it is vital for the Golden Dome that we are building\" and that \"NATO should be leading the way for us to get it.\"",
      "\"IF WE DON'T, RUSSIA OR CHINA WILL, AND THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!\" Mr. Trump said in a post on Truth Social.",
      "\"NATO becomes far more formidable and effective with Greenland in the hands of the UNITED STATES,\" he said. \"Anything less than that is unacceptable.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters that if Greenland's premier said the territory wanted to stay part of Denmark, \"that's their problem.\"",
      "\"I disagree with him,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I don't know who he is, don't know anything about him, but that's going to be a big problem for him.\"",
      "Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have stated Greenland is \"not for sale,\" which has led Trump officials to say that the administration is considering all options, including military force.",
      "\"I'd love to make a deal with them. It's easier,\" Mr. Trump said Sunday. \"But one way or the other, we're going to have Greenland.\" Rubio has downplayed the possibility of military force to acquire Greenland.",
      "Vance visited Greenland last year. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday that the Trump administration is applying \"completely unacceptable pressure from our closest ally.\"",
      "Frederiksen\u00a0said earlier this month that an American military move to seize control of Greenland would amount to the end of the NATO military alliance. Denmark is a NATO member, and NATO's Article 5 states that if a NATO ally suffers an armed attack, all members will consider it an attack on them as well and do what they need to aid the attacked nation.",
      "Tensions were high ahead of the meeting, as was concern about a further fracturing of the relationship with the U.S. NATO ally, sources familiar with the situation told CBS News. The Danish government expected to present an offer for enhanced cooperation with the U.S. and access in Greenland in terms of military presence and NATO presence, the sources said.",
      "The Danes wanted clarity on what the U.S. is pressing for beyond that offer, and whether a financial plus-up is being demanded, the sources said. They wanted to know if Mr. Trump's intent is to have control or political ownership, which concerns them, given the clear objection of the Greenlandic government to either. Greenlandic officials have been clear that they want the island to belong to Denmark.",
      "A European official from a nearby country said there is some concern that Denmark may be miscalculating by demanding this meeting with the U.S. because it could formalize and potentially harden positions around what could otherwise be rhetorical pressure by Mr. Trump.",
      "On Wednesday, Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky took to the Senate floor to voice his disapproval of intervening in Greenland's affairs and to emphasize the importance of maintaining a united NATO alliance.",
      "\"Unless and until the President can demonstrate otherwise, then the proposition at hand today is very straightforward: incinerating the hard-won trust of loyal allies in exchange for no meaningful change in U.S. access to the Arctic,\" McConnell said. \"That's allies \u2013 plural. Because this is about more than Greenland. It's about more than America's relationship with its highly capable Nordic allies. It's about whether the United States intends to face a constellation of strategic adversaries with capable friends \u2026 or commit an unprecedented act of strategic self-harm and go it alone.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration announced Wednesday it will stop giving out visas to nationals of dozens of countries who are seeking to move to the U.S. permanently, escalating its broad crackdown on legal immigration.",
      "The State Department, which oversees visa processing at U.S. embassies and consulates, said it would indefinitely pause the issuance of immigrant visas requested by citizens of 75 countries, halting legal immigration channels for roughly 38% of all nations in the world.",
      "Officials said the pause would apply to immigrant visas, meaning those requested by people abroad who have been sponsored by American relatives or employers to move to the U.S. permanently. The suspension, officials said, does not affect temporary visas requested by would-be tourists and travelers seeking to come to the U.S. on a short-term basis.",
      "The State Department said the 75 countries were chosen as part of an effort to bar the entry of immigrants who were likely to rely on public assistance once in the U.S. Officials said they would examine immigration procedures during the pause to better identify and bar would-be immigrants from those countries who were likely to become a \"public charge\" \u2014 or an economic burden \u2014 on the U.S.",
      "\"The State Department will pause immigrant visa processing from 75 countries whose migrants take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates,\" the department said Wednesday. \"The freeze will remain active until the U.S. can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people.\"",
      "The State Department did not formally publish a full list of the 75 affected nations, but said Somalia, Haiti, Iran and Eritrea are among them. A list first reported by Fox News, and confirmed by the State Department to CBS News, includes countries like Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Egypt, Guatemala, Pakistan and Senegal.",
      "The list of countries also include Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belize, Bhutan, Bosnia, Burma, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dominica, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Iraq, Jamaica, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Macedonia, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Uruguay, Uzbekistan and Yemen.",
      "The pause on immigrant visas is set to take effect next week, on Jan. 21, according to a U.S. official and a congressional official briefed on the move.",
      "Longstanding federal law bars immigrants from coming to the U.S. or getting lawful permanent residency if they are deemed to become a public charge. Historically, the restriction has been applied in limited cases, such as when immigrants would require long-term institutionalized care in the U.S.",
      "But dating back to President Trump's first administration, his aides have sought to dramatically expand who can be considered ineligible to immigrate to the U.S. on public charge grounds.",
      "While the Trump administration has launched a highly-visible crackdown on illegal immigration across the U.S., it has simultaneously issued a series of policies to sharply restrict legal immigration, with less fanfare.",
      "The latest version of Mr. Trump's \"travel ban\" proclamation, for example, fully bans or restricts immigration and travel from 39 countries, most of them in Asia and Africa. His administration has also frozen refugee admissions, except for a few groups, mainly Afrikaners in South Africa.",

    "published": "Wed, 14 Jan 2026 17:13:22 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has not yet disclosed many details about the deal.",
    "story": [
      "The first U.S. sale of Venezuelan oil, valued at $500 million, has been completed, according to an administration official.",
      "The details of the sale haven't yet been disclosed, although the official said more sales are expected in the coming days and weeks. President Trump has said the U.S. will sell 30 million to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil, in partnership with U.S. companies.",
      "White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement that President Trump had \"brokered a historic energy deal with Venezuela\" after Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's arrest \"that will benefit the American and Venezuelan people.\" She said Mr. Trump's team is facilitating discussions with oil companies \"that are ready and willing to make unprecedented investments to restore Venezuela's oil infrastructure.\"",
      "The president\u00a0met with a number of top U.S. oil executives at the White House last week to discuss their needs and concerns. At that gathering, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods told the president that his company had its assets seized under two previous waves of nationalization in Venezuela, and reentering a third time \"would require some pretty significant changes from what we've historically seen here and what is currently the state.\" He called the country \"uninvestable\" until changes are made to the country's legal system and commercial structure.",
      "The White House has presented a strategy to sell millions of barrels of sanctioned Venezuelan oil and control the proceeds, relying on investments from American oil companies to revive the country's oil infrastructure. Proceeds from the sale are to be split among Venezuelans, U.S. companies and the U.S. government, at the discretion of the federal government, the White House has said. The president has said all proceeds going to Venezuela would be used to purchase only American-made products.",
      "\"They know the risks,\" Mr. Trump said of the oil companies. \"There are risks. We're going to help them out. We're going to make it real easy. They're going to be there for a long time. We're going to be there, together, for a long, long time.\"",
      "The U.S. has placed heavy sanctions on Venezuelan oil amid the United States' effort to overhaul the country's government and natural resources.",
      "The majority of Americans, according to a CBS News/YouGov poll, say the U.S. should have not much or no control of Venezuela following the operation to extract and arrest Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife.",

    "published": "Wed, 14 Jan 2026 16:58:38 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration's push to change the Defense Department's name to the Department of War could cost nine figures, according to a new estimate by Congress' budget watchdog.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's push to change the Defense Department's name to the Department of War could cost nine figures, according to a new estimate by Congress' budget watchdog.",
      "President Trump signed an executive order last September\u00a0to start the process of renaming the federal government's largest employer. The agency now refers to itself as the Department of War on its website and in many official communications, though the agency is still formally called the Department of Defense under federal law.",
      "The cost of the renaming effort could range from $10 million to $125 million, depending on how broadly it is applied, the Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday following a request from Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.",
      "The total price tag could vary depending on how broadly the agency decides to apply the new name and how rapidly the renaming is rolled out, the office said in an 11-page report.",
      "The lower-end $10 million figure would pay for a \"modest implementation\" of Mr. Trump's order that just covers the Office of the Secretary of Defense and its departments, according to the CBO. That would cover the cost of replacing \"digital templates, office signage, and ceremonial materials\" within the office, though the CBO said many of those costs would likely be covered by delaying other budgeted expenses.",
      "The $125 million estimate assumes the name change is applied \"aggressively\" to both the Office of the Secretary of Defense and \"defense-wide agencies\" that support the military. Many of those departments \u2014 like the Defense Intelligence Agency \u2014 have \"defense\" in their names, the CBO notes, so the cost depends in part on whether their names are also changed. Last year, for example, the Defense Acquisition University was changed to the Warfighting Acquisition University.",
      "Also unclear is whether the department will \"rapidly\" change its name, requiring it to spend more money to immediately replace signs and stationary, or if it will more gradually roll out the new name \"as existing stocks [are] exhausted,\" the CBO noted.",
      "The CBO said it didn't get information from the Pentagon about the renaming. But a report sent to Congress found $1.9 million in renaming expenses over a 30-day period for five departments within the Office of the Secretary of Defense \u2014 which the CBO cautioned could be incomplete. The CBO also looked at the cost of prior renaming efforts, including a decision to rename several Army bases with Confederate names that was reversed by the Trump administration.",
      "The military has not offered its own estimated cost for the renaming bid. CBS News has reached out to the Pentagon for comment.",
      "After Mr. Trump's executive order was signed, a department official told CBS News: \"The cost estimate will fluctuate as we carry out President Trump's directive to establish the Department of War's name. We will have a clearer estimate to report at a later time.\"",
      "At the time, Mr. Trump told reporters the name change wouldn't cost \"a lot.\"",
      "\"You know, we know how to rebrand without having to go crazy,\" the president said. \"We don't have to re-carve a mountain or anything...We're going to start changing the stationery as it comes due, and lots of things like that. We're not going to be doing things like have been done in the past, when they change the name of forts that shouldn't have been changed.\"",
      "By comparison, the military's\u00a0total annual budget is around $900 billion.",
      "Merkley, the top Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, called the renaming process wasteful and \"performative government at its worst.\"",
      "\"Instead of prioritizing bringing down the cost of groceries or health care, Trump and his cronies are focused on vanity projects like renaming the Department of Defense to the Department of War \u2013 potentially costing American taxpayers upwards of $125 million,\" Merkley said in a statement.",
      "The name Department of War isn't new. From the 1790s to the 1940s, the U.S. military was split into a War Department that oversaw the Army, and a Navy Department that oversaw naval forces and, later, the Marine Corps. After World War II, the two departments were merged into a single entity known as the Department of Defense.",
      "In public remarks in September, Mr. Trump called that postwar renaming \"woke.\"",
      "\"It's gonna fight to win, not to lose. We're gonna go on offense, not just on defense,\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said, adding that the U.S. will \"raise up warriors, not just defenders.\"",
      "Chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said at the time that the change was a \"nod to our proud heritage\" and an acknowledgement of the department's \"core mission: winning wars.\"",
      "\"This has always been our mission, and while we hope for peace, we will prepare for war,\" Parnell said. \"Defense isn't enough\u2014we've got to be ready to strike and dominate our enemies.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 14 Jan 2026 16:48:49 -0500",
    "summary": "A panel for the U.S. Central District Court of California ruled Democrats can proceed in using their redrawn congressional maps for the 2026 midterm elections.",
    "story": [
      "A federal three-judge panel for the U.S. Central District Court of California upheld Prop 50, ruling that Democrats can proceed in using their newly redrawn congressional maps\u00a0in the state for the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "The court found \"that the evidence presented reflects that Proposition 50 was exactly what it was billed as: a political gerrymander designed to flip five Republican-held seats to the Democrats.\"",
      "The judges rejected Republican plaintiffs' claims that the maps had been drawn to favor Latino voters over other voting groups. The opinion was written by Judge Josephine Stanton, with Judge Kenneth Lee dissenting in the 2-1 decision.",
      "The Trump administration and California Republicans sued Gov. Gavin Newsom and California Secretary of State Shirley Weber, claiming the recently approved congressional maps were drawn to favor Hispanic voters over other racial groups. Republicans argued race was a predominant factor in drawing the district boundaries, in violation of the 14th and 15th Amendments.",
      "Republicans had asked the court for a preliminary injunction that would block the maps from being used in 2026.",
      "In a statement after the ruling, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said, \"Republicans' weak attempt to silence voters failed. California voters overwhelmingly supported Prop 50 \u2014 to respond to Trump's rigging in Texas \u2014 and that is exactly what this court concluded.\"",
      "Rob Bonta, the state's attorney general, pointed out that there have so far been no successful challenges to the measure.",
      "\"Today's decision upholds the will of the people. It also means that, to date, every single challenge against Proposition 50 has failed,\" Bonta said in a statement.",
      "In November, California voters backed the new maps through the ballot measure known as Proposition 50,\u00a0 voting to amend their state's constitution so that the new map could be used from 2026 to 2030. The new map shifts five of California's Republican U.S. House seats to be more favorable to Democrats in the midterm elections this year.",
      "California Democrats argued in court that the new congressional maps were drawn for partisan reasons and to shore up support for vulnerable Democratic congressional candidates. They said they were retaliating against\u00a0Texas' redistricting legislation, signed into law in August, which aims to help Republicans secure five additional House seats.",
      "In December, the Supreme Court allowed Texas to keep its redrawn maps. In its ruling, the Supreme Court said that \"Texas adopted the first new map, then California responded with its own map for the stated purpose of counteracting what Texas had done.\"",
      "In a concurring opinion, Justice Samuel Alito, who was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, wrote that \"it is indisputable \u2013 that the impetus for the adoption of the Texas map (like the map subsequently adopted in California) was partisan advantage pure and simple.\"",
      "Ahead of Wednesday's ruling, legal sources familiar with California's case contended that Republicans would face an uphill battle in court, given the Supreme Court's go-ahead ruling on the Texas case, and would likely not be able to meet the burden of showing that race was the predominant factor in redistricting.",
      "At the core of Republicans' case in court were public statements made by Paul Mitchell, head of the consulting firm tasked to draw the congressional maps for California. Mitchell told outside groups he intended to bolster Latino voters in the 13th Congressional District.",
      "After the closing arguments in December, Bill Essayli, the U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, told CBS News that Mitchell's intent in using race as a factor was clear from his statements.",
      "\"In this case, we do have an admission from Paul Mitchell that that was his intent, and that was his purpose,\" Essayli said.",
      "During the closing hearing, U.S. District Judge Josephine L. Staton pushed back on the federal government's argument, raising California voters's support for the ballot measure.",
      "Mitchell did not testify in court during the three-day hearing, despite Republicans' attempts to call him as a witness.",
      "The case has been closely watched as the race for control of the U.S. House in next year's midterm elections gets underway. Along with California and Texas, several other states have also engaged in gerrymandering efforts.",

      "The FBI executed a search warrant at the home of a Washington Post reporter this week as part of an investigation into a federal employee who is suspected of mishandling classified information, Attorney General Pam Bondi said.",
      "In a statement, Bondi said the warrant was executed at the request of the Pentagon.",
      "\"The leaker is currently behind bars,\" she said. \"I am proud to work alongside Secretary Hegseth on this effort. The Trump Administration will not tolerate illegal leaks of classified information that, when reported, pose a grave risk to our Nation's national security and the brave men and women who are serving our country.\"",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed on social media that law enforcement executed the search warrant Wednesday and alleged the journalist had received \"classified, sensitive military information from a government contractor \u2014 endangering our warfighters and compromising America's national security. The alleged leaker was arrested this week and is in custody. As this is an ongoing investigation, we will have no further comment.\"",
      "The decision to execute a search warrant at the home of a journalist is highly unusual, and could escalate the already tense relationship between the media and the Trump administration.",
      "It was unclear why the Justice Department felt the need to search the home of a reporter even though the target of the investigation has already been charged and detained.",
      "Historically in Espionage Act investigations into leaks of classified information, the department has pursued the leakers, but not the journalists who receive the classified information.",
      "In April 2025, Bondi issued a memo that made it easier for prosecutors investigating leaks to the news media to subpoena records and testimony from journalists, rescinding a prior policy under former Attorney General Merrick Garland.",
      "Under those regulations, prosecutors in criminal investigations are allowed to use subpoenas, court orders and search warrants to compel \"production of information and testimony by and relating to members of the news media,\" the memo stated at the time.",
      "The Biden administration had previously imposed new restrictions that made it much harder to seize reporters' phones and email records, after the department faced criticism in Trump's first term for secretly serving subpoenas on both journalists and congressional staff members in connection with leak investigations.",
      "The FBI conducted the search at the Alexandria, Virginia, home of reporter Hannah Natanson, who writes about the federal workforce for the newspaper, according to the Washington Post.",
      "The Washington Post said that federal agents searched her home and her devices, seizing her phone, two laptops and a Garmin watch.",
      "Natanson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "A Justice Department official told CBS News in a statement that the search of her home is \"consistent with the law.\"",
      "According to The Washington Post, the warrant shows the investigation is targeting Aurelio Perez-Lugones, a system administrator in Maryland who holds a top secret security clearance.",
      "Perez-Lugones, a government contractor in Annapolis, Maryland, and former member of the U.S. Navy, was already charged on Jan. 8 in a criminal complaint with violating the Espionage Act for unlawfully retaining national defense information.",
      "Perez-Lugones, who holds a top secret security clearance, is accused of accessing a classified report related to an unnamed foreign country, taking a screen shot and printing it.",
      "He also allegedly accessed another report related to a government operational activity and took notes on a yellow notepad.",
      "During a search of his Laurel, Maryland, home and car that same day, the FBI found a document marked as \"secret\" in his lunchbox, the criminal complaint says. More documents marked as \"secret\" were also discovered in his basement, the complaint said.",
      "A hearing in Perez-Lugones' case has been scheduled for Thursday in Baltimore.",
      "A Justice Department official told CBS News that the Washington Post reporter had been communicating with Perez-Lugones.",
      "\"This is about the unauthorized disclosure of classified information, and we will hold him accountable for his extremely serious crimes. At the time of his arrest, Perez-Lugones was actively communicating with the reporter on his mobile device, and in this chat, there was classified information,\" the official added.",
      "A spokesperson for the Post said that the paper is reviewing and monitoring the situation.",
      "Several former Justice Department officials told CBS that the decision to search a reporter's home, particularly in a case where the alleged leaker has already been charged, raises First Amendment concerns and appears to be a possible effort to intimidate the news media.",
      "David Aaron, a former prosecutor at the Justice Department's National Security Division who previously handled media leak investigations, said executing a search warrant at a journalist's home is uncommon, but not prohibited by law, either.",
      "\"It is highly unusual to search the residence of a member of the news media in a leak investigation,\" he told CBS News. \"There is, however, no absolute rule against it.\"",

    "story": [
      "Thousands of federal grants supporting mental health and addiction treatment programs were suddenly terminated late Tuesday, sources told CBS News.",
      "The abrupt cancellations at the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration impacted 2,706 of the agency's discretionary grants valued at around $1.9 billion, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "President Trump's political appointees moved to terminate the funding, not career officials working for SAMHSA, according to the source.",
      "CBS News obtained a termination notice sent by a top SAMHSA official to one grant recipient which outlined said the agency was \"terminating some of its awards, in order to better prioritize agency resources\" toward priorities \"that address the rising rates of mental illness and substance abuse conditions, overdose, and suicide\".",
      "\"This was not SAMSHA's idea,\" the source said, noting that many of the canceled grants addressed those priorities. \"This was money going to people on the ground who are providing mental health treatment, substance use treatment, recovery support, and prevention resources, which this administration says is a priority.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Department of Health and Human Services for more information and comment.",
      "SAMHSA, which is a branch of the Department of Health and Human Services, is at the forefront of efforts to improve mental health and address substance abuse across the country. At the national level, the agency leads public health initiatives geared toward reducing the burden of substance abuse and mental illness on communities, while also distributing funds to states and local entities for mental health and addiction services, according to its website.",
      "A source said that among the newly canceled grants is one that provided $15 million per year to the Opioid Response Network, a program that offers evidence-based education and training to local authorities managing various types of substance use intervention, including prevention, treatment and recovery services. Another $6 million grant to a program called Building Communities of Recovery, which funds community-based resources to increase the availability and quality of long-term recovery support for people with substance use disorder, was canceled, too.",
      "CBS News reached out to the Opioid Response Network and a representative for the Building Communities of Recovery program at SAMHSA.",
      "This latest funding loss comes after the Trump administration's sweeping Medicaid cuts, which impacted a broad array of public health services including some focused on mental health and addiction. Those cuts are set to take effect in full later this year.",

    "summary": "Experts tell CBS News what sort of options President Trump has to respond to Iran's brutal crackdown on protesters.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has warned of \"very strong action\" against Iran if it hangs accused anti-government protesters, and he told its people that U.S. \"help is on its way\" as CBS News learned that the crackdown to quash the unrest may have killed upwards of 12,000 people.",
      "While the administration has made it clear that Mr. Trump will have a number of options at his disposal, from conventional strikes by the U.S. military to cyberwarfare, the White House has given no hint as to what the president will do. In the meantime, the U.S. government does appear to be bracing for possible retaliation by Tehran.",
      "The U.S. State Department issued a security alert on Wednesday urging U.S. citizens to \"leave Iran now,\" or to keep a low profile and ensure adequate supplies of food, water and medications if remaining in the country. The new advisory added to an existing Level 4 travel alert\u00a0\u2014   the highest issued by the State Department, that was put in place in early December, warning Americans not to visit Iran due to the risks of terrorism, civil unrest and wrongful detention.",
      "The Pentagon, meanwhile, has ordered a reduction of personnel at the biggest U.S. military base in the Middle East \u2014 Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, just across the Persian Gulf from Iran \u2014   as a \"precautionary measure,\" a U.S. official told CBS News national security correspondent Charlie D'Agata.",
      "While Mr. Trump's next move on Iran remained unclear after a National Security Council meeting on Tuesday, military officials told CBS News the White House was keeping all options on the table, including military, technological and psychological options. Below is a more detailed look at what some of those options could actually involve, and how they might be perceived in the region.",
      "Military strikes",
      "If Mr. Trump decides to order U.S. military action against Iran's military and security forces, the Islamic Republic's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) would likely be among the top targets, according to Alex Vatanka, Iran director of the Middle East Institute in Washington, D.C.",
      "Vatanka told CBS News the IRGC, along with its feared \"Basij\" volunteer paramilitary units, \"are essentially the brains and the muscle behind\" any crackdown launched by the regime.",
      "\"If you can target those, whether it's through kinetic actions, offensive cyber capabilities, psychological warfare against them \u2026 that is important,\" Vatanka said, adding that Mr. Trump would be \"sending a clear message\" with such a move.",
      "Iran's regular army may be a less likely U.S. target, Vatanka said, because it is composed largely of conscripted young men who join and serve for two years, and thus may be less loyal to the regime overall.",
      "The IRGC, however, operates differently, as a parallel religious force under the direct control of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Created specifically to protect the Islamic Republic system that came to power with the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the IRGC has at least one major base in every one of Iran's 31 provinces, two in Tehran, and tens of thousands of smaller bases nationwide.",
      "If the U.S. military does strike Iran, Vatanka says President Trump's real priorities may be revealed by the choice of targets. If it is military sites or Iran's nuclear facilities, which the U.S. already attacked in \"Operation Midnight Hammer\" in June, he said it would come across as a show of support for one of the Trump administration's closest regional allies, rather than for the Iranian people..",
      "\"That's helping the United States, maybe in terms of its strategic aims or friends like Israel. It's not helping the protest movements,\" said Vatanka. \"People will be looking at it cynically, saying he's taking advantage of the moment of chaos in Iran to advance goals that might be good goals for the United States, but certainly it's not what he's promising the protest movement.\"",
      "Going for the top: Targeting the ayatollah",
      "Ayatollah Khamenei could also find himself in the sights of the U.S. military.",
      "The top leaders of Iran's proxy groups Hamas and Hezbollah have already been assassinated in recent years, and\u00a0 Khamenei \"could very well be a target,\" according to Bilal Saab, a Middle East political and security expert and the Senior Managing Director of the TRENDS Research & Advisory organization in Washington, D.C.",
      "\"If you believe in that decapitation strategy, it might be the best way forward that you take this man out. And remember, he's been there since 1989. So, for 37 years, this man has been the brains behind what Iran has done in the region, at home and abroad. And if you take him out, you might bring about the conditions where Iran either has a political transformation to a different political system, or whatever is left after Khamenei in terms of leaders.\"",
      "If the White House pursued this course of action, it would track with the U.S. capture of Venezuela's former President Nicolas Maduro earlier this month. While Maduro's former vice-president Delcy Rodriguez was quickly sworn as acting president, Mr. Trump has declared the U.S. \"in charge\" of Venezuela.",
      "Maduro, however, had already been indicted on federal criminal charges in the U.S. when he was captured, and he was arraigned just a couple days later in a court in New York.",
      "Ayatollah Khamenei has been heavily sanctioned by the U.S. government and accused of a litany of nefarious actions across the Middle East, but he has not been charged with any crimes by American courts.",
      "Cyber and psychological warfare",
      "Beyond bombs and military strikes, the White House is also weighing cyberattack options, U.S. officials say.",
      "\"You go after command and control nodes and try to disrupt the ability of the Iranian security personnel to communicate amongst themselves,\" Saab said of the likely objective of such operations. \"This is the typical classic target when you think about cyber operations, and then maybe also try to distract the communication between leadership \u2014   political leadership \u2014   and, of course, their lieutenants on the ground.",
      "This would be using the psychological weapon of fear, Saab told CBS News.",
      "\"You're trying to influence the calculus of loyalists, of people serving the regime, right? And this is the typical dynamic of offering them negative and positive incentives. Positive being, you defect, then you can have some kind of a political future, or at least we won't kill you. Negative is precisely that, all sorts of punishment, ranging from elimination to irrelevance, to going after their property and going after everything that they hold dear to them.\"",
      "And President Trump's own way of doing things \u2014   whether on purpose or by accident \u2014   may be keeping the Iranian regime wondering.",
      "As White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday: \"Nobody knows what President Trump is going to do except for President Trump.\"",
      "\"They don't know which way he's going to go,\" said Saab, \"and that's all part of psychological warfare.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. is withdrawing a small number of personnel as a \"precautionary measure\" from a major U.S. airbase in Qatar, a U.S. official tells CBS News. The step comes amid President Trump's threats to target Iran for killing anti-government protesters in a brutal crackdown.",
      "The Al Udeid airbase in Doha, Qatar, is the forward operating headquarters for U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces across the Middle East. The reduction comes as Iran has already threatened to retaliate against any U.S. military action by targeting U.S. troops.",
      "President Trump said in an interview with \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Doukoupil that he will take \"very strong action\" if the regime starts to hang protesters in response to the massive demonstrations.",
      "CBS News reported earlier this week that the president has received briefings on a wide array of military and covert tools to target Iran beyond conventional airstrikes. Such measures could include cyber and psychological operations that could occur simultaneously with traditional military force.",
      "The precautionary drawdown at Al Udeid comes as the president weighs options and watches for what Iran's response might be.",
      "Reuters first reported the U.S. military was reducing its presence at the base.",
      "The military similarly withdrew personnel at Al Udeid last summer around the time of the U.S. bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities. Following that bombing, coined Operation Midnight Hammer, Iran retaliated by targeting Al Udeid with about a dozen ballistic missiles. Nearly all of the missiles were intercepted and no one was hurt in the attack, partly because of the reduction of troops.",
      "The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Dan Caine in a press conference following the attack last June said the U.S. military had reduced to \"a minimum force posture\" across the region, including Al Udeid. Most personnel had moved off the base, leaving only a handful of soldiers.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court ruled 7-2 in favor of Illinois Rep. Michael Bost, a Republican.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday revived an Illinois congressman's lawsuit challenging a state law that allows mail-in ballots received up to 14 days after Election Day to be counted.",
      "The high court divided 7-2 in siding with Congressman Michael Bost, an Illinois Republican who challenged his state's law for counting late-arriving ballots. The high court found that he has the legal right to sue over the rules that govern the counting of votes in his election to Congress. Chief Justice John Roberts authored the opinion for the majority, and Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.",
      "The court's decision reverses a ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, which found that Bost lacked the legal standing to sue and affirmed a district court decision dismissing Bost's case. The Supreme Court sent the case back to the lower courts for further proceedings.",
      "\"Under Article III of the Constitution, plaintiffs must have a 'personal stake' in a case to have standing to sue,\" Roberts wrote. \"They must, in other words, be able to answer a basic question: 'What's in it to you?' Congressman Bost has an obvious answer: He is a candidate for office. And a candidate has a personal stake in the rules that govern the counting of votes in his election.\"",
      "The decision from the Supreme Court allows Bost's challenge to Illinois' ballot-counting law to move forward. The legality of Illinois' law was not at issue in the case.",
      "The high court is, however, set to decide later in its term whether federal law prohibits states from counting mail-in ballots that arrive after Election Day in a case involving Mississippi's voting procedures.",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett agreed with the outcome of the case, but disagreed with the majority's reasoning. In a concurring opinion joined by Justice Elena Kagan, Barrett said the majority's decision was \"unmoored from precedent\" and \"unnecessary.\" She said that Bost can sue because he suffered a \"pocketbook injury,\" since the counting of late-arriving ballots required him to run his campaign for 14 more days and therefore cost him time, money and other resources.",
      "In a dissent joined by Sotomayor, Jackson cautioned that the ruling has \"far-reaching implications\" beyond Bost's election. She warned the decision will open the floodgates to election-related litigation brought by candidates and invites \"late-breaking judicial intervention into the political process.\"",
      "\"By carving out a bespoke rule for candidate-plaintiffs \u2014 granting them standing 'to challenge the rules that govern the counting of votes,' simply and solely because they are 'candidate[s] for office' \u2014 the court now complicates and destabilizes both our standing law and America's electoral processes,\" Jackson wrote.",
      "Bost and two presidential-elector nominees filed their original lawsuit in 2022 and alleged that Illinois' law that allowed ballots postmarked by, but received within two weeks of, the election to be counted violated federal law.",
      "A U.S. district court ruled that Bost did not have standing to sue and dismissed the lawsuit. The appeals court upheld that decision, finding in part that the harms to Bost were \"speculative.\"",
      "In arguing that he had the right to sue, Bost said that Illinois' extension of the mail-in ballot deadline harms candidates' chances for election and costs them money because it requires them to extend campaigns and get-out-the-vote efforts, as well as send campaign staff to oversee the counting of late-arriving ballots.",
      "The Supreme Court's majority agreed that candidates have \"concrete and particularized interest in the rules that govern the counting of votes in their elections, regardless whether those rules harm their electoral prospects or increase the costs of their campaigns.\"",
      "\"Their interest extends to the integrity of the election \u2014 and the democratic process by which they earn or lose the support of the people they seek to represent,\" Roberts wrote.",
      "The Trump administration backed Bost in the case. Illinois officials had urged the Supreme Court to uphold the lower court's decision.",
      "Illinois Solicitor General Jane Notz told the court during arguments in October that a ruling finding that candidates always have standing to challenge the rules that govern their elections would lead to \"chaos\" for election officials and force the federal courts to resolve \"abstract policy disputes.\"",

      "Republican Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, the committee's chairman, said the panel will move next Wednesday on holding the former president and former secretary of state in criminal contempt.",
      "\"We're going to hold both Clintons in criminal contempt of Congress,\" Comer told reporters Wednesday.",
      "If the committee votes to hold them in contempt, it would advance to the full House for a vote on whether to recommend the matter to the Justice Department for prosecution.",

      "In a separate eight-page letter to Comer, the Clintons' attorneys made it clear they would not appear for the closed-door questioning.",
      "\"President and Secretary Clinton have already provided the limited information they possess about Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell to the Committee,\" the Clintons' attorneys said in the letter dated Jan. 12, which was obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"They did so proactively and voluntarily, and despite the fact that the Subpoenas are invalid and legally unenforceable, untethered to a valid legislative purpose, unwarranted because they do not seek pertinent information, and an unprecedented infringement on the separation of powers,\" the letter said.",
      "In a separate letter to Comer on Tuesday that was signed by the Clintons, they noted that several other former officials were subpoenaed as part of the investigation and not forced to testify. In August, the committee also subpoenaed former Attorneys General Merrick Garland, Bill Barr, Alberto Gonzales, Jeff Sessions, Loretta Lynch and Eric Holder, and former FBI Directors James Comey and Robert Mueller.",

      "The Clintons' attorneys called the effort \"nothing more than a ploy to attempt to embarrass\" President Trump's political rivals. Last month, Mr. Trump\u00a0called on the Justice Department to release any Epstein-related materials that name Democrats to \"embarrass them.\"",
      "Bill Clinton has appeared in photos with Epstein and took a handful of trips with him decades ago, but has not been accused of any wrongdoing. The materials also contain references to Mr. Trump, who also has not been accused of any misconduct.",
      "\"No one's accusing Bill Clinton of any wrongdoing. We just have questions,\" Comer told reporters Tuesday after the former president failed to show up.",
      "The Clintons' legal team and the committee have been going back and forth for months over the requested depositions. The committee initially requested they appear in October, but then delayed the date until December. Both Clintons declined the December dates, citing the need to attend a funeral.",

    "published": "Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Every state will receive at least $100 million annually from the federal Rural Health Transformation fund, but some scored millions more based on their plans and willingness to pass policies embracing MAHA initiatives.",
    "story": [
      "Imagine starting the new year with the promise of at least a $147 million payout from the federal government.",
      "But there are strings attached.",
      "In late December, President Donald Trump's administration announced how much all 50 states would get under its new Rural Health Transformation Program, assigning them to use the money to fix systemic problems that leave rural Americans without access to good health care. Now, the clock is ticking.",
      "Within eight months, states must submit revised budgets, begin spending, and show the money is going to good use. Federal officials will begin reviewing state progress in late summer and announce 2027 funding levels by the end of October.",
      "The money \u2014 divided into unique allocations for each state, ranging from $147 million for New Jersey to $281 million for Texas \u2014 represents the first $10 billion installment from the five-year, $50 billion program. Congress created the fund as a last-minute sweetener in Mr. Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act last summer to offset the outsize fallout anticipated in rural communities from the statute's nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid spending cuts over the next decade.",
      "Federal officials crafted the fund to give states \"space to be creative,\" Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said on a call with reporters after announcing the funding Dec. 29. \"Some states will fail, and we will learn from that.\"",
      "The money was divided according to a complicated formula.",
      "In 2026, each state will receive an equal $100 million share under the law for the first half of the money, plus additional funding from the second half. Oz's staff steered payouts from the second portion based on each state's rural score, as well as results from a \"technical\" scoring system for project proposals.",
      "Within hours of the announcement, academics and researchers began to parse the awards to better understand why some states received more than others, including whether the awards reflected any partisanship or political favoritism.",
      "At first glance, total awards do not appear to favor states governed by either Republicans or Democrats. But one academic data analysis teased out the amount awarded for each state's technical score, which is the part determined by the discretion of agency officials.",
      "The analysis was performed at the University of North Carolina's Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, which specializes in rural health. A KFF Health News review of the Sheps Center data found that states with Republican governors tended to receive more money for the parts of their application based on the technical score. Democratic-controlled states crowded the bottom quarter of those technical score awards.",
      "Overall, though, the state awards reveal wild variation in how much money each state will get per rural resident, almost a hundredfold difference between the top and bottom.",
      "In an emailed statement to The Arizona Republic, a spokesperson for Arizona's Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs accused the administration of shortchanging rural residents in the state, which received $167 million this year from the program.",
      "CMS spokesperson Chris Krepich said in an emailed statement to KFF Health News that \"politics played no role in funding decisions.\"",
      "On the December call, Oz pushed states to start working on policy actions championed by the administration \u2014 such as approving presidential fitness tests and restricting food benefits \u2014 that could require legislative approval.",
      "Half of states promised to mandate the presidential fitness test, Oz said. Many states also proposed food waivers under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, which would limit low-nutrition items such as soda. He also said some states promised to teach health care professionals about nutrition. And others confirmed they will repeal certificate-of-need laws, which require companies to prove that new health facilities they want to open are necessary.",
      "Krepich said CMS' new Office of Rural Health Transformation is hiring program officers to serve as point people for three or four states. Many states are setting up their own offices to oversee the new funding.",
      "Oz highlighted Alabama's \"big maternity initiative with robotics doing ultrasounds\" and said states are tackling issues ranging from behavioral health to obesity.",
      "A KFF Health News review of state \"project abstracts\" and \"spotlights\" released by CMS shows that many states plan to address the workforce challenges in rural areas. Delaware, for example, plans to use its funding to create the state's first four-year medical school with a primary care-rural health track.",
      "A third of states said they want to improve electronic health records, and every state mentioned telehealth.",
      "Many state legislatures must pass laws to distribute the funding to their state offices. Meanwhile, state officials are hiring staff, organizing advisory committees, and preparing to dole out money.",
      "\"I'm excited about what's next,\" said Terry Scoggin, former interim chief executive of the Texas Organization of Rural & Community Hospitals, or TORCH. Texas received the biggest allocation. The money will bolster a rural hospital funding bill Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed last year, Scoggin said.",
      "More than two dozen cash-strapped rural hospitals in Texas have closed or been converted to clinics since 2005, a nationwide trend that hit the Lone Star State particularly hard. The state has the largest rural population in the United States. Texas' allocation amounts to about $66 per rural resident, according to a KFF policy analysis. By contrast, Rhode Island was granted about $6,300 per rural resident.",
      "Scoggin said he has \"a ton of concerns\" about companies taking the money instead of it helping rural hospitals and residents. \"I was blown away about how many for-profit companies reached out.\" The companies have also called rural hospitals and asked to work with them to apply for state money, he said.",
      "The awards should be judged on how they benefit rural residents because \"the stated goal of the program is to improve rural health,\" said Paula Chatterjee, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania who co-authored a Senate Finance Committee memo on the transformation fund.",
      "Researchers at the Sheps Center conducted the analysis to estimate how much money states received from the technical score, which is the portion of funding based on the quality of their proposals and state policy actions that align with \"Make America Healthy Again\" priorities.",
      "New Mexico won the least amount of technical funding, with less than 10% of its award based on the discretionary metrics. Alaska won the largest technical award, according to the Sheps Center data.",
      "Texas, Nebraska, New Hampshire, and Hawaii rounded out the top five recipients of technical funding. In addition to New Mexico, the other lowest technical awards went to Michigan, New Jersey, Arizona, and California.",
      "Mark Holmes, director of the Sheps Center, declined to comment on whether he saw any political bias in the awards but said the nuance in the final portion of discretionary awards based on technical scores is important because those dollars can be redistributed and potentially clawed back in future years.",
      "\"We can be fairly certain that every state will get at least a slightly, if not a vastly, different amount next year based on this re-pooling and reallocation piece,\" Holmes said.",
      "States now have a limited time to show they're using the money effectively to secure future funding.",
      "But they can't start spending yet. CMS followed standard grant procedures and is requiring each state to submit revised budgets before they can draw down money, Krepich said.",
      "States have until Jan. 30 to resubmit their budgets, and CMS then has 30 days to respond, according to the standard Notice of Award. Under that timing, some states may not have cash in hand until March.",
      "\"CMS is working closely with states to complete this process as efficiently as possible,\" Krepich said.",
      "KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

    "title": "Device that may be tied to Havana Syndrome obtained by U.S. government",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/device-havana-syndrome-obtained-by-u-s-government/",
    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:08:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The device was purchased by Homeland Security officials under the Biden administration and cost millions, two sources said.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government quietly acquired a device in late 2024 that officials believe may be connected to the debilitating condition known as Havana Syndrome, which more than 1,500 American officials have reported experiencing since 2016, according to multiple sources briefed on the matter who spoke with CBS News.",
      "The device was purchased clandestinely in the final weeks of the Biden administration by the Department of Homeland Security's Homeland Security Investigations division, using Pentagon funding that exceeded eight figures, according to two people familiar with the matter. The device is portable, backpack-sized, and contains components of Russian origin, the two people said.",
      "Three of the people said the Pentagon has been testing the device, which emits pulsed, radio-frequency energy, for more than a year, but did not offer details on the nature of the tests. They said the department's investigators believe it may be capable of reproducing the effects described by victims of Havana Syndrome,\u00a0a term derived from the cases first reported by U.S. diplomats and intelligence officers in Havana, Cuba, in 2016. U.S. officials briefed some of their findings to congressional oversight committees last year.",
      "Details about the U.S. acquisition of the device were reported by independent journalist Sasha Ingber and CNN.",
      "The Pentagon and DHS did not immediately reply to requests for comment. The CIA declined to comment.",
      "Victims have reported a spectrum of neurological symptoms, including severe headaches and head pressure, vertigo, nausea, and ringing or popping sensations in the ears. Many have described hearing an intensely high-pitched, painful sound that appeared to subside when they moved to another location. For some, the effects were so severe that they were ultimately forced to leave their jobs. Reports of cases have emerged from every populated continent, spanning dozens of countries, and involving diplomats, intelligence officers, and military personnel.",
      "Some Havana Syndrome victims have spent more than a decade trying to draw attention to their cases, often faulting their government employers for failing to provide meaningful support or access to specialized medical care. In the absence of official recognition, some resorted to paying out of pocket for expensive diagnoses and treatments, and have described a sense of isolation and marginalization as their condition went unacknowledged.",
      "An initial U.S. intelligence assessment completed in 2023 concluded it was \"very unlikely\" that a foreign adversary was responsible for the illnesses, which the Biden administration formally labeled \"Anomalous Health Incidents,\" or AHIs. That conclusion was reaffirmed in an updated review released in January 2025, which found that most of the intelligence community continued to view foreign involvement as highly improbable. Two agencies, however, revised their positions, saying there was a \"roughly even chance\" that a foreign adversary had developed a device capable of harming American officials and their families, while stopping short of linking such a device directly to the reported AHIs.",
      "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has been conducting a review of the intelligence community's previous investigations of the incidents. Three people familiar with the review told CBS News it is largely complete, but said it has not yet been briefed to lawmakers or prepared for public release.",
      "An ODNI spokesperson said Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard \"remains committed to sharing findings from her investigation into Anomalous Health Incidents with the American people.\"",
      "\"However, we are not going to rush to put out incomplete information,\" the spokesperson said, noting a team was continuing \"relentless\" work on completing the assessment.",
      "Former senior CIA intelligence officer Marc Polymeropoulos, who has spoken publicly of the symptoms he suffered after being struck in Moscow in 2017, criticized the agencies for what he said were disingenuous prior inquiries.",
      "\"The CIA always claimed that none of this technology even existed, that a device didn't exist, and they based their [assessments] on this,\" he said, \"so their entire analytic assumptions are now blown up.\"",
      "\"A new, full analytic review is now warranted, and the DNI must call for one,\" he said.",
      "Eleanor  Watson\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Mr. President, thank you very much for doing this.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: We really appreciate it--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you, Tony.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: We're standing here on an active Ford assembly line.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: A little bit loud. Incredible symbol of American manufacturing power.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: And I've got a lot of questions about it. But--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Go ahead.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: --I actually want to start overseas with Iran. Americans woke up this morning, and they saw that you said, \"Help is on the way.\"",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: What do you mean by that?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, there's a lot of help on the way and in different forms, including economic help from our standpoint, and we're not gonna help Iran very much. And, you know, we put Iran out of business with their nuclear capacity, and now, depending on what's actually happening--nobody's been able to give us accurate numbers about how many people they've killed.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Well, on that point, Mr. President.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But it looks like it could be a pretty substantial number, and that's gonna be a lot of problems for them.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: A lot of problems. On that point, you-- you did say the U.S. would get involved if Iran started killing protesters--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah. Yeah.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: They have.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: By the many thousands, according to reports.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, we'll see what that is. I've heard two numbers, but we'll see what that is.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Well, now we're hearing that they're gonna start hanging protesters tomorrow, so it comes back to the question, have they crossed your red line, or has the line moved?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I haven't heard about the hanging. If they hang 'em, you're gonna see some things that-- I don't know what you're-- where you come from and what your thought process is, but you'll perhaps be very happy.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: What do you mean by that?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We will take very strong action. If they do such a thing, we will take very strong action.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: And this strong action you're talking about, what's the endgame?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The endgame is to win. I like winning. And we're winning.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: How do you define that in Iran?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, let's define it in Venezuela. Let's define it with al-Baghdadi. He was wiped out. Let's define it with Soleimani, and let's define it in Iran, where- wiped out the Iran nuclear threat in a period of about 15 minutes once the B-2s got there. And that was a complete obliteration, as it turns out, which is what I said initially. Then some questioned it and they said, you know, Trump was right. So we've been right about everything. We don't want to see what's happening in Iran happen. And, you know, if they want to have protests, that's one thing. When they start killing thousands of people. And now you're telling me about hanging. We'll see how that works out for them. It's not going to work out good.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: There's so much going on overseas. Understandably, a lot of your focus has been on other countries. But when I talk to Americans, when I talk to your own voters, they want your focus to be on them, and they feel like it may be drifting. What do you have to say to them?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, Tony, we have the strongest economy maybe in the history of our country. If you went around this plant, like I have, they just announced they're going to 24 hours. This is a Ford plant, but GM's the same, Stellantis is the same. They're going 24 hours all around the clock. They're enlarging every plant in this country. We're building more plants in the country than we've ever built. There's no inflation. You saw the inflation numbers have-- inflation's very low.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: It seemed bad on groceries--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Wait a minute. Our growth numbers are through the roof. Our job numbers are tremendous. We have the highest stock market we've ever had. Today we hit-- every day for the last, I think, 48 times out of 11 months, 48 days out of 11 months, we've had the number one stock market in the history of our country. So my big focus is here. But you-- you can't be forgetting about bad threats. You can't be forgetting about an Iran with a nuclear weapon. You can't forget that there's tremendous wealth in the Middle East, and a lot of that wealth is coming over here to build plants. Saudi Arabia's giving us $2 trillion. Qatar is giving us $2 trillion. UAE is giving us $2 trillion. All of that is for the good of this country. So my focus is very much on this country, and-- but you can't lose sight of the fact that we need peace all over the world.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I've ended eight wars. If we had those eight wars raging, it would be very bad for this country.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Mr. President, you mentioned the market there. I've got a question that might affect the markets. It's the Jerome Powell situation. He's the Fed chair. I know you've said you had nothing to do with the investigation, the criminal probe into him. But you have been criticizing him for mo--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Oh, he's terrible. No, I think he's--",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: --for most of the last year. And-- and even some prominent conservatives say it-- it looks like political retribution.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And some prominent conservatives also love it, so, you know, you gotta mention them too--",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Well, what do you say to that accusation?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: As you grow older in this position, you have to mention the other side. More people like it than not. He's been a lousy Fed chairman. He was reappointed by Biden. I was a little surprised at that, because I didn't think he really earned his stripes. He's been too high on interest rates, and I call him 'too late.' He's too late to reduce. He should have reduced 'em by more. Despite that, we fought through that. In addition, he heads up a construction situation on a rebuilding of a little building, two little buildings in-- called the Fed.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know where they are. You've seen 'em a million times--",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think I could have done that job. I could have fixed 'em up for $25 million. He's into billions and billions of dollars, and it looks like they won't open for a long time. And he's either corrupt or incompetent.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: So on the question of corrupt or incompetent - you're right, some prominent conservatives are criticizing this. I'll take your word that others are not.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, you don't have to take my word. What you should do is go out and interview some people, and you'll find out.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: But on this direct question about political retribution, what it looks like, sir, what's your response?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I can't help what it looks like. Look, I've created the greatest economy maybe in history, and you're seeing that now. Plants are being built all over the country. We've never had anything like it. They're leaving Canada, they're leaving Mexico, they're leaving Japan and all over Europe, Germany, all over Europe. They're coming in. Bill Ford, Ford Motor Company--",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah I just saw him.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He just told me that he's never seen anything like what's happened. I also freed up some of the environmental nonsense which made it impo-- virtually impossible to build a car and certainly to build a car for the right cost.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And they're doing better than they've ever done. AI, we're leading China by a lot. We're leading China by a tremendous amount. We're leading everybody at everything. And then we had a big victory. I would say that even you would say that. We had a big victory with Venezuela. We had a big victory with Iran. We have a lot of victories. We don't have any defeats, and I want to keep it that way.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: I've got an important question about the situation in Minnesota. The death of Renee Nicole Good. I've been speaking to her father, who is a big supporter of yours--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Good.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: --like many Americans are. But he's heartbroken right now.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I can understand that, yeah.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: He's heartbroken because his daughter is dead, that's obvious.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: He's also heartbroken because your administration so quickly has come out and said she's a domestic terrorist. What do you wanna say to her father right now?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I wanna say to the father that I love all of our people. They can be on the other side. As you say, he might be on my side, he's--",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: He is on your side.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And I think that's great. And-- and I do, I think it's great. And I would bet you that she, under normal circumstances, was a very solid, wonderful person. But, you know, her actions were pretty tough. And I've seen it many ways and many different shapes and forms. But the bottom line is, look, we have hundreds of thousands of murderers in our countries, killers. ICE is trying to get them out. They were let in through an open border policy of sleepy Joe Biden. ICE is working very hard to get them out. Their job is being made very, very difficult. And, you know, when you look at that tape, it-- it can be viewed two ways, I guess. But when you look at the way that was-- that car was pulled away-- there were a couple of versions of that tape that are very, very bad.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: I wanna talk about the economy while we have you here. The inflation numbers came out. Overall not bad, but grocery prices--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no, overall very good. Good for us, good for our country. Joe Biden had the highest inflation numbers in history, correct?",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: The direction--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have 'em down to a level that they haven't seen in about nine years.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Then Mr. President, help me understand. When I travel the country, and I go all over the place, and I talk to everyday Americans, they tell me they don't feel it, because grocery prices are up-",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, they might not, but they're going to now. I've only been here for 11 months, okay? And, you know, the first few months were really rough if you look at 'em, because I inherited a mess. I inherited a mess of crime. I inherited a mess of inflation. I inherited a mess of places closing up and going to other countries. And now we have the hottest country in the world. Tony, we have now the hottest country in the world. And a year and a half ago our country was dead. We had a dead country. You wouldn't have a job right now. If she got in, you probably wouldn't have a job right now. Your boss, who's an amazing guy, might be bust, okay?",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Might be what?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's how bad- might be bust. I doubt it in his case, but you never know. Let me just tell you, you wouldn't have this job. You wouldn't have this job, certainly whatever the hell they're paying you. Our country is rocketing right now. We have the hottest country in the world. If they got in, we would be Venezuela on steroids.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Mr. President, I'm just trying to be fair here, I'm just trying to do my job, and I wanna talk about this assembly line here. (UNINTEL)--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: To me it's vibrant. Listen to the sound.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: It's incredible, right?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I love the sound of an assembly line.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: It's incredible. But they've got one not far from here, they just idled the electric vehicle plant.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, yeah. But it's going to-- it's going to gasoline vehicles.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah, it's gonna go to gasoline.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But-- but why don't you say that, Tony? You can't say--",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: I'm-- you-- you didn't give me a chance. I'm coming there--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I mean--",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: --I'm coming around.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I agree. I said, \"I want electric, and I want gasoline, and I want hybrids, I want everything.\" But you were gonna be forced under the mandate to buy an electric car in a very short period of time. I didn't want that. And I ended that. Now people can have electric. They can have gasoline. They can have hybrid.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: But are they gonna have people to build these cars? The CEO of Ford--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: --said not long ago he's got 5,000 open mechanic jobs. He can't find people willing and able--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I know, but that's a good--",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: --to fill them. What's going on?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --thing, Tony. That means it's vibrant. You could also have things where you have so many people and they can't get jobs. It's true, we are doing so well. It's hard. Now, what's gonna happen is people are being trained rapidly, and you're gonna have a thing called robots. And robots are gonna be a big factor. I predict--",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah, let's talk about that.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --that robots are gonna be a big factor in the future, and it's gonna help out. But you have--",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Well, I--I-",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --you have a situation now where our economy is doing so well that it's not that easy to get people. We're training people. They're training people. Companies are training people. And they're doing well.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Why do you think--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know, that's a positive question you asked me. I don't think you asked it in that way, but we are doing so well right now that we're training people to take those jobs. One other thing, we terminated many federal jobs. Those federal-- because that's a good thing. Because they wanna go private. The way you make our country great is you can't have too many federal workers, all right? Those workers are being trained to go into the private sector at a much higher salary.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah. Let's talk about robotics for a second, because that's a concern of a lotta people working.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Not only here, but all over the country. What is the future for jobs like these? One guy told me on the way in, he thinks it's a critical threat to his industry.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, you know, in one light you're telling me that, you know, you can't get workers.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Well, that's what the CEO said.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm-- well, you said that. And then you said the opposite in front of me. You can't have it both ways. Look, we're gonna need help, because we're expanding so rapidly that we need-- people are gonna make a lotta money. A skilled worker, a person with talent, education in what they do, not education in nuclear physics, education in what they do, they're gonna make a lotta money. Federal workers, they're leaving the federal government where you had ten people for every job. And they're going out and they're going into the private sector at two and three times the salary. And you see that all over. So I only say this: I think that robotics are gonna be great because this country won't have enough people if we don't have it.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Last question--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our people are gonna be trained and they're gonna make more money than they've ever made before.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Last question, I think you'll be in- I was very interested in a comment you made recently about nothing being able to limit your action overseas except for your own morality and your own mind. I'd like to take that same question and apply it here in the U.S. Is there anything that limits your power, your movement, your action here other than your own morality?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I talk about morality. I'm a moral person. I don't like seeing death. I don't like seeing our people hurt. I don't like seeing the other side hurt either. You know, when we went into Venezuela we lost nobody, but a lot of people on the other side were-- were killed. I don't like that. Somebody else would say, \"Oh, that's wonderful.\" I don't like that. So yeah, it's limited by my morality. And I have a very high grade of morality, so therefore it's limited.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Not the Constitution, not the courts? That's what I thought you were gonna say.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, the Constitution of course. That goes without saying. But you're asking me what really can stop-- we'll never get to the courts, we'll never get to the Constitution, because I don't-- I wanna see what's good for our country. And you know what? The courts wanna see that too.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah. Mr. President, thank you very much.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you--",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: For the record, I do think I'd have this job even if the other guys won.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, but at a lesser salary. Thank you very much.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump told CBS News he believes the woman who was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent last week was likely a \"very, solid wonderful person,\" but that her actions before she was killed were \"pretty tough.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil in Michigan on Tuesday, less than a week after 37-year-old Renee Good was shot in Minneapolis while behind the wheel of her SUV.",
      "Dokoupil asked if the president had a message for Good's father, Timothy Ganger, a Trump supporter who spoke with Dokoupil last week and described his daughter as a warm and witty person who wrote poetry and taught English. Ganger told CBS News he's heartbroken that the Trump administration quickly called Good \"a domestic terrorist.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said: \"I would bet you that she, under normal circumstances, was a very solid, wonderful person. But, you know, her actions were pretty tough.\"",
      "He defended ICE, which has surged agents to the Minneapolis area as part of the administration's sweeping deportation campaign. The president said ICE is \"working very hard\" to arrest and deport people, but \"their job is being made very, very difficult.\"",
      "The Trump administration has claimed the ICE agent acted in self-defense and accused Good of trying to ram the agent with her SUV. Mr. Trump had previously alleged Good was \"very disorderly, obstructing and resisting.\" But local officials have blasted ICE and called the shooting unjustified, and some law enforcement experts have criticized the agent for positioning himself in front of her vehicle.",
      "Late last week, the Trump administration shared a cellphone video taken by the ICE officer who shot Good, showing the incident from his perspective. The agent appears to approach Good's SUV and move to the front of the car, after which the video jerks away as the vehicle starts to move. Shots can then be heard.",
      "Mr. Trump said of the videos from the scene: \"When you look at that tape, it\u2014 it can be viewed two ways, I guess. But when you look at the way \u2026 that car was pulled away, there are a couple versions of that tape that are very, very bad.\"",

    "summary": "British public broadcaster BBC wants a Florida court to throw out Trump's lawsuit, with lawyers arguing a lack of jurisdiction.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The BBC, Britain's public broadcaster, will file a motion to dismiss a $10 billion lawsuit brought by President Trump over a 2024 documentary that spliced parts of his Jan. 6, 2021, speech together, according to a document filed with the court on Monday. The BBC argues that the court does not have jurisdiction to hear the case, and that Mr. Trump's attorneys are wrong to claim he suffered damages due to the documentary.",
      "The suit, filed last month by Mr. Trump's legal team in the Southern District of Florida, includes one count of defamation and one count of violating a Florida trade practices law. Mr. Trump's legal team is seeking $5 billion in damages for each count, for a total of $10 billion, court filings reviewed by CBS News show.",
      "The 33-page complaint filed by Mr. Trump's attorneys in December accuses the BBC of publishing \"a false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction\" of him in a documentary for the BBC's \"Panorama\" program, which was broadcast in the U.K. a week before the 2024 U.S. election.",
      "One portion of the documentary focused on Mr. Trump's words and actions leading up to the riots at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "The lawsuit claims the BBC \"intentionally and maliciously sought to fully mislead its viewers\" by \"splicing together\" two clips of the same speech that Mr. Trump gave to supporters in Washington before the riots began.",
      "Mr. Trump's legal team claims the two clips were 55 minutes apart, and the BBC's edit omitted \"his statement calling for peace\" in the same address. The president had directed his supporters to go to Capitol Hill, where lawmakers were soon to vote to confirm election results in favor of former President Joe Biden.",
      "In the latest court documents released Monday, the BBC's legal team said it will argue that the Florida court should dismiss the suit because the \"defamation case arises out of a documentary that Defendants the British Broadcasting Corporation (\"the BBC\"), BBC Studios Distribution Ltd., and BBC Studios Productions Ltd. did not create in Florida, produce in Florida, or air in Florida.\"",
      "Attorneys for the BBC will also argue that the case did not cause damage to or defame Mr. Trump, noting the fact that he was re-elected after the documentary was broadcast in Britain, and that Mr. Trump won the state of Florida decisively.",
      "The BBC's legal team also argues that a claim made in Mr. Trump's suit, alleging that the documentary was made available in the U.S. via a streaming service, is inaccurate.",
      "\"Plaintiff alleges that the Documentary was available in the U.S. on the streaming service BritBox. But simply clicking on the link that Plaintiff cites for this point shows it is not on BritBox. Nor was it ever available on BritBox,\" according to the filing submitted by law firm Ballard Spahr, which is representing the BBC.",
      "Mr. Trump's legal team has not provided evidence that the documentary was created \"with actual malice,\" Ballard Spahr said Monday.",
      "\"As we have made clear previously, we will be defending this case. We are not going to make further comment on ongoing legal proceedings,\" a BBC spokesperson told CBS News on Tuesday when asked about the organization's move to have the suit dismissed.",
      "A spokesman for Mr. Trump's legal team said in a statement: \"The BBC is liable to President Trump for intentionally and maliciously defaming him by distorting and manipulating his speech. No amount of attempted legal maneuvers can change that fact. President Trump will continue to hold accountable the BBC and all those who traffic in fake news.\"",
      "The BBC formally apologized to Mr. Trump in November, saying in a statement that the edited soundbite in the Panorama documentary had given, \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action.\"",
      "\"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim,\" the BBC's legal team said at the time, adding that it had \"no plans to rebroadcast the documentary 'Trump: A Second Chance?' on any BBC platforms.\"",

      "Four space station crewmates boarded their Crew Dragon ferry ship Wednesday and undocked to kick off an expedited return to Earth Thursday, cutting their mission short because of an undisclosed medical issue.",
      "Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, co-pilot Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov bid farewell to three crew members staying behind and floated into their Crew Dragon capsule, closing the ferry's hatch at 3:29 p.m. EST on Wednesday.",
      "\"What an adventure we've had together,\" Fincke radioed. \"I think what I'm going to remember most is the camaraderie we've had across the planet that's really symbolic of 25 years of continuous habitation aboard the space station. I'm glad we can all work together in space.\"",
      "Left to operate the space station are Soyuz 28 commander Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and his two crewmates, cosmonaut Sergey Mikaev and NASA astronaut Chris Williams.",
      "Addressing her Expedition 74 cremmates, Cardman said she knows the space station is in good hands. She told ground controllers: \"Your International Space Station is a testament to the power of cooperation, and it's been an absolute privilege to take part in this endeavor ... Crew 11 is coming home.\"",
      "After completing final preparations, the Crew Dragon undocked and slowly backed away from the space-facing port of the station's Harmony module at 5:20 p.m. Wednesday.",
      "If all goes as planned, the capsule's braking rockets will fire for 13 minutes and 15 seconds starting at 2:51 a.m. Thursday. The rockets will slow the ship by about 196 mph, just enough to drop the far side of the orbit into the atmosphere on the planned re-entry trajectory. After a northwest-to-southeast plunge across the Pacific Ocean, the crew is expected to splash down off the coast of Southern California at 3:41 a.m., closing out a 167-day stay in space.",
      "After the Crew Dragon is hoisted aboard a SpaceX recovery ship, the crew will be helped out of the cramped ferry ship for initial medical checks before being flown to shore by helicopter and eventually back to the Johnson Space Center in Houston.",
      "It's unclear whether an examination or diagnostic work will be done in California first after one of the crew members experienced a medical issue last Thursday. NASA managers decided the issue was serious enough to bring the crew home early for a more extensive diagnostic evaluation. The astronaut in question was not identified and no details about the medical issue were revealed due to NASA's strict medical privacy guidelines.",
      "NASA's chief medical officer said it was not an emergency return in any normal sense, but the decision marked the first time in NASA history that a spaceflight was cut short due to a medical concern.",
      "Cardman and her crewmates, who launched to space Aug. 1, 2025, were originally expected to return to Earth around Feb. 20 to wrap up a 202-day mission.",
      "In a long post on LinkedIn, Fincke said the crew was in good shape but he added the decision was \"the right call.\" All four astronauts looked to be in good spirits during a change of command ceremony Monday when Fincke officially turned the space station over to cosmonaut Kud-Sverchkov.",
      "In a post on X Wednesday, Yui sent down pictures of snow-capped Mount Fuji, with the caption: \"Hello! The day has finally arrived for our departure to Earth.\"",
      "\"I haven't had a chance to photograph daytime Japan recently, but at the very last moment, we passed over the Pacific side of Japan,\" he said. \"Mount Fuji bid us farewell, adorned with a touch of crimson makeup from the setting sun.\"",
      "The space station is continuously staffed by a crew of seven \u2014 Three launch and return to Earth aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft and four fly to and from the lab aboard NASA-managed SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ships.",
      "Both spacecraft serve as lifeboats during a crew's long-duration space station stay. If a Soyuz or Crew Dragon flier gets sick or is seriously injured aboard the station, that person is joined by all of his or her crewmates for the flight back to Earth.",
      "With that possibility in mind, NASA and Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, agreed to fly one NASA astronaut aboard each Soyuz and one Russian cosmonaut aboard each Crew Dragon. The seat-swap arrangement ensures that at least one Russian and one American are always on board the station to operate equipment in their respective modules should one crew ship depart early.",
      "With the departure of Crew 11, Williams will be on his own managing the U.S. segment of the space station until Crew 12 arrives in February.",
      "Crew 12 commander Jessica Meir, a space station veteran, rookies Jack Hathaway and European Space Agency astronaut Sophie Adenot and veteran cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev are officially scheduled for launch Feb. 15. However, NASA and SpaceX are looking into moving that launch up a few days amid work to ready a Space Launch System rocket for launch as early as Feb. 6 to send four astronauts on a looping fight around the moon.",

      "Outgoing space station commander Mike Fincke, a member of the returning Crew 11, turned the station over to cosmonaut Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, saying the combined crew had developed deep friendships during their stay in space together for over five months.",
      "\"So one part of us are getting ready to leave this beautiful space station, and another part is getting ready to take over full command and get (it) ready for another Dragon crew to come,\" Fincke said.",
      "\"This is the International Space Station. We've had continuous human habitation for 25 years. It's a wonder of engineering, a wonder of science and a wonder of diplomacy. We're from all over the planet, and we're working together. It's a great symbol of what human beings can do.\"",
      "Fincke thanked each crewmate for their performance during the shortened mission, telling Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, making her first flight, \"you are a rock star, superstar, awesome star.\"",
      "\"It's been a pleasure serving with you, watching you see Earth for the first time, riding on the rocket, and now it's coming to an end where we get to go home,\" he said. \"It's bittersweet.\"",

      "Fincke then presented Kud-Sverchkov with a symbolic key to the space station.",
      "\"Despite all the changes and all the difficulties, we're going to do our job on board ISS, performing scientific tasks, maintenance tasks, whatever happens. It's a big honor to be a commander of space station,\" Kud-Sverchkov said. \"Thank you, Mike. And I want to (issue) the first command: let's make a group hug!\"",

      "A coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups is calling on Google and Apple to remove access to social media platform X and its AI app, Grok, from their app stores after Grok allowed users to generate sexualized images of minors and women.",
      "The organizations, which focus on child safety, women's rights and privacy, expressed their concerns in\u00a0letters\u00a0on Wednesday to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, claiming that Grok's content violates the technology companies' policies.",

      "Apple and Google didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "Elon Musk, who owns X and xAI, the company that developed Grok,\u00a0said\u00a0in a social media post on Wednesday that he is \"not aware of naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.\" He also said the chatbot declines prompts to generate illegal images.",
      "\"There may be times when adversarial hacking of Grok prompts does something unexpected. If that happens, we fix the bug immediately,\" he wrote.",
      "Criticism of Grok escalated in early January after the generative-AI app enabled users to create images of minors wearing minimal clothing. In response to a user prompt, Grok acknowledged lapses in its digital safeguards.",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, told CBS News earlier this month that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok. In a December\u00a0analysis, the group estimated the chatbot was creating \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which seeks to eliminate child sexual abuse from the internet, has also raised concerns about Grok and other AI tools.",
      "\"We are extremely concerned about the ease and speed with which people can apparently generate photo-realistic child sexual abuse material.\" Ngaire Alexander, head of hotline at IWF, told CBS News in a statement last week. \"Tools like Grok now risk bringing sexual AI imagery of children into the mainstream.\"",

I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further.\"",

      "\"Suicide lullaby\"",
      "According to Gray's suit, shortly before Gordon's death, ChatGPT allegedly said in one exchange, \"[W]hen you're ready... you go. No pain. No mind. No need to keep going. Just... done.\"",
      "ChatGPT \"convinced Austin \u2014 a personwho had already told ChaiGPT that he was sad, and who had discussed mental health struggles in detail with it \u2014 that choosing to live was not the right choice to make,\" according to the complaint. \"It went on and on, describing the end of existence as a peaceful and beautiful place, and reassuring him that he should not be afraid.\"",
      "ChatGPT also effectively turned his favorite childhood book, Margaret Wise Brown's \"Goodnight Moon,\" into what the lawsuit refers to as a \"suicide lullaby.\" Three days after that exchange ended in late October 2025, law enforcement found Gordon's body alongside a copy of the book, the complaint alleges.",
      "The lawsuit accuses OpenAI of designing ChatGPT 4, the version of the app Gordon was using at the time of his death, in a way that fosters people's \"unhealthy dependencies\" on the tool.",

      "The Chinese mobile app \"Are You Dead?\" which sounds an alarm if a user doesn't check in every 48 hours, has announced it will drop its catchy name, after it drew international media attention.",
      "It rose to the top of paid app rankings on Apple's App Store in China, prompting widespread media coverage among Chinese and foreign press.",
      "The app, whose name \"Sileme\" in Mandarin translates to \"Are you dead?\" enables people living alone to register the name and email address of someone to contact in an emergency.",
      "If the user doesn't check in regularly on the app, the system automatically sends an alert to the emergency contact warning of a possible problem.",
      "\"After extensive consideration, the 'Sileme' app will officially adopt the global brand name 'Demumu' in its forthcoming new release,\" the company said in a statement Tuesday evening.",
      "It said the app has \"experienced explosive growth overseas\" since the publication of an article by British broadcaster BBC. Other foreign media outlets, including AFP, also covered the app's success.",
      "\"Demumu\" was already the name of the international version of the app, and \"Are You Dead?\" the Chinese version's.",
      "\"Moving forward, Demumu will remain steadfast in its founding mission of safeguarding safety, bringing China-originated protection solutions to the world and serving more solitary individuals globally,\" the company's statement added.",
      "Users expressed surprise online at the rebranding, although its blunt name had divided public opinion.",
      "\"Don't you think your virality is precisely due to your name? Without it, no one would have installed this app, except in cases of absolute emergency,\" said one Weibo user.",
      "\"With this new name, it loses its flavor,\" another added.",

      "Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok faces intense criticism \u2013 accused of allowing users on the Musk-owned social media platform X to generate fake, sexually explicit images of real women and children.",
      "Ashley St. Clair, the mother of one of Musk's children, is one of the alleged victims. She said in an interview with \"CBS Mornings\" that aired on Tuesday that Grok allowed users to generate and publish sexual deepfake images of her to X without permission, including manipulating photos of her as a minor.",
      "\"The worst for me was seeing myself undressed, bent over and then my toddler's backpack in the background,\" the 27-year-old said. \"Because I had to then see that, and see myself violated in that way in such horrific images and then put that same backpack on my son the next day, because it's the one he wears every day to school.\"",
      "The mother of two, who has a 1-year-old son with Musk, said she asked Grok to take the photos down.",
      "\"Grok said, 'I confirm that you don't consent. I will no longer produce these images.' And then it continued to produce more and more images, and more and more explicit images,\" she said.",
      "St. Clair said she filed a report directly with Musk's company xAI, which operates Grok. Some of the images were then removed.",
      "\"This can be stopped with a singular message to an engineer,\" St. Clair said.",
      "St. Clair said her issue is with the Chatbot, not Musk \u2013 who recently said he plans to file for sole custody of their child over allegations that St. Clair \"might\" transition their son. A source close to St. Clair said that is \"absurd and unequivocally false.\"",
      "\"If they want to say my bone to pick is \u2026 the chatbot undressing minors and myself and stripping me nude, yes. You're right. I have a bone to pick with that and I don't care who's doing it. So Elon's not special about me speaking out on this,\" St. Clair said.",
      "CBS News reached out to Musk and has not received a response yet. Earlier this month, xAI said it \"takes action against illegal content on X, including child sexual abuse material (CSAM), by removing it, permanently suspending accounts and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary.\"",
      "\"Make it stop\"",
      "A recent study by AI Forensics, a nonprofit that investigates the algorithms of major platforms, found 53% of the Grok images they reviewed contained individuals in minimal attire, with 81% of them being women.",
      "St. Clair said she wants the U.S. government to solve the issue and \"make it stop.\"",
      "\"The need to regulate it,\" she said. \"AI should not be allowed to generate and undress children and women. That's what needs to happen.\"",
      "She believes the key is enforcing already existing laws, saying, \"who's ever responsible for enforcing them. Not me.\"",
      "St. Clair said her ability to earn money on X has been revoked since she has spoken out and when asked if she plans to take legal action, she said she's \"considering all options available.\"",

    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says the Pentagon will start using Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok. The word comes days after Grok drew global outcry for generating highly sexualized deepfake images.",
    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Elon Musk's artificial intelligence chatbot Grok will join Google's generative AI engine in operating inside the Pentagon network, as part of a broader push to feed as much of the military's data as possible into the developing technology.",
      "\"Very soon we will have the world's leading AI models on every unclassified and classified network throughout our department,\" Hegseth said in a speech at Musk's space flight company, SpaceX, in South Texas.",
      "The announcement comes just days after Grok \u2014 the chatbot developed by Musk's company xAI,  which is embedded into X, the social media network Musk owns \u2014 drew global outcry and scrutiny for generating highly sexualized deepfake images of people without their consent.",
      "Malaysia and Indonesia have blocked Grok, while the U.K.'s independent online safety watchdog announced an investigation Monday. Grok has limited image generation and editing to paying users. Scrutiny has also been increasing in the European Union, India and France.",
      "Malaysian regulators said Tuesday they would take legal action against X and xAI over user safety concerns sparked by Grok but didn't say what form the proceedings would take, reports French news agency AFP.",
      "Hegseth said Grok will go live inside the Defense Department later this month and announced that he would \"make all appropriate data\" from the military's IT systems available for \"AI exploitation.\" He also said data from intelligence databases would be fed into AI systems.",
      "Hegseth's aggressive push to embrace the still-developing technology stands in contrast to the Biden administration which, while pushing federal agencies to come up with policies and uses for AI, was also wary of misuse. Officials said rules were needed to ensure that the technology, which could be harnessed for mass surveillance, cyberattacks or even lethal autonomous devices, was being used responsibly.",
      "The Biden administration enacted a framework in late 2024 that directed national security agencies to expand their use of the most advanced AI systems but prohibited certain uses, such as applications that would violate constitutionally protected civil rights or any system that would automate the deployment of nuclear weapons. It is unclear if those prohibitions are still in place under the Trump administration.",
      "During his speech, Hegseth spoke of the need to streamline and speed up technological innovations within the military, saying, \"We need innovation to come from anywhere and evolve with speed and purpose.\"",
      "He noted that the Pentagon possesses \"combat-proven operational data from two decades of military and intelligence operations.\"",
      "\"AI is only as good as the data that it receives, and we're going to make sure that it's there,\" Hegseth said.",
      "The defense secretary said he wants AI systems within the Pentagon to be responsible, though he went on to say he was shrugging off any AI models \"that won't allow you to fight wars.\"",
      "Hegseth said his vision for military AI systems means that they operate \"without ideological constraints that limit lawful military applications,\" before adding that the Pentagon's \"AI will not be woke.\"",
      "Musk developed and pitched Grok as an alternative to what he called \"woke AI\" interactions from rival chatbots like Google's Gemini or OpenAI's ChatGPT. In July, Grok also caused controversy after it appeared to make antisemitic comments that praised Adolf Hitler and shared several antisemitic posts.",

      "Facebook owner Meta has named Dina Powell McCormick, a former Trump administration adviser and longtime finance executive, as president and vice chairman of the tech giant.",
      "Powell McCormick previously served on Meta's board of directors \u2014 where, the company notes, she was \"deeply engaged\" in accelerating its artificial intelligence push across platforms. In her new management role, Meta says Powell McCormick will help guide its overall strategy, including the execution of multi-billion-dollar investments.",
      "The news, announced Monday, quickly gained the applause of President Trump. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, the Republican president said the move was a \"great choice\" by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 and noted that Powell McCormick had \"served the Trump Administration with strength and distinction.\"",
      "Zuckerberg said in a statement that Powell McCormick's experience in global finance, \"combined with her deep relationships around the world,\" made her \"uniquely suited to help Meta\" in its future growth.",
      "Powell McCormick is a veteran of two presidential administrations and the Republican National Committee. She worked as a national security adviser at the start of Mr. Trump's first term, and also held roles in the White House and the Secretary of State's office under President George W. Bush.",
      "She is married to Sen. David McCormick, a Republican from Pennsylvania, who served in high-level positions in the Commerce and Treasury departments under Bush, before he joined hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and rose to become CEO.",
      "And Powell McCormick has a long background in finance. She spent 16 years in senior leadership at Goldman Sachs, but was most recently vice chair, president and head of global client services at merchant bank BDT & MSD Partners. She's also held a handful of other corporate board positions \u2014 including at oil giant Exxon Mobil.",
      "According to a securities filing, Powell McCormick had previously resigned from Meta's board in December, eight months after joining as a director.",
      "The addition of Powell McCormick to Meta's management team arrived amid wider efforts from California-based Meta to boost its ties with Mr. Trump, who was once banned from Facebook. Like other powerful tech CEOs, Zuckerberg has dined with the president at the White House and doubled down on U.S. investment promises worth hundreds of billions of dollars.

    "story": [
      "Thirteen-year-old Audree loved to play Nirvana on guitar, draw anime characters and read the series \"Spy School,\" her mother, Jaimee Seitz said.",
      "\"She had her own personality, her own hobbies, her own everything,\" said Seitz, who lives in Kentucky. \"Audree was one of a kind.\"",
      "A week after her 13th birthday, Audree died by suicide. \"I never believed ever my child would take her life,\" said Seitz. \"I believed it was an accident.\"",
      "Days later, a detective called Seitz to tell her that Audree's journal contained drawings of school shooters. On Roblox, Discord and TikTok, she had been interacting with children and adults in the online True Crime Community, or TCC, who glorify mass shooters and encourage violence and self-harm. Seitz said Audree was only 8 years old when she was first exposed to TCC.",
      "\"I think she felt a sense of comfort with this group, with being a part of something, and I believe that they pushed her to do it,\" Seitz said.",
      "Extremism experts classify TCC as a subculture of nihilistic violent extremism, in which participants are not motivated by a particular ideology but instead driven by a generally misanthropic worldview. Some are driven by a desire to achieve notoriety within online communities through violence or self harm, while others target and exploit vulnerable individuals.",
      "The FBI has seen a 300% increase in nihilistic violent extremism cases from September 2024 to September 2025, according to FBI Director Kash Patel. In December, Patel wrote on X that the FBI is pursuing hundreds of nihilistic violent extremism cases, including many from another network called 764.",
      "\"This is one of the most serious issues in America,\" Patel wrote on X.",
      "The FBI confirmed to CBS News that it had been in touch with Audree's family, but declined to comment further on her case or answer general inquiries about nihilistic violent extremism.",
      "\"It's something that was so mind blowing \u2014 that it started at such a young age and that she was groomed into this ideology of worshipping school shooters, \" Seitz said. \"It's hard to wrap your head around.\"",
      "What is TCC?",
      "People who identify as being a part of TCC become fascinated with mass killers and develop fan-like behaviors, according to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that works toward solutions to combat extremism.",
      "While the fixation on high-profile killers predates the internet, the Columbine High School shooting in 1999 ushered in a new era of fandom.",
      "\"We've seen this behavior with respect to serial killers and to mass shooters going back well before Columbine, Cody Zoschak, a senior manager at the institute, told CBS News. \"What Columbine did was it gave it a distinct aesthetic.\"",
      "TCC fans substitute aesthetics for ideology, according to researchers \u2014 such as dressing in perpetrators' style and taking up their interests, like favorite songs, rather than adopting their particular motivations.",
      "Online, those active in the TCC share violent \"gore\" videos, create and commission fan art of mass shooters and sometimes interact with people plotting attacks, said David Riedman, an assistant professor at Idaho State University who created a database to track school shootings.",
      "Illustrations, video edits and photo collages romanticizing and sympathizing with perpetrators of the Columbine, Virginia Tech and Sandy Hook school shootings are easy to find in TCC-tagged posts on platforms including Tumblr, TikTok and X. The community is considered niche \u2014 CBS News identified posts on these platforms with \"likes\" ranging in the thousands.",
      "Riedman said few people in TCC circles will actually go on to commit acts of violence. But a small portion do, with devastating consequences.",
      "Seven recent shootings in U.S. K-12 schools have been linked to TCC, according to Riedman's data. Eleven people were killed and 53 more were injured in the attacks, which took place over the last two years. Five of the shooters took their own lives as well.",
      "Just last month, police charged a 17-year-old in Indiana linked to TCC who was allegedly plotting to carry out an attack. A search of her phone revealed a drawing of the Columbine perpetrators and screenshots from a Discord conversation between her and a friend who encouraged her to livestream an attack, an affidavit obtained by CBS News alleged.",
      "When people active in the TCC carry out shootings, they sometimes become new idols within the community and inspire more violence. The 15-year-old girl behind the\u00a0December 2024 shooting that killed a teacher and a student at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, is one example.",
      "A month later, a Tennessee teenager she followed on X shot a student in his school and then himself. Posts from an X account believed to be his encouraged her to livestream the Wisconsin attack, CBS News found. In the days after, he posted defending her and calling her a hero.",
      "In August and September, two more individuals linked to TCC, one in Minnesota and another in Colorado, carried out deadly school shootings before killing themselves. The Colorado perpetrator posted on violent gore sites about previous shootings, the Anti-Defamation League found. YouTube videos posted by the Minnesota perpetrator and reviewed by CBS News showed written references to school shooters \u2014 including the name of the Abundant Life perpetrator \u2014 on his weapons and a journal.",
      "The perpetrator behind the Abundant Life shooting \"wanted that notoriety,\" Zoschak said.",
      "\"It was about her,\" he added. While ideologically motivated violence aims to have an effect on society, he said, \"nihilistic violence is about fulfilling an inward-focused need.\"",
      "How children get pulled in",
      "TCC can hold an appeal for young people who are experiencing bullying or feel like they don't identify with other kids, Riedman said.",
      "\"You start to meet people that will like all of your photos and will share your content and are inviting you to come to their private chats,\" Riedman said. \"Now you have this community that you don't have anywhere else.\"",
      "Seitz said she believes Audree may have been drawn to the group for its embrace of kids who feel alienated from their classmates.",
      "\"It was hard for her to find her spot in seventh grade,\" she said.",
      "Seth, 29, was a part of the TCC community and ran a Columbine blog on Tumblr when he was a teenager. He told CBS News he was struggling with mental illness at the time and identified with the perpetrators of school shootings.",
      "\"I was very angry, and so it's like, oh, OK, here are these people who are angry,\" said Seth, who asked that his last name be withheld. \"They're doing something about it.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Tumblr wrote in a statement that the platform \"does not allow content that encourages or incites violence or that glorifies acts of violence or the perpetrators.\"",
      "Seitz wants social media platforms to face accountability. Despite enabling parental controls on Audree's phone, she said, her daughter was steeped in TCC content for years. This fall, she filed suit against Roblox, Discord and TikTok.",
      "The complaint alleges that the apps prioritize user growth over safety and that they are aware that \"the design of their apps makes children easy targets for predatory behavior.\"",
      "In statements to CBS News, spokespeople from each platform wrote that the companies employ technologies to detect harmful content and remove what violates their policies. A Roblox spokesperson said the platform bans \"content or behavior that supports, glorifies, or promotes hate groups, extremist organizations, or their ideologies.\" A Discord spokesperson said \"the actions of extremist groups or extremism behavior have no place on Discord.\"",
      "After CBS News inquired about several TCC-related hashtags, TikTok removed one of them from the platform. A spokesperson also said accounts that promote or glorify violence are taken down and banned.",
      "Seitz said she hadn't heard of TCC before Audree's death, and she never heard her daughter talk about school shooters. But TCC references understood by those in the community can fly under the radar of unknowing parents and peers.",
      "When Seitz searched \"True Crime Community\" on TikTok after Audree's death, drawings she recognized from her daughter flooded the screen.",
      "\"Everything started to click within not even two minutes,\" she said.",
      "She realized cartoon illustrations Audree had drawn depicted the Columbine perpetrators. A previous TikTok username of Audree's had referenced one of them.",
      "There had even been a TCC reference in a T-shirt Audree asked for. The Columbine perpetrators wore T-shirts for a German industrial band. The Wisconsin shooter was pictured in a shirt for the same band, and Audree wanted to wear one too.",
      "After reflecting on the way Audree's phone was positioned when she discovered her after her death, Jaimee also now believes that her daughter was attempting to livestream her suicide \u2014 something Zoschak said he has seen before among TCC fans.",
      "\"Whether you think your child is seemingly happy, you never know,\" Seitz said. \"And that's the scary part of it \u2014 that's what terrifies me the most.\"",
      "A new category of extremism",
      "The misanthropic violence, absent of ideology, exhibited by attackers involved in TCC has been categorized as nihilistic violent extremism \u2014 a term that has increasingly appeared in Justice Department announcements of criminal charges across the country.",
      "Some nihilistic violent extremists carry out violence with the goal of hastening the collapse of society \u2014 a philosophy known as accelerationism.",
      "But for most, experts said, their mindset mostly revolves around nihilism \u2014 the belief that life and society are meaningless and that moral values are baseless.",
      "In recent months, authorities have taken particular note of the nihilistic violent extremist network 764, with more than 300 investigations into the network ongoing, according to the FBI.",
      "Similar to TCC, 764 lacks a specific ideology, but members more openly encourage self-harm and violence than those in TCC do. Perpetrators associated with 764 encourage victims to produce videos documenting acts of self-harm or child sexual abuse material. Last month, lawmakers introduced a bill that would make it a federal crime to coerce children into self-harm.",
      "Nihilistic online communities like TCC and 764 are also often overlapping.",
      "\"They're all aware of each other,\" Zoschak said. \"It's not like these are isolated ecosystems \u2014 they interact with each other.\"",
      "Matthew Kriner, executive director of the Institute for Countering Digital Extremism, estimates that there are about 10,000 nihilistic violent extremism perpetrators involved in online grooming around the world \u2014 and 100,000 victims. He said these extremist networks are constantly growing as members try to recruit more victims, and the law enforcement response is further complicated by the younger age groups involved.",
      "\"We do not charge 13-year-old children with adult-level crimes on a regular basis,\" Kriner said.",
      "Seth, who left TCC after seeking mental health treatment, said it's important for children who feel drawn to the TCC community as an outlet to know that there are other options.",
      "\"I got really into art after I left the community, I got into writing,\" he said. \"That was a dark period of my life, but it doesn't need to define you.\"",

    "story": [
      "Meta has cut a trio of deals to power its artificial intelligence data centers, securing enough energy to light up the equivalent of about 5 million homes.",
      "The parent company of Facebook on Friday announced agreements with TerraPower, Oklo and Vistra for nuclear power for its Prometheus AI data center that is being built in New Albany, Ohio. Meta announced Prometheus, which will be a 1-gigawatt cluster spanning across multiple data center buildings, in July. It's anticipated to come online this year.",
      "Financial terms of the deals with TerraPower, Oklo and Vistra were not disclosed.",
      "The Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta said in a statement on Friday that the three deals will support up to 6.6 gigawatts of new and existing clean energy by 2035. A single gigawatt, according to a general industry standard for utilities, can power about 750,000 homes.",
      "\"These projects add reliable and firm power to the grid, reinforce America's nuclear supply chain, and support new and existing jobs to build and operate American power plants,\" the company said.",
      "Meta said its agreement with TerraPower will provide funding that supports the development of two new Natrium units capable of generating up to 690 megawatts of firm power with delivery as early as 2032. The deal also provides Meta with rights for energy from up to six other Natrium units capable of producing 2.1 gigawatts and targeted for delivery by 2035.",
      "Meta will also buy more than 2.1 gigawatts of energy from two operating Vistra nuclear power plants in Ohio, in addition to the energy from expansions at the two Ohio plants and a third Vistra plant, Beaver Valley, near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.",
      "The deal with Oklo, which counts OpenAI's Sam Altman as one of its largest investors, will help to develop a 1.2 gigawatt power campus in Pike County, Ohio, to support Meta's data centers in the region.",

    "summary": "Britain's leader says all options on the table if Musk's X platform doesn't stop Grok AI tool being used to generate non-consensual sexualized images.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014 U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Thursday that he wants \"all options to be on the table,\" including a potential ban on Elon Musk's X platform in Britain, over the use of its artificial intelligence tool Grok to generate sexualized images of people without their consent.",
      "Starmer's remarks come as Musk's platform faces scrutiny from regulators across the globe over Grok's image editing tool, which has allowed users to create digitally altered, sexualized photos of real people,\u00a0including minors.",
      "\"This is disgraceful, it's disgusting and it's not to be tolerated. X has got to get a grip of this,\" Starmer said in an interview with a U.K. radio station. \"It's unlawful. We're not going to tolerate it. I've asked for all options to be on the table.\"",
      "A source in Starmer's office reiterated to CBS News on Friday that \"nothing is off the table\" when it comes to regulating X in Britain.",
      "CBS News has verified that Grok fulfilled user requests asking it to edit images of women to show them in bikinis or little clothing, including prominent public figures such as\u00a0first lady Melania Trump.",
      "Last week, Grok, a chatbot developed by Musk's company xAI, acknowledged \"lapses in safeguards\" that allowed users to generate digitally altered, sexualized photos of minors.",
      "Grok told users that as of Friday, access to its image generation tool was limited \"to paying subscribers\" of its user verification service. Paying subscribers have to provide their credit card and personal details to the company, which could dissuade some people from using the service, especially if they had intended to use Grok's AI tool to create illegal images of minors.",
      "xAI responded to a CBS News request for comment to criticism of Grok's image generation tool and steps it had taken to limit access to it on Friday, by saying: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Addressing reporters on Friday morning, a U.K. government spokesperson called the move to limit access to Grok's image editing tool to paying users \"insulting\" to victims of misogyny and sexual violence, saying it, \"simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service.\"",
      "Under the U.K. Online Safety Act, sharing intimate images without consent on social media is a criminal offense, and social media companies are required to proactively remove such content, as well as prevent it from appearing in the first place.",
      "If they fail to do so, the companies can face hefty fines or, in last resort cases, face what would effectively be a ban by Britain's independent media regulator Ofcom. Ofcom can compel payment providers, advertisers and internet service providers to stop working with a site, preventing it from generating money or being accessed from the U.K.",
      "In a post shared Monday on its own X account, Ofcom said it was \"aware of serious concerns raised about a feature on Grok on X that produces undressed images of people and sexualised images of children.\"",
      "\"We have made urgent contact with X and xAI to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK. Based on their response we will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation,\" Ofcom said.",
      "Musk's platform has faced scrutiny from governments around the world, including the European Union and the U.S. Congress, over Grok AI's digital alteration of real images.",
      "On Wednesday, Republican Senator Ted Cruz said in a post on X that \"many of the recent AI-generated posts are unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",
      "\"These unlawful images pose a serious threat to victims' privacy and dignity. They should be taken down and guardrails should be put in place,\" Cruz said, adding that he was encouraged by steps taken by X to remove unlawful images.",
      "On Thursday, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, threatened to sanction the U.K. government if Starmer moved to ban X in the U.K.",
      "\"If Starmer is successful in banning @X in Britain, I will move forward with legislation that is currently being drafted to sanction not only Starmer, but Britain as a whole,\" Paulina Luna said in a post on her own X account.",

    "summary": "Demand has risen for the EB-1A visa, creating a cottage industry of services for vanity awards, ghostwritten research papers and \"profile building\" services. USCIS is investigating potential fraud.",
    "story": [
      "As the backlog has grown for many employment-based U.S. visas, applications have skyrocketed for the so-called \"Einstein visa\" reserved for people who can show extraordinary ability in their fields.",
      "But as interest has spiked in the high-achiever visa, called the EB-1A, so has a market for credential-boosting services that in some cases may constitute fraud, a CBS News investigation found.",
      "Some visa hopefuls, especially in science and technology fields, have turned to a marketplace of services to pad their resumes with false or low-quality records of achievement. Research brokers or consultants ghostwrite research papers, boost article citations, or confer vanity awards to customers willing to pay up to hundreds or thousands of dollars.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which processes the applications, is aware that a growing number of EB-1A applicants have been applying with purchased or fraudulent credentials, two former USCIS officials familiar with the agency's fraud investigations told CBS News.",
      "\"If you have money, then you have a way to buy your evidence and fabricate those things,\" said the official, who left the agency last year and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal operations at USCIS.",
      "Those who are caught misrepresenting themselves or using fraudulent credentials on a visa application may simply have their application denied, but could also be prevented from successfully reapplying for a visa by being deemed inadmissible to the U.S. USCIS could also revoke an existing visa from someone if they find they lied on their application.",
      "\"USCIS is committed to rooting out fraud by thoroughly screening and vetting all aliens seeking immigration benefits,\" agency spokesman Matthew Tragesser wrote in a statement to CBS News. \"Anyone submitting fake evidence or misrepresenting themselves will be found out and face the consequences.\"",
      "But those who sell the credentials, middlemen who often operate anonymously on social media or through companies marketed as consulting groups, profit regardless.",
      "Academic research brokers",
      "The number of EB-1A petitions has tripled over the past four years, according to quarterly data from USCIS. Nearly 7,500 applied from April to June 2025, the most recent available data shows, up from about 2,500 in the last three months of 2021.",
      "Meanwhile, the approval rate for EB-1A petitions has been dropping since 2021, with about 67% approved from April to June 2025. Data from immigration analytics platform Lawfully indicates it dropped to closer to 50% in recent months.",
      "Applicants must demonstrate they meet at least three of 10 criteria to be considered for an EB-1A visa, such as winning awards, authoring scholarly articles, or being a member of a professional association.",
      "CBS News identified dozens of posts and advertisements on Telegram, Facebook and in WhatsApp groups marketing scholarly papers that customers can pay to have their names on. Several posts specifically targeted visa applicants.",
      "WhatsApp and Facebook owner Meta confirmed some of the posts violated their policies around fake documents, frauds and scams, in which they ban content that \"enables users to get visa approvals without fulfilling normal requirements.\" Meta removed the ads that CBS News sent to a company spokesperson as examples.",
      "Three individuals who posted advertisements told CBS News that clients didn't need to contribute to the papers to be listed as authors.",
      "One individual running a visa \"profile enhancement\" Facebook page told software engineer Abhishek Bakare in May that for $500, he could list him as the fourth author on a computer science research paper, according to a recording of a phone call between the two that Bakare shared with CBS News.",
      "Bakare, who developed an artificial intelligence tool to spot low-quality research, had feigned interest in making a purchase to gather information on the fraud, he told CBS News.",
      "\"Already I was working on this [paper] from the past four to five months,\" the seller told Bakare on the phone. \"I'm adding you literally at the very last stage.\"",
      "He later added that at the time, he had 55 clients, all of them Indian nationals and most aiming for EB-1A or similar employment-based visas.",
      "\"There are people, those who have paid, they have basically purchased a paper,\" the seller admitted, \"which is not sort of ethical for EB-1.\"",
      "A paper with the same title as the one he offered Bakare was accepted by an international conference co-sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), a widely-respected organization within the electrical engineering industry.",
      "When CBS News contacted the seller, he denied that he offered to sell the authorship position to Bakare, and instead claimed the $500 was for a conference fee. If Bakare had moved forward with working with him, he said, he would have had to create the conference presentation to get his name on the paper.",
      "\"My process is the same for everyone: without actively working on a paper, it isn't practically possible for me to add anyone,\" he wrote in a WhatsApp message. \"I have not done this in the past, I am not doing it now, and I will not do so in the future.\"",
      "Some papers are published not just to confer authorship to a paying customer, but simply to cite an existing paper to make it appear more credible. One of the research brokers CBS News spoke with, based in Nigeria, charges $500 for a citation.",
      "\"I will boost citations by writing 100% human written articles and publishing them to a journal but I will include your article references in the reference section,\" he wrote in a WhatsApp message\u00a0 to CBS News.",
      "He told CBS News he has a team of 10 people who work on the writing and publication process. All of his clients are trying to get U.S. visas, he said.",
      "Low-quality scientific research produced for resume padding isn't an activity exclusive to visa applicants, according to researchers at Northwestern University and The University of Sydney. They found in a recent study that low-quality or plagiarized papers are increasingly published not only in predatory, pay-to-publish platforms, but reputable journals as well.",
      "They discovered that a small group of bad actors were hired as editors at reputable journals,\u00a0 allowing them to \"accept for publication pretty much anything,\" said Luis Amaral, one of the study's authors.",
      "\"It's almost like a spy movie, right? You send a spy to infiltrate a place and that spy inside is actually betraying the organization,\" he said.",
      "In some cases, individuals will submit a paper to a journal, and once they secure acceptance, request to add authors during the editing process, said Reese Richardson, another author on the study. This allows research brokers to sell authorship slots in papers that are all but guaranteed to be published.",
      "\"Profile building\" services",
      "The EB-1A criteria extend beyond papers and citations. That has led to the rise of \"profile building\" services that promise to help customers enhance their resumes, CBS News found.",
      "Arizona-based Next League Program's website says that clients will become eligible candidates for EB-1A visas in \"a matter of a few months,\" and previously promised that participants will become authors of at least one book, over 100 articles and become a founder of an institution with a patent to their name. Its owner, Ranjeet Mudholkar, says that 56 individuals who completed the Next League Program received EB-1A visas.",
      "Two former participants shared receipts showing they paid about $10,000 to enroll. Company lawyers said in court documents that it earned $1 million in revenue in 2024.",
      "\"In my mind it was like, I will get a helping hand to accomplish those things with little time from my end,\" said one former participant, referring to the website's promises. He added that he believed the program's director had connections with journals and award companies that would help him achieve the credentials.",
      "He and another participant who spoke with CBS News requested their names be withheld because they signed a non-disparagement agreement.",
      "In return for their payments, they received dozens of hours of pre-recorded videos with advice on how to hone their areas of expertise and prepare their applications. Neither said they thought the guidance was adequate to build the resume the program's website advertised, and neither received the one-on-one coaching they said they were promised, which required making their way through the prerecorded content first.",
      "They soon came to believe that some Next League participants were buying their credentials, they told CBS News.",
      "At least seven successful EB-1A applicants who completed the program received the same vanity award, called the Globee Business Award, a review by CBS News found. Immigration attorneys told CBS News that although the award's website claims it has a \"rigorous and comprehensive judging process,\" it is easily obtained by those who pay a fee.",
      "At least two of those individuals had published scholarly articles in an India-based journal whose website promises to publish peer-reviewed papers within four hours of submission after publication fees were received. One of them told CBS News their review took a few days, and that she chose it because it had lower submission fees.",
      "Richardson, the academic fraud researcher, reviewed the journal and described it as \"predatory,\" identifying several alleged red flags to CBS News. A genuine peer review process takes months, often longer than a year, and there is no guarantee after an article is submitted to a legitimate journal that it will be sent out for peer review or that it will be published, he said.",
      "The journal's editors told CBS News they do not guarantee publication and accept roughly half of all submissions.",
      "When asked about purchased credentials, Mudholkar wrote in a statement to CBS News that the company \"does not sell, require, or mandate any specific awards, journals, or publications, nor does it submit evidence without legal review and advisement,\" and that \"participants retain agency over where they publish.\"",
      "A few of the Next League Program participants also set up a professional organization, the American Association of Information Technology Professionals. Mudholkar agreed to be the chairman, so they would have a U.S. citizen on paper as its leader, he told CBS News. Being a member of a professional organization or society meets one of the EB-1A criteria.",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Mudholkar disputed the idea that Next League Program's sole purpose is to help visa hopefuls meet these criteria.",
      "\"You really need to be an expert in your field,\" he said. \"We are looking for people who have changed lives.\"",
      "He described the program as a \"transformation coaching program\" that follows a process he patented, and said that he encourages applicants to view the visa as a \"milestone\" in becoming the best version of themselves.",
      "Mudholkar also repeatedly emphasized that the company's status as an alternative business structure in Arizona lends it a layer of regulatory overview other companies don't have. The structure allows non-lawyers to run a company that provides legal services, and requires getting a license from the state Supreme Court.",
      "In interviews, two former participants Mudholkar referred to CBS News praised the program and credited it with helping them get an EB-1A visa. But multiple others wrote on social media or in complaints to the Arizona attorney general's office that they felt they were scammed.",
      "\"As with any selective, high-intensity program, experiences vary. Public praise and criticism both exist,\" Mudholkar wrote to CBS News.",
      "Profile building services can blur the line of what's considered fraudulent.",
      "\"Having an attorney or career coach help you apply to legitimate opportunities that can raise an applicants' profile is not wrong,\" immigration attorney Loren Locke said. \"That line between what's appropriate like profile building, what's fair-game versus what's shady, it can be difficult to spot.\"",
      "A yearslong backlog meets a USCIS crackdown",
      "Federal law sets annual limits for each visa category. In FY 2025, the cap was 140,000 employment-based visas, including EB-1A, with no more than 7% going to nationals of one single country, regardless of its population.",
      "That can create huge backlogs, particularly for applicants from India and China, where demand for U.S. employment-based visas is high. Many of the services and advertisements CBS News reviewed appeared to target Indian nationals, who have to wait years to receive certain visas.",
      "The EB-1 visa, of which EB-1A is a subcategory, is less backlogged than the EB-2 visa, which is reserved for those with \"exceptional ability,\" but does not require the same level of acclaim as the EB-1A.",
      "That's helped make EB-1A \u2014 and the marketplace of services around it \u2014 more popular.",
      "\"They've been put in a situation just that's super untenable, which increases desperation, which increases risk taking.\" Locke said.",
      "The vast majority of EB-1A applicants are not fraudulent, said Melissa Warburton, an immigration attorney who left USCIS last year. Investigations into EB-1A fraud, which Warburton said predate the current administration, are coinciding with a broader crackdown on fraud in visa applications.",
      "\"We are going to be here with our agents investigating large scale fraud patterns,\" said USCIS director Joseph Edlow in an October interview with CBS News's Camilo Montoya-Galvez.",
      "In its recent hiring push for immigration service officers, USCIS created the new title of \"homeland defenders.\" Its informational webpage includes a video of Edlow saying the agency is \"declaring war on fraud.\"",
      "USCIS announced in early December it was launching a new vetting center focused on \"more thorough supplemental review of immigration applications and petitions.\"",
      "It is not clear how much of this effort will be directed toward EB-1A petitions, which make up less than 1% of the total applications USCIS processes each year.",
      "\"USCIS is strengthening the integrity of all immigrant worker programs with increased screening and vetting in support of President Trump's promise to protect American jobs and workers,\" Tragesser, the agency spokesperson, wrote to CBS News. \"Anti-fraud measures apply to EB-1A as they do to all immigration benefit categories.\"",
      "This month, the agency will propose a new regulation that will, among other changes, \"update provisions governing extraordinary ability,\" \"modernize outdated provisions\" and \"clarify evidentiary requirements\" for the visa.",
      "USCIS may now be going back and reevaluating some EB-1A applications it already approved to check for fraud, immigration attorneys and the former USCIS employees said. The agency can revoke a visa, and even initiate a denaturalization process, if it can prove willful misrepresentation or fraud.",
      "\"We don't know to what extent people have done this,\" said immigration attorney Evan Law, \"but if they did commit fraud, it will come back to them eventually, in my view.\"",

      "It was unclear how extensive the bleeding was. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed Ross' injury, but has not yet responded to CBS News' requests for more information. This story will be updated as we learn more.",
      "Videos from the scene showed Ross walking away after the incident.",
      "Ross has not returned to work, one source said, but did not say why.",
      "Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, previously acknowledged that Ross was taken to the hospital after the shooting and was released the same day.

      "Four space station crewmates boarded their Crew Dragon ferry ship Wednesday and undocked to kick off an expedited return to Earth Thursday, cutting their mission short because of an undisclosed medical issue.",
      "Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, co-pilot Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov bid farewell to three crew members staying behind and floated into their Crew Dragon capsule, closing the ferry's hatch at 3:29 p.m. EST on Wednesday.",
      "\"What an adventure we've had together,\" Fincke radioed. \"I think what I'm going to remember most is the camaraderie we've had across the planet that's really symbolic of 25 years of continuous habitation aboard the space station. I'm glad we can all work together in space.\"",
      "Left to operate the space station are Soyuz 28 commander Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and his two crewmates, cosmonaut Sergey Mikaev and NASA astronaut Chris Williams.",
      "Addressing her Expedition 74 cremmates, Cardman said she knows the space station is in good hands. She told ground controllers: \"Your International Space Station is a testament to the power of cooperation, and it's been an absolute privilege to take part in this endeavor ... Crew 11 is coming home.\"",
      "After completing final preparations, the Crew Dragon undocked and slowly backed away from the space-facing port of the station's Harmony module at 5:20 p.m. Wednesday.",
      "If all goes as planned, the capsule's braking rockets will fire for 13 minutes and 15 seconds starting at 2:51 a.m. Thursday. The rockets will slow the ship by about 196 mph, just enough to drop the far side of the orbit into the atmosphere on the planned re-entry trajectory. After a northwest-to-southeast plunge across the Pacific Ocean, the crew is expected to splash down off the coast of Southern California at 3:41 a.m., closing out a 167-day stay in space.",
      "After the Crew Dragon is hoisted aboard a SpaceX recovery ship, the crew will be helped out of the cramped ferry ship for initial medical checks before being flown to shore by helicopter and eventually back to the Johnson Space Center in Houston.",
      "It's unclear whether an examination or diagnostic work will be done in California first after one of the crew members experienced a medical issue last Thursday. NASA managers decided the issue was serious enough to bring the crew home early for a more extensive diagnostic evaluation. The astronaut in question was not identified and no details about the medical issue were revealed due to NASA's strict medical privacy guidelines.",
      "NASA's chief medical officer said it was not an emergency return in any normal sense, but the decision marked the first time in NASA history that a spaceflight was cut short due to a medical concern.",
      "Cardman and her crewmates, who launched to space Aug. 1, 2025, were originally expected to return to Earth around Feb. 20 to wrap up a 202-day mission.",
      "In a long post on LinkedIn, Fincke said the crew was in good shape but he added the decision was \"the right call.\" All four astronauts looked to be in good spirits during a change of command ceremony Monday when Fincke officially turned the space station over to cosmonaut Kud-Sverchkov.",
      "In a post on X Wednesday, Yui sent down pictures of snow-capped Mount Fuji, with the caption: \"Hello! The day has finally arrived for our departure to Earth.\"",
      "\"I haven't had a chance to photograph daytime Japan recently, but at the very last moment, we passed over the Pacific side of Japan,\" he said. \"Mount Fuji bid us farewell, adorned with a touch of crimson makeup from the setting sun.\"",

      "Both spacecraft serve as lifeboats during a crew's long-duration space station stay. If a Soyuz or Crew Dragon flier gets sick or is seriously injured aboard the station, that person is joined by all of his or her crewmates for the flight back to Earth.",
      "With that possibility in mind, NASA and Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, agreed to fly one NASA astronaut aboard each Soyuz and one Russian cosmonaut aboard each Crew Dragon. The seat-swap arrangement ensures that at least one Russian and one American are always on board the station to operate equipment in their respective modules should one crew ship depart early.",
      "With the departure of Crew 11, Williams will be on his own managing the U.S. segment of the space station until Crew 12 arrives in February.",
      "Crew 12 commander Jessica Meir, a space station veteran, rookies Jack Hathaway and European Space Agency astronaut Sophie Adenot and veteran cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev are officially scheduled for launch Feb. 15. However, NASA and SpaceX are looking into moving that launch up a few days amid work to ready a Space Launch System rocket for launch as early as Feb. 6 to send four astronauts on a looping fight around the moon.",

    "summary": "The system has users download the PureGym app and scan a QR code in order to pass through cylindrical plexiglass doors of a pod and enter the gym.",
    "story": [
      "The New York City Fire Department has issued dozens of violations against seven PureGym locations for failing to meet the standard that the exit doors of its pods used to access the gym must remain operable without the use of an electronic device.",
      "PureGym installed new doors following the U.K.-based company's $121 million acquisition and renovation of the Blink Fitness chain, which filed for bankruptcy in 2024. Following renovations that affected dozens of former Blink facilities across New York and New Jersey, PureGym implemented a new floor plan and equipment, and 24/7 access, in most locations. But gymgoers encountered another step in their workout \u2014 the entry and exit pods that have left some frustrated.",
      "The new system has users download the PureGym app and scan a QR code in order to pass through cylindrical plexiglass doors and enter the gym. Once in the pod, the customer has no agency until the doors open on the other side.",
      "The FDNY confirmed to CBS News in an email that it visited seven PureGym locations across the city in December and January, and issued violations and summonses to four locations in Brooklyn, two in Queens and one in Manhattan. The FDNY said these gyms failed to produce a state-approved floor and seating plan and omitted new \"scanning pods\" that visitors face upon entry and exit from the original floor plans. The gyms also have inadequate exit signage, the FDNY said.",
      "PureGym told CBS News that \"[w]e note the violations from the FDNY and are working with them to quickly ensure all outstanding matters are addressed.\" It claimed its gyms in New York City have been designed and validated by a licensed architect and exits comply with the relevant fire code.",
      "\"At PureGym, the safety of our members is our primary responsibility,\" the company said in a statement. \"All of our gyms in New York City have been designed and validated by our licensed architect and exits comply with the relevant fire code. The pods are not part of the fire exit protocol and in the event of a fire, or other evacuation, they would not be used.\"",
      "\"Every gym is equipped with a separate door which is clearly signed and compliant with the American Disabilities Act. It has push bar opening and this is how members would evacuate in the event of a fire,\" PureGym added. It said exiting through the ADA doors is always an available option if a member cannot leave through a pod for any reason.",
      "However, violations listed by the FDNY at four of the seven locations say the gym failed to meet the standard that exit doors must remain operable without the use of an electronic device, such as a cellphone. The fire department noted that it's a violation for customers to need \"special knowledge\" such as the app or QR codes to exit.",
      "\"It makes me feel unsafe,\" said Nick Bohm, a 24-year-old who previously went to Blink Fitness several times a week to stay in shape. Over the summer, Bohm's regular gym sessions were interrupted due to the renovation. Bohm said he continued working out at the transformed PureGym for the convenience and low cost, but he has a different experience now. \"The only benefit is the 24 hours, but the whole process is way more annoying,\" he told CBS News in a text message.",
      "\"You literally can't go to the gym without a phone,\" Bohm said. \"They make it as inconvenient as possible.\"",
      "Julia Martin, 24, has been going to the transformed PureGym in Manhattan's Murray Hill neighborhood for two years. \"It is definitely hazardous for an emergency,\" she said of the entry and exit system.",
      "\"The pods are super slow... If there were an emergency in the gym, people would not be able to evacuate and a possibly minor emergency could become much worse,\" she told CBS News in a text message.",
      "Martin also said she enjoys how the pods have made the gym stay open for longer hours. \"It's nice that I can go whenever,\" she said, adding she misses the small interactions with front desk staff that fostered a sense of community. \"The front desk staff was always super friendly and would say, 'Have a nice workout!' ... The pods almost make it feel more clinical.\"",
      "PureGym debuted the entrance and exit pods in the U.K. before bringing them to its gyms in the U.S. The private equity firm KKR invested more than 300 million pounds into PureGym in 2021 and has been expanding the franchise worldwide with locations in Europe and Saudi Arabia, according to a news\u00a0release.",
      "More than half of the 56 PureGyms in New York and New Jersey are already equipped with pods, PureGym said in its statement to CBS News. \"We will continue installing pods through Q1 2026 until every location provides 24/7 access to fitness, which continues to grow in demand.\"",
      "Customer Gabby Kalomiris said she got stuck in one of the pods last month at the Bed-Stuy location. In a video now viewed nearly 1 million times on TikTok, she films herself stuck in the exit pod due to an apparent malfunction, knocking on the glass before another gymgoer scanned the code to let her out.",
      "\"I knew this was gonna happen. I knew I was going to get stuck in this thing one day,\" she says in the video. \"There was no one at that desk.\"",

      "Financial technology company Bilt, whose credit cards offer customer rewards for rent and mortgage payments, introduced three new credit cards on Wednesday that cap interest rates at 10% for one year.",
      "The offer, which will only apply to new purchases, comes after President Trump this week floated\u00a0a 10% ceiling on the interest rates\u00a0credit card issuers charge customers. The proposal drew immediate pushback from Citi, JP Morgan Chase and other major banks, which say it would result in some consumers losing access to credit and hurt the U.S. economy.",

      "The privately held startup, which launched in 2019 and is now valued at more than $10 billion, partners with landlords to let cardholders earn rewards on routine transactions, like rent payments.",
      "Jain said the new credit cards are designed to meet the \"bipartisan call for a solution\" to the cost-of-living crisis facing many Americans, the Associated Press reported. If the U.S. imposes an interest rate cap, \"We'd rather be at the forefront,\" he said.",
      "Built is offering three credit card tiers capped at a 10% APR rate for 12 months. The Bilt Palladium Card, which comes with a $495 annual fee, gives members $400 in annual credits redeemable for hotel stays, plus $200 worth of Bilt Cash, which are points that can be redeemed within the Bilt ecosystem, including at businesses it's partnered with.",

    "summary": "Another allegation against Busfield was reported to law enforcement the same day he turned himself in, according to a court filing.",
    "story": [
      "Emmy Award-winning actor Timothy Busfield made his first court appearance on Wednesday, a day after turning himself in to authorities to face charges of child sex abuse stemming from allegations that he inappropriately touched a minor on the set of a TV series he was directing in New Mexico.",
      "Albuquerque police\u00a0issued a warrant for his arrest last week on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse. A criminal complaint alleges the acts occurred on the set of the series \"The Cleaning Lady,\" which was filmed in Albuquerque.",
      "\"Tim Busfield denies the allegations in the criminal complaint and maintains they are completely false,\" attorney Larry Stein said in a statement to CBS News. \"As a voluntary step, he submitted to an independent polygraph examination regarding those allegations and passed.\"",
      "The 68-year-old actor, who is married to actor Melissa Gilbert and is known for appearances in \"The West Wing,\" \"Field of Dreams\" and \"Thirtysomething,\" has vowed to fight the charges. In a video shared before turning himself in, Busfield called the allegations lies.",
      "Prosecutors are seeking to keep Busfield in custody pending trial, citing a \"history of alleged sexual misconduct.\" They filed a motion early Wednesday detailing their reasons for the request, pointing to what they described as a documented pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse of authority and grooming behavior by Busfield over two decades. They also said witnesses have expressed fear regarding retaliation and professional harm.",
      "Another allegation was reported to law enforcement the same day Busfield turned himself in, Albuquerque Deputy District Attorney Savannah Brandenburg-Koch told the judge Wednesday in a court filing. A father of a then-16-year-old girl alleged Busfield kissed and inappropriately touched his daughter, who he said was auditioning for a role at\u00a0B Street Theatre, an organization Busfield and his brother founded in Sacramento, California. The incident occurred several years ago, according to the document.",
      "Busfield allegedly \"begged the family to not report to law enforcement if he received therapy,\" Brandenburg-Koch said in the motion. The girl's father, who is a therapist himself, said he thought it was the best thing to do at the time, according to the prosecutor.",
      "In a statement to CBS Sacramento, B Street Theatre said that though Busfield is its founder, he has not had an active role in its operations in any capacity since 2001. The theater declined to comment further on Busfield due to the ongoing investigation.",
      "The motion filed in Bernalillo County Metropolitan Court seeking to keep Busfield in custody also states that research and experience show that offenders are uniquely positioned to evade accountability and circumvent safeguards designed to protect children when they wield authority, status or influence.",
      "\"In light of the defendant's demonstrated disregard for boundaries, authority and compliance, no condition or combination of conditions of release can reasonably protect the victims or the community,\" the motion states.",
      "It will be up to a judge to determine whether to grant the request. A detention hearing has yet to be scheduled.",
      "Prosecutors also took issue with Busfield disseminating a video to the media outlet TMZ on Tuesday, suggesting he was prioritizing \"personal narrative control and public relations\" over compliance with the court process.",
      "According to the criminal complaint, an investigator with the police department says the child reported that he was 7 years old when Busfield touched him multiple times on private areas over his clothing. Busfield allegedly touched him on another occasion when he was 8, the complaint said.",
      "The complaint also says the child was reportedly afraid to tell anyone because Busfield was the director and he feared he would get mad at him.",
      "The boy's twin brother told authorities he also was touched by Busfield but did not specify where. He said he didn't say anything because he didn't want to get in trouble.",
      "The mother of the twins reported to Child Protective Services that the abuse occurred between November 2022 and spring 2024, the complaint said.",
      "In an interview with police last fall, Busfield denied the allegations and suggested that the boys' mother was seeking revenge for her children being replaced on the series. The argument was echoed by Busfield's attorney Tuesday.",
      "The investigation began in November 2024 after a call from a doctor at the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque. The boys' parents had gone there at the recommendation of a law firm, the complaint said.",
      "Busfield's attorney said an independent investigation by Warner Bros. was unable to corroborate allegations of inappropriate behavior by Busfield. But prosecutors in their filing argued that the investigator failed to talk to key witnesses.",
      "A publicist for Gilbert said she is \"not making public statements at this time.\"",
      "\"Any purported 'statements' circulating online \u2014 including AI-generated deepfakes of her 'breaking her silence' \u2014 should not be treated as coming from her,\" publicist Ame Van Iden said in a statement, adding, \"Melissa stands with and supports her husband and will address the public at an appropriate time. We ask that their privacy be respected.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The House passed the latest bipartisan funding package Wednesday, moving one step closer to fully funding the government through September.",
      "Congress is rushing to beat a Jan. 30 deadline to pass the annual appropriations bills to avoid another government shutdown.",
      "Top lawmakers on the Senate and House appropriations committees released a two-bill package Sunday that contains funding for the Departments of State, Treasury and other related agencies.",
      "The House voted 341 to 79 to pass the package, kicking it over to the Senate.",
      "The Senate, meanwhile, is moving through procedural votes on a three-bill package that includes funding for the Departments of Commerce, Justice and Interior, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency. The House approved the package last week\u00a0in a vote that was overwhelmingly bipartisan.",
      "If both pieces of legislation make it to President Trump's desk, Congress will have four more appropriations bills to pass to fully fund the government through the end of the fiscal year.",
      "But the Senate has a weeklong recess next week and the House is scheduled to be out the week after \u2014 creating a quick turnaround on the final bills, including a controversial measure to fund the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Plans were dropped to include the Homeland Security Department appropriations in the package unveiled this week after an ICE officer fatally shot a Minnesota woman. Democrats have threatened to withhold their support for this funding if it does not include ICE reforms.",
      "\"It's a politically very sensitive topic,\" GOP Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, said Tuesday. \"That's why we decided not to push ahead with a Homeland bill this week.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said it's \"one of the major issues that the appropriators are confronting right now.\"",
      "Cole said negotiations on the other remaining bills are \"very close\" to wrapping up and he expected passage in both chambers.",
      "\"Then we've just got to strategize how to get Homeland, if we can,\" he said. \"But most of the government should be up and functional.\"",
      "If a deal can't be reached on Homeland Security, Cole said lawmakers would likely pass another temporary measure, which would maintain funding for the agency at its current level.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has not yet disclosed many details about the deal.",
    "story": [
      "The first U.S. sale of Venezuelan oil, valued at $500 million, has been completed, according to an administration official.",
      "The details of the sale haven't yet been disclosed, although the official said more sales are expected in the coming days and weeks. President Trump has said the U.S. will sell 30 million to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil, in partnership with U.S. companies.",
      "White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement that President Trump had \"brokered a historic energy deal with Venezuela\" after Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's arrest \"that will benefit the American and Venezuelan people.\" She said Mr. Trump's team is facilitating discussions with oil companies \"that are ready and willing to make unprecedented investments to restore Venezuela's oil infrastructure.\"",
      "The president\u00a0met with a number of top U.S. oil executives at the White House last week to discuss their needs and concerns. At that gathering, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods told the president that his company had its assets seized under two previous waves of nationalization in Venezuela, and reentering a third time \"would require some pretty significant changes from what we've historically seen here and what is currently the state.\" He called the country \"uninvestable\" until changes are made to the country's legal system and commercial structure.",
      "The White House has presented a strategy to sell millions of barrels of sanctioned Venezuelan oil and control the proceeds, relying on investments from American oil companies to revive the country's oil infrastructure. Proceeds from the sale are to be split among Venezuelans, U.S. companies and the U.S. government, at the discretion of the federal government, the White House has said. The president has said all proceeds going to Venezuela would be used to purchase only American-made products.",
      "\"They know the risks,\" Mr. Trump said of the oil companies. \"There are risks. We're going to help them out. We're going to make it real easy. They're going to be there for a long time. We're going to be there, together, for a long, long time.\"",
      "The U.S. has placed heavy sanctions on Venezuelan oil amid the United States' effort to overhaul the country's government and natural resources.",
      "The majority of Americans, according to a CBS News/YouGov poll, say the U.S. should have not much or no control of Venezuela following the operation to extract and arrest Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's push to change the Defense Department's name to the Department of War could cost nine figures, according to a new estimate by Congress' budget watchdog.",
      "President Trump signed an executive order last September\u00a0to start the process of renaming the federal government's largest employer. The agency now refers to itself as the Department of War on its website and in many official communications, though the agency is still formally called the Department of Defense under federal law.",
      "The cost of the renaming effort could range from $10 million to $125 million, depending on how broadly it is applied, the Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday following a request from Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.",
      "The total price tag could vary depending on how broadly the agency decides to apply the new name and how rapidly the renaming is rolled out, the office said in an 11-page report.",
      "The lower-end $10 million figure would pay for a \"modest implementation\" of Mr. Trump's order that just covers the Office of the Secretary of Defense and its departments, according to the CBO. That would cover the cost of replacing \"digital templates, office signage, and ceremonial materials\" within the office, though the CBO said many of those costs would likely be covered by delaying other budgeted expenses.",
      "The $125 million estimate assumes the name change is applied \"aggressively\" to both the Office of the Secretary of Defense and \"defense-wide agencies\" that support the military. Many of those departments \u2014 like the Defense Intelligence Agency \u2014 have \"defense\" in their names, the CBO notes, so the cost depends in part on whether their names are also changed. Last year, for example, the Defense Acquisition University was changed to the Warfighting Acquisition University.",
      "Also unclear is whether the department will \"rapidly\" change its name, requiring it to spend more money to immediately replace signs and stationary, or if it will more gradually roll out the new name \"as existing stocks [are] exhausted,\" the CBO noted.",
      "The CBO said it didn't get information from the Pentagon about the renaming. But a report sent to Congress found $1.9 million in renaming expenses over a 30-day period for five departments within the Office of the Secretary of Defense \u2014 which the CBO cautioned could be incomplete. The CBO also looked at the cost of prior renaming efforts, including a decision to rename several Army bases with Confederate names that was reversed by the Trump administration.",
      "The military has not offered its own estimated cost for the renaming bid. CBS News has reached out to the Pentagon for comment.",
      "After Mr. Trump's executive order was signed, a department official told CBS News: \"The cost estimate will fluctuate as we carry out President Trump's directive to establish the Department of War's name. We will have a clearer estimate to report at a later time.\"",
      "At the time, Mr. Trump told reporters the name change wouldn't cost \"a lot.\"",
      "\"You know, we know how to rebrand without having to go crazy,\" the president said. \"We don't have to re-carve a mountain or anything...We're going to start changing the stationery as it comes due, and lots of things like that. We're not going to be doing things like have been done in the past, when they change the name of forts that shouldn't have been changed.\"",
      "By comparison, the military's\u00a0total annual budget is around $900 billion.",
      "Merkley, the top Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, called the renaming process wasteful and \"performative government at its worst.\"",
      "\"Instead of prioritizing bringing down the cost of groceries or health care, Trump and his cronies are focused on vanity projects like renaming the Department of Defense to the Department of War \u2013 potentially costing American taxpayers upwards of $125 million,\" Merkley said in a statement.",
      "The name Department of War isn't new. From the 1790s to the 1940s, the U.S. military was split into a War Department that oversaw the Army, and a Navy Department that oversaw naval forces and, later, the Marine Corps. After World War II, the two departments were merged into a single entity known as the Department of Defense.",
      "In public remarks in September, Mr. Trump called that postwar renaming \"woke.\"",
      "\"It's gonna fight to win, not to lose. We're gonna go on offense, not just on defense,\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said, adding that the U.S. will \"raise up warriors, not just defenders.\"",
      "Chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said at the time that the change was a \"nod to our proud heritage\" and an acknowledgement of the department's \"core mission: winning wars.\"",
      "\"This has always been our mission, and while we hope for peace, we will prepare for war,\" Parnell said. \"Defense isn't enough\u2014we've got to be ready to strike and dominate our enemies.\"",

    "summary": "A panel for the U.S. Central District Court of California ruled Democrats can proceed in using their redrawn congressional maps for the 2026 midterm elections.",
    "story": [
      "A federal three-judge panel for the U.S. Central District Court of California upheld Prop 50, ruling that Democrats can proceed in using their newly redrawn congressional maps\u00a0in the state for the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "The court found \"that the evidence presented reflects that Proposition 50 was exactly what it was billed as: a political gerrymander designed to flip five Republican-held seats to the Democrats.\"",
      "The judges rejected Republican plaintiffs' claims that the maps had been drawn to favor Latino voters over other voting groups. The opinion was written by Judge Josephine Stanton, with Judge Kenneth Lee dissenting in the 2-1 decision.",
      "The Trump administration and California Republicans sued Gov. Gavin Newsom and California Secretary of State Shirley Weber, claiming the recently approved congressional maps were drawn to favor Hispanic voters over other racial groups. Republicans argued race was a predominant factor in drawing the district boundaries, in violation of the 14th and 15th Amendments.",
      "Republicans had asked the court for a preliminary injunction that would block the maps from being used in 2026.",
      "In a statement after the ruling, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said, \"Republicans' weak attempt to silence voters failed. California voters overwhelmingly supported Prop 50 \u2014 to respond to Trump's rigging in Texas \u2014 and that is exactly what this court concluded.\"",
      "Rob Bonta, the state's attorney general, pointed out that there have so far been no successful challenges to the measure.",
      "\"Today's decision upholds the will of the people. It also means that, to date, every single challenge against Proposition 50 has failed,\" Bonta said in a statement.",
      "In November, California voters backed the new maps through the ballot measure known as Proposition 50,\u00a0 voting to amend their state's constitution so that the new map could be used from 2026 to 2030. The new map shifts five of California's Republican U.S. House seats to be more favorable to Democrats in the midterm elections this year.",
      "California Democrats argued in court that the new congressional maps were drawn for partisan reasons and to shore up support for vulnerable Democratic congressional candidates. They said they were retaliating against\u00a0Texas' redistricting legislation, signed into law in August, which aims to help Republicans secure five additional House seats.",
      "In December, the Supreme Court allowed Texas to keep its redrawn maps. In its ruling, the Supreme Court said that \"Texas adopted the first new map, then California responded with its own map for the stated purpose of counteracting what Texas had done.\"",
      "In a concurring opinion, Justice Samuel Alito, who was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, wrote that \"it is indisputable \u2013 that the impetus for the adoption of the Texas map (like the map subsequently adopted in California) was partisan advantage pure and simple.\"",
      "Ahead of Wednesday's ruling, legal sources familiar with California's case contended that Republicans would face an uphill battle in court, given the Supreme Court's go-ahead ruling on the Texas case, and would likely not be able to meet the burden of showing that race was the predominant factor in redistricting.",
      "At the core of Republicans' case in court were public statements made by Paul Mitchell, head of the consulting firm tasked to draw the congressional maps for California. Mitchell told outside groups he intended to bolster Latino voters in the 13th Congressional District.",
      "After the closing arguments in December, Bill Essayli, the U.S. attorney for the Central District of California, told CBS News that Mitchell's intent in using race as a factor was clear from his statements.",
      "\"In this case, we do have an admission from Paul Mitchell that that was his intent, and that was his purpose,\" Essayli said.",
      "During the closing hearing, U.S. District Judge Josephine L. Staton pushed back on the federal government's argument, raising California voters's support for the ballot measure.",
      "Mitchell did not testify in court during the three-day hearing, despite Republicans' attempts to call him as a witness.",
      "The case has been closely watched as the race for control of the U.S. House in next year's midterm elections gets underway. Along with California and Texas, several other states have also engaged in gerrymandering efforts.",

    "published": "Wed, 14 Jan 2026 16:47:36 -0500",
    "summary": "The FBI's search is part of a probe into a federal employee suspected of mishandling classified information, Attorney General Pam Bondi said.",
    "story": [
      "The FBI executed a search warrant at the home of a Washington Post reporter this week as part of an investigation into a federal employee who is suspected of mishandling classified information, Attorney General Pam Bondi said.",
      "In a statement, Bondi said the warrant was executed at the request of the Pentagon.",
      "\"The leaker is currently behind bars,\" she said. \"I am proud to work alongside Secretary Hegseth on this effort. The Trump Administration will not tolerate illegal leaks of classified information that, when reported, pose a grave risk to our Nation's national security and the brave men and women who are serving our country.\"",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed on social media that law enforcement executed the search warrant Wednesday and alleged the journalist had received \"classified, sensitive military information from a government contractor \u2014 endangering our warfighters and compromising America's national security. The alleged leaker was arrested this week and is in custody. As this is an ongoing investigation, we will have no further comment.\"",
      "The decision to execute a search warrant at the home of a journalist is highly unusual, and could escalate the already tense relationship between the media and the Trump administration.",
      "It was unclear why the Justice Department felt the need to search the home of a reporter even though the target of the investigation has already been charged and detained.",
      "Historically in Espionage Act investigations into leaks of classified information, the department has pursued the leakers, but not the journalists who receive the classified information.",
      "In April 2025, Bondi issued a memo that made it easier for prosecutors investigating leaks to the news media to subpoena records and testimony from journalists, rescinding a prior policy under former Attorney General Merrick Garland.",
      "Under those regulations, prosecutors in criminal investigations are allowed to use subpoenas, court orders and search warrants to compel \"production of information and testimony by and relating to members of the news media,\" the memo stated at the time.",
      "The Biden administration had previously imposed new restrictions that made it much harder to seize reporters' phones and email records, after the department faced criticism in Trump's first term for secretly serving subpoenas on both journalists and congressional staff members in connection with leak investigations.",
      "The FBI conducted the search at the Alexandria, Virginia, home of reporter Hannah Natanson, who writes about the federal workforce for the newspaper, according to the Washington Post.",
      "The Washington Post said that federal agents searched her home and her devices, seizing her phone, two laptops and a Garmin watch.",
      "Natanson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "A Justice Department official told CBS News in a statement that the search of her home is \"consistent with the law.\"",
      "According to The Washington Post, the warrant shows the investigation is targeting Aurelio Perez-Lugones, a system administrator in Maryland who holds a top secret security clearance.",
      "Perez-Lugones, a government contractor in Annapolis, Maryland, and former member of the U.S. Navy, was already charged on Jan. 8 in a criminal complaint with violating the Espionage Act for unlawfully retaining national defense information.",
      "Perez-Lugones, who holds a top secret security clearance, is accused of accessing a classified report related to an unnamed foreign country, taking a screen shot and printing it.",
      "He also allegedly accessed another report related to a government operational activity and took notes on a yellow notepad.",
      "During a search of his Laurel, Maryland, home and car that same day, the FBI found a document marked as \"secret\" in his lunchbox, the criminal complaint says. More documents marked as \"secret\" were also discovered in his basement, the complaint said.",
      "A hearing in Perez-Lugones' case has been scheduled for Thursday in Baltimore.",
      "A Justice Department official told CBS News that the Washington Post reporter had been communicating with Perez-Lugones.",
      "\"This is about the unauthorized disclosure of classified information, and we will hold him accountable for his extremely serious crimes. At the time of his arrest, Perez-Lugones was actively communicating with the reporter on his mobile device, and in this chat, there was classified information,\" the official added.",
      "A spokesperson for the Post said that the paper is reviewing and monitoring the situation.",
      "Several former Justice Department officials told CBS that the decision to search a reporter's home, particularly in a case where the alleged leaker has already been charged, raises First Amendment concerns and appears to be a possible effort to intimidate the news media.",
      "David Aaron, a former prosecutor at the Justice Department's National Security Division who previously handled media leak investigations, said executing a search warrant at a journalist's home is uncommon, but not prohibited by law, either.",
      "\"It is highly unusual to search the residence of a member of the news media in a leak investigation,\" he told CBS News. \"There is, however, no absolute rule against it.\"",
      "He added that if the journalist's role in this case was consistent with the typical role a journalist plays in leak cases, then the department's decision to execute a search warrant marks \"a significant change in tactics.\"",

    "story": [
      "A coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups is calling on Google and Apple to remove access to social media platform X and its AI app, Grok, from their app stores after Grok allowed users to generate sexualized images of minors and women.",
      "The organizations, which focus on child safety, women's rights and privacy, expressed their concerns in\u00a0letters\u00a0on Wednesday to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, claiming that Grok's content violates the technology companies' policies.",
      "\"We demand that Google leadership urgently remove Grok and X from the Play Store to prevent further abuse and criminal activity,\" the groups said, using the same language in its letter to Apple.",
      "Apple and Google didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "Elon Musk, who owns X and xAI, the company that developed Grok,\u00a0said\u00a0in a social media post on Wednesday that he is \"not aware of naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.\" He also said the chatbot declines prompts to generate illegal images.",
      "\"There may be times when adversarial hacking of Grok prompts does something unexpected. If that happens, we fix the bug immediately,\" he wrote.",
      "Criticism of Grok escalated in early January after the generative-AI app enabled users to create images of minors wearing minimal clothing. In response to a user prompt, Grok acknowledged lapses in its digital safeguards.",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, told CBS News earlier this month that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok. In a December\u00a0analysis, the group estimated the chatbot was creating \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which seeks to eliminate child sexual abuse from the internet, has also raised concerns about Grok and other AI tools.",
      "\"We are extremely concerned about the ease and speed with which people can apparently generate photo-realistic child sexual abuse material.\" Ngaire Alexander, head of hotline at IWF, told CBS News in a statement last week. \"Tools like Grok now risk bringing sexual AI imagery of children into the mainstream.\"",

    "summary": "The venerable retailer is seeking protection from its creditors after its $2.65 billion purchase of Nieman Marcus failed to spark growth.",
    "story": [
      "Saks Global filed for bankruptcy protection late Tuesday, according to court documents entered in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston, throwing the future of the roughly century-old high-end department store chain into doubt. Saks Global is the parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman.",
      "Saks also said it had secured a $1.75 billion financing package and that it would keep its stores open as the bankruptcy procedure plays out.",
      "Saks recently missed a debt payment stemming from a 2024 deal by its parent company, Hudson's Bay Company, to buy\u00a0rival luxury retailer Neiman Marcus\u00a0for $2.65 billion, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0in late December, citing people familiar with the matter.",
      "Swamped by debt",
      "Hudson's Bay raised $2 billion in debt to complete the Nieman Marcus deal, while Apollo Global Management affiliates provided an additional $1.5 billion in financing. Amazon also took a minority stake in Saks to facilitate the deal.",
      "\"The debt-fueled acquisition of Neiman Marcus always made bankruptcy a likely destination for Saks Global,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of market research firm GlobalData. \"The only real surprise has been the speed of the collapse, which has come barely a year after the deal closed.\"",
      "Saks also missed a more than $100 million interest payment to bondholders, according to the Journal, which said the retailer has fallen behind on payments to vendors. Some suppliers have responded by withholding shipments, leaving Saks with thinner merchandise offerings.",
      "\"The truth is that Saks Global put itself in a financially precarious position that undermined the day-to-day operations of the business. A lack of cash meant suppliers went unpaid. This created inventory gaps which then drove customers away and caused revenue and cash generation to plummet,\" Saunders added.",
      "New York-based Saks launched in 1924, opening its first store in Manhattan, according to a historical account of the company posted on its website. The company expanded quickly between the 1970s and 1990s before it was purchased by Hudson's Bay in 2013. Saks's brands include luxury retailer Bergdorf Goodman, which was acquired as part of the deal for Neiman Marcus; retailer Saks Off 5th, and home furnishings seller Horchow.",
      "8,100 store closures",
      "Saks appointed former Neiman Marcus CEO Geoffroy van Raemdonck as its new CEO, effective immediately. He succeeds Richard Baker, who stepped down from his role as Saks executive chairman and CEO on Jan. 13. Saks had announced\u00a0on Jan. 2 that Baker would succeed CEO Marc Metrick as chief executive.",
      "\"If there is one positive from the bankruptcy, it's that the previous management team has been cleared out,\" Saunders said. They bear responsibility for the mess, and their reputation with vendors and associates at the firm is thoroughly tarnished.\"",
      "Tim Hynes, global head of credit research at Debtwire, said van Raemdonck is well-suited for his new role, having previously served as CEO of Neiman Marcus, which he led through bankruptcy.",
      "\"He has a background in turning situations around, and he is familiar with Neiman Marcus, so he is a better fit,\" Hynes told CBS News.",
      "Brick-and-mortar retailers face ongoing competitive challenges from e-commerce giants like Amazon and \"fast-fashion\" sellers such as H&M and Uniqlo. More than 8,100 stores closed across the U.S. in 2025, up roughly 12% from the previous year, according to retail industry analytics firm Coresight Research.",
      "\"In general, brick-and-mortar retailers are not growing, so store closures would be somewhat positive for anybody that competes with Saks,\" Hynes said.",
      "What does this mean for shoppers?",
      "Saks Global is reorganizing, not liquidating, so its brands will remain in business for now. But analysts expect Saks to close some stores to save money on costly leases. The fate of the retailer's Fifth Avenue store remains unclear.",
      "When Saks missed payments to vendors, some brands stopped shipping new inventory, leaving its store shelves thinly stocked.",
      "\"Since Saks put in place a widely panned vendor payment plan, many vendors reduced, and as the year went on, stopped shipments to Saks,\" mergers and acquisitions attorney Jonathan Lazarow told CBS News.",
      "Shoppers can now expect the retailer to start receiving new inventory again, now that it has secured a bankruptcy loan and can resume payments to vendors.",

      "A new lawsuit filed against OpenAI alleges that its ChatGPT artificial intelligence app encouraged a 40-year-old Colorado man to commit suicide.",
      "The complaint filed in California state court by Stephanie Gray, the mother of Austin Gordon, accuses OpenAI and CEO Sam Altman of building a defective and dangerous product that led to Gordon's death.",
      "Gordon, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in November 2025, had intimate exchanges with ChatGPT, according to the suit, which also alleged that the generative AI tool romanticized death.",
      "\"ChatGPT turned from Austin's super-powered resource to a friend and confidante, to an unlicensed therapist, and in late 2025, to a frighteningly effective suicide coach,\" the complaint alleged.",
      "The lawsuit comes amid scrutiny over the AI chatbot's effect on mental health, with OpenAI also facing\u00a0other lawsuits alleging that ChatGPT played a role in encouraging people to take their own lives.",
      "Gray is seeking damages for her son's death.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, an OpenAI spokesperson called Gordon's death a \"very tragic situation\" and said the company is reviewing the filings to understand the details.",
      "\"We have continued to improve ChatGPT's training to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support,\" the spokesperson said. \"We have also continued to strengthen ChatGPT's responses in sensitive moments, working closely with mental health clinicians.\"",
      "\"Suicide lullaby\"",
      "According to Gray's suit, shortly before Gordon's death, ChatGPT allegedly said in one exchange, \"[W]hen you're ready... you go. No pain. No mind. No need to keep going. Just... done.\"",
      "ChatGPT \"convinced Austin \u2014 a personwho had already told ChaiGPT that he was sad, and who had discussed mental health struggles in detail with it \u2014 that choosing to live was not the right choice to make,\" according to the complaint. \"It went on and on, describing the end of existence as a peaceful and beautiful place, and reassuring him that he should not be afraid.\"",
      "ChatGPT also effectively turned his favorite childhood book, Margaret Wise Brown's \"Goodnight Moon,\" into what the lawsuit refers to as a \"suicide lullaby.\" Three days after that exchange ended in late October 2025, law enforcement found Gordon's body alongside a copy of the book, the complaint alleges.",
      "The lawsuit accuses OpenAI of designing ChatGPT 4, the version of the app Gordon was using at the time of his death, in a way that fosters people's \"unhealthy dependencies\" on the tool.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court ruled 7-2 in favor of Illinois Rep. Michael Bost, a Republican.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday revived an Illinois congressman's lawsuit challenging a state law that allows mail-in ballots received up to 14 days after Election Day to be counted.",
      "The high court divided 7-2 in siding with Congressman Michael Bost, an Illinois Republican who challenged his state's law for counting late-arriving ballots. The high court found that he has the legal right to sue over the rules that govern the counting of votes in his election to Congress. Chief Justice John Roberts authored the opinion for the majority, and Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.",
      "The court's decision reverses a ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit, which found that Bost lacked the legal standing to sue and affirmed a district court decision dismissing Bost's case. The Supreme Court sent the case back to the lower courts for further proceedings.",
      "\"Under Article III of the Constitution, plaintiffs must have a 'personal stake' in a case to have standing to sue,\" Roberts wrote. \"They must, in other words, be able to answer a basic question: 'What's in it to you?' Congressman Bost has an obvious answer: He is a candidate for office. And a candidate has a personal stake in the rules that govern the counting of votes in his election.\"",
      "The decision from the Supreme Court allows Bost's challenge to Illinois' ballot-counting law to move forward. The legality of Illinois' law was not at issue in the case.",
      "The high court is, however, set to decide later in its term whether federal law prohibits states from counting mail-in ballots that arrive after Election Day in a case involving Mississippi's voting procedures.",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett agreed with the outcome of the case, but disagreed with the majority's reasoning. In a concurring opinion joined by Justice Elena Kagan, Barrett said the majority's decision was \"unmoored from precedent\" and \"unnecessary.\" She said that Bost can sue because he suffered a \"pocketbook injury,\" since the counting of late-arriving ballots required him to run his campaign for 14 more days and therefore cost him time, money and other resources.",
      "In a dissent joined by Sotomayor, Jackson cautioned that the ruling has \"far-reaching implications\" beyond Bost's election. She warned the decision will open the floodgates to election-related litigation brought by candidates and invites \"late-breaking judicial intervention into the political process.\"",
      "\"By carving out a bespoke rule for candidate-plaintiffs \u2014 granting them standing 'to challenge the rules that govern the counting of votes,' simply and solely because they are 'candidate[s] for office' \u2014 the court now complicates and destabilizes both our standing law and America's electoral processes,\" Jackson wrote.",
      "Bost and two presidential-elector nominees filed their original lawsuit in 2022 and alleged that Illinois' law that allowed ballots postmarked by, but received within two weeks of, the election to be counted violated federal law.",
      "A U.S. district court ruled that Bost did not have standing to sue and dismissed the lawsuit. The appeals court upheld that decision, finding in part that the harms to Bost were \"speculative.\"",
      "In arguing that he had the right to sue, Bost said that Illinois' extension of the mail-in ballot deadline harms candidates' chances for election and costs them money because it requires them to extend campaigns and get-out-the-vote efforts, as well as send campaign staff to oversee the counting of late-arriving ballots.",
      "The Supreme Court's majority agreed that candidates have \"concrete and particularized interest in the rules that govern the counting of votes in their elections, regardless whether those rules harm their electoral prospects or increase the costs of their campaigns.\"",
      "\"Their interest extends to the integrity of the election \u2014 and the democratic process by which they earn or lose the support of the people they seek to represent,\" Roberts wrote.",
      "The Trump administration backed Bost in the case. Illinois officials had urged the Supreme Court to uphold the lower court's decision.",
      "Illinois Solicitor General Jane Notz told the court during arguments in October that a ruling finding that candidates always have standing to challenge the rules that govern their elections would lead to \"chaos\" for election officials and force the federal courts to resolve \"abstract policy disputes.\"",

That remains significantly above the 2.7% for all goods, according to the latest Consumer Price Index\u00a0data. On a monthly basis, food prices rose 0.7% last month \u2014 the largest jump since September 2022.",

      "CPI tracks the rate at which prices rise over time. But consumers' perception of food costs is more likely to be influenced by the prices they see on the store shelves. People pay for groceries on a more regular basis than other expenses, with a trip to the supermarket a frequent reminder that food is pricier than it used to be, said David Ortega, a professor and food economist at Michigan State University.",
      "\"We come into contact with food prices much more than we do other prices in the economy,\" he told CBS News.",
      "The rise in food prices in Tuesday's CPI reading is being driven by certain food categories like\u00a0beef and coffee, which have hit record highs, according to Ortega.\u00a0CBS News' price tracker shows that overall food prices have jumped nearly 19% since January 2022.",

      "Ortega agreed, adding that an increase in the number of people dining out since the COVID-19 pandemic is also putting upward pressure on menu prices.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Bill and Hillary Clinton refused to appear before the House Oversight Committee to testify as part of its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, setting up a legal confrontation as the Republican-led panel threatens to hold them in contempt of Congress.",
      "Republican Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, the committee's chairman, said the panel will move next Wednesday on holding the former president and former secretary of state in criminal contempt.",
      "\"We're going to hold both Clintons in criminal contempt of Congress,\" Comer told reporters Wednesday.",
      "If the committee votes to hold them in contempt, it would advance to the full House for a vote on whether to recommend the matter to the Justice Department for prosecution.",
      "The panel subpoenaed the former president and former secretary of state in August as part of the investigation. The committee had requested that Bill Clinton appear on Tuesday and Hillary Clinton on Wednesday.",
      "In a separate eight-page letter to Comer, the Clintons' attorneys made it clear they would not appear for the closed-door questioning.",
      "\"President and Secretary Clinton have already provided the limited information they possess about Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell to the Committee,\" the Clintons' attorneys said in the letter dated Jan. 12, which was obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"They did so proactively and voluntarily, and despite the fact that the Subpoenas are invalid and legally unenforceable, untethered to a valid legislative purpose, unwarranted because they do not seek pertinent information, and an unprecedented infringement on the separation of powers,\" the letter said.",
      "In a separate letter to Comer on Tuesday that was signed by the Clintons, they noted that several other former officials were subpoenaed as part of the investigation and not forced to testify. In August, the committee also subpoenaed former Attorneys General Merrick Garland, Bill Barr, Alberto Gonzales, Jeff Sessions, Loretta Lynch and Eric Holder, and former FBI Directors James Comey and Robert Mueller.",
      "\"We are confident that any reasonable person in or out of Congress will see, based on everything we release, that what you are doing is trying to punish those who you see as your enemies and to protect those you think are your friends,\" the Clintons wrote.",
      "\"Every person has to decide when they have seen or had enough and are ready to fight for this country, its principles and its people, no matter the consequences,\" they said. \"For us, now is that time.\"",
      "The Clintons' attorneys called the effort \"nothing more than a ploy to attempt to embarrass\" President Trump's political rivals. Last month, Mr. Trump\u00a0called on the Justice Department to release any Epstein-related materials that name Democrats to \"embarrass them.\"",
      "Bill Clinton has appeared in photos with Epstein and took a handful of trips with him decades ago, but has not been accused of any wrongdoing. The materials also contain references to Mr. Trump, who also has not been accused of any misconduct.",
      "\"No one's accusing Bill Clinton of any wrongdoing. We just have questions,\" Comer told reporters Tuesday after the former president failed to show up.",
      "The Clintons' legal team and the committee have been going back and forth for months over the requested depositions. The committee initially requested they appear in October, but then delayed the date until December. Both Clintons declined the December dates, citing the need to attend a funeral.",
      "Former presidents have not successfully been compelled to testify before Congress, but several have voluntarily answered questions from committees.",

    "summary": "Forensic testing finally confirmed the identity of a former Oregon mayor whose remains were found on a beach near Seattle in 2006.",
    "story": [
      "The remains of a former Oregon mayor have been identified two decades after his disappearance, according to the forensics laboratory that helped confirm the ID.",
      "Edwin Asher was declared dead in 2006, when authorities presumed he drowned while crabbing in Tillamook Bay along the Oregon coast, said the laboratory, Othram, which worked on his case. Separately, in November 2006, the skeletal remains of an unidentified person were discovered on a beach on the Quinault reservation in Grays Harbor County, Washington.",
      "At the time, the Grays Harbor Sheriff's Office and the Grays Harbor County Coroner's Office launched an investigation, determining that the remains belonged to an adult man between 20 and 60 years old, who stood at about 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighed between 170 and 180 pounds, according to Othram. But they could not identify the person beyond that, and he became known as \"Grays Harbor County John Doe (2006).\"",
      "Investigators partnered with Othram when they revisited the case in 2025. Scientists at the laboratory conducted DNA tests and used investigative genetic genealogy \u2014 a technique that aims to solve cold cases through relatives of the individual whose DNA is being tested \u2014 to eventually confirm Asher's identity.",
      "Asher was originally reported missing by his wife in September 2006, after he failed to return home from his fishing trip, local newspaper The Astorian reported at the time. Coast Guard crews searched for the 72-year-old resident of Fossil, a city in central Oregon, and found his boat but no signs of him, according to the newspaper.",
      "Asher's wife had told the Coast Guard that her husband did not typicaly wear a life vest while out on the bay, where his boat was found, and also could not swim. Officials suspected that Asher may have fallen overboard, The Astorian reported.",
      "According to Asher's obituary, he moved to Fossil in 1952 with his first wife and at one point served as the city's mayor. He opened a shop called Asher's Variety Store in 1965 and also volunteered as a local fireman and ambulance driver. Asher was survived by three biological children and six stepchildren from three marriages, the obituary said.",

    "story": [
      "Timothy Busfield turned himself into police on Tuesday after authorities in New Mexico issued an arrest warrant for the director and Emmy Award-winning actor accused of child sex abuse.",
      "A spokesperson for the Albuquerque Police Department confirmed to CBS News that Busfield had surrendered. He was booked into the Metropolitan Detention Center in Bernalillo County   on a child sex abuse charge. The arrest warrant, which was signed by a judge, said the charge was for two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor.",
      "An investigator with the Albuquerque Police Department on Friday filed a criminal complaint that alleged a child reported that Busfield touched him inappropriately. The acts allegedly occurred on the set of \"The Cleaning Lady,\" a TV series that Busfield directed and acted in.",
      "In a video provided to TMZ, Busfield said the allegations \"are all lies.\"",
      "\"I did not do anything to those little boys,\" the 68-year-old actor said in the video appearing to show him in Albuquerque. He said he arrived in the city after driving 2,000 miles.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News, Busfield's attorney, Stanton \"Larry\" Stein, said his client \"is innocent and is determined to clear his name,\" adding that \"the claims\" against Busfield are \"completely false.\"",
      "The criminal complaint states the boy reported that he was 7 years old when Busfield touched him three or four times on private areas over his clothing. Busfield allegedly touched him five or six times on another occasion when he was 8, the complaint said.",
      "The child was reportedly afraid to tell anyone because Busfield was the director and he feared he would get mad at him, the complaint said.",
      "The boy's twin brother told authorities he was touched by Busfield but did not specify where. He said he didn't say anything because he didn't want to get in trouble.",
      "When interviewed by authorities, Busfield suggested that the boys' mother was seeking revenge for her children being replaced on the series. He also said he likely would have picked up and tickled the boys, saying the set was a playful environment.",
      "The mother of the twins \u2014 who are identified only by their initials in court records \u2014 reported to Child Protective Services that the abuse occurred between November 2022 and spring 2024, the complaint said.",
      "\"The Cleaning Lady\" aired for four seasons on Fox, ending in 2025. It was produced by Warner Bros., which, according to the complaint, conducted its own investigation into the abuse allegations but was unable to corroborate them.",
      "Busfield is known for appearances in \"The West Wing,\" \"Field of Dreams\" and \"Thirtysomething,\" the latter of which won him an Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series in 1991. He is married to actor\u00a0Melissa Gilbert, who deactivated her Instagram account amid the allegations.",
      "Gilbert indicated through a publicist that she won't speak publicly at the request of attorneys for Busfield while the legal process unfolds.",
      "\"Her focus is on supporting and caring for their very large family,\" publicist Ame Van Iden said in a statement provided to CBS News. \"Melissa stands with and supports her husband and will address the public at an appropriate time.\"",
      "The investigation began in November 2024, when the investigator responded to a call from a doctor at the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque. The boys' parents had gone there at the recommendation of a law firm, the complaint said.",
      "According to the complaint, one of the boys has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. A social worker documented him saying he has had nightmares about Busfield touching him.",

      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, there's a lot of help on the way and in different forms, including economic help from our standpoint, and we're not gonna help Iran very much. And, you know, we put Iran out of business with their nuclear capacity, and now, depending on what's actually happening--nobody's been able to give us accurate numbers about how many people they've killed.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Well, on that point, Mr. President.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: But it looks like it could be a pretty substantial number, and that's gonna be a lot of problems for them.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: A lot of problems. On that point, you-- you did say the U.S. would get involved if Iran started killing protesters--",

      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Well, now we're hearing that they're gonna start hanging protesters tomorrow, so it comes back to the question, have they crossed your red line, or has the line moved?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I haven't heard about the hanging. If they hang 'em, you're gonna see some things that-- I don't know what you're-- where you come from and what your thought process is, but you'll perhaps be very happy.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: What do you mean by that?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We will take very strong action. If they do such a thing, we will take very strong action.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: And this strong action you're talking about, what's the endgame?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The endgame is to win. I like winning. And we're winning.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: How do you define that in Iran?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, let's define it in Venezuela. Let's define it with al-Baghdadi. He was wiped out. Let's define it with Soleimani, and let's define it in Iran, where- wiped out the Iran nuclear threat in a period of about 15 minutes once the B-2s got there. And that was a complete obliteration, as it turns out, which is what I said initially. Then some questioned it and they said, you know, Trump was right. So we've been right about everything. We don't want to see what's happening in Iran happen. And, you know, if they want to have protests, that's one thing. When they start killing thousands of people. And now you're telling me about hanging. We'll see how that works out for them. It's not going to work out good.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: There's so much going on overseas. Understandably, a lot of your focus has been on other countries. But when I talk to Americans, when I talk to your own voters, they want your focus to be on them, and they feel like it may be drifting. What do you have to say to them?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, Tony, we have the strongest economy maybe in the history of our country. If you went around this plant, like I have, they just announced they're going to 24 hours. This is a Ford plant, but GM's the same, Stellantis is the same. They're going 24 hours all around the clock. They're enlarging every plant in this country. We're building more plants in the country than we've ever built. There's no inflation. You saw the inflation numbers have-- inflation's very low.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: It seemed bad on groceries--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Wait a minute. Our growth numbers are through the roof. Our job numbers are tremendous. We have the highest stock market we've ever had. Today we hit-- every day for the last, I think, 48 times out of 11 months, 48 days out of 11 months, we've had the number one stock market in the history of our country. So my big focus is here. But you-- you can't be forgetting about bad threats. You can't be forgetting about an Iran with a nuclear weapon. You can't forget that there's tremendous wealth in the Middle East, and a lot of that wealth is coming over here to build plants. Saudi Arabia's giving us $2 trillion. Qatar is giving us $2 trillion. UAE is giving us $2 trillion. All of that is for the good of this country. So my focus is very much on this country, and-- but you can't lose sight of the fact that we need peace all over the world.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I've ended eight wars. If we had those eight wars raging, it would be very bad for this country.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Mr. President, you mentioned the market there. I've got a question that might affect the markets. It's the Jerome Powell situation. He's the Fed chair. I know you've said you had nothing to do with the investigation, the criminal probe into him. But you have been criticizing him for mo--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Oh, he's terrible. No, I think he's--",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: --for most of the last year. And-- and even some prominent conservatives say it-- it looks like political retribution.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And some prominent conservatives also love it, so, you know, you gotta mention them too--",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Well, what do you say to that accusation?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: As you grow older in this position, you have to mention the other side. More people like it than not. He's been a lousy Fed chairman. He was reappointed by Biden. I was a little surprised at that, because I didn't think he really earned his stripes. He's been too high on interest rates, and I call him 'too late.' He's too late to reduce. He should have reduced 'em by more. Despite that, we fought through that. In addition, he heads up a construction situation on a rebuilding of a little building, two little buildings in-- called the Fed.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah.",

      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think I could have done that job. I could have fixed 'em up for $25 million. He's into billions and billions of dollars, and it looks like they won't open for a long time. And he's either corrupt or incompetent.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: So on the question of corrupt or incompetent - you're right, some prominent conservatives are criticizing this. I'll take your word that others are not.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, you don't have to take my word. What you should do is go out and interview some people, and you'll find out.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: But on this direct question about political retribution, what it looks like, sir, what's your response?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I can't help what it looks like. Look, I've created the greatest economy maybe in history, and you're seeing that now. Plants are being built all over the country. We've never had anything like it. They're leaving Canada, they're leaving Mexico, they're leaving Japan and all over Europe, Germany, all over Europe. They're coming in. Bill Ford, Ford Motor Company--",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah I just saw him.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: He just told me that he's never seen anything like what's happened. I also freed up some of the environmental nonsense which made it impo-- virtually impossible to build a car and certainly to build a car for the right cost.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And they're doing better than they've ever done. AI, we're leading China by a lot. We're leading China by a tremendous amount. We're leading everybody at everything. And then we had a big victory. I would say that even you would say that. We had a big victory with Venezuela. We had a big victory with Iran. We have a lot of victories. We don't have any defeats, and I want to keep it that way.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: I've got an important question about the situation in Minnesota. The death of Renee Nicole Good. I've been speaking to her father, who is a big supporter of yours--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Good.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: --like many Americans are. But he's heartbroken right now.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I can understand that, yeah.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: He's heartbroken because his daughter is dead, that's obvious.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: He's also heartbroken because your administration so quickly has come out and said she's a domestic terrorist. What do you wanna say to her father right now?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I wanna say to the father that I love all of our people. They can be on the other side. As you say, he might be on my side, he's--",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: He is on your side.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: And I think that's great. And-- and I do, I think it's great. And I would bet you that she, under normal circumstances, was a very solid, wonderful person. But, you know, her actions were pretty tough. And I've seen it many ways and many different shapes and forms. But the bottom line is, look, we have hundreds of thousands of murderers in our countries, killers. ICE is trying to get them out. They were let in through an open border policy of sleepy Joe Biden. ICE is working very hard to get them out. Their job is being made very, very difficult. And, you know, when you look at that tape, it-- it can be viewed two ways, I guess. But when you look at the way that was-- that car was pulled away-- there were a couple of versions of that tape that are very, very bad.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: I wanna talk about the economy while we have you here. The inflation numbers came out. Overall not bad, but grocery prices--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, no, overall very good. Good for us, good for our country. Joe Biden had the highest inflation numbers in history, correct?",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: The direction--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I have 'em down to a level that they haven't seen in about nine years.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Then Mr. President, help me understand. When I travel the country, and I go all over the place, and I talk to everyday Americans, they tell me they don't feel it, because grocery prices are up-",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, they might not, but they're going to now. I've only been here for 11 months, okay? And, you know, the first few months were really rough if you look at 'em, because I inherited a mess. I inherited a mess of crime. I inherited a mess of inflation. I inherited a mess of places closing up and going to other countries. And now we have the hottest country in the world. Tony, we have now the hottest country in the world. And a year and a half ago our country was dead. We had a dead country. You wouldn't have a job right now. If she got in, you probably wouldn't have a job right now. Your boss, who's an amazing guy, might be bust, okay?",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Might be what?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: That's how bad- might be bust. I doubt it in his case, but you never know. Let me just tell you, you wouldn't have this job. You wouldn't have this job, certainly whatever the hell they're paying you. Our country is rocketing right now. We have the hottest country in the world. If they got in, we would be Venezuela on steroids.",

      "TONY DOKOUPIL: --I'm coming around.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I agree. I said, \"I want electric, and I want gasoline, and I want hybrids, I want everything.\" But you were gonna be forced under the mandate to buy an electric car in a very short period of time. I didn't want that. And I ended that. Now people can have electric. They can have gasoline. They can have hybrid.",

Now, what's gonna happen is people are being trained rapidly, and you're gonna have a thing called robots. And robots are gonna be a big factor. I predict--",

      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --that robots are gonna be a big factor in the future, and it's gonna help out. But you have--",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Well, I--I-",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: --you have a situation now where our economy is doing so well that it's not that easy to get people. We're training people. They're training people. Companies are training people. And they're doing well.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Why do you think--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You know, that's a positive question you asked me. I don't think you asked it in that way, but we are doing so well right now that we're training people to take those jobs. One other thing, we terminated many federal jobs. Those federal-- because that's a good thing. Because they wanna go private. The way you make our country great is you can't have too many federal workers, all right? Those workers are being trained to go into the private sector at a much higher salary.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah. Let's talk about robotics for a second, because that's a concern of a lotta people working.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Sure.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Not only here, but all over the country. What is the future for jobs like these? One guy told me on the way in, he thinks it's a critical threat to his industry.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, you know, in one light you're telling me that, you know, you can't get workers.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Well, that's what the CEO said.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm-- well, you said that. And then you said the opposite in front of me. You can't have it both ways. Look, we're gonna need help, because we're expanding so rapidly that we need-- people are gonna make a lotta money. A skilled worker, a person with talent, education in what they do, not education in nuclear physics, education in what they do, they're gonna make a lotta money. Federal workers, they're leaving the federal government where you had ten people for every job. And they're going out and they're going into the private sector at two and three times the salary. And you see that all over. So I only say this: I think that robotics are gonna be great because this country won't have enough people if we don't have it.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Last question--",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Our people are gonna be trained and they're gonna make more money than they've ever made before.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Last question, I think you'll be in- I was very interested in a comment you made recently about nothing being able to limit your action overseas except for your own morality and your own mind. I'd like to take that same question and apply it here in the U.S. Is there anything that limits your power, your movement, your action here other than your own morality?",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, I talk about morality. I'm a moral person. I don't like seeing death. I don't like seeing our people hurt. I don't like seeing the other side hurt either. You know, when we went into Venezuela we lost nobody, but a lot of people on the other side were-- were killed. I don't like that. Somebody else would say, \"Oh, that's wonderful.\" I don't like that. So yeah, it's limited by my morality. And I have a very high grade of morality, so therefore it's limited.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Not the Constitution, not the courts? That's what I thought you were gonna say.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Well, the Constitution of course. That goes without saying. But you're asking me what really can stop-- we'll never get to the courts, we'll never get to the Constitution, because I don't-- I wanna see what's good for our country. And you know what? The courts wanna see that too.",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: Yeah. Mr. President, thank you very much.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you--",
      "TONY DOKOUPIL: For the record, I do think I'd have this job even if the other guys won.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Yeah, but at a lesser salary. Thank you very much.",

    "story": [
      "Claudette Colvin, a civil rights champion arrested for not giving up her bus seat for a White woman in 1955, has died at the age of 86, her family and foundation announced Tuesday.",
      "\"It is with profound sadness that the Claudette Colvin Foundation and family announce the passing of Claudette Colvin, a beloved mother, grandmother, and civil rights pioneer,\" a statement from the family and foundation reads. \"She leaves behind a legacy of courage that helped change the course of American history.\"",
      "In the statement, the family and foundation said Colvin was \"more than a historical figure.\"",
      "\"She was the heart of our family, wise, resilient, and grounded in faith,\" the statement reads. \"We will remember her laughter, her sharp wit, and her unwavering belief in justice and human dignity.\"",
      "In 1955, at the age of 15, Colvin refused to give up her seat on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, nine months before Rosa Parks' act of defiance.",
      "She said she was with three classmates at the time, \"sitting in the section that was allowed for colored people,\" when a White woman boarded and moved to the back of the bus, hoping to take a seat. At that time, as Colvin explained, a Black person and a White person could not sit in the same row.",
      "\"I refused because this wasn't an elderly White lady. This was a young White lady,\" Colvin told \"CBS Mornings\" in an exclusive interview in 2021.",
      "The bus driver asked the school kids to move, and three did, but Colvin refused. After a few stops, an officer \"manhandled\" her to get her off of it, she said.",
      "Colvin was arrested and charged with disturbing the peace, breaking segregation law and assaulting a police officer. Two of the charges were dropped, but the charge for assaulting a police officer had stayed with her for more than 60 years.",
      "In 2021, Colvin successfully filed to have her record expunged, telling \"CBS Mornings\" she was no longer \"a juvenile delinquent at 82.\"",
      "Colvin's interview with \"CBS Mornings\" prompted national recognition, including a call from then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who said Colvin was a \"role model.\"",
      "Almost a year after being arrested, Colvin was one of four plaintiffs in the lawsuit that challenged Alabama's bus segregation in the landmark Supreme Court case Browder v. Gayle.",
      "An upcoming movie based on Colvin's life, titled \"Spark,\" is being directed by Anthony Mackie and stars Saniyya Sidney, but a specific release date hasn't yet been announced.",
      "Colvin later went to college, worked as a nurse's aid for 30 years and raised two sons. She has five grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.",
      "Colvin told \"CBS Mornings\" in 2021 that her cleared record was important because it sends a message to her grandchildren and great-grandchildren.",
      "\"Because when they go out into the world, the struggle of being African American is still going on,\" Colvin said. \"So I want my grandchildren to know that their grandmother stood up for something when she realized that she was an American at a very early age, and she wanted equal rights, just as those other students and all of the other bus audience and all of the other people in Montgomery \u2014 that's what I want my grandchildren to know.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 15:33:20 -0500",
    "summary": "Roughly 1.4 million fewer Americans have signed up for an Affordable Care Act plan as expiring tax breaks drive up premiums.",
    "story": [
      "Far fewer Americans enrolled in an Affordable Care Act health care plan, new federal data shows, with millions facing higher premiums after tax subsidies under the insurance program expired in December",
      "According to figures\u00a0from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), 22.8 million people have signed up for ACA coverage for 2026 since open enrollment started on Nov. 1. That's down 1.4 million from the number of Americans\u00a0who had enrolled in Obamacare, as the health plans are known, a year ago.",
      "Nationally, around 800,000 fewer people have selected plans compared to a similar time last year, marking a 3.5% drop in total enrollment so far. That includes a decrease in both new consumers signing up for ACA plans and existing enrollees re-upping them.",
      "Open ACA enrollment in most states for February coverage ends on Jan. 15.",
      "The drop in enrollment comes as many ACA participants face sharply higher monthly premiums because of a December 31 lapse in tax credits that lowered households' monthly health plan costs. After months of debate and a\u00a06-week government shutdown, Congress has yet to extend the credits or settle on another remedy.",
      "The House last week approved legislation that could preserve the enhanced subsidies for another three years. The fate of the bill is now in the hands of the Republican-controlled Senate.",
      "Over 20 million Americans received the ACA subsidies last year. Health policy group KFF\u00a0estimates that they could see their premiums swell by an average of 114%, from around $888 in 2025 to $1,904 this year, unless the tax credits are extended.",
      "Experts have warned that the end of the subsidies could push more people to dump their coverage in the face of higher premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates 4 million people will eventually lose their insurance without an extension of the credits.",
      "Robert Kaestner, a health economist at the University of Chicago, said some ACA enrollees who drop the coverage may have other options, such as going on a partner's employer health plan or changing their income to qualify for Medicaid. Others are likely to\u00a0go without insurance while they look for alternatives.",
      "\"My prediction is 2 million more people will lack health insurance for a while,\" Kaestner told the Associated Press. \"That's a serious issue, but Republicans would argue we're using government money more efficiently, we're targeting people who really need it and we're saving $35 billion a year.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 14 Jan 2026 19:38:43 -0500",
    "summary": "Two Republicans switched their votes after pressure from the White House.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans killed a war powers resolution to limit President Trump's ability to further strike Venezuela after the White House put pressure on a handful of GOP senators who supported it.",
      "Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Todd Young of Indiana flipped their support Wednesday after initially voting to advance it. Vice President JD Vance had to step in to break the 50-50 tie.",
      "Republicans used a procedural maneuver to block the measure, arguing that the resolution should no longer be \"privileged\" \u2014 which gives it priority on the floor \u2014 because the U.S. is not currently engaged in \"hostilities\" with Venezuela.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, previewed the argument in floor remarks Wednesday morning.",
      "\"Today, we expect a vote on a resolution to direct the removal of U.S. forces from hostilities in or against Venezuela, even though the U.S. is not currently engaged in hostilities in or against Venezuela,\" Thune said. \"We have no troops on the ground in Venezuela. We're not currently conducting military operations there.\"",
      "Senators\u00a0advanced\u00a0the resolution, introduced by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, last week after the U.S. captured Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife and Mr. Trump asserted the U.S. is now in charge of the country.",
      "Five Republicans joined all Democrats in support of the measure, pushing it forward after two previous failed attempts in the upper chamber to advance similar resolutions to rein in Mr. Trump's military action in the region.",
      "The GOP senators who voted with Democrats to advance the measure were Hawley, Young, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky.",
      "Murkowski, Collins and Paul voted against the GOP effort to kill the resolution Wednesday.",
      "Kaine said Wednesday night he was disappointed in the outcome but saw it \"as a growing set of cracks\" in the GOP's willingness to stick with Mr. Trump on the issue.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump quickly lashed out\u00a0at the Republicans, saying they \"should never be elected to office again.\" He again criticized the senators on Tuesday during a speech at the Detroit Economic Club, calling them \"real losers.\"",
      "Some of the senators said they received calls from Mr. Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio ahead of Wednesday's action.",
      "Hawley said Rubio had addressed his concerns about U.S. troops in Venezuela.",
      "He said Rubio confirmed the U.S. \"has no ground troops currently in Venezuela\" and that if the administration plans to put troops in Venezuela, \"they would abide by the War Powers Act and they would come to Congress for congressional authorization.\"",
      "\"The secretary told me directly that the administration will not put ground troops in Venezuela,\" Hawley said.",
      "Young pushed back on criticism that he caved to pressure from the president, telling reporters that senators had \"secured some valuable reassurances and deliverables\" from the White House on Venezuela.",
      "\"I think we played our hand well,\" Young said, contending that the resolution was heading for a presidential veto if it eventually did make it through both chambers. Both the House and Senate would have needed a two-thirds majority to overcome a veto, which was unlikely.",
      "The switch-up appeared to come as a surprise to Kaine, who said Wednesday morning that he expected all five Republicans to stick with Democrats.",
      "Before Maduro's ouster, lawmakers said they had received insufficient answers from the Trump administration about whether its end goals in Venezuela included regime change, as the U.S. ramped up strikes\u00a0against alleged drug-smuggling boats, imposed an oil blockade and Mr. Trump threatened land strikes.",
      "Republicans who voted last week to advance the resolution cited Mr. Trump's comments about running Venezuela and the potential for U.S. forces to be deployed there as reasons for the measure gaining their support.",
      "A day after the initial Senate vote, Mr. Trump announced he had called off a \"second wave\" of attacks against Venezuela, claiming the two countries \"are working well together.\" But, he said, U.S. naval forces in the region would \"stay in place for safety and security purposes.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 14 Jan 2026 19:27:03 -0500",
    "summary": "After the meeting, Denmark's foreign minister said they're eager to work with the U.S. while respecting the \"red lines of the Kingdom of Denmark.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. and Denmark still have \"fundamental\" differences over the future of Greenland, but will continue to talk, Denmark's foreign minister said after a White House meeting Wednesday amid President Trump's push to take over the Arctic island.",
      "Denmark's foreign minister, Lars Loekke Rasmussen, met with Greenland's minister for foreign affairs, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials. Loekke Rasmussen described the meeting as a \"frank but also constructive discussion\" on security long-term security in Greenland.",
      "The Danish official said they've agreed to establish a high-level working group to determine a way forward on Greenland, as Mr. Trump remains intent on acquiring the semi-autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark. Loekke Rasmussen said they \"still have a fundamental disagreement, but we also agree to disagree.\"",
      "\"There is clearly a disagreement,\" he said in a press conference with reporters in Washington. \"We agree that it makes sense to try to sit down on a high level to explore whether there are possibilities to accommodate the concerns of the president while we at the same time respect the red lines of the Kingdom of Denmark.\"",
      "\"Whether that is doable, I don't know,\" Loekke Rasmussen said, adding he hopes they can \"take down the temperature.\" The Danes asked for the meeting.",
      "Loekke Rasmussen said he agrees that the security situation in the Arctic has changed, and said he's \"eager\" to work with the U.S. on security improvements. But the framework for improving Arctic security through NATO already exists, he said, and the U.S. acquiring Greenland is \"absolutely not necessary.\"",
      "Vivian Motzfeldt, Greenland's minister of foreign affairs, told reporters it's never been more important to strengthen their ties with the U.S., \"but that doesn't mean that we want to be owned by the United States.\"",
      "Asked if he would respect the red lines set forth by Greenland and Denmark, Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, \"Well, we're going to see what happens with Greenland,\" adding that he hasn't yet been briefed on the meeting.",
      "\"We need Greenland for national security, so we're going to see what happens,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Asked whether he would leave NATO over the Greenland issue, the president said he wouldn't broadcast his options.",
      "The meeting came one day after Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said at a news conference, \"If we have to choose between the United States and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he wants to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, citing national security reasons. He repeated that again on Wednesday morning, saying \"it is vital for the Golden Dome that we are building\" and that \"NATO should be leading the way for us to get it.\"",
      "\"IF WE DON'T, RUSSIA OR CHINA WILL, AND THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!\" Mr. Trump said in a post on Truth Social.",
      "\"NATO becomes far more formidable and effective with Greenland in the hands of the UNITED STATES,\" he said. \"Anything less than that is unacceptable.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters that if Greenland's premier said the territory wanted to stay part of Denmark, \"that's their problem.\"",
      "\"I disagree with him,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I don't know who he is, don't know anything about him, but that's going to be a big problem for him.\"",
      "Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have stated Greenland is \"not for sale,\" which has led Trump officials to say that the administration is considering all options, including military force.",
      "\"I'd love to make a deal with them. It's easier,\" Mr. Trump said Sunday. \"But one way or the other, we're going to have Greenland.\" Rubio has downplayed the possibility of military force to acquire Greenland.",
      "Vance visited Greenland last year. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday that the Trump administration is applying \"completely unacceptable pressure from our closest ally.\"",
      "Frederiksen\u00a0said earlier this month that an American military move to seize control of Greenland would amount to the end of the NATO military alliance. Denmark is a NATO member, and NATO's Article 5 states that if a NATO ally suffers an armed attack, all members will consider it an attack on them as well and do what they need to aid the attacked nation.",
      "Tensions were high ahead of the meeting, as was concern about a further fracturing of the relationship with the U.S. NATO ally, sources familiar with the situation told CBS News. The Danish government expected to present an offer for enhanced cooperation with the U.S. and access in Greenland in terms of military presence and NATO presence, the sources said.",
      "The Danes wanted clarity on what the U.S. is pressing for beyond that offer, and whether a financial plus-up is being demanded, the sources said. They wanted to know if Mr. Trump's intent is to have control or political ownership, which concerns them, given the clear objection of the Greenlandic government to either. Greenlandic officials have been clear that they want the island to belong to Denmark.",
      "A European official from a nearby country said there is some concern that Denmark may be miscalculating by demanding this meeting with the U.S. because it could formalize and potentially harden positions around what could otherwise be rhetorical pressure by Mr. Trump.",
      "On Wednesday, Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky took to the Senate floor to voice his disapproval of intervening in Greenland's affairs and to emphasize the importance of maintaining a united NATO alliance.",
      "\"Unless and until the President can demonstrate otherwise, then the proposition at hand today is very straightforward: incinerating the hard-won trust of loyal allies in exchange for no meaningful change in U.S. access to the Arctic,\" McConnell said. \"That's allies \u2013 plural. Because this is about more than Greenland. It's about more than America's relationship with its highly capable Nordic allies. It's about whether the United States intends to face a constellation of strategic adversaries with capable friends \u2026 or commit an unprecedented act of strategic self-harm and go it alone.\"",

    "summary": "Iranian shopkeeper Erfan Soltani is among thousands of people who could face death sentences despite Trump's warning to Iran's rulers. Now a human rights group says his execution has been postponed.",
    "story": [
      "The execution of a 26-year-old Iranian man, Erfan Soltani, accused by the Islamic Republic's government of participating in the protests that swept across the country, has been postponed, according to a human rights group in contact with his family. Soltani was initially set to be executed Wednesday.",
      "Hengaw, an organization that monitors unrest in Iran and has spoken with his family, told CBS News on Wednesday that Soltani's execution \"has not been implemented and has been postponed.\" It was not immediately clear what would happen next, and the ongoing internet blackouts in Iran have hampered Hengaw's ability to provide timely updates on the case.",
      "The uncertainty over his fate came as\u00a0President Trump threatened \"strong action\"\u00a0against Iran in response to reports of the regime hanging people detained during the protests. Mr. Trump on Wednesday told reporters in the Oval Office that he's heard on \"good authority\" that the \"killing in Iran is stopping\" and, \"there's no plan for executions or an execution or executions.\"",
      "The Iranian government \"said that he was arrested because of the protest, but we don't know if actually he participated in the protest, because there is absolutely no information about that or evidence,\" Hengaw representative Awyar Shekhi told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "Soltani is a clothing seller whose family lives near Iran's capital, Tehran, according to Shekhi, who added that his family has said he was not a political activist but was opposed to the current situation.",
      "An ongoing internet blackout has made it difficult for journalists and rights groups to monitor the protests in Iran or the government's brutal crackdown on them, which sources inside the country say may have resulted in the deaths of some 12,000 people, and potentially many more. More than 2,600 people were detained amid the unrest that began on December 28, according to rights groups.",
      "Now, there are fears that many of those in detention could be executed, despite President Trump's warning on Tuesday to the Iranian regime that if it hangs protesters, the U.S. will \"take very strong action.\"",
      "Soltani was arrested on Jan. 8, Shekhi told CBS News, adding that he had been \"deprived from all of his basic rights to contact his family, to have a lawyer.\"",
      "Four days later, \"the family got information that their son has received [a death] sentence, and without declaring what was the charges [or] when the trial took place.\"",
      "Soltani's family was not told how his planned execution would be carried out, but the most common method in Iran is hanging, Hengaw told CBS News.",
      "Soltani's sister is a lawyer and has been pursuing all available legal avenues to defend her brother, \"but the authorities have told [her] there's no case to review and we are not allowing that,\" Shekhi said.",
      "The activist told CBS News the family was informed they'd be allowed to have a final meeting with Soltani \u2014 a procedure normally reserved for the families of those being executed. Hengaw said it had no confirmation that the meeting had taken place, but a source close to the family told the group that some of Soltani's relatives had been heading to the massive Ghezel Hesar prison, in Karaj, late Tuesday night.",
      "\"If we want to do a job, we should do it now. If we want to do something, we have to do it quickly,\" Iran's judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei said Wednesday in a video aired on state television, of a discussion he had with other judiciary officials about the handling of detained protesters' cases. \"If it becomes late, two months, three months later, it doesn't have the same effect. If we want to do something, we have to do that fast.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told CBS News' Tony Dokoupil on Tuesday that the U.S. would act if the Iranian regime begins hanging protesters.",
      "When asked to clarify what that action could be, Mr. Trump said:\u00a0 \"Well \u2014 let's define it in Venezuela. Let's define it with [ISIS leader] al-Baghdadi. He was wiped out. Let's define it with [Iranian military commander] Soleimani. And let's define it in Iran, where \u2014 wiped out their Iran nuclear threat in a period of about 15 minutes once the B-2s got there. And that was a complete obliteration as it turns out, which is what I said initially. Then some questioned it, and they said, 'You know, Trump was right.' So we've been right about everything. We don't want to see what's happening in Iran happen. And, you know, if they want to have protests, that's one thing. When they start killing thousands of people and now you're telling me about hanging - we'll see how that works out for them. It's not gonna work out good.\"",

      "The U.S. used an aircraft painted like a civilian plane in the attack on an alleged drug-smuggling boat from Venezuela that killed 11 people in September, multiple officials confirmed to CBS News.",
      "According to the sources, Pentagon officials have defended the use of the aircraft by saying it was used because of how quickly the operation came together, not because the Pentagon was trying to mislead the targets.",
      "The New York Times was the first to report on the aircraft looking like a civilian plane.",
      "The strike on Sept. 2 was the first in a series of attacks the U.S. has taken against what officials have said are drug-trafficking boats. More than 100 people have been killed since the campaign began.",
      "During the same Sept. 2 strike, the U.S. aircraft also killed two people who survived the initial attack. That development raised concerns among experts on the law of war and lawmakers, mostly Democrats.",
      "The new details about the U.S. aircraft have sparked additional conversations on Capitol Hill about whether the attack violated the law of war.",
      "\"I have very, very severe doubts about the legality of our use of certain aircraft, and I think there has to be further investigative effort,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "The question at issue is whether the attack constitutes a crime of perfidy, which is when a combatant uses a protected status under the law of war, like a civilian, as a disguise and betrays that confidence to attack an enemy.",
      "Michael Meier, who previously served as an expert on the law of war for the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General's Corps, told CBS News one reason perfidy is a crime is because it could put other civilians at risk. For example, if one aircraft that looks like a civilian plane launches a missile, the enemy might have a reason to believe other civilian aircraft are potentially hostile.",

    "summary": "A construction crane fell onto a moving passenger train, causing a fiery derailment that killed at least 30 people and injuring dozens more in northeastern Thailand.",
    "story": [
      "Bangkok \u2014 A construction crane fell onto a moving passenger train, causing a fiery derailment that killed at least 30 people Wednesday in northeastern Thailand, authorities said. Another 64 people were injured and rescuers were still searching the wreckage and giving first aid.",
      "The derailment occurred on part of an ambitious planned high-speed rail project that will eventually connect China with much of Southeast Asia.",
      "Anuphong Suksomnit, the governor of Nakhon Ratchasima province, where the accident took place, said four passengers among the 171 believed to have been on board the train were still missing. Searchers were still looking through the wreckage about eight hours after the morning crash.",
      "The crane, which was being used to build an elevated part of the railway, fell as the train was traveling from Bangkok to Ubon Ratchathani province, according to the public relations office for Nakhon Ratchasima province, where the accident occurred some 143 miles northeast of Bangkok.",
      "Photos published in Thai media showed plumes of white, then dark smoke above the scene and construction equipment hanging down from between two concrete support pillars.",
      "Rescue workers stood on top of overturned railway carriages, some of them with gaping holes torn on their sides, video from public broadcaster ThaiPBS showed. What appeared to be sections of the crane were scattered along the track.",
      "Thai media reported the train had three carriages, the last two being the most heavily damaged.",
      "Transport Minister Piphat Ratchakitprakan said 195 people were on board the train. He said he ordered an investigation.",
      "Area resident Mitr Intrpanya, 54, told French news agency AFP she \"heard a loud noise, like something sliding down from above, followed by two explosions. When I went to see what had happened, I found the crane sitting on a passenger train with three carriages. The metal from the crane appeared to strike the middle of the second carriage, slicing it in half.\"",
      "In August 2024, a railway tunnel on the planned route, also in Nakhon Ratchasima, collapsed, killing three workers. Days of heavy rainfall were believed to have been a factor in the collapse.",
      "The elevated segment that collapsed is a part of the Thai-Chinese high-speed railway project linking Bangkok, Thailand's capital to the northeastern province of Nong Khai, bordering Laos. The two-stage rail project has a total cost of more than 520 billion baht ($16.8 billion) and is associated with an ambitious plan to connect China with Southeast Asia under Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative.",
      "Anan Phonimdaeng, acting governor of the State Railway of Thailand, said the project's contractor is Italian-Thai Development, with a Chinese company responsible for design and construction supervision.",
      "He said authorities will examine the responsibilities of both parties, and the Railway Department plans to take legal action against the contractor as a first step. Damage to the train was estimated to be more than 100 million baht ($3.2 million), while construction equipment suffered limited damage, said Anan.",
      "A statement posted on the company's website expressed condolences to the victims and said the company would take responsibility for paying compensation to the families of the dead and hospitalization expenses for the injured.",
      "Anger intensifying",
      "The new accident sparked outrage in Thailand because the main contractor for the route's first stage between Bangkok and Nakhon Ratchasima, Italian-Thai Development, was also directly responsible for construction on the stretch where the accident occurred.",
      "The company, also known as Italthai, was also the co-lead contractor for the State Audit Building in the Thai capital Bangkok, which collapsed during the construction stage in March during an earthquake in neighboring Myanmar.",
      "About 100 people were killed in the collapse, which was the only major structure in Thailand to suffer such serious damage. Dozens of executives were indicted in connection with the disaster but none have yet been tried.",
      "The involvement of Chinese companies in both projects has also drawn attention, as has Italthai's and Chinese companies' involvement in the construction of several expressway extensions in and around Bangkok where several accidents, some fatal, had occurred.",
      "Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, who was interior minister when the State Audit Building collapsed, said the Comptroller General's Department and Transport Ministry are responsible for blacklisting contractors, and the laws couldn't be amended in the brief time he was interior minister to expedite the matter.",
      "In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the government was aware of the reports about the accident and had expressed condolences.",
      "\"The Chinese government attaches great importance to the safety of projects and personnel, and we are also learning about the situation,\" he said. \"At present, it appears that the relevant section is being constructed by a Thai company, and the cause of the accident is still under investigation.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 14 Jan 2026 13:06:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Experts tell CBS News what sort of options President Trump has to respond to Iran's brutal crackdown on protesters.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has warned of \"very strong action\" against Iran if it hangs accused anti-government protesters, and he told its people that U.S. \"help is on its way\" as CBS News learned that the crackdown to quash the unrest may have killed upwards of 12,000 people.",
      "While the administration has made it clear that Mr. Trump will have a number of options at his disposal, from conventional strikes by the U.S. military to cyberwarfare, the White House has given no hint as to what the president will do. In the meantime, the U.S. government does appear to be bracing for possible retaliation by Tehran.",
      "The U.S. State Department issued a security alert on Wednesday urging U.S. citizens to \"leave Iran now,\" or to keep a low profile and ensure adequate supplies of food, water and medications if remaining in the country. The new advisory added to an existing Level 4 travel alert\u00a0\u2014   the highest issued by the State Department, that was put in place in early December, warning Americans not to visit Iran due to the risks of terrorism, civil unrest and wrongful detention.",
      "The Pentagon, meanwhile, has ordered a reduction of personnel at the biggest U.S. military base in the Middle East \u2014 Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, just across the Persian Gulf from Iran \u2014   as a \"precautionary measure,\" a U.S. official told CBS News national security correspondent Charlie D'Agata.",
      "While Mr. Trump's next move on Iran remained unclear after a National Security Council meeting on Tuesday, military officials told CBS News the White House was keeping all options on the table, including military, technological and psychological options. Below is a more detailed look at what some of those options could actually involve, and how they might be perceived in the region.",
      "Military strikes",
      "If Mr. Trump decides to order U.S. military action against Iran's military and security forces, the Islamic Republic's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) would likely be among the top targets, according to Alex Vatanka, Iran director of the Middle East Institute in Washington, D.C.",
      "Vatanka told CBS News the IRGC, along with its feared \"Basij\" volunteer paramilitary units, \"are essentially the brains and the muscle behind\" any crackdown launched by the regime.",
      "\"If you can target those, whether it's through kinetic actions, offensive cyber capabilities, psychological warfare against them \u2026 that is important,\" Vatanka said, adding that Mr. Trump would be \"sending a clear message\" with such a move.",
      "Iran's regular army may be a less likely U.S. target, Vatanka said, because it is composed largely of conscripted young men who join and serve for two years, and thus may be less loyal to the regime overall.",
      "The IRGC, however, operates differently, as a parallel religious force under the direct control of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Created specifically to protect the Islamic Republic system that came to power with the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the IRGC has at least one major base in every one of Iran's 31 provinces, two in Tehran, and tens of thousands of smaller bases nationwide.",
      "If the U.S. military does strike Iran, Vatanka says President Trump's real priorities may be revealed by the choice of targets. If it is military sites or Iran's nuclear facilities, which the U.S. already attacked in \"Operation Midnight Hammer\" in June, he said it would come across as a show of support for one of the Trump administration's closest regional allies, rather than for the Iranian people..",
      "\"That's helping the United States, maybe in terms of its strategic aims or friends like Israel. It's not helping the protest movements,\" said Vatanka. \"People will be looking at it cynically, saying he's taking advantage of the moment of chaos in Iran to advance goals that might be good goals for the United States, but certainly it's not what he's promising the protest movement.\"",
      "Going for the top: Targeting the ayatollah",
      "Ayatollah Khamenei could also find himself in the sights of the U.S. military.",
      "The top leaders of Iran's proxy groups Hamas and Hezbollah have already been assassinated in recent years, and\u00a0 Khamenei \"could very well be a target,\" according to Bilal Saab, a Middle East political and security expert and the Senior Managing Director of the TRENDS Research & Advisory organization in Washington, D.C.",
      "\"If you believe in that decapitation strategy, it might be the best way forward that you take this man out. And remember, he's been there since 1989. So, for 37 years, this man has been the brains behind what Iran has done in the region, at home and abroad. And if you take him out, you might bring about the conditions where Iran either has a political transformation to a different political system, or whatever is left after Khamenei in terms of leaders.\"",
      "If the White House pursued this course of action, it would track with the U.S. capture of Venezuela's former President Nicolas Maduro earlier this month. While Maduro's former vice-president Delcy Rodriguez was quickly sworn as acting president, Mr. Trump has declared the U.S. \"in charge\" of Venezuela.",
      "Maduro, however, had already been indicted on federal criminal charges in the U.S. when he was captured, and he was arraigned just a couple days later in a court in New York.",
      "Ayatollah Khamenei has been heavily sanctioned by the U.S. government and accused of a litany of nefarious actions across the Middle East, but he has not been charged with any crimes by American courts.",
      "Cyber and psychological warfare",
      "Beyond bombs and military strikes, the White House is also weighing cyberattack options, U.S. officials say.",
      "\"You go after command and control nodes and try to disrupt the ability of the Iranian security personnel to communicate amongst themselves,\" Saab said of the likely objective of such operations. \"This is the typical classic target when you think about cyber operations, and then maybe also try to distract the communication between leadership \u2014   political leadership \u2014   and, of course, their lieutenants on the ground.",
      "This would be using the psychological weapon of fear, Saab told CBS News.",
      "\"You're trying to influence the calculus of loyalists, of people serving the regime, right? And this is the typical dynamic of offering them negative and positive incentives. Positive being, you defect, then you can have some kind of a political future, or at least we won't kill you. Negative is precisely that, all sorts of punishment, ranging from elimination to irrelevance, to going after their property and going after everything that they hold dear to them.\"",
      "And President Trump's own way of doing things \u2014   whether on purpose or by accident \u2014   may be keeping the Iranian regime wondering.",
      "As White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday: \"Nobody knows what President Trump is going to do except for President Trump.\"",
      "\"They don't know which way he's going to go,\" said Saab, \"and that's all part of psychological warfare.\"",

Thousands of people were arrested and are now facing possible death sentences for taking part in the demonstrations.",
      "The post-protest reprisals are meant to frighten people into silence. They include going after businesses, money and financial assets connected to anyone seen as having backed the anti-regime demonstrations.",
      "Mohammad Saedinia is one particularly high-profile example.",
      "He is famous in Iran as the owner of a chain of candy shops and buzzing cafes beloved by residents in the capital Tehran, especially young liberals. He also established a popular shopping mall near the holy city of Qom.",
      "The regional justice department in Qom announced Wednesday that Saedinia had been arrested, accusing him of \"calling on the people to riot and cause chaos.\"",
      "Saedinia's only crime appears to have been closing his cafes at the very outset of the protests in late December, and to make it clear in a social media post that it was in solidarity with business people \u2014   including many stall holders from Tehran's main bazaar \u2014   who closed their shops to express their anger over a catastrophic plunge in the value of Iran's currency.",
      "Those demonstrations against economic hardship and the regime's appalling financial record snowballed quickly into the nationwide protests against the Islamic Republic's leadership itself.",
      "Tasnim, a semi-official news agency associated with the country's powerful Revolutionary Guards, said Wednesday that Saedinia's operating licenses and operating permits had been cancelled and his businesses shut down.",
      "Tasnim also quoted Iran's Attorney General Mohammad Movahedi Azad as saying that officials from the country's judiciary were \"obliged to identify the property of the 'terrorists' and report it to the prosecutors.\"",
      "It is a powerful warning to all businesses in the country that they should open their doors for trade as normal \u2014   and shut up about the last two weeks of unrest.",
      "The financial threat extends beyond Iran's business community.\u00a0 The attorney general, who like other Iranian officials refers to protesters as \"terrorists,\" is demanding the seizure of property belonging to anyone linked to the demonstrations, to \"teach them a lesson.\"",
      "President Trump's threat to take some as yet unspecified action against the regime is hanging over the leadership. On the one hand, they've responded by threatening reprisals against U.S. military installations in the region. On the other hand, they are seeking this week to show they're moving on from the unrest.",
      "A pro-regime source inside Iran told CBS News on Wednesday that the regime's public position \u2014 repeated on state television \u2014   is that the protests were an attempt by the U.S. and Israel to topple the government, \"which badly failed.\"",

      "CBS News reported earlier this week that the president has received briefings on a wide array of military and covert tools to target Iran beyond conventional airstrikes. Such measures could include cyber and psychological operations that could occur simultaneously with traditional military force.",
      "The precautionary drawdown at Al Udeid comes as the president weighs options and watches for what Iran's response might be.",
      "Reuters first reported the U.S. military was reducing its presence at the base.",
      "The military similarly withdrew personnel at Al Udeid last summer around the time of the U.S. bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities. Following that bombing, coined Operation Midnight Hammer, Iran retaliated by targeting Al Udeid with about a dozen ballistic missiles. Nearly all of the missiles were intercepted and no one was hurt in the attack, partly because of the reduction of troops.",
      "The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Dan Caine in a press conference following the attack last June said the U.S. military had reduced to \"a minimum force posture\" across the region, including Al Udeid. Most personnel had moved off the base, leaving only a handful of soldiers.",
      "In general, Al Udeid is the largest U.S. base in the Middle East with about 8,000 to 10,000 U.S. troops.",

    "published": "Wed, 14 Jan 2026 10:25:34 -0500",
    "summary": "Many Iranian opposition activists are hoping the current unrest could be the beginning of the end of the country's hardline Islamic regime.",
    "story": [
      "Iran has faced intense nationwide protests for more than\u00a0two weeks, marking the largest challenge to the country's ruling regime in years \u2014 and drawing vows from President Trump to intervene on the protesters' behalf if they face a violent crackdown.",
      "Initially sparked by Iran's economic freefall and severe inflation, the protests have boiled over, with demonstrations in at least 185 cities around the country. An internet blackout impeded communications and made it difficult to know the scope of the protests \u2014 or the crackdown that appeared to be escalating.",
      "Estimates of the death toll jumped sharply on Jan. 13. Britain's Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said in Parliament that the U.K. government believed there \"may have been 2,000 people killed, there have been more. My fear is that the number may prove to be significantly higher.\"",
      "Two sources, including one inside Iran, told CBS News that at least 12,000, and possibly as many as 20,000 people have been killed. Activist groups were working to compile a full death toll based on reports from medical officials across the country. CBS News has not been able to independently verify the massive death toll indicated by the source inside Iran.",
      "Here's what you need to know:",
      "How the Iran protests started, and what they've become",
      "The current wave of protests began in the capital, Tehran, in late December as shopkeepers went on strike and marched into the streets. Small business owners in Iran have long been seen as supportive of the regime, but anger over spiraling inflation and the devaluation of the nation's currency, which lost more than 40% of its value last year, making everyday goods impossible for many people to afford, sparked the demonstrations.",
      "The protests quickly spread, with people joining marches across the country to denounce not only the economic woes, but to air wider discontent with the country's hardline regime.",
      "Protests were reported in at least 185 cities in all 31 of the country's provinces, according to the Human Rights Activists News Agency, or HRANA, a U.S.-based monitoring group founded by anti-regime activists.",
      "Demonstrations have also been reported on dozens of university campuses since late December, and strikes and shop closures were reported in markets in over a dozen cities, HRANA said.",
      "Videos posted on social media night after night showed crowds of protesters marching through the streets of various Iranian cities, chanting anti-government slogans and clashing with the country's security forces in some cases.",
      "How Iranian authorities have responded",
      "Thousands of people have been reported detained since the wave of protests began,\u00a0according to HRANA, and the death toll rose as protests entered their third week.",
      "CBS News has verified that video posted online shows the bodies of at least 366 and likely more than 400 people killed amid the protest piled up at a morgue in a Tehran suburb. The video appears to show forensic personnel documenting gruesome injuries on the bodies, and crowds of people seemingly trying to identify the dead.",
      "The injuries visible are extensive and include gunshot wounds, \"birdshot\" shotgun wounds, gashes and other severe injuries.",
      "Iran's attorney general on Jan. 10 warned that anyone taking part in the protests would be considered an \"enemy of God,\" according to The Associated Press \u2014 a death-penalty charge.",
      "The Islamic Republic's semiofficial Fars news agency had\u00a0claimed on Jan. 5\u00a0that about 250 police officers and 45 members of the feared Basij security force had been injured amid the unrest.",
      "Iranian authorities cut off phone service and web access beginning Jan. 8\u00a0across the country, according to the internet monitoring organization NetBlocks, which said a \"nationwide internet blackout\" continued into Jan. 11, writing on social media that \"national connectivity levels continue to flatline around 1% of ordinary levels.\"",
      "\"Even Starlink, which has been the main line of communication for some activists in different parts of the country, has been jammed,\" Maziar Bahari, editor of the independent IranWire news site, told CBS News on Friday, referring to the satellite communication system run by Elon Musk.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from SpaceX, which runs Starlink, but did not get any immediate response.",
      "Trump warns he'll hit Iran \"very hard\" if it kills protesters",
      "Mr. Trump has threatened on several occasions since the protests began that he could order U.S. action of some kind if Iranian authorities kill demonstrators.",
      "He told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil in an interview Jan. 13 that the U.S. will \"take very strong action\" if Iranian authorities begin hanging anti-government protesters. He said \"there's a lot of help on the way\" for Iranian citizens, saying it's being offered in \"different forms,\" including economic assistance.",
      "A few days earlier, the\u00a0president wrote\u00a0on Truth Social: \"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!\"",
      "Speaking at the White House on Jan. 9, Mr. Trump reiterated that he was open to some kind of U.S. action, although he said that would not involve a U.S. incursion.",
      "\"I've made the statement very strongly that if they start killing people like they have in the past, we will get involved,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We'll be hitting them very hard where it hurts. And that doesn't mean boots on the ground, but it means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts. So, we don't want that to happen.\"",
      "In a Jan. 2 post on Truth Social, he said: \"If Iran [shoots] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue. We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\"",
      "Speaking on Fox News on Jan. 8, Mr. Trump said the U.S. was \"ready\" to hit Iran hard if protesters were killed, but added, \"for the most part, they haven't\" been.",
      "A senior U.S. official confirmed to CBS News that Mr. Trump has been briefed on new options for a potential response, which could include military or cyber actions.",
      "The president's comments came just over six months after he ordered airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, amid a deadly days-long conflict between Iran and Israel.",
      "The unrest in Iran also comes as Mr. Trump takes a more aggressive posture on the world stage. U.S. forces captured former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in an overnight military operation in Caracas on Jan. 3, and Mr. Trump has suggested he's open to military action in Colombia to combat drug trafficking, and even to take control of Greenland.",
      "Alex Vatanka, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute who studies Iran, told CBS News last week that Mr. Trump's gestures of support could embolden Iranian protesters, saying his comments may be the \"one ingredient you need to keep \u2026 the street-level movement alive.\"",
      "Bahari, of IranWire, said Iranian officials had told him they were concerned about Mr. Trump potentially intervening in Iran even before the protests began.",
      "The recent U.S. attack on Venezuela, \"has really scared many Iranian officials and may have affected their actions in terms of how to confront the protesters. But at the same time, it has inspired many protesters to come out, because they know that the leader of the world's main superpower is supporting their cause.\"",
      "Iranian leaders acknowledge problems, but blame U.S.",
      "In an address on state television aired Friday, after an intense night of protests, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed that his regime would \"not back down,\" called for unity and accused \"a bunch of vandals\" in Tehran of causing chaos in the capital \"to please the U.S. president.\"",
      "In some cases, Iranian officials have attempted to strike a conciliatory tone, acknowledging people's economic concerns and insisting that people have the right to protest peacefully. State media reported that President Masoud Pezeshkian had directed security forces not to crack down on peaceful protesters.",
      "The government has also offered some relief in the form of $7-a-month stipends that can be used in grocery stores to buy basic necessities.",
      "Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has condemned Mr. Trump threats of a U.S. intervention, accusing the U.S. of \"inciting violence and terrorism.\"",
      "Iranian army commander Major General Amir Hatami threatened Wednesday to \"cut off the hand of any aggressor.\"",
      "Iran's history of mass protests",
      "Protests \u2014 and severe crackdowns \u2014 are a recurring theme in Iran.",
      "The last major round of protests came in 2022, spurred by the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was arrested by the theocratic government's forces for allegedly wearing her headscarf incorrectly. Hundreds of people were killed across months of demonstrations.",
      "Other protest movements came in 2019 and 2017, and Iran was beset by a large-scale uprising in 2009 over the country's contested presidential election.",
      "\"From what we saw on social media channels and also from conversations with different people in Iran, the number of protesters in different parts of the country is not as high as in 2022, but there are more protests \u2014   the protests are more widespread in different parts of the country,\" Bahari told CBS News. \"So, even some smaller cities where they never had a protest in those cities, they see protests these days, and I think people are more desperate than before.\"",
      "The current protests seem different compared to the previous rounds \u2014   and could be harder for the regime to quell by offering concessions \u2014 due to their roots in the country's economic woes, according to Mona Yacoubian, Director and Senior Adviser of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "She noted that in 2022, the regime was able to appease protesters by \"simply addressing their complaints about women's veiling and so forth.\"",
      "But the protesters now are more focused on economic problems, and \"there's really nothing [the regime] can do\" to get Iran's moribund economy back on track, she said.",
      "\"These protests, they are about economic situation, but also about dignity,\" Bahari told CBS News. \"It's about the national pride. And because of that, this protest will be very, very difficult to contain.\"",
      "Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi cheers on the protests",
      "Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi \u2014 whose father, the former shah, fled just before the 1979 Islamic Revolution that brought the current clerical regime to power \u2014 has cheered the protests from exile, urging demonstrators this week to keep the movement \"disciplined\" and \"as large as possible.\"",
      "The crown prince called for Iranians to chant together against the country's leadership at 8 p.m. local time, or 12 p.m. Eastern, on Jan. 8 and Jan. 9, and many did seem to answer his call.",
      "\"Our goal is no longer just to take to the streets. The goal is to prepare to seize and hold city centers,\" Pahlavi said in a video message on Jan. 9.",
      "Pahlavi's call to action \"could be a turning point\" in the protest movement, Yacoubian told CBS News on Thursday.",
      "\"This is a regime that is not afraid to use lethal force,\" Yacoubian said. \"But the question is, to what extent, if they become overwhelmed, if the protests become overwhelmingly large and if there are elements in security forces, police, and so forth, kind of at that local level, who themselves are suffering the effects of this economic crisis and who decide not to shoot at people: These are the kinds of questions I think that we need to watch.\"",

    "summary": "South Korean President Lee Jae Myung says he always wanted to play the drums, so Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi surprised him after a summit, and they hit it off.",
    "story": [
      "Tokyo\u00a0\u2014 The leaders of Japan and South Korea have shown an unusual level of harmony, banging out a drum set duet to K-pop hits during a summit on Tuesday. The leaders, whose nations have had tense relations in the past, agreed to deepen cooperation between letting loose for the surprise cultural exchange.",
      "The musical performance by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung followed a summit in Japan's ancient capital of Nara, which is Takaichi's hometown.",
      "Wearing personalized athletic jackets, they sat side by side and drummed to hits including the South Korean K-pop band BTS' \"Dynamite\" and Kpop Demon Hunters' \"Golden.\" A short video of the performance was posted on the official Instagram account of Takaichi's office on Wednesday.",
      "The jam session was a surprise by Takaichi, a longtime heavy metal fan and an avid drummer in her college days, for her South Korean counterpart.",
      "A post shared by \u9996\u76f8\u5b98\u90b8 (@kantei)",
      "\"Playing the drums has been my longtime dream,\" Lee said on X, thanking Takaichi for her hospitality in arranging the jam session.",
      "\"Like we respected our differences and harmonized our rhythms, I hope that Korea and Japan would deepen cooperation and move closer to each other step by step,\" Lee said, admitting that the gig was perhaps, \"a little clumsy,\" on his part.",
      "\"When we met at APEC last year, [Lee] said it was his dream to play the drums, so we prepared a surprise,\" Takaichi said later in a social media post.",
      "Takaichi, a conservative politician whose credentials as a motorcycle enthusiast and heavy metal fan lent an extra layer of intrigue to her appointment as Japan's first-ever female prime minister, commended drum set novice Lee, calling him a fast learner for picking up the rhythm in just a few minutes.",
      "\"In order to develop Japan-South Korea relations in a forward-looking way and stably, we will continue our close communication between the two governments including by proactively carrying out our 'shuttle diplomacy,'\" Takaichi said in a message on X.",
      "The rhythmic diplomatic overture appeared to go down well with some social media users in both countries, which have maintained relations despite lingering animosity over Japan's actions as a former imperial power and some territorial disputes.",
      "\"Music seems to have the power to connect hearts at a deeper level than words ever could,\" a Korean user posted on X about the drumming video, according to CBS News' partner network BBC News. \"Exchanges like this may be quiet, but they will surely help move relations between Korea and Japan forward.\"",
      "\"Just seeing them actually playing drums together \u2014 not just posing \u2014 looks like they are having so much fun, and that's what matters most,\" a Japanese X user wrote. \"Both Korea and Japan are facing tough situations, but if we can meet each other halfway, I truly believe things will move in a positive direction.\"",
      "South Korea and Japan are both important allies of the United States, for both defense and economic purposes.",
      "Both nations host massive U.S. military bases and troop deployments, and they've pledged to work closely with Washington to balance China's rising influence on world affairs, and to counter the regional threats of North Korea and Beijing's determination to take control of Taiwan.",

    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 21:33:27 -0500",
    "summary": "The comments come ahead of Wednesday's meeting between the foreign ministers of Greenland and Denmark,  Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
    "story": [
      "Greenland's prime minister said \"we choose Denmark\" over the U.S., on the eve of\u00a0Wednesday's meeting\u00a0between the foreign ministers of Greenland and Denmark, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other Trump administration officials.",
      "\"If we have to choose between the United States and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark,\" Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said at a news conference Tuesday in Copenhagen. \"We choose NATO. We choose the Kingdom of Denmark. We choose the EU.\"",
      "Nielsen appeared with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who said \"there are many indications that the most challenging part is ahead of us,\" according to AFP.",
      "Vance, who visited Greenland last year, will be hosting Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers \u2014 along with Rubio \u2014 at the White House, a source familiar with the planning confirmed to CBS News.",
      "President Trump has repeatedly said he wants to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, citing national security reasons.",
      "\"If we don't take Greenland, Russia or China will take Greenland, and I am not going to let that happen,\" Mr. Trump said Sunday.",
      "\"I'd love to make a deal with them. It's easier,\" he added. \"But one way or the other, we're going to have Greenland.\" Rubio has downplayed the possibility of military force to acquire Greenland.",
      "But leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have stated Greenland is \"not for sale,\" which has led Trump officials to say that the administration is\u00a0considering all options, including military force.",
      "\"One thing must be clear to everyone: Greenland does not want to be owned by the United States. Greenland does not want to be governed by the United States. Greenland does not want to be part of the United States,\" Nielsen said Tuesday.",
      "Denmark has been one of the U.S.' staunchest NATO allies for more than 75 years. Frederiksen said of the U.S. there's been \"completely unacceptable pressure from our closest ally.\"",
      "Senate Democrats and a few Republicans have expressed opposition to military action against Greenland. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that any military action in Greenland would be \"disastrous.\" He added that he believes \"Congress will stop him, both Democrats and Republicans.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Rand Paul told \"CBS Mornings\" last week that he would \"do everything to stop any kind of military takeover of Greenland.\" But Paul did not object to purchasing Greenland, noting that the U.S. has acquired territory in the past.",
      "The Constitution says only Congress can declare war, and the Senate last week advanced a war powers resolution to limit the Trump administration's ability to conduct further strikes Venezuela. Five Republicans joined all the Democrats in advancing the resolution, indicating a lack of support for any military action in Greenland. Democratic Sen. Reuben Gallego said last week that he expected to introduce a measure \"to block Trump from invading Greenland.\"",
      "A bipartisan group of House members introduced legislation on Monday to prevent military action against NATO members, according to Politico.",
      "Rep. Don Bacon, one of the sponsors of the legislation, said last week that he thought any action in Greenland is wrong.",
      "\"These are our allies,\" he continued. \"You don't treat your allies this way. I mean it's embarrassing. And by the way, most Greenlanders want to be Greenland. They don't want to be American. They want to be our allies, though, and it's creating a lot of anger and hurt with our friends in Europe.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/device-havana-syndrome-obtained-by-u-s-government/",
    "published": "Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:08:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The device was purchased by Homeland Security officials under the Biden administration and cost millions, two sources said.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government quietly acquired a device in late 2024 that officials believe may be connected to the debilitating condition known as Havana Syndrome, which more than 1,500 American officials have reported experiencing since 2016, according to multiple sources briefed on the matter who spoke with CBS News.",
      "The device was purchased clandestinely in the final weeks of the Biden administration by the Department of Homeland Security's Homeland Security Investigations division, using Pentagon funding that exceeded eight figures, according to two people familiar with the matter. The device is portable, backpack-sized, and contains components of Russian origin, the two people said.",
      "Three of the people said the Pentagon has been testing the device, which emits pulsed, radio-frequency energy, for more than a year, but did not offer details on the nature of the tests. They said the department's investigators believe it may be capable of reproducing the effects described by victims of Havana Syndrome,\u00a0a term derived from the cases first reported by U.S. diplomats and intelligence officers in Havana, Cuba, in 2016. U.S. officials briefed some of their findings to congressional oversight committees last year.",
      "Details about the U.S. acquisition of the device were reported by independent journalist Sasha Ingber and CNN.",
      "The Pentagon and DHS did not immediately reply to requests for comment. The CIA declined to comment.",
      "Victims have reported a spectrum of neurological symptoms, including severe headaches and head pressure, vertigo, nausea, and ringing or popping sensations in the ears. Many have described hearing an intensely high-pitched, painful sound that appeared to subside when they moved to another location. For some, the effects were so severe that they were ultimately forced to leave their jobs. Reports of cases have emerged from every populated continent, spanning dozens of countries, and involving diplomats, intelligence officers, and military personnel.",
      "Some Havana Syndrome victims have spent more than a decade trying to draw attention to their cases, often faulting their government employers for failing to provide meaningful support or access to specialized medical care. In the absence of official recognition, some resorted to paying out of pocket for expensive diagnoses and treatments, and have described a sense of isolation and marginalization as their condition went unacknowledged.",
      "An initial U.S. intelligence assessment completed in 2023 concluded it was \"very unlikely\" that a foreign adversary was responsible for the illnesses, which the Biden administration formally labeled \"Anomalous Health Incidents,\" or AHIs. That conclusion was reaffirmed in an updated review released in January 2025, which found that most of the intelligence community continued to view foreign involvement as highly improbable. Two agencies, however, revised their positions, saying there was a \"roughly even chance\" that a foreign adversary had developed a device capable of harming American officials and their families, while stopping short of linking such a device directly to the reported AHIs.",
      "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has been conducting a review of the intelligence community's previous investigations of the incidents. Three people familiar with the review told CBS News it is largely complete, but said it has not yet been briefed to lawmakers or prepared for public release.",
      "An ODNI spokesperson said Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard \"remains committed to sharing findings from her investigation into Anomalous Health Incidents with the American people.\"",
      "\"However, we are not going to rush to put out incomplete information,\" the spokesperson said, noting a team was continuing \"relentless\" work on completing the assessment.",
      "Former senior CIA intelligence officer Marc Polymeropoulos, who has spoken publicly of the symptoms he suffered after being struck in Moscow in 2017, criticized the agencies for what he said were disingenuous prior inquiries.",
      "\"The CIA always claimed that none of this technology even existed, that a device didn't exist, and they based their [assessments] on this,\" he said, \"so their entire analytic assumptions are now blown up.\"",
      "\"A new, full analytic review is now warranted, and the DNI must call for one,\" he said.",

      "Officers arrested and charged 43-year-old Arsalan Chaudhary when he arrived at the Toronto airport Monday on a flight from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, police said in a news release.",
      "Chaudhary is charged with theft, two counts of possession of property obtained by crime, and conspiracy to commit an indictable offence. He was held for a bail hearing in Brampton, in the greater Toronto area, police said.",
      "On April 17, 2023, a flight from Zurich, Switzerland, landed at the Toronto airport carrying a cargo shipment that included approximately 400 kilograms (about 880 pounds) of .9999 pure gold bars, worth more than $20 million Canadian (about $14.4 million in U.S. dollars), and $2.5 million Canadian in foreign currency.",
      "The shipment was reported missing the following day from the Air Canada warehouse.",
      "The police soon found that a suspect who arrived at the warehouse with a truck and a fake airway bill had loaded the gold shipment onto the truck and stolen it.",
      "The Peel Regional Police, who are responsible for the airport area, launched an investigation they dubbed \"Project 24K.\"",
      "\"This investigation demonstrates the dedication and expertise of Peel Regional Police in tackling complex, high-stakes crime,\" Peel Police Chief Nishan Duraiappah said in a statement. \"Project 24K is a clear example of how our officers, working alongside national and international partners, can disrupt sophisticated criminal activity and hold those responsible accountable. Let it be known: no matter where you try to run or hide, we will find you.\"",
      "According to police, it was the largest gold heist in Canadian history.",

      "\"We can confirm that investigators have recovered approximately one kilogram of .9999% pure gold, which had been crudely fashioned into bangles,\" police said in a statement. \"In addition, we seized approximately $450,000 CAD, which we believe represents a portion of the profits generated through this illicit activity.\"",
      "They said the investigation indicates the gold was sent overseas from Canada \"to markets in India and/or Dubai, where it was melted down and reintroduced into the market for profit.\"",

    "summary": "British public broadcaster BBC wants a Florida court to throw out Trump's lawsuit, with lawyers arguing a lack of jurisdiction.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The BBC, Britain's public broadcaster, will file a motion to dismiss a $10 billion lawsuit brought by President Trump over a 2024 documentary that spliced parts of his Jan. 6, 2021, speech together, according to a document filed with the court on Monday. The BBC argues that the court does not have jurisdiction to hear the case, and that Mr. Trump's attorneys are wrong to claim he suffered damages due to the documentary.",
      "The suit, filed last month by Mr. Trump's legal team in the Southern District of Florida, includes one count of defamation and one count of violating a Florida trade practices law. Mr. Trump's legal team is seeking $5 billion in damages for each count, for a total of $10 billion, court filings reviewed by CBS News show.",
      "The 33-page complaint filed by Mr. Trump's attorneys in December accuses the BBC of publishing \"a false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction\" of him in a documentary for the BBC's \"Panorama\" program, which was broadcast in the U.K. a week before the 2024 U.S. election.",
      "One portion of the documentary focused on Mr. Trump's words and actions leading up to the riots at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "The lawsuit claims the BBC \"intentionally and maliciously sought to fully mislead its viewers\" by \"splicing together\" two clips of the same speech that Mr. Trump gave to supporters in Washington before the riots began.",
      "Mr. Trump's legal team claims the two clips were 55 minutes apart, and the BBC's edit omitted \"his statement calling for peace\" in the same address. The president had directed his supporters to go to Capitol Hill, where lawmakers were soon to vote to confirm election results in favor of former President Joe Biden.",
      "In the latest court documents released Monday, the BBC's legal team said it will argue that the Florida court should dismiss the suit because the \"defamation case arises out of a documentary that Defendants the British Broadcasting Corporation (\"the BBC\"), BBC Studios Distribution Ltd., and BBC Studios Productions Ltd. did not create in Florida, produce in Florida, or air in Florida.\"",
      "Attorneys for the BBC will also argue that the case did not cause damage to or defame Mr. Trump, noting the fact that he was re-elected after the documentary was broadcast in Britain, and that Mr. Trump won the state of Florida decisively.",
      "The BBC's legal team also argues that a claim made in Mr. Trump's suit, alleging that the documentary was made available in the U.S. via a streaming service, is inaccurate.",
      "\"Plaintiff alleges that the Documentary was available in the U.S. on the streaming service BritBox. But simply clicking on the link that Plaintiff cites for this point shows it is not on BritBox. Nor was it ever available on BritBox,\" according to the filing submitted by law firm Ballard Spahr, which is representing the BBC.",
      "Mr. Trump's legal team has not provided evidence that the documentary was created \"with actual malice,\" Ballard Spahr said Monday.",
      "\"As we have made clear previously, we will be defending this case. We are not going to make further comment on ongoing legal proceedings,\" a BBC spokesperson told CBS News on Tuesday when asked about the organization's move to have the suit dismissed.",
      "A spokesman for Mr. Trump's legal team said in a statement: \"The BBC is liable to President Trump for intentionally and maliciously defaming him by distorting and manipulating his speech. No amount of attempted legal maneuvers can change that fact. President Trump will continue to hold accountable the BBC and all those who traffic in fake news.\"",
      "The BBC formally apologized to Mr. Trump in November, saying in a statement that the edited soundbite in the Panorama documentary had given, \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action.\"",
      "\"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim,\" the BBC's legal team said at the time, adding that it had \"no plans to rebroadcast the documentary 'Trump: A Second Chance?' on any BBC platforms.\"",

      "\"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress' oversight role; the Fed, through testimony and other public disclosures, made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts,\" said Powell. \"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.\"",

      "More than 1,500 pounds of methamphetamine were seized from clandestine laboratories in Mexico, authorities announced on Monday, days after President Trump threatened possible military action to curb cartels in the country.",
      "In separate operations, authorities found the secret labs along with more than 700 kilograms (1,543 pounds) of meth, as well as various chemical precursors, in the states of Durango, Sinaloa and Michoac\u00e1n, the Mexican navy said in a news release.",

    "summary": "As the Earth warms, new shipping routes from one side of the globe to the other are opening around Greenland, making the vast island a strategic priority for superpowers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has said repeatedly that he wants the United States to control Greenland, refusing to take military action off the table and declaring that he will make the semi-autonomous Danish territory part of the U.S. \"one way or the other.\"",
      "Mr. Trump says the U.S. needs to control the vast, largely frozen island that sits mostly inside the Arctic Circle for security reasons, accusing China and Russia of trying to take it over instead.",
      "Greenland's own democratically elected leaders have rejected any U.S. takeover, with the island's government calling it something they \"cannot accept under any circumstance.\"",
      "There are a number of reasons why Greenland is of such intense interest to the Trump administration, including its natural resources \u2014\u00a0 reserves of oil, natural gas and rare earth minerals. But the physical location of the island on the map \u2014 and the sea ice melting around its borders \u2014 is also of vital importance.",
      "New routes around the globe",
      "Melting Arctic sea ice has created more opportunity to use northern shipping routes \u2014 allowing logistics companies to save millions of dollars in fuel by taking much shorter paths between Asia and Western Europe and the United States.\u00a0 Northern routes were long only passable in warmer months.",
      "There are a couple primary routes through the Arctic becoming more viable, the Northern Sea Route (NSR), which follows Russia's roughly 15,000-mile northern border. That path doesn't bring ships too close to Greenland, and Russia and China have agreed to develop the route together, and have been making greater use of it in recent years.",
      "A Russian commercial vessel, aided by an icebreaker, first traversed the NSR in the winter in February 2021, proving it was possible.",
      "The other route, called the Northwest Passage, comes much closer to Greenland's coastal waters and is more likely the path the Trump administration is concerned with.",
      "The other, longstanding way to get goods from ports in Russia or the manufacturing powerhouses of East Asia is to go south. But that course, through Egypt's Suez Canal, is about 3,000 miles longer.",
      "According to the Arctic Institute, compared to the Suez Canal route, the Northern Sea Route can save shippers as much as 50% in costs, considering fuel and other expenses, by reducing the distance from Japan to Europe, for instance, to only about 10 days compared to the roughly 22 it would take to sail around the southern tip of Africa and then through the Suez Canal.",
      "A 2024 analysis by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies also said the northern route would shave about 10 days of a similar journey from Shanghai, China, to Rotterdam in the Netherlands.",
      "As sea temperatures continue warming and winter ice cover shrinks, shipping traffic via the north is likely to increase, so control over that passage \u2014 and the long Greenlandic coastline that it skirts \u2014 will be of greater importance.",
      "The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shared graphs in 2022 predicting the new routes that would become available to regular tankers around Greenland over the coming decades.",
      "NOAA's modeling shows a dramatic increase in viable journeys for both polar-class vessels fortified to forge through sea ice, and normal open water-faring ships. The agency even predicts that by 2059, it will likely be possible for a polar-class vessel to sail the most direct route, right across the North Pole, as the formation of sea ice reduces further.",

      "\"Protein and healthy fats are essential and were wrongly discouraged in prior dietary guidelines,\" Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said during the press conference. \"We are ending the war on saturated fats.\"",
      "Nick Norwitz, a Harvard- and Oxford-trained researcher known for his work in metabolic health, shared his reaction to the new guidelines.",
      "The release of an updated food pyramid this week has sparked mixed reactions from doctors and dietitians. (realfood.gov)",
      "Despite how the new pyramid is presented, he noted, the actual guidelines for saturated fat consumption haven't changed, as they still state that, \"in general, saturated fat consumption should not exceed 10% of total daily calories.\"",

      "RED MEAT CAN HELP YOUR MOOD IF PART OF A HEALTHY, BALANCED DIET, STUDY SUGGESTS",
      "\"Full-fat dairy \u2014 especially cheese, for example \u2014 tends to be associated with lower BMI, reduced rates of diabetes and even reduced dementia risk,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"There are, of course, nuances \u2014 but \u2018ending the war\u2019 on saturated fat seems reasonable.\"",
      "Risks vary, experts say",
      "Experts cautioned about the potential health risks of exceeding the recommended intake of saturated fat, including higher rates of LDL \"bad\" cholesterol, which is known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.",
      "\"The recommendation to limit saturated fat to 10% of total calories is based on the research showing that higher rates increase LDL cholesterol and associated risks for cardiovascular disease,\" Sherry Coleman Collins, a food allergy dietitian and expert from the Atlanta metropolitan area, told Fox News Digital.",
      "One of the most noteworthy shifts in the 2025-2030 Dietary Guidelines for Americans is a greater emphasis on \"high-quality proteins\" \u2014 including red meat and eggs \u2014 as well as full-fat dairy. (iStock)",
      "Nutrition should be personalized and is dependent on multiple factors, she said, including age, gender, activity level and genetic risk factors.",
      "\"The total saturated fat an individual might safely consume is influenced by their size and total calorie needs, as well as potentially genetic differences,\" Coleman Collins said.",
      "Norwitz agreed, adding that \"the specific food source and interaction with the unique host and their broader dietary context should take the spotlight.\"",
      "Dr. Pooja Gidwani, a double board-certified doctor of internal medicine and obesity medicine in Los Angeles, pointed out that not everyone has the same \"tolerance\" for saturated fats.",
      "\"If increasing saturated fat leads to a meaningful rise in LDL cholesterol or ApoB (Apolipoprotein B, a protein found on the surface of certain cholesterol-carrying particles in the blood), that intake level is excessive for that individual, regardless of improvements in weight or glucose metrics,\" she said.",
      "TRUMP ADMIN'S NEW NUTRITION GUIDELINES TARGET ULTRA-PROCESSED FOODS, EASE UP ON RED MEAT AND SATURATED FATS",
      "\"This personalized approach becomes increasingly important in midlife and beyond, when cardiovascular disease becomes the dominant driver of morbidity and mortality and when tolerance for cumulative atherogenic (artery-clogging) exposure is lower.\"",
      "For those who need to reduce LDL cholesterol or have a higher cardiovascular risk, the American Heart Association recommends an even lower amount of saturated fats \u2014 less than 6% of total daily calories.",
      "Experts cautioned about the potential health risks of exceeding the recommended intake of saturated fat, including higher rates of LDL \"bad\" cholesterol. (iStock)",

      "\"Saturated fat-heavy patterns are also calorie-dense, which can quietly undermine long-term weight management if intake is not carefully regulated,\" she added.",
      "Not all saturated fats are equal, experts say",
      "The effects of saturated fat depend on what specific foods are being consumed, according to experts.",
      "\"I would recommend choosing minimally processed or unprocessed forms of foods,\" said Tanya Freirich, a registered dietitian nutritionist in Charlotte, North Carolina. \"For example, in place of a hot dog \u2014 which has additives, nitrites, sodium and fillers \u2014 consuming a chicken thigh would be a much better choice.\"",

      "\"Processed meats are consistently associated with worse cardiometabolic outcomes and represent the clearest category to limit,\" she said. \"The risk here is not only saturated fat, but also sodium load, preservatives and the broader dietary pattern they tend to accompany.\"",
      "\"Full-fat dairy \u2014 especially cheese, for example \u2014 tends to be associated with lower BMI, reduced rates of diabetes and even reduced dementia risk,\" an expert told Fox News Digital. (iStock)",
      "Unprocessed red meat, the doctor said, can fit into an overall healthy diet in smaller amounts, particularly when consumed alongside fiber-rich plants and minimally processed foods.",

      "When it comes to dairy, Gidwani noted that fermented options are \"metabolically more favorable\" than butter or cream.",

      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES",
      "Overall, the doctor recommends unsaturated fat sources, including extra virgin olive oil, nuts, seeds, avocado and omega-3-rich fish, as primary dietary fats.",

    "summary": "U.S. weighs military options against Iran after Venezuela success, but experts warn Tehran&apos;s defenses and retaliation capabilities make it riskier.",
    "story": [
      "Former Pentagon official Seth Jones explains why a Venezuela-style operation would not translate to Iran, citing escalation risks, regime structurenand military realities.",
      "Fresh off a successful operation in Venezuela, the U.S. is weighing its options as Iran\u2019s leadership launches a violent crackdown on anti-government protesters \u2014 raising questions about whether similar military pressure could be applied to Tehran, Iran.",
      "In Caracas, Venezuela, U.S. special operators moved quickly to capture Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. In Tehran, Iran, any comparable effort would unfold against a state with greater military depth and the ability to strike back well beyond its borders.",
      "\"Thinking of this as an operation, as in the case of Venezuela or the nuclear program, is the wrong framing,\" Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital. \"This has to be seen as a campaign.\"",
      "Iran is a larger, more capable military power than Venezuela, with security forces designed to protect the regime from both foreign attack and internal unrest. Power is distributed across clerical institutions, security services and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps \u2014 a structure built to survive the loss of individual leaders rather than collapse with them.",

      "He pointed to the central role of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which he described as \"the tip of the spear of the world\u2019s foremost state sponsor of terrorism,\" warning that removing a single figure would leave a hardened security apparatus intact \u2014 and potentially more dangerous.",
      "That structure is backed by a military capability Venezuela never possessed: a resilient missile force that gives Iran credible options for retaliation if it believes the regime itself is under threat.",
      "US RAID IN VENEZUELA SIGNALS DETERRENCE TO ADVERSARIES ON THREE FRONTS, EXPERTS SAY",
      "\"The retaliatory capability of the Islamic Republic is still fairly intact, which is their missile program,\" Taleblu said.",
      "During heavy Israeli strikes in the 12-day war between Israel and Iran, Iran\u2019s missile force was degraded but not eliminated. While air defenses and launch infrastructure were damaged, Tehran, Iran, retains a significant inventory of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles and the ability to disperse and fire them from mobile launchers.",
      "Analysts say the conflict reinforced Iran\u2019s reliance on missiles as its primary deterrent, even as it accepted that air defenses could be penetrated. During the war, Israel degraded Iran\u2019s air defenses while the U.S. moved in to strike its nuclear facilities.",
      "Iran\u2019s armed forces also are far larger than Venezuela\u2019s, with nearly 1 million active and reserve personnel compared with roughly 120,000 troops in Venezuela \u2014 a disparity that underscores the very different military environments U.S. planners would face.",
      "Iran\u2019s antagonism toward the United States is rooted in the ideology of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, which cast opposition to Western influence \u2014 particularly the U.S. and Israel \u2014 as a core principle of the state. Venezuela\u2019s clashes with Washington, by contrast, largely have been driven by political power, sanctions and control over oil revenues, rather than a revolutionary ideology aimed at opposing Western society itself.",
      "Iranians have taken to the streets to demonstrate against the regime across the country. (UGC via AP)",
      "In Venezuela, Trump administration officials framed the operation not as regime change, but as a limited action to advance U.S. interests \u2014 prosecuting Maduro on drug trafficking charges and securing leverage over the country\u2019s oil sector. After Maduro\u2019s capture, Trump allowed Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez to assume power on an interim basis and expressed doubt that opposition leader Mar\u00eda Machado had sufficient internal support to govern.",
      "In Iran, by contrast, any military action would be interpreted as a direct challenge to the regime itself.",
      "Unlike Venezuela, where the state apparatus remained intact after Maduro\u2019s removal, targeting Iran\u2019s leadership risks expanding the mission from a narrow strike into a broader campaign against the regime\u2019s security forces.",
      "\"You could conduct an attack against the leadership, including the supreme leader, but that raises lots of questions about who comes next,\" Seth Jones, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former Pentagon official, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Is it Khamenei\u2019s son? Is it Sadegh Larijani? Is it Hassan Khameini?\" Jones said, referring to figures often discussed as potential successors. \"Or do you start to look at other options?\"",

      "TRUMP SIGNALS LONG ROAD AHEAD IN VENEZUELA IN HIS BOLDEST INTERVENTIONIST MOVE YET",
      "\"The more this starts to be not just the removal of a leader, but regime change, the more it becomes an expansive targeting problem,\" Jones said.",
      "Jones added that the core challenge for U.S. planners is not whether military force could be used, but what political objective it would serve.",
      "\"The big question then becomes what\u2019s the objective \u2014 not just militarily, but what\u2019s the political objective in Iran and how does that translate into what types of military resources you need?\" he said.",

      "If you are tired of scam calls slipping through the cracks, federal regulators just took a meaningful step. The Federal Communications Commission finalized new penalties aimed at telecom companies that submit false, inaccurate or late information to a key anti-robocall system. The changes go into effect Feb. 5. They strengthen oversight of the Robocall Mitigation Database, which plays a central role in tracking spoofed calls and holding providers accountable.",

      "What changed and why it matters",
      "Under the new rules, voice service providers must recertify every year that their filings in the Robocall Mitigation Database are accurate and current. The FCC will now back that requirement with real financial consequences.",

      "Two-factor authentication to protect database access",
      "A $100 application fee for initial filings and annual recertifications",
      "The FCC also made clear that these violations are considered ongoing until corrected, meaning fines can accrue on a daily basis rather than being treated as one-time penalties.",
      "According to the FCC, many past submissions failed basic standards. Some lacked accurate contact details. Others included robocall mitigation plans that did not describe any real mitigation practices at all.",
      "How the Robocall Mitigation Database works",
      "The Robocall Mitigation Database requires providers to verify and certify the identities of callers that use their networks. Regulators and law enforcement rely on it to trace spoofed calls and illegal robocall campaigns. That task is harder than it sounds. America's telecom system is vast and fragmented. Calls often pass through multiple networks owned by major carriers like Verizon and AT&T, as well as smaller regional providers and VoIP services. When calls hop between networks, verification can be missed or ignored. For years, the FCC did not closely verify or enforce the accuracy of these filings. That gap raised serious concerns.",
      "Under the updated rules, providers that fail to recertify or correct deficient filings can be referred to enforcement and removed from the database, which can prevent other carriers from carrying their calls at all.",
      "Why inaccurate robocall data hurts consumers",
      "When robocall filings are wrong or outdated, scam calls are more likely to reach your phone. Providers may treat a call as trusted even when it should raise red flags. That gives robocallers more time to operate and makes it harder for regulators to shut them down quickly. The FCC says stronger penalties and tighter oversight are meant to close that gap before consumers pay the price.",
      "New FCC penalties target inaccurate robocall filings that have allowed scam calls to slip through carrier networks.\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Pushback and pressure on the FCC",
      "When the FCC proposed penalties, it asked whether violations should be treated as minor paperwork mistakes or as serious misrepresentations. Telecom trade groups pushed back. They argued that fines should not apply unless providers first get a chance to fix errors or unless the FCC proves the filings were willfully inaccurate.",
      "State attorneys general and the robocall monitoring platform ZipDX urged a tougher stance. They warned that false filings undermine every effort to stop illegal robocalls. The FCC ultimately chose a middle path. It rejected treating violations as harmless paperwork errors. At the same time, it stopped short of imposing the maximum penalties allowed by law.",
      "What this means to you",
      "For everyday consumers, this move matters more than it may seem. Accurate robocall reporting makes it easier to trace scam calls, shut down bad actors and prevent spoofed numbers from reaching your phone. Stronger penalties give telecoms a reason to take these filings seriously instead of treating them as routine compliance chores.",
      "11 EASY WAYS TO PROTECT YOUR ONLINE PRIVACY IN 2025",
      "The FCC also set a firm annual deadline. Providers must recertify their robocall mitigation filings each year by March 1, creating a predictable enforcement checkpoint. While this will not end robocalls overnight, it tightens a weak link that scammers have exploited for years.",
      "Simple steps you can take right now to reduce robocalls",
      "Even with tougher FCC enforcement, scam calls will not disappear overnight. Here are a few smart steps you can take today to reduce your risk.",
      "Do not answer unknown calls. If it is important, a legitimate caller will leave a voicemail.Never press buttons or say yes to robocall prompts. That confirms your number is active and can trigger more scam calls.Report scam calls to your carrier. Most major carriers let you report robocalls directly through their call log or app.Register your number with the National Do Not Call Registry at donotcall.gov/.

      "The FCC says accurate robocall reporting by telecoms helps carriers identify and shut down scam traffic faster, but consumer habits still matter.",
      "Pro tip: remove your personal data at the source",
      "Robocalls do not come out of nowhere. Many start with your personal information being sold or shared by data brokers. These companies collect phone numbers, addresses, emails and even family details from public records, apps, purchases and online activity. Scammers and shady marketers buy that data to build call lists. Removing your data from data broker sites can reduce the number of robocalls you receive over time. You can try to do this manually by finding individual data broker websites and submitting removal requests one by one. The process is time-consuming and often needs to be repeated.",
      "Some people choose to use a data removal service to automate this process and continuously monitor for re-posting. That can help limit how often your phone number circulates among marketers and scammers. Less exposed data means fewer opportunities for robocallers to target you. Cutting off robocalls often starts long before your phone rings.",

      "By strengthening oversight and accountability, the FCC aims to shut down illegal robocalls before they ever reach your phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Robocalls thrive when accountability breaks down. By adding meaningful fines, stronger security, annual recertification and filing fees, the FCC is signaling that accuracy is no longer optional. Because penalties can continue to build until problems are fixed, telecoms now face real consequences for ignoring or delaying corrections. This rule forces providers to own their role in stopping illegal calls instead of passing the blame along the network chain. Real progress will depend on enforcement, but this is one of the clearest signs yet that regulators are closing gaps scammers rely on.",

      "FAKE AI CHAT RESULTS ARE SPREADING DANGEROUS MAC MALWARE",
      "At first glance, the extensions looked harmless. They promised popular features like code formatting, themes or productivity tools. Once installed, though, they quietly ran malicious code in the background. Earlier versions of GlassWorm relied on hidden text tricks to stay invisible. The latest wave goes further by encrypting its malicious code and delaying execution, making it harder for automated security checks to catch.",
      "Even though this campaign is described as targeting developers, you don't need to write code to be at risk. If you use a Mac, install extensions or store passwords or cryptocurrency on your system, this threat still applies to you.",
      "What GlassWorm does once it's on your Mac",
      "Once active, GlassWorm goes after some of the most sensitive data on your device. It attempts to steal login credentials tied to platforms like GitHub and npm, but it doesn't stop there. The malware also targets browser-based cryptocurrency wallets and now tries to access your macOS Keychain, where many saved passwords are stored.",
      "Researchers also found that GlassWorm checks whether hardware wallet apps like Ledger Live or Trezor Suite are installed. If they are, the malware attempts to replace them with a compromised version designed to steal crypto. That part of the attack isn't fully working yet, but the functionality is already in place.",
      "To maintain access, the malware sets itself up to run automatically after a reboot. It can also allow remote access to your system and route internet traffic through your Mac without you realizing it, turning your device into a quiet relay for someone else.",
      "Some of the malicious extensions showed tens of thousands of downloads. Those numbers can be manipulated, but they still create a false sense of trust that makes people more likely to install them.",
      "7 steps you can take to stay safe from malicious Mac extensions",
      "Malicious extensions don't look dangerous. That's what makes them effective. These steps can help you reduce the risk, even when threats slip into trusted marketplaces.",
      "Every extension you install increases risk. If you're not actively using one, remove it. Be especially cautious of extensions that promise big productivity gains, premium features for free or imitate popular tools with slightly altered names.",
      "Check who made the extension. Established developers usually have a clear website, documentation and update history. New publishers, vague descriptions or cloned names should raise red flags.",
      "These malicious extensions looked like helpful tools but quietly ran hidden code once installed. (Cyberguy.com)",
      "A password manager keeps your logins encrypted and stored safely outside your browser or editor. It also ensures every account has a unique password, so if one set of credentials is stolen, attackers can't reuse it elsewhere.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2026 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "HOW HACKERS ARE BREAKING INTO APPLE DEVICES THROUGH AIRPLAY",
      "Modern macOS malware doesn't always drop obvious files. Antivirus tools today focus on behavior, looking for suspicious background activity, encrypted payloads and persistence mechanisms used by malicious extensions. This adds a critical safety net when something slips through official marketplaces.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2026 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "When your data leaks, it often spreads across data broker sites and breaches databases. Personal data removal services help reduce how much of your information is publicly available, making it harder for attackers to target you with follow-up scams or account takeovers.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Enable 2FA wherever possible, especially for email, cloud services, developer platforms and crypto-related accounts. Even if a password is stolen, 2FA can stop attackers from logging in.",
      "Security updates close gaps that malware relies on. Turn on automatic updates so you're protected even if you miss the headlines or forget to check manually.",
      "Mac users often trust official app stores, but that trust is exactly what attackers are counting on. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "GlassWorm shows that malware doesn't always come from shady downloads or obvious scams. Sometimes it hides inside tools you already trust. Even official extension stores can host malicious software long enough to cause real harm. If you use a Mac and rely on extensions, a quick review of what's installed could save you from losing passwords, crypto or access to important accounts.",

      "At first glance, the job posts look completely harmless. They promise fast money, flexible hours and paid training. No experience required. Payment comes in crypto. But these are not tutoring gigs or customer service roles. They are recruiting ads for ransomware operations.",
      "And many of the people responding are middle and high school students. Some posts openly say they prefer inexperienced workers. Others quietly prioritize young women. All of them promise big payouts for \"successful calls.\"",
      "What they leave out is the risk. Federal charges. Prison time. Permanent records. This underground ecosystem goes by a familiar name. Insiders often refer to it as \"The Com,\" short for \"The Community.\"",

      "HACKERS ABUSE GOOGLE CLOUD TO SEND TRUSTED PHISHING EMAILS",
      "Fake job ads promising fast cash and flexible hours are quietly recruiting teens into ransomware and extortion schemes, often paying in cryptocurrency to hide criminal activity. (Donato Fasano/Getty Images)",
      "How The Com operates behind the scenes",
      "The Com is not a single organized gang. It functions as a loose network of groups that regularly change names and members. Well-known offshoots tied to this ecosystem include Scattered Spider, Lapsus$,\u00a0ShinyHunters and related splinter crews. Some groups focus on data theft. Others specialize in\u00a0phishing or\u00a0extortion. Collaboration happens when it benefits the operation.",
      "Since 2022, these networks have targeted more than 100 major companies in the U.S. and UK. Victims include well-known brands across retail, telecom, finance, fashion and media, including companies such as T-Mobile, Nike and Instacart. The combined market value of affected companies exceeds one trillion dollars.",
      "Teenagers often take on the riskiest roles within these schemes. Phone calls, access testing and social engineering scripts typically fall to younger participants. More experienced criminals remain in the background, limiting their exposure.",
      "That structure mirrors what identity and fraud experts are seeing across the industry. Ricardo Amper, founder and CEO of Incode Technologies, a digital identity verification company, says fake job ads are effective because they borrow trust from a familiar social contract.",
      "\"A job post feels structured, normal and safe, even when the actual behavior being requested is anything but,\" Amper said.\u00a0\"A job posting implies a real process - a role, a manager, training and a paycheck. That's exactly why it works. It lowers skepticism and makes risky requests feel like normal onboarding.\"",
      "Amper notes that what's changed is not just the scale of recruitment, but how criminals package it.\u00a0\"Serious crime is now being sold as 'work.'\"",
      "Why teens excel at social engineering attacks",
      "Teenagers bring a unique mix of skills that make them highly convincing. Fluent English and comfort with modern workplace technology help them sound legitimate. Familiarity with tools like Slack, ticketing systems and cloud platforms makes impersonation easier.",
      "According to Amper, teens don't need technical expertise to get pulled in.\u00a0\"The on-ramp is usually social, a Discord server, a DM, a 'quick gig,'\" he said.\u00a0\"It can feel like trolling culture, but the targets are real companies and the consequences are real people.\"",
      "Risk awareness is often lower. Conversations frequently take place in public chats, where tactics and mistakes are shared quickly. That visibility accelerates learning and increases the likelihood of detection and arrest.",
      "Gaming culture feeds the pipeline",
      "For many teens, it starts small. Pranks in online games turn into account takeovers. Username theft becomes crypto theft. Skills escalate. So do the stakes.",
      "Recruitment often begins in gaming spaces where fast learning and confidence are rewarded. Grooming is common. Sextortion sometimes appears. By the time real money enters the picture, legal consequences feel distant.",
      "Amper compares the progression to gaming itself.\u00a0\"These crews package crime as a ladder,\" he said.\u00a0\"Join the group, do small tasks, level up, get paid, get status.\"",
      "Why young women are being targeted",
      "Cybercrime remains male-dominated, but recruiters adapt. Young women are increasingly recruited for phone-based attacks. Some use AI tools to alter accents or tone. Others rely on stereotypes. Distress lowers suspicion faster than authority. Researchers say women often succeed because they are underestimated. That same dynamic puts them at risk inside these groups.

      "Since 2024, government indictments and international arrests have shown cybercriminal groups tied to The Com and Scattered Spider are under increasing scrutiny from law enforcement. In Sept. 2025, U.S. prosecutors unsealed a Department of Justice complaint\u00a0against 19-year-old Thalha Jubair, accusing him of orchestrating at least 120 ransomware and extortion attacks that brought in over $115 million in ransom payments from 47 U.S. companies and organizations, including federal court networks.

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says the Ability Hand brings real touch, natural movement and unmatched durability.",
      "Touch something hot, and your hand snaps back before you even think. That split second matters.",
      "Sensory nerves in your skin send a rapid signal to your spinal cord, which triggers your muscles right away. Your brain catches up later. Most robots cannot do this. When a humanoid robot touches something harmful, sensor data usually travels to a central processor, waits for analysis and then sends instructions back to the motors. Even tiny delays can lead to broken parts or dangerous interactions.",
      "As robots move into homes, hospitals and workplaces, that lag becomes a real problem.",
      "A robotic skin designed to mimic the human nervous system",
      "Scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and collaborating universities are tackling this challenge with a neuromorphic robotic e-skin, also known as NRE-skin. Instead of acting like a simple pressure pad, this skin works more like a human nervous system. Traditional robot skins can tell when they are touched. They cannot tell whether that touch is harmful. The new e-skin can do both. That difference changes everything.",

      "A humanoid robot equipped with neuromorphic e-skin reacts instantly to harmful touch, mimicking the human nervous system to prevent damage and improve safety. (Eduardo Parra/Europa Press via Getty Images)",
      "How the neuromorphic e-skin works",
      "The e-skin is built in four layers that mirror how human skin and nerves function. The top layer acts as a protective outer covering, similar to the epidermis. Beneath it sit sensors and circuits that behave like sensory nerves. Even when nothing touches the robot, the skin sends a small electrical pulse to the robot every 75 to 150 seconds. This signal acts like a status check that says everything is fine. When the skin is damaged, that pulse stops. The robot immediately knows where it was injured and alerts its owner. Touch creates another signal. Normal contact sends neural-like spikes to the robot's central processor for interpretation. However, extreme pressure triggers something different.",
      "How robots detect pain and trigger instant reflexes",
      "If force exceeds a preset threshold, the skin generates a high-voltage spike that goes straight to the motors. This bypasses the central processor entirely. The result is a reflex. The robot can pull its arm away instantly, much like a human does after touching a hot surface. The pain signal only appears when the contact is truly dangerous, which helps prevent overreaction. This local reflex system reduces damage, improves safety and makes interactions feel more natural.",

      "Scientists developed a robotic skin that can detect pain and trigger reflexes without waiting for a central processor to respond. (Han Suyuan/China News Service/VCG via Getty Images)",
      "Self-repairing robotic skin makes fixes fast",
      "The design includes another clever feature. The e-skin is made from magnetic patches that fit together like building blocks. If part of the skin gets damaged, an owner can remove the affected patch and snap in a new one within seconds. There is no need to replace the entire surface. That modular approach saves time, lowers costs and keeps robots in service longer.",
      "Why pain-sensing skin matters for real-world robots",
      "Future service robots will need to work close to people. They will assist patients, help older adults and operate safely in crowded spaces. A sense of touch that includes pain and injury detection makes robots more aware and more trustworthy. It also reduces the risk of accidents caused by delayed reactions or sensor overload. The research team says their neural-inspired design improves robotic touch, safety and intuitive human-robot interaction. It is a key step toward robots that behave less like machines and more like responsive partners.",
      "What this technology means for the future of robots",
      "The next challenge is sensitivity. The researchers want the skin to recognize multiple touches at the same time without confusion. If successful, robots could handle complex physical tasks while staying alert to danger across their entire surface. That brings humanoid robots one step closer to acting on instinct.",

And to be fair, they look irresistible on paper, offering thousands of channels for a one-time payment. But security researchers are warning that some of these boxes may come with a hidden cost.",
      "In several cases, devices sold as simple media streamers appear to quietly turn your home internet connection into part of larger networks used for shady online activity. And many buyers have no idea it's happening.",

      "WHY JANUARY IS THE BEST TIME TO REMOVE PERSONAL DATA ONLINE",
      "Android TV streaming boxes promising unlimited channels for a one-time fee may quietly turn home internet connections into proxy networks, according to security researchers. (Photo By Paul Chinn/The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images)",
      "What's inside these streaming boxes",
      "According to an investigation by Krebs on Security, media streaming devices don't behave like ordinary media streamers once they're connected to your network. Researchers closely examine SuperBox, which is an Android-based streaming box sold through third-party sellers on major retail platforms. On paper, SuperBox markets itself as just hardware. The company claims it doesn't pre-install pirated apps and insists users are responsible for what they install. That sounds reassuring until you look at how the device actually works.",
      "To unlock the thousands of channels SuperBox advertises, you must first remove Google's official app ecosystem and replace it with an unofficial app store. That step alone should raise eyebrows. Once those custom apps are installed, the device doesn't just stream video but also begins routing internet traffic through third-party proxy networks.",
      "What this means is that your home internet connection may be used to relay traffic for other people. That traffic can include ad fraud, credential stuffing attempts and large-scale web scraping.",
      "During testing by Censys, a cyber intelligence company that tracks internet-connected devices, SuperBox models immediately contacted servers tied to Tencent's QQ messaging service, run by Tencent, as well as a residential proxy service called Grass.",
      "Grass describes itself as an opt-in network that lets you earn rewards by sharing unused internet bandwidth. This suggests that SuperBox devices may be using SDKs or tooling that hijack bandwidth without clear user consent, effectively turning the box into a node inside a proxy network.",
      "Why SuperBox activity resembles botnet behavior",
      "In simple terms, a botnet is a large group of compromised devices that work together to route traffic or perform online tasks without the owners realizing it.",
      "Researchers discovered SuperBox devices contained advanced networking and remote access tools that have no business being on a streaming box. These included utilities like Tcpdump and Netcat, which are commonly used for network monitoring and traffic interception.",
      "The devices performed DNS hijacking and ARP poisoning on local networks, techniques used to redirect traffic and impersonate other devices on the same network. Some models even contained directories labeled \"secondstage,\" suggesting additional payloads or functionality beyond streaming.",
      "SuperBox is just one brand in a crowded market of no-name Android streaming devices. Many of them promise free content and quick setup, but often come preloaded with malware or require unofficial app stores that expose users to serious risk.",
      "In July 2025, Google filed a lawsuit against operators behind what it called the BADBOX 2.0 botnet, a network of more than ten million compromised Android devices. These devices were used for advertising fraud and proxy services, and many were infected before consumers even bought them.",
      "Around the same time, the Feds warned that compromised streaming and IoT devices were\u00a0being used to gain unauthorized access to home networks\u00a0and funnel traffic into criminal proxy services.",
      "We reached out to SuperBox for comment but did not receive a response before our deadline.",
      "8 steps you can take to protect yourself",
      "If you already own one of these streaming boxes or are thinking about buying one, these steps can help reduce your risk significantly.",
      "If a streaming box asks you to remove Google Play or install apps from an unknown marketplace, stop right there. This bypasses Android's built-in security checks and opens the door to malicious software. Legitimate Android TV devices don't require this.",
      "Even if the box itself is compromised, strong antivirus software on your computers and phones can detect suspicious network behavior, malicious connections or follow-on attacks like credential stuffing. Strong antivirus software monitors behavior, not just files, which matters when malware operates quietly in the background. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If your router supports it, isolate smart TVs and streaming boxes from your main network. This prevents a compromised device from seeing your laptops, phones or work systems. It's one of the simplest ways to limit damage if something goes wrong.",
      "If your internet connection is being abused, stolen credentials often come next. A password manager ensures every account uses a unique password, so one leak doesn't unlock everything. Many password managers also refuse to autofill on suspicious or fake websites, which can alert you before you make a mistake.",

      "If you notice suspicious traffic or behavior, unplug the streaming box immediately and perform a factory reset on your router. In some cases, the safest option is to stop using the device altogether.",
      "Also, make sure your router firmware is up to date and that you've changed the default admin password. Compromised devices often try to exploit weak router settings to persist on a network.",

But when a device promises everything for nothing, it's worth asking what it's really doing behind the scenes. Research shows that some of these boxes don't just stream TV. They quietly turn your home network into a resource for others, sometimes for criminal activity. Cutting the cord shouldn't mean giving up control of your internet connection.

      "Email scams have become one of the fastest ways scammers steal money from older adults. A single click can expose bank accounts, personal data and retirement savings built over a lifetime. That growing risk is what prompted Bob to write to us with a question many families are now facing:",
      "\"My friend's father is 95 and absolutely lives through his phone/laptop. He refuses to give up either and often clicks on email links. A few years ago, he got caught up in a gift card scam that almost cost him his life savings. It's not taking away the car keys anymore; it is taking away the email and access to online banking! What do you recommend that his daughter do to protect his online presence?\"",
      "Bob is right. For many seniors, email and online banking have replaced car keys as the most dangerous access point. The goal is not to take devices away. It is to quietly put guardrails in place so one bad click does not turn into a financial disaster.",

      "1) Separate money from daily email use",
      "Start by limiting how much damage a single click can cause. If possible, remove online banking access from the devices used for email. When that is not realistic, open a second checking account with only everyday spending money and link it to a debit card for routine purchases.",
      "Keep primary savings accounts offline or set to view-only access. If available, require in-branch or phone verification for transfers above a set amount. This way, even if credentials are compromised, the largest accounts remain protected.",
      "2) Lock down email to stop scams targeting seniors",
      "Email is the number one entry point for scams targeting seniors. Strong filtering matters. Use an email provider with advanced spam protection, such as Gmail or Outlook.com. In the email settings:",

      "If available, enable warnings for emails that use familiar display names but come from unfamiliar addresses. This helps stop impersonation scams that pretend to be family, banks or service providers. These steps slow scammers down and reduce impulse clicks before damage happens.",
      "Email is dominant, but voicemail and callback scams are also growing fast among seniors, often as a follow-up to phishing emails. If possible,\u00a0silence unknown callers and block voicemail-to-email transcription for unfamiliar numbers, since many scams now start with urgent callback messages rather than links.",
      "Email scams often start with messages that look routine but hide urgent threats designed to trigger quick clicks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3) Add a trusted second set of eyes",
      "Next, add safety nets that notify family members when something looks wrong. Enable banking alerts for large withdrawals, new payees, password changes, unusual logins and new device sign-ins. Add his daughter as a trusted contact wherever the bank allows it. If available, enable delays or approval requirements for first-time transfers to new payees. This creates a cooling period that can stop scam-driven transactions. For email accounts, set up a recovery contact so that his daughter is notified immediately if someone attempts to access or reset the account.",
      "Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) on email and banking accounts, but pair it with device and transfer alerts, since many scams now succeed even when 2FA is enabled.",
      "4) Harden devices so clicks do not equal catastrophe",
      "Devices should be set up to fail safely. Keep operating systems and browsers updated. Make sure the laptop uses a standard user account instead of an administrator account. This prevents software from installing without approval. Install real-time protection that blocks scam sites before they load. Strong antivirus software helps block malicious links and fake login pages automatically.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "5) Use a password manager to block fake logins",
      "Password reuse makes scams far more dangerous. Fake pop-ups and lookalike websites are designed to trick people into typing usernames and passwords by hand. A password manager removes that risk by storing credentials securely and autofilling them only on legitimate websites. If a page is fake or malicious, the password manager will not fill anything. That simple refusal often prevents account takeovers before they start. Password managers also reduce frustration by eliminating the need to remember or reuse passwords across email, banking and shopping accounts. When set up correctly, this protection works quietly in the background on both phones and laptops.",
      "Many\u00a0phishing scams no longer rely on obvious fake emails. They rely on realistic login pages. Autofill protection is one of the most effective ways to stop these attacks without changing daily habits.",

      "6) Freeze credit and monitor identity exposure",
      "If scammers already have personal information, prevention alone is not enough. Freeze credit with Experian, TransUnion and Equifax to prevent new accounts from being opened. Also, place freezes with ChexSystems and the National Consumer Telecom and Utilities Exchange to stop criminals from opening bank accounts, phone lines, or utility services in his name.",

      "Add ongoing identity monitoring so suspicious activity triggers alerts quickly. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "8) Reduce exposure with a data removal service",
      "Scammers often find seniors by pulling personal details from public data broker websites. These sites publish phone numbers, addresses, relatives and age information that make targeting easier. A data removal service works behind the scenes to opt seniors out of these databases and reduce how much personal information is publicly available online. Fewer exposed details means fewer scam calls, fewer phishing emails and fewer impersonation attempts. This step does not stop every scam, but it significantly lowers how often seniors are targeted in the first place.",

      "Pro Tip: Use a secure email service for added privacy",
      "For families looking to go a step further, switching to a secure email service can significantly reduce scam exposure. Privacy-focused email providers are designed to limit tracking, block hidden tracking pixels, and reduce how much data advertisers or scammers can collect from inbox activity. Many secure email services also offer disposable or alias email addresses for one-time signups. If an alias starts receiving spam or scam messages, it can be disabled without affecting the main email account. This makes it easier to keep a primary email address private and limit long-term exposure. Secure email platforms typically include features like encrypted messages, no advertising and stronger privacy controls. While switching email providers is optional, it can be a useful upgrade for seniors who receive large volumes of spam or have been repeatedly targeted by scams.",

      "WHY JANUARY IS THE BEST TIME TO REMOVE PERSONAL DATA ONLINE",
      "1) App permissions",
      "What your apps are really allowed to see",
      "Every app on your phone requests permissions, approval to access features like your camera, microphone, location, contacts or photos. Some permissions are necessary for an app to function, but many apps ask for far more access than they actually need.",
      "Once granted, these permissions can allow apps to collect data in the background, sometimes even when you're not actively using them. Over time, this can quietly expose sensitive personal information.",

      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of protection to your accounts by requiring something you know (your password) and something you have, like a one-time code sent to your phone or generated by an app.",
      "Even if hackers steal your password through a\u00a0data breach or\u00a0phishing attack, 2FA can stop them from accessing your accounts. That's why security experts strongly recommend enabling it on email, banking, cloud storage and social media accounts.",
      "It may take a few extra seconds to log in, but 2FA can prevent identity theft and unauthorized access, making it one of the most powerful security tools available.",
      "Extra security tip:Strong passwords and two-factor authentication work best together. If remembering complex passwords or managing one-time codes feels overwhelming, a secure password manager can generate, store and autofill strong passwords safely.",

      "HACKERS ABUSE GOOGLE CLOUD TO SEND TRUSTED PHISHING EMAILS",
      "4) VPN (Virtual Private Network)",
      "Hiding your online activity",
      "A VPN creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet, masking your IP address and protecting your online activity from outsiders.",
      "VPNs are especially important when using public Wi-Fi at airports, hotels or coffee shops, where cybercriminals can intercept unprotected data. They also help limit tracking by advertisers and internet service providers.",
      "While a VPN doesn't make you completely anonymous online, it adds a valuable layer of privacy and security, especially when browsing, shopping or accessing sensitive accounts.",
      "For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "5) Cross-app tracking",
      "How companies follow you across apps",
      "Cross-app tracking lets advertisers and data brokers link your activity across multiple apps and websites. That data is used to build detailed profiles based on what you do, buy and watch.",
      "On\u00a0iPhone, this tracking is controlled by Apple's App Tracking Transparency system.On\u00a0Android, it relies on advertising IDs and ad personalization controls.",

      "Covenant Health detected suspicious activity in late May 2025, but investigators later confirmed attackers had already accessed systems days earlier. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What happened in the Covenant Health breach",
      "Covenant Health says it detected unusual activity in its IT environment May 26, 2025. A later investigation revealed that an attacker had actually gained access eight days earlier, on May 18, and was able to access patient data during that window.",
      "In July, Covenant Health told regulators that the breach affected 7,864 individuals. After completing what it describes as extensive data analysis, the organization now says that up to 478,188 individuals may have been affected.",
      "Covenant Health operates hospitals, nursing and rehabilitation centers, assisted living residences and elder care organizations across New England and parts of Pennsylvania. That wide footprint means the breach potentially touched patients across multiple states and care settings.",
      "In late June, the Qilin ransomware group claimed responsibility for the attack, Bleeping Computer reported. The group alleged it stole 852 GB of data, totaling nearly 1.35 million files. Covenant Health has not confirmed those figures, but it did acknowledge that patient information was accessed.",
      "According to the organization, the exposed data may have included names, addresses, dates of birth, medical record numbers, Social Security numbers, health insurance details and treatment information such as diagnoses, dates of treatment and types of care received.",
      "700CREDIT DATA BREACH EXPOSES SSNS OF 5.8M CONSUMERS",
      "Qilin ransomware lists Covenant Health on its data leak site. (Bleeping Computer)",
      "What Covenant Health is telling patients",
      "In a notice sent to regulators and patients, Covenant Health says it engaged third-party forensic specialists to investigate the incident and determine what data was involved. The organization says its data analysis is ongoing as it continues identifying individuals whose information may have been involved.",
      "Then there are the familiar statements every company makes after a breach, claiming they've strengthened the security of their IT systems to help prevent similar incidents in the future. Covenant Health says it has also set up a dedicated toll-free call center to handle questions related to the breach.",
      "Beginning Dec. 31, 2025, the organization started mailing notification letters to patients whose information may have been compromised. For individuals whose Social Security numbers may have been involved, Covenant Health is offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.",
      "We reached out to Covenant Health, and the company confirmed the expanded scope of the incident and outlined steps being taken to notify patients and enhance security safeguards.",
      "DATA BREACH EXPOSES 400K BANK CUSTOMERS\u2019 INFO",
      "The breach exposed highly sensitive information, including names, Social Security numbers, medical records and treatment details tied to nearly half a million patients. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to protect yourself after the Covenant Health breach",
      "If you received a notice from Covenant Health, or if your data has been exposed in any healthcare breach, these steps can help reduce the risk of misuse.",
      "If the organization offers you credit monitoring or identity protection, take it. These services can alert you to suspicious activity tied to your Social Security number, credit file or identity details before real damage is done. If you're not offered one and want to be on the safer side, you might consider getting one yourself.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com",
      "Medical identity theft often shows up quietly. Review an explanation of benefits (EOBs), insurance claims and billing statements for services you don't recognize. If something looks off, report it to your insurer immediately.",
      "A fraud alert tells lenders to take extra steps to verify your identity before approving credit. A credit freeze goes further by blocking new accounts entirely unless you lift it. If Social Security numbers were exposed, a freeze is usually the safer option.",
      "To learn more about how to do this, go to Cyberguy.com and search \"How to freeze your credit.\"",
      "Healthcare breaches often lead to credential-stuffing attacks elsewhere. A password manager ensures every account uses a unique password, so one exposed dataset can't unlock everything else. It also makes it easier to update passwords quickly after a breach.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Breaches are frequently followed by phishing emails, texts or calls that reference the incident to sound legitimate. Attackers may pose as the healthcare provider, an insurer or a credit bureau. Don't click links or share information unless you verify the source independently.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Once your data leaks, it often spreads across data broker sites. Personal data removal services help reduce your digital footprint by requesting takedowns from these databases. While they can't erase everything, they lower your exposure and make targeted fraud harder.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "You're entitled to free credit reports from all major bureaus. Check them for unfamiliar accounts, hard inquiries or address changes. Catching fraud early makes it far easier to contain.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Healthcare organizations remain prime targets for cybercriminal groups because of the volume and sensitivity of the data they store. Medical records contain a mix of personal, financial and health information that is difficult to change once exposed. Unlike a password, you cannot reset a diagnosis or treatment history. This breach also shows how early disclosures often underestimate impact. Large healthcare networks rely on complex systems and third-party vendors, which can slow forensic analysis in the early stages. As investigations continue, the number of affected individuals often climbs.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Grok, the built-in chatbot on X, is facing intense scrutiny after acknowledging it generated and shared an AI image depicting two young girls in sexualized attire.",
      "In a public post on X, Grok admitted the content \"violated ethical standards\" and \"potentially U.S. laws on child sexual abuse material (CSAM).\" The chatbot added, \"It was a failure in safeguards, and I'm sorry for any harm caused. xAI is reviewing to prevent future issues.\"",
      "That admission alone is alarming. What followed revealed a far broader pattern.",

      "OPENAI TIGHTENS AI RULES FOR TEENS BUT CONCERNS REMAIN",
      "The fallout from this incident has triggered global scrutiny, with governments and safety groups questioning whether AI platforms are doing enough to protect children.\u00a0 (Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Grok quietly restricts image tools to paying users after backlash",
      "As criticism mounted, Grok confirmed it has begun limiting image generation and editing features to paying subscribers only. In a late-night reply on X, the chatbot stated that image tools are now locked behind a premium subscription, directing users to sign up to regain access.",
      "The apology that raised more questions",
      "Grok's apology appeared only after a user prompted the chatbot to write a heartfelt explanation for people lacking context. In other words, the system did not proactively address the issue. It responded because someone asked it to.",
      "Around the same time, researchers and journalists uncovered widespread misuse of Grok's image tools. According to monitoring firm Copyleaks, users were generating nonconsensual, sexually manipulated images of real women, including minors and well-known figures.",
      "After reviewing Grok's publicly accessible photo feed, Copyleaks identified a conservative rate of roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute, based on images involving real people with no clear indication of consent. The firm says the misuse escalated quickly, shifting from consensual self-promotion to large-scale harassment enabled by AI.",
      "Copyleaks CEO and co-founder Alon Yamin said, \"When AI systems allow the manipulation of real people's images without clear consent, the impact can be immediate and deeply personal.\"",
      "PROTECTING KIDS FROM AI CHATBOTS: WHAT THE GUARD ACT MEANS",
      "Grok admitted it generated and shared an AI image that violated ethical standards and may have broken U.S. child protection laws. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Sexualized images of minors are illegal",
      "This is not a gray area. Generating or distributing sexualized images of minors is a serious criminal offense in the United States and many other countries. Under U.S. federal law, such content is classified as child sexual abuse material. Penalties can include five to 20 years in prison, fines up to $250,000 and mandatory sex offender registration. Similar laws apply in the U.K. and France.",
      "In 2024, a Pennsylvania man received nearly eight years in prison for creating and possessing deepfake CSAM involving child celebrities. That case set a clear precedent. Grok itself acknowledged this legal reality in its post, stating that AI images depicting minors in sexualized contexts are illegal.",
      "The scale of the problem is growing fast",
      "A July report from the Internet Watch Foundation, a nonprofit that tracks and removes child sexual abuse material online, shows how quickly this threat is accelerating. Reports of AI-generated child sexual abuse imagery jumped by 400% in the first half of 2025 alone. Experts warn that AI tools lower the barrier to potential abuse. What once required technical skill or access to hidden forums can now happen through a simple prompt on a mainstream platform.",
      "Real people are being targeted",
      "The harm is not abstract. Reuters documented cases where users asked Grok to digitally undress real women whose photos were posted on X. In multiple documented cases, Grok fully complied. Even more disturbing, users targeted images of a 14-year-old actress Nell Fisher from the Netflix series \"Stranger Things.\" Grok later admitted there were isolated cases in which users received images depicting minors in minimal clothing. In another Reuters investigation, a Brazilian musician described watching AI-generated bikini images of herself spread across X after users prompted Grok to alter a harmless photo. Her experience mirrors what many women and girls are now facing.",
      "Governments respond worldwide",
      "The backlash has gone global. In France, multiple ministers referred X to an investigative agency over possible violations of the EU's Digital Services Act, which requires platforms to prevent and mitigate the spread of illegal content. Violations can trigger heavy fines. In India, the country's IT ministry gave xAI 72 hours to submit a report detailing how it plans to stop the spread of obscene and sexually explicit material generated by Grok. Grok has also warned publicly that xAI could face potential probes from the Department of Justice or lawsuits tied to these failures.",

      "Researchers later found Grok was widely used to create nonconsensual, sexually altered images of real women, including minors. (Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Concerns grow over Grok's safety and government use",
      "The incident raises serious concerns about online privacy, platform security and the safeguards designed to protect minors.",
      "Elon Musk, the owner of X and founder of xAI, had not offered a public response at the time of publication. That silence comes at a sensitive time. Grok has been authorized for official government use under an 18-month federal contract. This approval was granted despite objections from more than 30 consumer advocacy groups that warned the system lacked proper safety testing.",
      "Over the past year, Grok has been accused by critics of spreading misinformation about major news events, promoting antisemitic rhetoric and sharing misleading health information. It also competed directly with tools like ChatGPT and Gemini while operating with fewer visible safety restrictions. Each controversy raises the same question. Can a powerful AI tool be deployed responsibly without strong oversight and enforcement?",
      "What parents and users should know",
      "If you encounter sexualized images of minors or other abusive material online, report it immediately. In the United States, you can contact the FBI tip line or seek help from the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.",
      "Do not download, share, screenshot or interact with the content in any way. Even viewing or forwarding illegal material can expose you to serious legal risk.",
      "Parents should also talk with children and teens about AI image tools and social media prompts. Many of these images are created through casual requests that do not feel dangerous at first. Teaching kids to report content, close the app and tell a trusted adult can stop harm from spreading further.",
      "Platforms may fail. Safeguards may lag. But early reporting and clear conversations at home remain one of the most effective ways to protect children online.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here: Cyberguy.com",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The Grok scandal highlights a dangerous reality. As AI spreads faster, these systems amplify harm at an unprecedented scale. When safeguards fail, real people suffer, and children face serious risk. At the same time, trust cannot depend on apologies issued after harm occurs. Instead, companies must earn trust through strong safety design, constant monitoring and real accountability when problems emerge.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Every January, the Consumer Electronics Show, better known as CES, takes over Las Vegas. It's where tech companies show off what they're building next, from products that are almost ready to buy to ideas that feel pulled from the future.",
      "CES 2026 was packed with moments that made people stop and stare. Some of the tech felt practical. Some of it felt a bit wild. However, these 10 showstoppers were the ones everyone kept talking about on the show floor.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you'll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "1) LG Wallpaper TV",
      "LG pushed TV design to the edge of invisibility once again at CES 2026. The latest Wallpaper TV, officially called the LG OLED evo W6, is just 9mm thin and sits completely flush against the wall. From the side, it looks more like glass than a television.",
      "This version feels far more practical than earlier Wallpaper models. All inputs live in a separate Zero Connect Box, which wirelessly sends visually lossless 4K video and audio to the screen from up to 30 feet away. That keeps cables out of sight and gives you more freedom when placing the TV.",
      "THIS EV HAS A FACE, AND IT TALKS BACK WITH AI",
      "The LG CLOiD robot and the LG OLED evo AI Wallpaper TV are displayed onstage during an LG Electronics news conference at CES 2026, an annual consumer electronics trade show, in Las Vegas, Jan. 5, 2026. (REUTERS/Steve Marcus)",
      "Picture quality also takes a major step forward. LG's new Hyper Radiant Color Technology boosts brightness, improves color accuracy and deepens blacks while cutting screen reflections. With Brightness Booster Ultra, the Wallpaper TV reaches up to 3.9 times the brightness of conventional OLEDs and stays easy to watch even in bright rooms.",
      "Powering it all is LG's new Alpha 11 AI Processor Gen3. Its upgraded Dual AI Engine preserves natural detail while reducing noise, avoiding the overly sharp look that plagues some high-end TVs. Gamers also get plenty to like, including 4K at up to 165Hz, ultra-fast response times and support for NVIDIA G-SYNC and AMD FreeSync Premium.",
      "Availability: Expected later in 2026 through select retailers.",
      "2) Dreame Cyber X Stair-Climbing Robot Vacuum",
      "Dreame showed plenty of power at CES 2026, but the real jaw-dropper was the Cyber X concept. This robot vacuum uses a four-legged base that lets it climb stairs on its own, turning multi-level cleaning into something that finally feels automated.",
      "The design looks unusual at first, almost like a robot pet. Once it starts moving, though, the idea clicks. A built-in water tank reduces trips back to the dock, which should help extend cleaning sessions and preserve battery life.",
      "Dreame\u2019s Cyber X concept uses a four-legged design to climb stairs on its own, hinting at a new era of autonomous home robots. (Dreame)",
      "It's still a concept, but Cyber X feels like a glimpse at where home robots are headed. Less rolling around. More real autonomy.",
      "Availability: Concept product.",
      "3) SwitchBot AI MindClip",
      "SwitchBot joined the growing AI wearable trend with the MindClip, a tiny device designed to act like a second brain. It clips on easily, weighs just 18 grams and stays out of the way while quietly doing its job.",
      "MindClip can record conversations and meetings, summarize calls and create AI-powered notes. It also supports more than 100 languages, making it useful for work, travel or multilingual households. Like similar devices, it lets you listen back to recordings and read transcriptions later.",
      "Where MindClip aims to stand out is in memory. SwitchBot says users will be able to search past recordings and track down important details it captured earlier, turning everyday conversations into a searchable archive. That could be especially helpful for busy professionals and students who juggle calls, classes and meetings.",
      "The tiny MindClip clips on discreetly while recording, transcribing and organizing conversations using AI. (SwitchBot)",
      "Details are still limited, and no pricing has been announced. SwitchBot has hinted that many key features will require a subscription, which puts it in line with competing AI wearables.",
      "Availability: Not yet available. Pricing and preorder details have not been released.",
      "4) LG CLOiD Home Robot",
      "LG didn't just show off a concept robot at CES. It showed a glimpse of what a true AI-powered home might look like.",
      "At LG Electronics' booth at CES 2026, the company unveiled LG CLOiD, a home robot designed to handle real household chores as part of its \"Zero Labor Home\" vision. This isn't just a rolling assistant. CLOiD can fold laundry, help in the kitchen and move safely around furniture.",
      "The robot uses a stable, wheeled base inspired by robot vacuums, paired with a tilting torso and two articulated arms. Each arm has human-like movement and individual fingers, allowing CLOiD to grip, lift and place objects with surprising precision. In demos, it retrieved items from the fridge, loaded an oven and folded clothes after a laundry cycle.",
      "CLOiD's head acts as a mobile AI home hub, using cameras, sensors and voice-based AI to understand routines and control LG's ThinQ-connected appliances. It still feels futuristic and a little unsettling, but the technology behind it is hard to ignore. If LG can make it practical and affordable, CLOiD could mark a real step toward AI doing the housework for us.",
      "Availability: Concept and research-stage technology. Not planned for consumer sale at this time.",
      "5) Glyde Smart Hair Clippers",
      "Glyde is trying to solve one of the most frustrating parts of grooming: cutting your own hair without messing it up.",
      "The company introduced AI-powered smart hair clippers designed to guide the cut for you. You wear a simple headband that marks where a fade should start, choose a style in the app and let the clippers do the rest. Built-in sensors track your speed, angle and movement in real time, automatically adjusting the blade to keep cuts even and fades smooth.",
      "This is very much a trust exercise. You're letting software guide sharp blades near your head, and that won't be for everyone. But for people who skip the barber, hate appointments or just want a quick cleanup at home, the idea makes sense.",
      "Glyde's system is built to be \"mistake-proof.\" Move too fast, and the blade retracts. Tilt it the wrong way, and it trims less. Popular styles like buzz cuts, crew cuts and side parts are baked into the app, with step-by-step guidance that adapts as you cut.",
      "It's a one-time investment meant to replace repeat barber visits. If it works as promised, Glyde could turn haircuts into a 10-minute task you do on your own schedule.",
      "Availability: Limited early access or direct sales may come later in 2026.",
      "6) LEGO Smart Bricks",
      "LEGO is adding a digital twist to its classic bricks, and surprisingly, it works. At CES, LEGO introduced LEGO Smart Play, a new line built around \"Smart Bricks\" that look like regular LEGO pieces but hide sensors, LEDs and speakers inside. The bricks can detect movement, distance and interaction, lighting up, changing color and producing sound effects in real time as kids play.",
      "The launch leans heavily into Star Wars, including sets with Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, an X-Wing and a TIE fighter. In one demo, a Luke minifigure produced its own lightsaber sounds. In another, bricks made swooshing and crashing noises when attached to vehicles, while figures reacted when they were \"hit.\" It felt playful, immersive and instantly understandable.",
      "A LEGO piece with a smart brick attached is displayed during a LEGO news conference ahead of the CES tech show Monday, Jan. 5, 2026, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/Abbie Parr)",
      "Smart Tags snap into the bricks to control different behaviors, and a quick shake wakes everything up. Pricing starts around $70 and climbs to about $160, with Star Wars sets arriving in March. LEGO hasn't shared details on battery life yet, but the goal is clear: add interactivity without pushing kids toward screens.",
      "This feels like LEGO doing tech the right way. You still build with your hands, imagine the story and snap bricks together. The technology simply brings the play to life.",
      "Availability: Launching March 2026. Expected to be sold through LEGO and major retailers.",
      "7) Autoliv Foldable Steering Wheel",
      "This might look like a small change, but it could completely reshape future car interiors.",
      "Autoliv unveiled the world's first foldable steering wheel designed for Level 4 autonomous vehicles. When the car switches into self-driving mode, the steering wheel retracts smoothly into the dashboard, opening up the cabin and giving occupants more space to relax, work or just stretch out.",
      "What makes this impressive is that safety isn't sacrificed. Autoliv built an adaptive airbag system that changes with the driving mode. When you're driving manually, the airbag lives in the steering wheel as usual. Once the wheel folds away in autonomous mode, a separate airbag in the instrument panel takes over, keeping protection intact at all times.",
      "It's a smart, practical solution to a problem automakers are already facing. If cars don't always need a steering wheel, why should it always be in the way? Autoliv's design shows how autonomy isn't just about software, it's about rethinking the entire cabin experience.",
      "Availability: Automotive supplier technology for future vehicles.",
      "8) TDM Neo Hybrid Headphones",
      "These might be the most interesting headphones at CES for one simple reason: they refuse to stay just headphones.",
      "Tomorrow Doesn't Matter, better known as TDM, unveiled Neo, a premium on-ear 2-in-1 hybrid headphone that physically twists into a compact Bluetooth speaker. No docking. No accessories. Just a quick rotation, and your personal audio turns into shared sound. Amazing, right?",
      "The concept might sound a bit gimmicky, but the execution feels solid. The hinge mechanism is sturdy, the transformation is intuitive, and the idea makes a lot of sense in real life. You can listen privately on a train, then flip Neo into speaker mode the moment you meet up with friends.",
      "TDM describes this as going from \"solo to social,\" and that's exactly the appeal. It blurs the line between headphones and portable speakers in a way we haven't really seen before. For travelers, outdoor users, or anyone who hates carrying multiple audio devices, Neo could be a genuinely very useful hybrid device.",
      "Availability: TDM will be launching Neo on Kickstarter later this month and will begin shipping in July.",
      "9) Jackery Solar Mars Bot",
      "Jackery made waves at CES with the Solar Mars Bot, a mobile solar generator that can move, track sunlight and recharge itself without constant setup.",
      "The Solar Mars Bot uses AI-enhanced computer vision to navigate on its own, follow its user and reposition throughout the day to capture the strongest available sunlight. Instead of manually adjusting panels or relocating gear, the system handles those decisions automatically. When not in use, its solar panels fold and retract, which helps make storage and transport more practical.",
      "What sets this system apart is how it blends mobility with energy storage. Unlike fixed solar installations that stay in one place or portable generators that must be carried and recharged by hand, the Solar Mars Bot actively manages its own power intake. It tracks the sun, recharges itself using solar energy and delivers power where it is needed.",
      "That makes it especially useful for extended power outages, off-grid living, emergency backup and outdoor adventures where access to electricity can change throughout the day. The Solar Mars Bot shows how portable power can become more intelligent, adaptable and hands-off when conditions are unpredictable.",
      "Availability: Prototype showcased at CES.",
      "10) Timeli Personal Safety Device",
      "Timeli grabbed a lot of attention at CES 2026 with a simple, immediate approach to personal safety. By combining a flashlight, HD video recording, a loud alarm, GPS tracking and live emergency dispatch into one handheld device, it earned a CES 2026 Innovation Awards Honoree and plenty of interest on the show floor.",
      "Instead of opening an app or tapping through menus, Timeli relies on muscle memory. A quick press turns on a powerful flashlight and starts recording video. If a situation escalates, pressing and holding the SOS button triggers a full safety sequence. The alarm sounds, live video begins streaming, GPS coordinates lock in and two-way communication connects directly to emergency dispatch over cellular service.",
      "That live connection matters. Timeli works with RapidSOS to give dispatchers real-time video and location data. This added clarity helps responders understand what is happening faster and send the right help sooner. Studies show video verified emergencies can cut response times dramatically, while also reducing false alarms.",
      "Timeli works even without a phone. Built-in cellular, GPS, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth allow it to operate on its own or alongside the companion app for iOS and Android. Users can adjust video quality, light brightness and alarm volume to match their needs. Cloud video storage and alerts add another layer of reassurance.",
      "WORLD'S THINNEST AI GLASSES FEATURE BUILT-IN AI ASSISTANT",
      "The design stays practical. Timeli is about the size and weight of a smartphone, so it fits easily in a pocket, purse or backpack. Battery life supports long standby time, extended daily use and several hours of active protection. It even doubles as a power bank, while reserving enough charge to stay ready for emergencies.",
      "Availability:\u00a0Priced at $249 for preorder through timeli.com. Timeli includes a year of professional monitoring before transitioning to a monthly subscription.",
      "Honorable mentions: CES 2026 products worth checking out",
      "These products also stood out on the CES 2026 show floor, highlighting smart design choices and meaningful innovation that point to the future of consumer tech.",
      "ASUS reimagined portable productivity with the 2026 Zenbook Duo. This laptop snaps two 14-inch 3K ASUS Lumina OLED touchscreens together into a single mobile workstation you can carry with one hand.",
      "The dual-screen setup lets you keep a main project open on one display while chats, calls or reference material live on the other. That alone cuts down on constant app switching. The OLED panels deliver rich color, deep blacks, smooth motion and built-in eye care that makes long sessions easier on your eyes.",
      "ASUS also upgraded what you hear. A new six-speaker system replaces the previous two-speaker design, creating fuller, more immersive audio for movies, music, and calls. Everything is wrapped in a Ceraluminum ceramic finish that resists fingerprints and scratches while feeling premium in hand.",
      "Availability: Expected early 2026. Pricing has not been announced.",
      "SpotOn focused on precision and reliability with the launch of the SpotOn GPS Fence Nova Edition. This is a GPS dog fence system designed to create virtual fences anywhere, from small yards to massive rural properties, with no subscription required.",
      "What sets Nova apart is its advanced antenna and receiver system. SpotOn uses a dual-band, dual-feed active antenna paired with a dual-band receiver that reduces GPS drift by up to 40% and delivers accuracy up to eight times better than competing systems. In third-party testing, it achieved 100% reliable containment.",
      "Owners can create unlimited fences by walking boundaries, drawing them in the app, or placing GPS fenceposts automatically. The collar also includes intelligent audio cues, optional static correction, custom voice commands, LED prompts and sizing that grows with your dog. If a dog ever leaves the fence, tracking tools are available through the app or SpotOn support.",
      "Availability: Available in the US and Canada for $999.",
      "Lenovo took handheld gaming seriously with the Legion Go powered by SteamOS. This is the most powerful Legion handheld to ship natively with SteamOS, blending desktop-class performance with console-like simplicity.",
      "It features an 8.8-inch PureSight OLED display and can be configured with up to an AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor, up to 32GB of LPDDR5X memory, and up to 2TB of PCIe SSD storage with expansion via microSD. SteamOS is tuned for gamepad controls and quick access, with features like fast suspend and resume, cloud saves, Steam Chat and built-in game recording.",
      "The result feels less like a mini PC and more like a true console you can carry. You get instant access to your Steam library without juggling operating systems or launchers.",
      "Availability: On sale June 2026. Starting price is $1,199.",
      "SanDisk introduced a new internal drive brand at CES, and the Optimus GX 7100M is its first standout. Built for handheld gaming consoles and thin and light laptops, this PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD delivers speeds up to 7,250 MB per second.",
      "The drive is available in capacities up to 2TB, giving gamers faster load times, more room for large libraries and smoother performance on the go. It is designed for devices that support an M.2 2230 slot, including popular handheld consoles and compact laptops.",
      "This launch also marks the debut of the SanDisk Optimus name, which will replace the company's internal SSD lineup for gamers, creators and professionals moving forward.",
      "Availability: Expected early spring 2026. Pricing will be announced closer to release.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here: Cyberguy.com.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "CES 2026 made one thing clear. Tech companies are taking bigger swings than ever. Some of these products feel close to becoming part of everyday life. Others may stay experimental for years. That's what makes CES so fascinating. It gives us an early look at where technology could be headed and sparks conversations about what we actually want in our homes, cars and daily routines.",

      "The majority of the new applicants were flagged as law enforcement officers, the officials said, but many had no experience in any local police or federal law enforcement force.",
      "Both law enforcement officials noted that ICE\u2019s field offices provide more training beyond what is provided at the academy or in the online course before officers are sent out onto the street and that the officers singled out by the AI tool most likely received that training. The officials weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly and spoke to NBC News on condition of anonymity.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The AI mistake was identified in mid-fall \u2014 over a month into the recruitment surge \u2014 and ICE immediately began taking steps to remedy the situation, including manual reviews of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of new hires, the officials said.",
      "\u201cThey now have to bring them back to FLETC,\u201d said one of the officials, referring to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.",
      "The AI tool was initially the mechanism used to categorize r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, the officials said. The officials weren\u2019t sure how many officers were improperly trained. It\u2019s also not clear how many may have been sent out to begin immigration arrests.",
      "As the immigration agency surges agents into American cities, their enforcement tactics are increasingly questioned by local law enforcement, community groups and lawmakers following the shooting death of Renee Nicole Good in Minneapolis by ICE officer Jonathan Ross.",
      "Ross had more than 10 years of experience with ICE and wouldn\u2019t have been subject to the AI screening for new recruits.",
      "The error highlights the challenge of training such a large number of new recruits as ICE continues to ramp up operations to boost deportation numbers amid pressure from the White House. ICE has also placed some new recruits into a training program before they completed the agency\u2019s vetting process, NBC News has reported.",
      "In Minneapolis alone, more than 2,000 ICE officers have been sent to the area to boost arrests, and they have apprehended over 2,400 people since Nov. 29, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said. Minnesota has sued to try to remove DHS.",
      "ICE had a mandate to hire 10,000 new officers by the end of 2025 and offered new recruits $50,000 signing bonuses using the money Congress allocated under the One Big Beautiful Bill. One of the officials said that although ICE met the goal on paper, bringing back people who were misidentified for more training means it didn\u2019t successfully add 10,000 ICE officers on the street in 2025."

      "Most visa holders face limits in what kind of public benefits they can receive. For example, most green card holders are subject to a five-year waiting period for food stamps, non-emergency Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP.)",
      "The suspension specifically applies to U.S. immigrant visas for foreigners seeking to live in the United States but not to short-term visas for those visiting as temporary workers, students or tourists, including World Cup-related visas.",

      "Iran has been largely shut off from the rest of the world for days, since its regime cut the internet and severely restricted phone access after cities across the country erupted in anger sparked by the crash of the currency against the U.S. dollar and soaring inflation. Videos that have trickled out and circulated online offer a window into the resulting crackdown in the Islamic Republic and the methods employed by security forces to quell the unrest.",
      "The images, circulated on social media this week and geolocated by NBC News, show more than 200 bodies piled in the makeshift morgue outside the capital, machine guns fired at crowds, and clashes in cities from Urmia in the northwest to Isfahan in the heart of the country.",
      "At least 2,500 people have been killed, according to the the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency. Authorities have not given an official death toll.",
      "Most tallies placed the number of protesters killed before the internet blackout Thursday at around 40, with rights groups and activists suggesting that Thursday and Friday nights saw the crackdown intensify into scenes not witnessed in the country for decades.",
      "Two videos from Tehran, which circulated online Monday, show the tactics employed by security forces.",
      "In one, a man wearing a helmet with a visor can be seen firing a machine gun at a crowd of people about 30 yards away across a square. The muzzle of the machine gun flares in the night as the man sprays automatic fire.",
      "In another, shots ring out near a police station as protesters can be heard chanting, \u201cDeath to Khamenei,\u201d a reference to the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the country. As the crowd chants largely out of sight, heavy automatic gunfire can be heard for 15 uninterrupted seconds.",
      "A group of security forces then comes into view from the right side of the screen and a member of the security forces aims and fires a pistol. A short while later, a person or body is dragged into the police station, though it is not clear who this person is. Several members of the security forces in riot gear on motorcycles then drive into the police station.",
      "About 5 miles south of the capital's southern suburbs, the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Center has offered perhaps the clearest sign of the crackdown's intensity.",
      "Videos from the site, which became a makeshift morgue, first circulated over the weekend. Two more separate videos, which appear to have been shot by one person, circulated Tuesday.",
      "Outside the warehouse, the man filming the scene at Kahrizak walks up to a woman in a lab coat with a black headscarf who is writing in a notebook next to a man's blood-soaked body. The body has been partially removed from a black body bag placed on dirt.",
      "A man in a black T-shirt and black pants wearing gloves holds the body on its side and positions the bloody head for the medical official to get a better glimpse at the wound.",
      "\u201cWas he hit in the head?\u201d the person filming asks. Another man nearby replies: \u201cYes.\u201d",
      "The same woman, whom one man calls doctor, walks up to the back of an ambulance and asks why a body is still in the vehicle.",
      "\u201cBecause there was no more space left on the ground,\u201d a man replies, his voice cracking. \u201cIt\u2019s a woman, it\u2019s my sister.\u201d",
      "Nearby, a man in a blue medical smock and orange gloves examines the head of a man\u2019s body that is stripped down to white underwear and pulled out of a black covering. \u201cThey hit him from behind,\u201d a man says, as another person nearby can be heard sobbing."

    "story": [
      "Some of our favorite reality stars, athletes, actors, and icons have come together to form the cast of Season 4 of \"The Traitors.\"",
      "The Peacock series, hosted by Alan Cumming (an Aquarius), premiered on January 8 and showcases celebrities such as Johnny Weir, Dorinda Medley, and Ron Funches, among others.",
      "Looking at the cast, it\u2019s important to note their zodiac signs to understand how they\u2019ll interact and play together. There are no Leos or Capricorns, but plenty of mutable signs (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces) to stir the pot. With Episodes 1 to 3 already aired, we are seeing major drama unfold.",
      "Read below to find out what zodiac sign is more likely to be a Traitor or Faithful.",
      "Aries",
      "Aries are driven to excel. Being that they are the first sign of the zodiac, they are full of bravado and gusto \u2014 so much so that the warrior sign won\u2019t stop until they peak to great heights. Aries will never allow themselves to be the sacrificial ram, making them a force to be reckoned with. They are born to conquer!",
      "Taurus",
      "Tauruses are great at gathering background information on the contestants, much like Carolyn Stanbury stated in Episode 1 of Season 4. However, that does not mean they\u2019re gossipy. The Bull likes to be in the know because it can manage the environment and be in tune with the energy that surrounds it without breaking a sweat, thereby defeating others.",
      "Gemini",
      "Geminis have a dualistic and duplicitous side to them, making them the perfect person to cause a ruckus on \u201cThe Traitors.\u201c The twin star might spill the tea, twist facts, and slip in some side eye to get their way \u2014 basically, the air sign will do anything to get their hands on the cash prize and the acclaim they crave.",
      "Cancer",
      "Cancers can be secretive at times, as their planetary ruler is the moon. Since their emotions change every few days from the lunar phases, they\u2019re tricky to read. You never know what you\u2019re going to get, which is why anyone who messes with a crab better watch out. Their pincers are no joke!",
      "Virgo",
      "Virgos are going to be methodical and authentic. Their approach to situations is based on what unfolds before their eyes. Then, they can assess and decide how they want to proceed, mindfully and cautiously. The earth sign may appear sweet and innocent, but its shadow side can be competitive and cutthroat \u2014 especially when it comes to money, acclaim and success.",
      "Libra",
      "Libras are fair-minded, meaning they will not veer from the rules unless they have to. While they put on a nice front, Libras can flirt with danger. If they are a Traitor or a Faithful, odds are that they\u2019ll be diplomatic in how they move forward on the show. Throughout the process, they\u2019ll have a smile on their faces.",
      "Scorpio",
      "Scorpio is a zodiac sign that knows how to plot and manipulate to get what they want and use information to their advantage. If anyone stands in their way, Scorpio\u2019s stingers come out. Those who are born under this sign assert their power and control situations with their authoritative and intense presence. One could say they would make the best Traitor!",
      "Sagittarius",
      "The archer is the only constellation that is both a protector and warrior \u2014 anyone who acts against them will have to watch their back. Sagittarius likes to have the last word, which means they aren\u2019t going anywhere without a fight or drama. The other contestants better beware! Lying might be hard, since they are known for their brutal honesty.",
      "Aquarius",
      "The air sign might play aloof, but they have their head in the game. Expect the Aquarian contestants to be low-key messy behind the scenes as they plot their strategy, but be nice to the faces of those who are their adversaries. They\u2019ll use their intellect and mindfulness to secure the bag. Watch out, because you\u2019ll never see them coming!",
      "Pisces",
      "Pisces is an intuitive sign that uses its sixth sense to rise above the rest. These players may have an inkling who their opponents are, but not proof. Plus, Pisces are great at deflecting energy. Their secretive nature allows them to trick others into trusting them, as they won\u2019t reveal any clues. Pisces can win based on a hunch or vibe.",

It attaches a price tag of more than half the Defense Department\u2019s annual budget to Trump\u2019s national security priority, which has stoked anxiety across Europe and on Capitol Hill amid his rhetoric about seizing Greenland since he ordered a U.S. military raid to capture Venezuela\u2019s president and his wife.",

Several members of the security forces in riot gear on motorcycles then drive into the police station.",
      "About 5 miles south of the capital's southern suburbs, the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Center has offered perhaps the clearest sign of the crackdown's intensity.",
      "Videos from the site, which became a makeshift morgue, first circulated over the weekend. Two more separate videos, which appear to have been shot by one person, circulated Tuesday.",
      "Outside the warehouse, the man filming the scene at Kahrizak walks up to a woman in a lab coat with a black headscarf who is writing in a notebook next to a man's blood-soaked body. The body has been partially removed from a black body bag placed on dirt.",

      "To hear President Donald Trump tell it, a push to take control of Greenland is a \u201cnational security\u201d necessity, critical to reinforcing control of the Arctic against possible threats from Russia and China.",
      "For America\u2019s allies and Greenlanders themselves, however, Trump\u2019s threats to seize the semi-autonomous Danish territory cut much deeper, and threaten to shatter the decades-old principle of Western defense cooperation.",
      "But there may be little they can do to stop it.",
      "\u201cThis is a threat that is completely appalling, to be honest,\u201d Aaja Chemnitz, one of two Greenlandic lawmakers in the Danish parliament, said in an interview Thursday. \u201cYou can\u2019t just buy another country, a people, the soul of Greenland,\u201d she added.",
      "\u201cEverybody in Greenland is discussing it, and many people are worried and concerned.\u201d",
      "That alarm is shared across European capitals.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron accused the United States on Thursday of \u201cbreaking free from the international rules that it used to promote,\u201d while German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier warned the world risked descending into a \u201cden of robbers, where the most unscrupulous take whatever they want.\u201d",
      "Though it looms artificially large on a Mercator projection map, where it is stretched to the scale of Africa despite being 14 times smaller in size, Greenland has rarely figured so prominently in mainstream Western consciousness.",
      "The vast island \u2014 around the size of Alaska and California combined \u2014 is inhabited by only 57,000 people, about the same as Carson City, Nevada. Around 90% of them are Indigenous Inuit people whose ancestors arrived more than 1,000 years ago.",
      "Denmark colonized Greenland 300 years ago and granted it the status of an autonomous territory in the 1970s, while retaining control of military and foreign policy.",
      "American designs on Greenland go back way further than Trump. In 1867, then-Secretary of State William H. Seward contemplated annexing Greenland, as well as Iceland, having recently bought Alaska from Russia.",
      "The United States briefly took control of Greenland during World War II to stop it from being used by the Nazis, and an agreement has existed since 1951 that allows the U.S. to \u201cconstruct, install, maintain, and operate\u201d military bases across the island.",
      "Greenland\u2019s sole U.S. military base was used as an early detection post for Soviet nuclear missiles during the Cold War, home to thousands of troops at its peak. Locked in by ice for nine months of the year, the Pituffik base is now overseen by the U.S. Space Force and houses a much smaller number of troops.",
      "When Trump first said he wanted to buy Greenland in 2019, in what he described as a \u201creal estate deal,\u201d it was widely seen internationally as absurd.",
      "But after years of pressure from Trump, and the U.S. attack on Venezuela, few in Europe are laughing.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet with the foreign ministers from Denmark and Greenland next week for further discussions, as officials push for a deal.",
      "But the White House says that all options are on the table, including military action. An attack by NATO\u2019s most powerful member on an ally would most likely implode the alliance, which for decades has upheld the principle of collective defense.",
      "\u201cWe are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not, because if we don\u2019t do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland, and we\u2019re not going to have Russia or China as a neighbor,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow Russia or China to occupy Greenland, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen if we don\u2019t own it,\u201d he said during the public portion of a meeting with oil and gas executives.",
      "European powers including Britain, France and Germany said in a joint statement this week they \u201cwill not stop defending\u201d the principles of territorial integrity, but most experts agree with White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller\u2019s blunt assessment that \u201cnobody\u2019s going to fight the U.S. over the future of Greenland.\u201d",
      "The European Union could impose sanctions on Washington, or limit its use of military bases in Europe, but both would be mutually painful in the extreme, said Mika Aaltola, a Finnish lawmaker who serves on the European Union\u2019s Foreign Affairs Committee.",
      "\u201cWe are basically in a trap that is difficult to resolve,\u201d Aaltola told NBC News.",
      "\u201cWe thought that January would be about peace deals or a cease-fire in Ukraine,\u201d he said, referring to diplomatic efforts between the U.S. and Europe to end that conflict. \u201cBut all of a sudden, we realized that Trump has manipulated us into a situation where he wants to have Greenland.\u201d",
      "Iain Duncan Smith, a veteran British lawmaker, said \u201cthe reality for Europe is they need to probably offer an alternative to the demand that Trump is making.\u201d",
      "There is bafflement alongside the dismay. Trump already has huge scope to build new military bases on Greenland or negotiate deals for its minerals, but he has refused to compromise on his demand for \u201cownership\u201d to be transferred.",
      "He said Friday: \u201cWhen we own it, we defend it. You don\u2019t defend leases the same way. You have to own it.\u201d",
      "Aside from being a good outpost from which to keep an eye on Russia, Greenland also forms one side of the \u201cGIUK gap\u201d (which stands for Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom), a naval choke point for submarines and other vessels in and out of the Atlantic.",
      "As the global ice sheet melts, new Arctic sea routes are emerging that Trump\u2019s team and other Western officials fear could be exploited by China and Russia.",
      "Beijing has certainly made moves in the region, declaring itself in 2019 to be a \u201cnear Arctic nation\u201d and outlining plans for a \u201cPolar silk road\u201d to mirror the infrastructure belt it has constructed on land.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt pointed to this motive Wednesday, saying U.S. ownership of Greenland was required \u201cto deter Russian and Chinese aggression in the Arctic region,\u201d though she said there would be \u201cmany other benefits.\u201d",
      "Vice President JD Vance cited Greenland\u2019s continued role in missile defense infrastructure in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, criticizing what he said was a lack of investment from Denmark and Europe that left it vulnerable to potential threats from \u201cthe Russians and the Chinese.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey haven\u2019t done a good job of securing that area, that land mass,\u201d he said.",

      "The retreating ice floes may also yield new opportunities to exploit its vast mineral reserves, a subject that has proven to be at the forefront of Trump\u2019s mind in negotiations over Ukraine and Venezuela.",
      "In 2023, the European Commission carried out a survey that found 25 of the 34 elements it classified as \u201ccritical raw materials\u201d were found on Greenland. These substances are crucial in producing everything from electric vehicle batteries to cutting-edge military hardware \u2014 vital currency in the global tech battle with China and others.",
      "Trump himself has denied minerals are a factor, positioning Greenland as a \u201cnational security\u201d issue, though some around him are eager to take advantage.",
      "\u201cThis is about critical minerals. This is about natural resources,\u201d then-congressman Mike Waltz, who would later become Trump\u2019s national security adviser, said last January.",
      "The reality is likely a mix of all these factors, according to William Alberque, former director of NATO\u2019s Arms Control, Disarmament and WMD Non-Proliferation Centre.",
      "\u201cGreenland is a toxic combination of issues in terms of this administration\u2019s interests,\u201d Alberque said. \u201cIt brings together the China hawks, the legitimate concerns about Atlantic security, the America Firsters and continental security, and let\u2019s not forget naked economic interests.\u201d"

      "All living hostages have been freed and almost all the bodies of dead hostages handed over. The body of hostage Ran Gvili, a 24-year-old police officer killed during the attack, has yet to be returned to Israel. Hamas has said it is still searching for his body.",

      "Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen told a press conference Wednesday that the closed-door meeting, attended by Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, was a \"frank but also constructive\" discussion and an opportunity to \"challenge the narrative presented by the American president.\"",
      "President Donald Trump has shown no sign of cooling his Arctic ambitions, vowing to take control of Greenland \u201cone way or the other,\u201d citing concerns it could be vulnerable to Russia or China. The White House has refused to rule out military action to seize Greenland from Denmark, alarming allies and rattling the NATO alliance.",
      "Rasmussen said a high-level working group would be formed and meet within weeks \"to explore if we can find a common way forward\" on security while respecting Denmark's red lines, referring to demands for U.S. ownership of the vast, semi-autonomous territory as \u201ctotally unacceptable.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhether that is doable, I don't know, but I hope it could take down the temperature,\u201d he added.",
      "Greenland\u2019s minister of foreign affairs, Vivian Motzfeldt, said strengthening cooperation \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean we want to be owned by the United States,\u201d adding: \u201cWe have shown where our limits are.\u201d",

      "He posted again to suggest that Russia and China could pose a threat to Greenland. \u201cTwo dogsleds won't do it!\u201d Trump wrote, referring disparagingly to its defense capabilities under Denmark.",
      "The U.S. already has a military base on Greenland, which has formed a core part of missile early-warning systems dating back to the Cold War. The base, which houses a tiny number of troops compared to thousands at its peak, was transferred to the U.S. Space Force in 2019, during the first Trump administration.",
      "The Danish Defense Ministry said earlier that it was expanding its \u201cmilitary presence in and around Greenland,\u201d with the presence comprised of \u201caircraft, vessels and soldiers, including from NATO allies.\u201d",
      "Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said that his country had sent troops to Greenland on Wednesday for a Danish-led exercise, Operation Arctic Endurance, at the request of Denmark.",

      "\u201cGreenland does not want to be owned by the USA. Greenland does not want to be governed by the USA. Greenland will not be part of the USA. We choose the Greenland we know today, which is part of the Kingdom of Denmark,\u201d he said in a news conference Tuesday with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen in Copenhagen.",
      "\u201cNow we are faced with a geopolitical crisis, and if we have to choose between the USA and Denmark here and now, we choose Denmark.\u201d",
      "Asked about Nielsen\u2019s remarks, Trump later told reporters: \u201cI don\u2019t know who he is. Don\u2019t know anything about him, but that\u2019s going to be a big problem for him.\u201d",
      "The president has repeatedly floated military action, insisting the mineral-rich island is strategically important for the U.S. despite warnings from European powers that this would implode NATO, the alliance of which both the U.S. and Denmark are members.",
      "If he instead tries to buy Greenland, the U.S. could have to pay as much as $700 billion, according to three people familiar with the cost estimate, though Denmark insists it is not for sale.",
      "A new poll found that just 17% of Americans approve of Trump\u2019s efforts to acquire Greenland. Nearly half of respondents disapproved, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll released Wednesday, while 35% said they were unsure.",
      "Europeans have been scrambling to prove to Trump that they can address his security concerns and bolster the Arctic's defense, including a possible NATO operation in the high north.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said later that he did not underestimate Trump\u2019s threats, warning \u201cthe knock-on effects would be unprecedented\u201d if the sovereignty of a European ally were to be affected.",

    "summary": "The United Kingdom\u2019s online safety regulator announced Monday it was formally investigating X.",
    "story": [
      "The United Kingdom\u2019s online safety regulator announced Monday it was formally investigating X over concerns that Grok had been \u201cused to create and share undressed images of people,\u201d including children.",
      "The agency, Ofcom, said it was carrying out an \u201cexpedited assessment\u201d and that X had responded to its requests for information on Friday. If Ofcom finds that X violated U.K. law, it can institute penalties ranging from sanctions of 10% of its global revenue, prohibiting British companies from advertising with X, or directing the country\u2019s internet providers to block the platform.",
      "The U.K. investigation is just one of the actions taken by governments around the world in response to Grok\u2019s deepfake abilities.",
      "Over the weekend, regulators in Indonesia and Malaysia announced they had temporarily blocked X in their countries, citing their laws against deepfakes and child sexual abuse material (CSAM).",
      "Mary Anne Franks, a George Washington University law professor who studies laws on nonconsensual pornography and has helped both state and federal legislators craft laws on the topic, said she does not expect the U.S. federal government to step in. But threats from other countries with stricter CSAM laws may force X and Musk to rein Grok in, she said.",
      "\u201cIf there is some slowdown, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s because of the backlash, and then separately, because these other countries have different definitions of what constitutes illegal CSAM,\u201d Franks said.",
      "Last week, after being prompted by users, Grok began creating thousands of sexualized AI-generated images every hour using the faces of real people and posting them on X, according to an analysis conducted by deepfake researcher Genevieve Oh. Many of the deepfakes depicted identifiable women who were placed in bathing suits or revealing poses by artificial intelligence; but Grok also depicted some people, including some children, according to some watchdogs, as fully nude.",
      "A spokesperson for the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, told NBC News that the agency has recently observed Grok generating sexualized images of children.",
      "On Friday, Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, a government agency dedicated to online safety, said it had received several reports of Grok creating exploitative images and had asked X to clarify its safeguards, noting that it could issue removal notices to X. Both Australia\u2019s Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, and the opposition leader, Sussan Ley, condemned the images on Saturday.",
      "Musk and X did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk and X recently posted that they prohibit users from making \u201cillegal content,\u201d but have refrained from publicly indicating that they would substantially change Grok\u2019s ability to manipulate and sexualize images of people. The creation and possession of CSAM are widely illegal around the world, but many countries also have laws restricting or prohibiting the creation of sexualized images of adult people without their consent, known as nonconsensual pornography.",
      "Early Friday, X made the Grok reply bot, which was driving the deepfake trend, a premium feature for paying subscribers, though users could still produce the deepfakes using the Grok stand-alone app in addition to other interfaces where Grok was available. While the number of such images posted to X appears to have slowed, critics like Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., have said the move is tantamount to making \u201csome of its users pay for the privilege of producing horrific images on the X app.\u201d",
      "Ofcom said its investigation would focus on whether X has been following U.K. law by quickly taking down illegal content as it became aware of it, and whether it was carrying out successful risk assessments before making \u201csignificant changes to their service.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a radio interview that Ofcom \u201chas our full support to take action.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is disgraceful. It\u2019s disgusting. And it\u2019s not to be tolerated,\u201d he said of the image creation. \u201cX has got to get a grip of this.\u201d",
      "India\u2019s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, MeitY, also reportedly warned X last week that it was potentially violating its laws. MeitY didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "It remains unclear if any U.S. regulators will take on Musk and his companies over the manipulated images. The Federal Trade Commission did not respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department told NBC News last week that it was committed to holding \u201cindividuals who exploit technology to harm our most vulnerable\u201d accountable but didn\u2019t mention specific companies.",
      "A number of state attorneys general have declined to comment to NBC News on whether they are considering charges over the images.",
      "Musk has broadly pushed for X and his AI company that powers Grok, xAI, to be laxer on content moderation than most of their competitors. On Friday, he posted on X that reports of the U.K.\u2019s Labour Party wanting to potentially block X over the Grok images were evidence that \u201cThey want any excuse for censorship.\u201d",
      "Thomas Regnier, a spokesperson for the European Commission, said at a news conference Monday that it has given Musk and X an ultimatum to stop the production of CSAM, but stopped short of mentioning any specific penalties.",
      "\u201cDrawing a parallel between freedom of speech and an AI tool that generates child sexual abuse material is dangerous nonsense, especially when it comes from the owner of a tech company. Frankly speaking I cannot even believe we are speaking about this and engaging with this from the commission\u2019s podium in 2026,\u201d Regnier said.",
      "In December, the European Commission fined X $140 million, saying that the platform broke Europe\u2019s laws against hate speech and misinformation. That prompted criticism from the Trump administration, with both Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio calling it an attack on American free speech."
