      "Women folk singers are preserving one of Morocco's most cherished culturual traditions, a genre of folk singing known as aita",
      "SIDI YAHYA ZAER, Morocco -- Mbarka Moullablad\u2019s family frowned when she first told them she planned to make a living as a cheikha, singing about love, pain, and societal change to the melodies of her ancestors under the stage name \u201cThouria.\u201d",
      "Women like her are the stewards of one of Morocco\u2019s most cherished oral traditions: a form of folk singing known as aita, which means a \u201ccry\u201d or \u201clament\u201d in Arabic. From smoky bars and cabarets in Morocco\u2019s largest cities to the gatherings in the country\u2019s rural regions, they croon at weddings, festivals and private events and pub nights, hypnotizing audiences both humble and wealthy.",
      "But despite aita's position in Moroccan culture, the genre\u2019s popularity does not always translate into acceptance for those who perform it. Cheikha are often stigmatized, eroticized, and pushed to society\u2019s margins. That was once a fear for Moullablad, but she says her community in Sidi Yahya Zaer, a farming town on Morocco\u2019s Atlantic plains, has mostly accepted her.",
      "\u201cMy family did not agree at first and I used to suffer from society\u2019s judgment, but now everything is good,\u201d Moullablad said on the sidelines of a recent performance south of Morocco\u2019s capital, Rabat. \u201cI do it in order to earn money for my children.\u201d",
      "A form of sung poetry, aita has long explored themes of societal triumphs, ironies, and unspoken struggles, including those related to relationships and economic hardship. Cheikha don heavy stage makeup, silk caftans, and golden takchita belts as they sing about their community's agonies and triumphs. They sway their hips to amplify emotion, dancing seductively or cheerfully depending on the context.",
      "When Moullablad performs, men and women lean in as her voice softens, captivated as she climbs octaves into a full-throated howl. The beads wrapped around her sister Fatiha\u2019s belly shake as she dances. The band leader, another singer, backs her with his own poetry while a drummer keeps the beat, a guitarist strums, and a violinist drags his bow in sync.",
      "Those who come to hear them sing say cheikha can serve as a community's truth-tellers, singing about often unspoken dynamics related to marriage, agriculture or, historically, colonial resistance. Moullablad sings in Moroccan Arabic, embodying traditions specific to her community. But cheikha across the North African Kingdom also perform in the indigenous Amazigh language, adapting the music and lyrics to reflect their region.",
      "The art form has inspired contemporary acts like the electro-infused \u201cAita, Mon Amour\u201d and Kabareh Cheikhats, a troupe of male actors who pay homage, dress and sing in the tune of Morocco's most celebrated 20th century women folk singers. It is also the subject of Morocco\u2019s submission for this year\u2019s Academy Awards, \u201cEverybody Loves Touda,\u201d which follows a single mother who leaves her town in the Atlas Mountains to pursue her dream of singing in bars, cabarets, and hotels in Casablanca.",
      "\u201cI was always amazed by their strength and the power that they have toward people when they open their mouths. Whether they are modern or conservative people, they all stand up and get into a kind of trance like gospel,\u201d Nabil Ayouch, the film\u2019s director, said in an interview when the film premiered at the Marrakech Film Festival last year.",
      "Morocco\u2019s music scene is increasingly embracing Middle Eastern pop and rap by North African artists from throughout the diaspora. And rural communities are shrinking amid the country's rapid development and urbanization. But though the future of aita may seem uncertain, its musicians and listeners remain confident that it will endure.",
      "\u201cAita will not die because it is renewed by young people. Aita will remain in all times and is loved by old people and young people as well. It is developed and improved, but they preserve its origins,\u201d said Rachid Kadari, a Cheikh who also sings aita."

      "Beyonc\u00e9 winning the trophy for album of the year was the highlight of the Grammy Awards on Sunday, but there were plenty of other key moments",
      "All eyes at the Grammy Awards were on whether the most-nominated artist in the history of the telecast would finally walk away with the coveted album of the year trophy. She did. \u201cWe finally saw it happen,\u201d host Trevor Noah said, almost in relief.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 winning for \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d capped a night that turned into a tribute to a suffering Los Angeles, with city firefighters chosen to reveal the winner of the last award and speeches offering words of encouragement for communities devastated. The Grammys almost veered into a telethon; $7 million was pledged from viewers of the show.",
      "It was also a telecast where the best new artist nominees like Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter were given plenty of time to show why there's a deep well of talent coming up. And there was a shock return for The Weeknd, who had been boycotting the Grammys.",
      "Here are some of the night\u2019s notable moments:",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 and Lady Gaga were right there, as were Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish, but the honor of opening the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles was given to two local brothers deeply affected by the wildfires: Taylor and Griffin Goldsmith of the band Dawes.",
      "They lost one brother\u2019s home along with their childhood home, instruments and much else. They've advocated for victims, raised money and were included in the FireAid benefit concert on Thursday.",
      "\u201cThey truly epitomize the unique spirit that we are seeing in LA right now,\u201d host Trevor Noah said. \u201cWhat better way to start the Grammy Awards?\u201d",
      "Dawes then played Randy Newman's \u201cI Love L.A.\u201d surrounded by an all-star backing band: John Legend, Brad Paisley, Sheryl Crow, Brittany Howard and St. Vincent.",
      "\u201cLook at these firefighters, ain\u2019t nothin like \u2018em nowhere,\u201d Taylor Goldsmith sang, altering the line: \u201cLook at these women/There ain\u2019t nothing like \u2019em nowhere.\u201d",
      "Doechii won the Grammy for best rap album, only the third woman to win in that category. And, with her mother by her side, she had a strong message for young Black girls.",
      "\u201cI know that there's some Black girl out there, so many Black women out there, that are watching me right now, and I want to tell you: You can do it. Anything is possible. Anything is possible,\u201d she said.",
      "\"Don\u2019t allow anybody to project any stereotypes on you, to tell you that you can\u2019t be here, that you\u2019re too dark, or that you\u2019re not smart enough, or that you\u2019re too dramatic, or you\u2019re too loud. You are exactly who you need to be to be right where you are, and I am a testimony right now. Good night!\u201d",
      "The win caps an astounding few years for the 26-year-old Floridian who mixes R&B, hip-hop, jazz, boundary-pushing sounds and samples, and adds theatricality. She playfully calls herself the \u201cswamp princess.\u201d",
      "Her 2024 mixtape, \u201dAlligator Bites Never Heal\u2033 went to No. 33 on the Billboard 200, No. 9 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop chart and No. 8 on the Top Rap Album chart.",
      "Her Grammy performance of \u201cCatfish\u201d and \u201cDenial Is a River\u201d was electric, with the singer-songwriter backed by over a dozen dancers in matching Thom Browne suits and she eventually stripped down to a white two-piece set.",
      "Chappell Roan was crowned best new artist and then used her speech to demand change in the music business.",
      "\u201cI told myself that if I ever won a Grammy and got to stand up here before the most powerful people in music, I would demand that labels in the industry profiting millions of dollars off of artists would offer a livable wage and health care, especially to developing artists,\u201d she said.",
      "Roan began her music career in 2015 when she signed with Atlantic Records, releasing several singles including \u201cPink Pony Club.\u201d In 2020, the label dropped her. She moved back to her hometown to work as a barista before releasing her debut full-length album.",
      "\u201cIt was devastating to feel so committed to my art and feel so betrayed by the system and dehumanized,\u201d Roan said in her speech. \u201cRecord labels need to treat their artists as valuable employees with a livable wage and health insurance and protection.\u201d",
      "Earlier, Roan performed a rocking version of her \u201cPink Pony Club,\u201d joined by a posse of dancing clown cowboys as she sang from atop a giant pink horse.",
      "Lady Gaga, accepting the trophy for best pop duo or group alongside Bruno Mars for their chart-topping collab, \u201cDie with a Smile,\u201d gave a shout-out to the trans community, targets of President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cTrans people are not invisible. Trans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up. Music is love,\" Lady Gaga said.",
      "Not long after, Alicia Keys, being honored with The Dr. Dre Global Impact Award, also backed diversity and inclusion programs, another Trump target.",
      "\u201cThis is not the time to shut down the diversity of voices,\u201d said Keys. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen on this stage talented, hardworking people from different backgrounds with different points of view, and it changes the game. DEI is not a threat, it\u2019s a gift.\u201d",
      "The Grammy Awards had a powerful way to prove that they've changed. They got a surprise endorsement by The Weeknd, who was last on the Grammy stage in 2017.",
      "The pop superstar in 2020 slammed the Grammys, calling them \u201ccorrupt\u201d after he landed zero nominations despite a megahit album. \u201cYou owe me, my fans and the industry transparency,\" he wrote on social media.",
      "Grammys CEO Harvey Mason jr., who started in his post in 2020, on Sunday said he understood the criticism and listed all the things the Academy has done to fix it.",
      "\u201cWe have completely re-made our membership, adding more than 3,000 women voting members. The Grammy electorate is now younger, nearly 40% people of color, and 66% of our members are new since we started our transformation,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the past few years, we have listened, we\u2019ve acted and we\u2019ve changed.\u201d",
      "Mason then introduced The Weeknd, who performed two tunes from his just-released album \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow\u201d \u2014 \u201cCry For Me\u201d and \u201cTimeless\u201d with special guest Playboi Carti. He wore a long druid's robe and the stage was smoky.",
      "Will Smith, hosting a tribute to the late Quincy Jones, marked his first appearance at a major awards show since since he slapped Chris Rock onstage at the Oscars in 2022.",
      "\u201cIn his 91 years, Q touched countless lives, but I have to say, he changed mine forever. You probably wouldn\u2019t even know who Will Smith was if it wasn\u2019t for Quincy Jones,\" Smith said.",
      "Smith has been banned from film academy ceremonies for 10 years but the Grammys are a different beast. He made no mention of the infamous Slap.",
      "Smith has previously nabbed Grammy wins in the short form music video (\u201cWill 2K\u201d), best rap solo performance (\u201cGetting\u2019 Jiggy Wit It,\u201d \u201cMen in Black\u201d), and best rap performance by a duo or group (\u201cSummertime\u201d as the Fresh Prince with DJ Jazzy Jeff).",

      "A woman from New Zealand says in lawsuits that British author Neil Gaiman sexually assaulted her repeatedly when she worked as a babysitter and nanny for him and his wife",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- A woman from New Zealand has filed three civil lawsuits against best-selling British author Neil Gaiman and his wife, accusing Gaiman of repeatedly sexually assaulting her while she was working as the couple's babysitter and nanny.",
      "Scarlett Pavlovich filed the lawsuits in federal court in Wisconsin, Massachusetts and New York on Monday.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they publicly identify themselves. Pavlovich identified herself in an interview with New York Magazine, which published an article in January detailing allegations of assault, abuse and coercion leveled by eight women.",
      "Pavlovich alleges in the lawsuits that she was homeless and living on a beach when she met Palmer in Auckland, New Zealand, in 2020. Pavlovich was 22 years old at the time.",
      "According to the lawsuits, Gaiman's wife, Amanda Palmer, invited Pavlovich to the couple's home on Waiheke Island. Pavlovich began running errands for the couple, babysitting their son and helping with chores, eventually becoming the couple's nanny.",
      "Gaiman first sexually assaulted her the night they met in February 2022, according to the lawsuits. The assaults continued but she kept working for the couple because she was broke and homeless and Gaiman had told her he would help her writing career, according to the lawsuits.",
      "When she told Palmer about the assaults, Palmer told her that more than a dozen women had told her in the past that Gaiman had sexually abused them, according to the lawsuits.",
      "The assaults didn't stop until Pavlovich told Palmer she was going to kill herself, the lawsuits said. She left the family and became homeless again, although the documents say Gaiman eventually paid her for her work caring for the couple's child and helped cover her rent for a few months.",
      "Palmer knew of Gaiman's sexual desires and presented Pavalovich to him knowing he would assault her, according the lawsuits. Pavlovich alleges Gaiman and Palmer violated federal human trafficking prohibitions and seeks at least $7 million in damages.",
      "After the New York Magazine article was published, Gaiman released a statement in January denying he had ever engaged in non-consensual sex. The allegations of four of the women were previously broadcast in July in a Tortoise Media podcast.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever,\u201d Gaiman posted on the social media platform Tumblr.",
      "Representatives for Gaiman and Palmer did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday and online court records did not list attorneys representing them in the suits. Pavlovich\u2019s attorneys stated in the filings that Gaiman, author of such bestsellers as \u201cCoraline\u201d and \u201cThe Sandman\u201d series, is a resident of Menomonie, Wisconsin. But they\u2019re unsure if Palmer resides in Massachusetts or New York.",
      "Pavlovich told New York Magazine that she filed a police report in January 2023 accusing Gaiman of sexual assault. Police have not confirmed whether Gaiman was ever under investigation.",
      "Gaiman has worked with numerous publishers over the years. Two of them, HarperCollins and W.W. Norton, have said they have no plans to release his books in the future. Others, including Bloomsbury, have so far declined comment.",
      "Dark Horse Comics announced in January that it would no longer release its illustrated series based on Gaiman's novel, \u201cAnansi Boys.\u201d The seventh of eight editions was released earlier that month.",
      "Disney has paused a planned adaptation of Gaiman\u2019s \u201cThe Graveyard Book,\u201d while Netflix is still scheduled to release a second season based on \u201cThe Sandman.\u201d"

      "Rihanna, the superstar singer who is Rocky\u2019s longtime partner and the mother of his two toddler sons, was not in the courtroom after being in the audience to support him for the trial\u2019s previous three days.",
      "Rocky has pleaded not guilty to two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, charges that with a conviction carry a maximum penalty of 24 years in prison.",
      "A day earlier, the hip-hop star was up a Grammy Award for the third time at a ceremony just two miles away, but lost to one of the night\u2019s big winners, Kendrick Lamar.",
      "Relli who first took the stand on Wednesday, had been often evasive and just as often angry under cross-examination from Rocky's lawyer.",
      "That came to a head Monday as the defense got a chance to ask its last set of questions before he was excused.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not on trial. I\u2019ve been here for five days, dealing with this man,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking stupid for five days.\u201d",

      "Last week, Relli had angrily declared that recordings of phone calls the defense played for him about getting money from Rocky were faked. Defense lawyers contend the only reason Relli went to police about the incident was so he could extract money from Rocky in the civil case he has also filed.",
      "On Monday, the man who recorded those calls, Wally Sajimi, took the stand as an out-of-order witness for the defense, and the jurors heard the recordings themselves.",
      "In one of them, a voice resembling Relli's says he'll stop participating in the criminal case as soon as he gets paid.",
      "\u201cOnce I walk away, when I get my cash, the case will get way weaker,\" says the recording that Sajimi testified he made in 2022. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard for the DA to find me. Because I\u2019m going to be on another island.\u201d",
      "Sajimi testified that he builds websites for artists and brands, and has worked with both Rocky and Relli, but said he is much closer to Rocky, who he considers a friend."

      "A Paris court has found a filmmaker guilty of sexual assault on French actor Ad\u00e8le Haenel when she was between 12 and 15 in the early 2000s, in the country\u2019s first big #MeToo trial",
      "PARIS -- A Paris court found a filmmaker guilty of sexual assault on French actor Ad\u00e8le Haenel when she was between 12 and 15 in the early 2000s, in the country\u2019s first big #MeToo trial.",
      "Filmmaker Christophe Ruggia was sentenced Monday to two years under house arrest with an electronic bracelet plus a two-year suspended sentence. Ruggia had denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Haenel, now 35, was the first top actor in France to accuse the film industry of turning a blind eye to sexual abuse after the #MeToo movement broke out. In 2019, she accused Ruggia of having repeatedly touched her inappropriately during and after filming of the movie \u201cLes Diables,\u201d or \u201cThe Devils,\u201d in the early 2000s.",
      "Haenel appeared relieved, breathing deeply, as Monday's verdict was being released. She was applauded by some women\u2019s rights activists as she left the courtroom.",
      "The court ruled that Ruggia \u201ctook advantage of the dominant position\u201d he had on Haenel at the time. \u201cDuring quasi-weekly meetings at your home for over three years you had sexualized gestures and attitudes,\u201d as Haenel was \u201cgradually isolated\u201d from her loved ones, the court said in a statement.",
      "Ruggia's lawyer said her client would appeal.",
      "He \u201cmaintains that he has never touched Ad\u00e8le Haenel,\u201d the lawyer, Fanny Colin, said. \u201cSentenced in these conditions and on the sole basis of her words seems to us not only unjustified but dangerous.\u201d",
      "Haenel, star of the 2019 Cannes entry \u201cPortrait of a Lady on Fire,\u201d has in recent years vocally protested what she\u2019s called an insufficient response to sexual abuse in French filmmaking.",
      "At the C\u00e9sar Awards in 2020, she walked out of the ceremony after Roman Polanski won best director. Polanski is still wanted in the United States decades after he was charged with raping a 13-year-old girl in 1977.",
      "In 2023, Haenel, announced she was quitting the French film industry that she denounced for \u201ccomplacency toward sexual aggressors.\u201d She published an open letter in which she said Cannes and other pillars of the French film industry are \u201cready to do anything to defend their rapist chiefs.\u201d",
      "While #MeToo initially struggled to find traction in France, some other actors and film industry workers have since spoken out.",
      "French renowned actor Judith Godr\u00e8che attended Monday\u2019s verdict at the Paris courthouse. \u201cIt was a very moving and a very important moment that reminded me of things that, in my case, may go unpunished,\u201d she told reporters with tears in her eyes.",
      "Last year, Godr\u00e8che accused film director Beno\u00eet Jacquot of having raped and physically abused her in a six-year relationship that began when she was 14 years old. Jacquot, who has more than 50 director credits in film and television, was handed preliminary charges of rape, sexual assault and violence in July 2024.",
      "Godr\u00e8che is also accusing another film director, Jacques Doillon, of sexual abuse while he was directing a film when she was 15.",
      "Both Jacquot and Doillon have denied the allegations.",
      "In a separate case, French actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu is to go on trial in March on charges of sexually assaulting two women on a film set.",
      "Depardieu, who has denied any wrongdoing, is accused of using \u201cviolence, coercion, surprise or threat\u201d in the alleged sexual assaults that prosecutors say took place in 2021 on the set of \u201cLes Volets verts,\u201d or \"The Green Shutters.\u201d"

      "Punxsutawney Phil\u2019s team of top-hatted associates will issue the woodchuck\u2019s weather verdict as the sun rises",
      "Punxsutawney Phil's team of top-hatted associates will issue the woodchuck's weather verdict as the sun rises on Sunday, telling the world whether he is predicting wintry conditions for the next six weeks or the relief of an early spring.",
      "The annual ritual goes back more than a century in western Pennsylvania, with far older roots in European folklore, but it took Bill Murray's 1993 movie to transform it into what it is today, with tens of thousands of revelers at the scene and imitators scattered around the United States and beyond.",
      "Last year's crowd may have been a record and organizers are bracing for a similar turnout on Sunday.",
      "If the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club members declare Phil did not see his shadow, that is said to usher in an early spring. If he does see it, it's six more weeks of winter, although what that means can be subjective.",
      "Phil has predicted a longer winter far more often than an early spring, and one effort to track his accuracy concluded he was right less than half the time.",
      "Tom Dunkel, president of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, says there are two types of people who make the trek to Gobbler's Knob: the faithful seeking to validate their beliefs and the doubters who want to confirm their skepticism.",
      "Phil communicates his forecast through \u201cGroundhog-ese\u201d with the help of a special cane that Dunkel has inherited as the club's leader. It's not as if he speaks in English words.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll like wink, he\u2019ll purr, he\u2019ll chatter, he\u2019ll \u2014 you know \u2014 nod,\u201d Dunkel said.",
      "Attendance is free but it costs $5 to take a bus and avoid a 1 mile (1.6 kilometer) trek from the middle of town to the stage where the prediction is made, some 80 miles (123 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh. The need for so many buses is why the local schools, where the sports mascot is the Chucks, close when Groundhog Day falls on a weekday.",
      "A new welcome center opened four years ago and the club is working on an elaborate second living space for Phil and family so they can split time between Gobbler's Knob and Phil's longtime home at the town library. The club also is putting up large video screens and more powerful speakers this year to help attendees in the back of the crowd follow the proceedings.",
      "\"It\u2019s a holiday where you don\u2019t really owe anyone anything,\u201d said A.J. Dereume, who among the club's 15-member inner circle serves as Phil's handler. \u201cYou\u2019re grasping onto the belief, you know, in something that\u2019s just fun to believe in.\u201d",
      "Phil has a wife, Punxsutawney Phyllis, and two pups born this spring, Shadow and Sunny, although his family won't join him on stage for the big event. The groundhog family eats fruits and vegetables, get daily visits from Dereume and see a veterinarian at least once a year.",
      "The club's lore is that Phil is the same woodchuck who has been issuing weather forecasts for the past century, thanks to an \u201celixir of life\u201d that keeps him immortal.",
      "\u201cThere's only one Phil, and it's not something that can be handed down,\u201d Dunkel said. \u201cJust like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, there's only one.\u201d",
      "Groundhog Day celebrations, formal and informal, are being held in many Pennsylvania towns and elsewhere on Sunday. There have been Groundhog Day events in at least 28 U.S. states and Canadian provinces."

Max Walker-Silverman\u2019s \u201cRebuilding,\u201d starring Josh O\u2019Connor as a cowboy who loses his ranch in a wildfire and forms a community with fellow survivors in a FEMA camp, hit close to home for many.",
      "Filmmakers Meena Menon and Paul Gleason lost their home in Altadena where they filmed some of their zombie apocalypse movie \u201cDidn\u2019t Die.\u201d Sundance artist labs head Michelle Satter lost her Palisades home as well. Satter had an audience of Sundance Institute donors in tears early in the festival while accepting an honor at a fundraising gala.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a deeply devastating time for us and so many others, a moment that calls for all of us coming together to support our bigger community,\u201d Satter said. \u201cAs a friend recently noted, and I have to listen to this, \u2018Take a deep breath ... We lost our village, but at the end of the day we are the village.\u2019\u201d",
      "It was a topic bound to come up in nearly every conversation: The festival\u2019s new home in 2027. \u201cWhere do you think it will go? How do you feel about it leaving Park City? What would Sundance in Ohio even look like?\u201d No one had any answers, but everyone had an opinion about the fact that next year will be the last year in which the center of activity is in Park City. Sundance Institute leadership has narrowed the finalist cities to Salt Lake City, Utah, Boulder, Colorado, and Cincinnati, Ohio, and is expected to announce the winner before spring.",
      "Actor Tessa Thompson, who serves on the institute\u2019s board, was hopeful about a new city.",
      "\u201cI think that Sundance has more to do with the spirit and community, and I think that\u2019s evergreen,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cRegardless of where Sundance is, Sundance will always be.\u201d",
      "In the early days of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s second administration, politics were also a main topic of private discussions at least. Several films (mostly documentaries) had direct relevance to recent news, like \u201cHeightened Scrutiny,\u201d about transgender lawyer Chase Strangio and the media coverage of transgender issues amid a pending Supreme Court case.",
      "Even \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman\u201d filmmaker Bill Condon quoted Trump\u2019s \u201ctwo genders\u201d mandate before his film screened.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a sentiment I think you\u2019ll see that the movie has a different point of view on,\u201d Condon said.",
      "There also wasn\u2019t the spirit of public protest that was unavoidable eight years ago when Trump first took office, when A-listers took to the streets to march for women's rights. But audiences at Q&As for films like \u201cThe Alabama Solution,\u201d about the abusive Alabama prison systems which the AP has reported extensively on, were curious how they could help change things.",
      "There have been essentially two major deals out of the festival so far: Netflix took \u201cTrain Dreams,\u201d Clint Bentley\u2019s lyrical Denis Johnson adaptation, with Joel Edgerton and Felicity Jones, and Neon acquired the Dave Franco and Alison Brie relationship body horror \u201cTogether.\u201d",
      "As always, some films came in with distribution in place: Focus Features with \u201cThe Ballad of Wallis Island\u201d; A24 with \u201cIf I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You,\u201d \u201cOpus,\u201d and \u201cThe Legend of Ochi\u201d; Bleecker Street with \u201cThe Wedding Banquet\u201d; Nat Geo with the Sally Ride documentary \u201cSally\u201d; MUBI with \u201cMagic Farm\u201d; and Apple with \u201cDeaf President Now!\u201d; HBO Documentary Films with \u201cThe Alabama Solution\u201d and \u201cEnigma.\u201d",
      "Most deals happen after the festival ends, but there have been private grumblings that the market this year was weaker than usual, and the films were not commercial enough. Several insiders singled out Condon\u2019s adaptation of \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman\u201d with Jennifer Lopez as being too expensive for anyone but a streaming service. But there are also plenty of deals in the works, some of which will be finalized soon, while others may be settled at the Berlin Film Festival market.",
      "As festival programmers like to say, Sundance isn\u2019t the end of the story for new films \u2014 it\u2019s just the beginning. Last year\u2019s program had over 100 films distributed to audiences through traditional means, and only a small fraction of those were announced during the festival.",
      "Perhaps the biggest discovery of the festival is \u201cSorry, Baby,\u201d from writer-director-star Eva Victor in her feature debut. This funny and quietly piercing film is about Agnes, who was sexually assaulted by her thesis advisor. Instead of making it about depicting the incident itself (Victor keeps the camera firmly planted outside of the home where it occurs, showing the passage of time through light), Victor, who could be the next Greta Gerwig and/or Phoebe Waller-Bridge, stays focused on how it affects Anges.",
      "Filmmaker James Sweeney also scored a big win with \u201cTwinless,\u201d which picked up the U.S. dramatic audience prize and a special award for his star Dylan O\u2019Brien. The movie is about a bromance between two men in a twin bereavement group.",
      "On the documentary side there was much chatter about \u201cAndr\u00e9 Is an Idiot,\u201d a documentary about a \u201cbrilliant idiot\u201d who is dying because he didn\u2019t get a colonoscopy and trying to live out his final days happily.",
      "The in-person experience at Sundance is also a good reminder that reviews are only part of the equation when it comes to judging the response to a film. Hailey Gates\u2019 war satire \u201cAtropia\u201d got mixed reviews from critics, but premiere audiences were very enthusiastic (as was the U.S. dramatic jury who gave it the festival\u2019s top prize ).",
      "As of publication, all are still seeking distribution.",
      "Others that played notably well with audiences and critics include: \u201cIf I Had Legs I'd Kick You,\u201d \u201cDJ Ahmet,\u201d \u201cCactus Pears,\u201d \"2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d \u201cPlainclothes,\u201d \u201cRicky,\u201d \u201cPrime Minister,\u201d \u201cSelena y Los Dinos,\u201d \u201cThe Stringer,\u201d\u201cSLY LIVES!,\u201d \u201cThe Alabama Solution,\u201d \u201cPredators,\u201d \u201cEast of Wall,\u201d \u201cFolktales,\u201d \u201cFree Leonard Peltier,\u201d \u201cPeter Hujar\u2019s Day,\u201d \u201cThe Ballad of Wallis Island\u201d and \u201cTrain Dreams.\u201d",

She directed her attention to major labels and the music industry, instructing them to \u201coffer a living wage and healthcare, especially to developing artists.\u201d Then she described getting signed as a minor, getting dropped and entering the workforce during COVID-19 with no work experience and no health care.

      "There have been plenty of out-of-the-ordinary moments at the ongoing trial of rapper A$AP Rocky",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The trial of rapper A$AP Rocky is progressing according to standard legal procedure, but there have been no lack of unusual moments, from visits from Rihanna to a tough-but-quirky judge and lawyers nearly coming to blows.",
      "Testimony is expected to last another week before jurors will decide Rocky's fate on two counts of assault with a semi-automatic firearm. A conviction could lead to up to 24 years in prison for the hip-hop star.",
      "Here are some of the out-of-the-ordinary moments from the first two weeks of the trial, most not captured by the cameras in the courtroom.",
      "From the moment it became clear the case was going to trial, nearly everyone involved was asking the same thing: What about Rihanna?",
      "Editors asked it of reporters, who asked it of lawyers. Even Judge Mark Arnold asked it months ago at a hearing: \u201cWill the mother of his children be there?\u201d",
      "Her name came up constantly during jury selection, when prospective panelists were asked whether her attendance would affect their judgment.",
      "Yet when the singing superstar finally did show up, she was easy to miss.",
      "She didn't appear through the first week, but rumors abounded Wednesday that she might appear, on a short court day with important testimony. Yet there was no sign of her outside or in the halls. (Unlike a nearby civil courthouse, where celebrities like Britney Spears and the Kardashians are smuggled in, Rocky and other defendants must use public entrances and many thought she'd accompany him.)",
      "When the media were allowed in the courtroom, many reporters walked past her without noticing she was already sitting inconspicuously between Rocky's mother and sister. She had been brought in through restricted entrances. She could barely be seen from the media section, and the camera capturing the trial is not allowed to shoot the audience.",
      "Her presence caused a quiet stir once the audience realized it, though it's not clear if the jurors had noticed her.",
      "She appeared again the next day, and it soon felt almost unexceptional that she was there. By Friday, she slipped in about 30 minutes into testimony after coming through a public entrance.",
      "Later that day she entered the courtroom together with Rocky for the first time, down a hallway full of jurors from his and other cases that was abuzz.",
      "Court observers knew that when Deputy District Attorney John Lewin joined the prosecution shortly before trial, that he and Rocky's equally bullish and vocal attorney, Joe Tacopina, were sure to butt heads. They weren't wrong.",
      "Lewin, a dogged prosecutor, is best known for his successful murder prosecution of real estate heir Robert Durst. Tacopina is a New York attorney and frequent TV commentator whose clients have included President Donald Trump.",
      "Their shouting matches began quickly. Soon, without judge or jury present, the two had to be separated by a fellow lawyer when they went nose-to-nose in a faceoff that looked like it might become a fistfight.",
      "\u201cMr. Tacopina started literally screaming at me in the courtroom. He basically appeared to challenge me to a fight,\u201d Lewin told the judge later.",
      "Tacopina responded. \u201cNo one screamed. You weren\u2019t there your honor. Mr. Lewin comes up with his little scolding, bullying attitude.\u201d",
      "Arnold, a former sheriff's deputy, forbade the two from talking to each other except on the record.",
      "Moments later, he said a UFC fight might be warranted. \u201cMaybe we should get an octagon.\u201d",
      "Arnold wasn't wrong either. An even more fierce fight broke out between the two men in front of the judge but off camera a few days later as they argued over evidence. Lewin shouted that the defense assertion Rocky was carrying a prop gun was \u201cgarbage.\"",
      "\u201cOh?! Oh?!\u201d Tacopina yelled. \u201cWe'll see what the jury says at the end!\"",
      "\"The argument grew more out of control and turned to personal insults.",
      "\u201cYou don't know me! But you will learn!\u201d Tacopina yelled.",
      "The judge, disgusted, refused to keep playing referee.",
      "\u201cThat's it, we're off the record,\u201d he said, and walked out.",
      "The testimony of A$AP Relli, Rocky's accuser, was dark and difficult but brought a couple of oddly light moments.",
      "At one point, Deputy District Attorney Paul Przelomiec asked him how far away Rocky was at a certain moment.",
      "\u201cAbout three or four skips,\" Relli said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never heard about anyone estimating with skips,\u201d Przelomiec said.",
      "\u201cWait, what does a skip mean?\u201d the judge asked.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t know what I mean?\u201d Relli asked.",
      "They determined for the record that it was about 7 to 8 feet.",
      "Arnold's long-for-a-judge hair and rugged, bushy mustache evoke a biker, or a cowboy. His nameplate on the bench is a carved wooden log. Relli let him know he liked his style.",
      "As he testified, Arnold told him he clearly had to say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d for the court reporter.",
      "Relli said sorry, he was nervous, then looking at the judge said, \u201cI like your bracelet.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat?\u201d Arnold said.",
      "Relli pointed at the silver wristband on the judge's right arm. \u201cYour bracelet.\u201d",
      "\u201cOh,\u201d the judge said. \u201cThank you.\u201d",
      "Rocky\u2019s mother, Renee Black, and his sister, Erika Mayers, garnered their own share of attention even before Rihanna sat between them.",
      "The first day they appeared, Arnold asked Rocky who the women in his section were.",
      "\u201cThat's my mother and my sister,\u201d Rocky said. The judge's marveled at Black's youthful appearance.",
      "\u201cWhat were you, 7 when you had him?\u201d the judge asked. She said she was 26.",
      "\u201cYou are very beautiful,\u201d the judge told her. \u201cThat\u2019s on the record.\u201d",
      "Later, Lewin politely approached the women and talked to them during a break. He said of Rocky, \u201cI just hope he's evaluating everything\u201d in a reference to the deal Rocky turned down \u2014 a recommendation of 180 days in jail and other relatively minor punishments for a guilty plea on one count.",
      "Tacopina angrily brought it up to the judge later, and Lewin explained himself.",
      "\u201cI walked up very kindly to the defendants mother and sister. I said \u2018I am very sorry you have to go through this. I hope that your brother and your son, he\u2019s really evaluated what he\u2019s risking here.\u2019\u201d",
      "During jury selection, when the room was packed with tired and seemingly bored potential jurors being questioned one after another, a woman gave everyone a start when she suddenly shouted, \u201cThere\u2019s a woman taking a picture in that corner!\u201d",
      "She pointed to a door with a small window behind the judge, who pounced into action, his robe flying. He and his clerk opened the door and hurried down the hall behind it, but found no one.",
      "The woman swore she saw someone and tried to justify herself, but Arnold cut her off.",
      "\u201cYou did the right thing!\u201d Arnold said. \u201cYou done good!\u201d",
      "They kept the window covered after that."

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Rihanna appeared for the first time at the trial of her longtime partner A$AP Rocky, on the day of its most important testimony \u2014 the description by a former friend of the moment Rocky allegedly fired a gun at him.",
      "The singer superstar, who has two toddler sons with the rapper Rocky, sat out of view of the courtroom\u2019s cameras, between Rocky\u2019s mother and sister, in the downtown Los Angeles criminal courthouse. Security brought her in surreptitiously to avoid crowds Wednesday morning.",
      "Rocky, whose legal name is Rakim Athelston Mayers, has been standing trial on two felony charges that he fired a handgun at the former friend, who is known by the name A$AP Relli and was born Terell Ephron. If convicted, Rocky could get up to 24 years in prison.",
      "Rihanna watched Wednesday as Relli testified about the moment Rocky allegedly fired a gun at him on a Hollywood street in 2021.",
      "He had been shouting angrily at Rocky, who was walking away after an initial confrontation and scuffle, when Rocky pulled a gun from his waistband and held it in the air, Relli testified.",

      "The trial's key witness said he grabbed one of their mutual friends who were with Rocky after the first shot was fired and stood behind him for protection. He said he did not see Rocky fire the second shot, and Rocky ran away moments later.",
      "When jurors were being selected, prosecutors asked them whether Rihanna\u2019s connection to the case, especially if she appeared in court, would affect their ability to deliver a guilty verdict.",
      "Nearly all those questioned had heard of her \u2014 far more than had heard of Rocky \u2014 and some described themselves as fans, but all said they felt it would not affect their decisions.",
      "It was not clear whether they could see Rihanna or were aware of her presence as they watched the testimony. She wore a long black dress with buttons on the front that resembled a winter overcoat, and had a pair of glasses on her head that she put on during the prosecution's questioning.",
      "Earlier in the trial, which began on Jan. 21, Relli said he and Rocky, members of A$AP, a crew of creators at a New York high school, had been close but their relationship eroded after Rocky became famous.",
      "He said their relationship had been strained for years and was getting worse in the days leading up to the incident, but he was still \u201cfurious\u201d when Rocky pulled a gun on him after a scuffle that began the moment the two met up near the W Hotel. He dared him to use it.",
      "When Rocky walked away, he testified that he followed and shouted after him, until the shots were fired.",
      "Rocky\u2019s lawyer says the shots he fired were not even from a real gun \u2014 they were blanks from a starter pistol that he carried as a prop. The lawyer said Relli knew this, and that was why he was so fearless walking after him.",
      "\u201cOh it was a real gun,\u201d Relli testified Wednesday, saying he knew because of his scraped hand.",
      "He said he felt free to follow and shout at Rocky because \u201cI felt like because he put it away and we\u2019re on a busy street in Hollywood. He\u2019s definitely not gonna shoot it.\u201d",
      "Since the shooting, and his decision to go to police and testify, he has gotten death threats and has been shunned as a snitch, he said, and the modest music management career he built fell apart.",
      "\u201cIt's been a living hell,\u201d Relli said.",
      "About an hour after the shooting, Relli returned to the scene and said he photographed and recovered two shell casings. Earlier, while responding to a report of a shooting, police did not find any.",
      "He sent a text to Rocky that was shown in court saying \"U try killing me.\"",
      "Rocky denied it in his reply.",
      "\u201cBro wtf is u talkin bout why u tell ppl I shot at u.\u201d",

      "The court day ended after just a few hours of testimony because of scheduling issues. Rihanna was shuffled out through a restricted exit by deputies, and Rocky left separately through the main courthouse doors.",
      "The defense will begin their cross-examination of Relli on Thursday.",
      "Raised in Harlem, Rocky\u2019s rap songs became a phenomenon in New York in 2011. He had his mainstream breakthrough when his first studio album went to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in 2013. The second one, in 2015, did the same.",

      "Incarcerated men in the Alabama prison system risked their safety to feed shocking footage of their horrifying living conditions to a pair of documentary filmmakers",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- Incarcerated men in the Alabama prison system risked their safety to feed shocking footage of their horrifying living conditions to a pair of documentary filmmakers. The result is \u201cThe Alabama Solution,\u201d which premiered this week at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City.",
      "Filmmakers Andrew Jarecki and Charlotte Kaufman became interested in Alabama prisons in 2019. Jarecki, the filmmaker behind \u201cThe Jinx\u201d and \u201cCapturing the Friedmans,\u201d and Kaufman first gained access to the restricted grounds through a visit with a chaplain during a revival meeting held in the prison yards. There men pulled them aside and whispered shocking stories about the reality of life inside: forced labor, drugs, violence, intimidation, retaliation and the undisclosed truths behind many prisoner deaths.",
      "The Associated Press has written extensively about the problems in the state\u2019s prison system, including high rates of violence, low staffing, a plummeting parole rate and the use of pandemic funds to build a new supersized prison.",
      "This process eventually led them to incarcerated activists Melvin Ray and Robert Earl Council (also known as \u201cKinetik Justice\u201d) who had for years been trying to expose the horrifying conditions and deep- seated corruption across the system. They helped feed dispatches to the filmmakers with contraband cellphones.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re deeply concerned for their safety, and we have been since the first time we met them,\u201d said Kaufman. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing this work for decades and as you see in the film, they\u2019ve been retaliated against in very extreme ways. But there are lawyers who are ready to do wellness checks and visit them and respond to any sort of retaliation that may come.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday at the first showing of the film, she had Council on the phone listening in. They put the microphone up to the cellphone so that Council could speak.",
      "\u201cWe thank you all for listening, for being interested,\u201d Council said. \u201cOn behalf of the brothers of Alabama, I thank you all.\u201d",
      "Several family members of their incarcerated subjects were also in the audience, including Sandy Ray, the mother of Steven Davis, who died in 2019 at William E. Donaldson Correctional Facility, his face beaten beyond recognition. Prison officials said Davis was killed in self-defense because he didn\u2019t put down his weapons. The prisoners tell a vastly different story.",
      "Alelur \u201cAlex\u201d Duran, who spent 12 years in prison in New York, also helped produce the film. Jarecki said they wouldn't have taken on the subject without the expertise of someone who had been incarcerated.",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing in this film is going on all over the nation,\u201d Duran said.",
      "Also embedded in the story is Alabama\u2019s long history of contracting prisoners to do work at private companies from Burger King to Best Western, an issue that the AP investigated for over two years. The cheap, reliable labor force has generated more than $250 million for the state since 2000 \u2014 money garnished from prisoners\u2019 paychecks, the AP wrote in December. Parole numbers have also plummeted in recent years.",
      "\u201cWe want to show viewers the truth about a system that has been cloaked in secrecy,\u201d Jarecki said. \u201cWe hope the film sparks an effort to allow access for journalists and others so the public can have transparency into how incarcerated citizens are treated and how our tax dollars are being spent. We hope to inspire Alabama\u2019s leadership to acknowledge the crisis and to overhaul its prison system and its use of forced labor.\u201d",
      "The film will have a theatrical release before it debuts on HBO sometime this year, but the specific dates and details are still being worked out. And while it is in its early days, the impact, Jarecki said, has already been seen, including in a class action labor lawsuit.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 16:02:29 -0500",
    "summary": "William E",
    "story": [
      "William E",
      "NEW YORK -- William E. Leuchtenburg, a prize-winning historian widely admired for his authoritative writings on the U.S. presidency and as the reigning scholar on Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal, has died at 102.",
      "Leuchtenburg died Tuesday at his home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, according to his son, Joshua A. Leuchtenburg, who cited no specific cause of death.",
      "A professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina and a published author for more than 70 years, William E. Leuchtenburg was praised for his encyclopedic knowledge and rigorous, but accessible style. He received some of the top awards given to historians, including the Parkman and Bancroft prizes, was a political analyst for CBS and NBC and consulted on several of Ken Burns' PBS documentaries. In 2008, he was given the Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. Award for \"Distinguished Writing\" of American history.",
      "Leuchtenburg's notable books include \"Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal\" and \"The Perils of Prosperity,\" a history of the U.S. from World War I to the peak of the Great Depression. Although politically liberal, his expertise called upon by aides to Lyndon Johnson and other Democratic politicians, he was as willing to point out the New Deal\u2019s disappointments as its successes: His scholarship was closely studied by younger FDR historians, from Jonathan Alter to Burns collaborator Geoffrey Ward, who dedicated the 2014 book \u201cThe Roosevelts\u201d to Leuchtenburg. And he was otherwise known for his generosity with Ward and others who sought his expertise.",
      "His most influential work was likely the Bancroft-winning \u201cFranklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal,\u201d published in 1963. Leuchtenburg found that the impact of FDR's vast and unprecedented response to the Depression was limited by political calculation, especially the president's reluctance to challenge racial segregation in the South, and that \u201cIt never demonstrated that it could achieve prosperity\" until the U.S. entered World War II. But he also credited the New Deal with transforming the role of federal government and Roosevelt with reinventing the presidency, using the young medium of radio to convince millions that he knew them personally.",
      "\u201cNothing is glossed over at all,\u201d The New York Times\u2019 Charles Poore wrote upon the book\u2019s release. \u201cYou live here through years of tumult and disaster, triumph and ineptitude and daring.\u201d",
      "Leuchtenburg's books on Roosevelt covered his presidency and beyond. \"In the Shadow of FDR,\" published in 1983 and periodically updated, demonstrated how presidents from Truman to George W. Bush attempted to shun and/or embrace Roosevelt's legacy. Leuchtenburg wrote of Roosevelt's immediate successor, Harry Truman, gesturing in the White House to a portrait of FDR and admitting, \"I'm trying to do what he would like.\" He noted the frustration of Republican Dwight Eisenhower and Democrat John F. Kennedy in being compared, unfavorably, to Roosevelt, and how Jimmy Carter began his 1976 presidential run with a speech in Warm Springs, Georgia, where FDR often stayed. At the time of his death, Leuchtenburg was working on an edition that would have included the administration of Joe Biden, who kept a portrait of Roosevelt in the Oval Office.",
      "The 2005 book \"The White House Looks South\" featured sections on Roosevelt, Truman and Lyndon Johnson and told of how each embraced or distanced themselves from the South. Roosevelt, a native of New York, spent so much time in Warm Springs that the state's governor referred to him as our \"fellow-Georgian.\" Johnson, a Texan, alternately identified himself as a Southerner or a Westerner, depending on the intended audience.",
      "In the prologue, Leuchtenburg fondly noted his own journey, remembering visits to baseball spring training camps in Florida, marching with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in Montgomery, Alabama, and never failing on New Year's Day to partake of black-eyed peas and collard greens, \"even if they are eaten with a grimace.\"",
      "\"In sum, I am in, but not of, the South,\" he concluded.",
      "He was a popular and rigorous educator \u2014 sometimes referred to as \u201cThe Big L\u201d \u2014 who taught at Smith College, Harvard University and Columbia University before settling at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the early 1980s. A former president of the American Historical Association and the Organization of American Historians, he held such stature that he contributed to later editions of \"The Growth of the American Republic,\" a standard college textbook originally written by Henry Steele Commager and Samuel Eliot Morison. Historians studying under him ranged from Allan Brandt to Howard Zinn.",
      "Leuchtenburg was married twice, most recently to Jean Anne Leuchtenburg, and had three children.",
      "A postal clerk's son born in New York City in 1922, William Edward Leuchtenburg was so fascinated by politics that at age 12, he raised money tutoring neighborhood kids to fund a nine-hour bus ride to Washington, where he would recall his \"wide-eyed\" tour of the White House and the \"brand-new marble palace of the U.S. Supreme Court.\"",
      "His affinity for Roosevelt was lifelong and personal. When he was 10, he sat by the radio and counted delegates as FDR was elected to his first term as president. He was able to afford college with help from a job found through a New Deal program, the National Youth Administration.",
      "Leuchtenburg graduated from Cornell University, received a master's degree and a doctorate from Columbia and worked for a civil rights lobby and other political organizations before deciding to focus on history. His first book, \u201cFlood Control Politics,\u201d came out in 1953, followed five years later by \u201cThe Perils of Prosperity.\u201d",
      "In recent years, Leuchtenburg wrote a short, critical biography of FDR\u2019s predecessor, Herbert Hoover, and the 900-page \u201cThe American President: From Teddy Roosevelt to Bill Clinton.\u201d He continued to work every morning and, at age 101, completed \u201cPatriot Presidents,\u201d the first of a planned multi-volume history that he acknowledged in the book's preface \u201cmay be too ambitious.\u201d"

      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- Ugandan authorities on Monday began a clinical trial of a vaccine against the Sudan strain of Ebola that has killed one person in the outbreak declared last week.",
      "Health workers and others exposed to the Ebola strain are being targeted in the study, which began four days after Uganda announced the death of a nurse in the capital, Kampala. Two more cases were confirmed on Monday in relatives of the first victim.",
      "Officials are investigating the source of the outbreak. Ebola is spread by contact with bodily fluids of an infected person or contaminated materials. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and at times internal and external bleeding.",
      "Responding to this outbreak could prove difficult because Kampala has a highly mobile population of about 4 million. The nurse who died had sought treatment at a hospital just outside the capital and later traveled to Mbale in the country\u2019s east, where he was admitted to a public hospital. Health authorities said he also sought the services of a traditional healer.",
      "At least 234 contacts in this outbreak have been identified, according to the Ministry of Health.",
      "Health authorities have access to more than 2,000 doses of a candidate vaccine against the Sudan strain. IAVI provided the vaccine.",
      "The trial \u201cmarks a major milestone in public health emergency response and demonstrates the power of collaboration for global health security,\u201d Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO director for Africa, said in a statement.",
      "This is the first Ebola outbreak since the Trump administration's decision last week to withdraw from the U.N. health agency, and since Trump's order for a freeze on foreign assistance.",
      "Uganda has had multiple Ebola outbreaks, including one in 2000 that killed hundreds. Tracing contacts is key to stemming the spread of Ebola, which manifests as a viral hemorrhagic fever.",
      "A trial vaccine known as rVSV-ZEBOV, used to vaccinate 3,000 people at risk of infection during an outbreak of the Zaire strain of Ebola in eastern Congo between 2018 and 2020, proved effective in containing the spread of the disease there.",
      "The confirmation of Ebola in Uganda is the latest in a series of outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers in the east African region. Tanzania declared an outbreak of the Ebola-like Marburg disease last month, and Rwanda in December announced that its own outbreak of Marburg was over.",
      "Scientists don\u2019t know the natural reservoir of Ebola, but they suspect the first person infected in an outbreak acquired the virus through contact with an infected animal or eating its raw meat.",
      "Ebola was discovered in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks in South Sudan and Congo, where it occurred in a village near the Ebola River, after which the disease is named."

      "NEW YORK -- New York Attorney General Letitia James on Monday told hospitals that they would be violating state law if they stop offering gender-affirming care for people under age 19 in response to an executive order from President Donald Trump aimed at curtailing federal funding for such treatments.",
      "In a letter, James, a Democrat, told health care facilities that refusing to provide the treatments would violate New York's anti-discrimination laws.",
      "\"Regardless of the availability of federal funding, we write to further remind you of your obligations to comply with New York State laws,\" her letter reads.",
      "Trump, a Republican, last week signed an executive order that directed agencies to take steps to make sure that hospitals receiving federal research and education grants \u201cend the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\u201d The language in the order \u2014 using words such as \u201cmaiming,\u201d \u201csterilizing\u201d and \u201cmutilation\u201d \u2014 contradicts what is typical for gender-affirming care in the United States.",
      "The letter from James came as some hospitals in Colorado, Virginia and Washington, D.C., said they were pausing gender-affirming treatments for young people while administrators evaluate the order. The White House on Monday released a statement that said the executive order was \u201calready having its intended effect.\u201d",

      "Hundreds of wounded people have poured into overcrowded hospitals in Goma after Rwanda-backed rebels captured the major city in eastern Congo last week",
      "GOMA, Congo -- Hundreds of wounded people have poured into overcrowded hospitals in Goma, a major city in eastern Congo, as fighting rages on between government forces and the Rwanda-backed rebels who seized the city of around 2 million people.",
      "\u201cThey will get infected before we can treat them all,\u201d said Florence Douet, an operating room nurse at Bethesda Hospital, as she attended to patients with varying degrees of injuries.",
      "Since the start of the M23 rebels' offensive on Goma on Jan. 26, more than 700 people have been killed and nearly 3,000 have been wounded in the city and its vicinity, officials say. Bethesda Hospital alone said it receives more than 100 new patients each day, overstretching its capacity of 250 beds.",
      "Bethesda is one of several hospitals in Goma that The Associated Press visited that has inadequate personnel and supplies. The city hosts many of the close to 6.5 million people displaced by the conflict, which is one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises.",
      "As more people arrived at the hospitals with gunshot or shrapnel wounds, many were forced to share beds while others lay on the floor, writhing in pain as they waited for medical attention.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m experiencing this,\" said Patrick Bagamuhunda, who was wounded in the fighting. \u201cThis war has caused a lot of damage, but at least we are still breathing.\u201d",
      "The M23 rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, far more than in 2012, when they first captured Goma before withdrawing under international pressure. They are the most potent of the more than 100 armed groups vying for control in Congo\u2019s mineral-rich east, which holds vast deposits critical to much of the world\u2019s technology.",
      "Unlike in 2012, the rebels say they now plan to march to Congo\u2019s capital, Kinshasa, 1,000 miles (1,609 kilometers) away, describing the country as a failed state under President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi.",
      "The fighting in Congo has connections with a decadeslong ethnic conflict. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) militia group. Rwanda said the group is \"fully integrated\u201d into the Congolese military, which denies the charges.",
      "Medical workers at Kyeshero Hospital in Goma say they are treating an increasing number of patients with bullet wounds.",
      "\"We removed 48 bullets yesterday,\u201d Johnny Kasangati, a surgeon, said Friday as he examined a patient under a tent.",
      "Kyeshero is also severely overcrowded, hitting more than 200% of its capacity on some days, according to Joseph Amadomon Sagara, a project coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, which runs the hospital.",
      "In the past, hospitals in Goma could transport wounded patients by boat to South Kivu's main Bukavu city, 180 kilometers (111 miles) to the south, but transport across Lake Kivu was suspended during the rebellion and roads have been mostly cut.",
      "The fighting in and around Goma has also disrupted supply chains, leading to shortages in medical supplies that aid groups rely on. Some of it previously entered the city through its international airport, which is now under rebel control.",
      "\u201cGoma was cut off from the world. It was a total blackout,\" said Virginie Napolitano, Goma's emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders.",
      "The aid group's stockpiles, along with those of other groups, have been looted.",
      "\"We\u2019re getting by with what we had in the cabinets, but I don\u2019t know for how long,\u201d Napolitano said.",
      "Congo's government has confirmed 773 deaths and 2,880 injured persons at morgues and hospitals. The toll could be higher, it said, citing fears of finding mass graves and more bodies.",
      "The Maternit\u00e9 de la Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Goma was among those struggling to find space for the dead.",
      "\u201cWe had 66 bodies here. Fifty-six were transferred to the provincial hospital, where the morgue has more space than ours,\" said Jules Kafitiye, the hospital's medical director.",
      "\"We need to avoid decomposition due to disease,\u201d he added, pointing to a tent where bodies were being stored.",
      "Scores of bodies lay on streets and in hospitals in Goma after the city's capture, raising fears of disease outbreaks in the region, which is also facing mpox and cholera outbreaks.",
      "The U.N. health body warned last week that repeated mass displacement in Congo has created ideal conditions for the spread of endemic diseases in displacement camps and surrounding communities, including cholera, which saw more than 22,000 infections last year, and measles, which affected close to 12,000 people. The region also battles with chronic child malnutrition.",

But they hadn't expected the abrupt halt to foreign aid from the world's largest donor that stops money flowing for wide-ranging projects like disease response, girls' education and free school lunches.",
      "Even after global outrage prompted some exemptions to Trump's order, sub-Saharan Africa could suffer more than any other region as most global aid pauses 90 days for a spending review. The U.S. gave the region more than $6.5 billion in humanitarian assistance last year.",

      "Rafah is Gaza\u2019s only crossing that does not enter into Israel. Israeli forces closed the crossing in early May after seizing it during an offensive on the southern city. Egypt shut down its side of the passage in protest.",
      "Even before the Gaza war began, the Rafah crossing represented a crucial escape valve from the territory, where a 15-year Israeli-Egyptian blockade aimed at containing Hamas undermined health facilities and impoverished the population. Palestinians routinely applied for permission to travel outside the territory for lifesaving treatments not available in Gaza, including chemotherapy.",
      "It took some diplomatic gymnastics to reopen the crossing and overcome security disputes between Israeli, Egyptian and Palestinian officials. Hamas had overseen the border since 2007, when it took control of Gaza from its rival, the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority, or PA, after winning parliamentary elections in 2006.",
      "Israeli troops remain at the Rafah crossing and in the Philadelphia Corridor, a band of land running the length of the border. Israel has refused to allow Hamas to resume management of the crossing, accusing it of smuggling weapons through tunnels under the border, though Egypt says it destroyed the tunnels from its side and stopped smuggling years ago. Israel also refuses to allow the Palestinian Authority to officially run the crossing.",
      "Instead, the crossing will be staffed by Palestinians from Gaza who previously served as border officers with the PA, but they will not be allowed to wear official PA insignia, a European diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to brief the media. Israel has screened the officers to ensure they have no affiliation with Hamas, the European diplomat added.",
      "European Union monitors will also be present, as they were before 2007.",
      "Negotiations on the second phase of the deal \u2014 which calls for a permanent ceasefire, full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of any remaining hostages \u2014 are supposed to begin Monday. Israel has resisted the notion that the PA would control postwar Gaza."

      "GENEVA -- The World Health Organization chief asked global leaders to lean on Washington to reverse President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the U.N. health agency, insisting in a closed-door meeting with diplomats last week that the U.S. will miss out on critical information about global disease outbreaks.",
      "But countries also pressed WHO at a key budget meeting last Wednesday about how it might cope with the exit of its biggest donor, according to internal meeting materials obtained by The Associated Press. A German envoy, Bjorn Kummel, warned: \u201cThe roof is on fire, and we need to stop the fire as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "For 2024-2025, the U.S. is WHO\u2019s biggest donor by far, putting in an estimated $988 million, roughly 14% of WHO\u2019s $6.9 billion budget.",
      "A budget document presented at the meeting showed WHO\u2019s health emergencies program has a \u201cheavy reliance\u201d on American cash. \u201cReadiness functions\u201d in WHO\u2019s Europe office were more than 80% reliant on the $154 million the U.S. contributes.",
      "The document said U.S. funding \u201cprovides the backbone of many of WHO's large-scale emergency operations,\u201d covering up to 40%. It said responses in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan were at risk, in addition to hundreds of millions of dollars lost by polio-eradication and HIV programs.",
      "The U.S. also covers 95% of WHO's tuberculosis work in Europe and more than 60% of TB efforts in Africa, the Western Pacific and at the agency headquarters in Geneva, the document said.",
      "At a separate private meeting on the impact of the U.S. exit last Wednesday, WHO finance director George Kyriacou said if the agency spends at its current rate, the organization would \u201cbe very much in a hand-to-mouth type situation when it comes to our cash flows\u201d in the first half of 2026. He added the current rate of spending is \u201csomething we're not going to do,\" according to a recording obtained by the AP.",
      "Since Trump\u2019s executive order, WHO has attempted to withdraw funds from the U.S. for past expenses, Kyriacou said, but most of those \u201chave not been accepted.\u201d",
      "The U.S. also has yet to settle its owed contributions to WHO for 2024, pushing the agency into a deficit, he added.",
      "WHO's executive board, made up of 34 high-level envoys including many national health ministers, was expected to discuss budget matters during its latest session, which opens Monday and is set to run through Feb. 11.",
      "Last week, officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were instructed to stop working with WHO immediately.",
      "WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the attendees at the budget meeting that the agency is still providing U.S. scientists with some data \u2014 though it isn't known what data.",
      "\u201cWe continue to give them information because they need it,\u201d Tedros said, urging member countries to contact U.S officials. \u201cWe would appreciate it if you continue to push and reach out to them to reconsider.\u201d",
      "Among other health crises, WHO is currently working to stop outbreaks of Marburg virus in Tanzania, Ebola in Uganda and mpox in Congo.",
      "Tedros rebutted Trump\u2019s three stated reasons for leaving the agency in the executive order signed on Jan. 20 \u2014 Trump's first day back in office. In the order, the president said WHO mishandled the COVID-19 pandemic that began in China, failed to adopt needed reforms and that U.S. membership required \u201cunfairly onerous payments.\"",
      "Tedros said WHO alerted the world in January 2020 about the potential dangers of the coronavirus and has made dozens of reforms since \u2014 including efforts to expand its donor base.",
      "Tedros also said he believed the U.S. departure was \u201cnot about the money\u201d but more about the \u201cvoid\u201d in outbreak details and other critical health information that the United States would face in the future.",
      "\u201cBringing the U.S. back will be very important,\" he told meeting attendees. \"And on that, I think all of you can play a role.\u201d",
      "Kummel, a senior advisor on global health in Germany's health ministry, described the U.S. exit as \u201cthe most extensive crisis WHO has been facing in the past decades.\u201d",
      "He also asked: \u201cWhat concrete functions of WHO will collapse if the funding of the U.S. is not existent anymore?\u201d",
      "Officials from countries including Bangladesh and France asked what specific plans WHO had to deal with the loss of U.S. funding and wondered which health programs would be cut as a result.",
      "The AP obtained a document shared among some WHO senior managers that laid out several options, including a proposal that each major department or office might be slashed in half by the end of the year.",
      "WHO declined to comment on whether Tedros had privately asked countries to lobby on the agency's behalf.",
      "Some experts said that while the departure of the U.S. was a major crisis, it might also serve as an opportunity to reshape global public health.",
      "Less than 1% of the U.S. health budget goes to WHO, said Matthew Kavanagh, director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Global Health Policy and Politics. In exchange, the U.S. gets \u201ca wide variety of benefits to Americans that matter quite a bit,\u201d he said. That includes intelligence about disease epidemics globally and virus samples for vaccines.",
      "Kavanagh also said the WHO is \"massively underfunded,\u201d describing the contributions from rich countries as \u201cpeanuts.\u201d",
      "WHO emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan said at the meeting on the impact of the U.S. withdrawal last week that losing the U.S. was \u201cterrible,\u201d but member states had \u201ctremendous capacity to fill in those gaps.\u201d",

      "A new memo says the Defense Department will no longer reimburse service members for travel out of state to get reproductive health care, including abortions and fertility treatments",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Defense Department will no longer reimburse service members for travel out of state to get reproductive health care, including abortions and fertility treatments, according to a new memo.",
      "The directive signed this week eliminates a rarely used Biden administration policy enacted in October 2022, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and more states began to impose increased abortion restrictions.",
      "Signed on Wednesday by Jeffrey Register, the director of the Pentagon's human resources department, the memo simply shows red lines crossing out the previous regulation and offers no other guidance.",
      "Asked if service members would still be allowed time off to travel at their own expense, the department had no immediate answer.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the policy change \u201cshameful.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur service members go wherever they need to in order to bravely serve our country \u2014 and because President Trump\u2019s extremist Supreme Court overturned Roe, where they and their families are stationed quite literally dictates their access to critical reproductive care,\u201d Warren said in a statement. \u201cNow, Trump is turning his back on our servicemembers \u2014 and our servicewomen in particular \u2014 to score political points. It\u2019s shameful, and will only make our troops and our nation less safe.\u201d",
      "Then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin instituted the policy in October 2022 to ensure that troops who were assigned to states where abortions or other types of health care such as IVF treatment were no longer provided could still access those services.",
      "The Defense Department on Friday was unable to say how many times the reimbursement policy was used, or the costs. But last March, officials said it had been used by service members or their dependents just 12 times from June to December 2023. And the total cost was roughly $40,000 to cover transportation, lodging and meals.",
      "The policy did not cover the cost of abortions, and it\u2019s not clear how many of the 12 trips were for abortions or other type of reproductive health care, such as IVF treatment. That specific medical information is protected by health privacy law.",
      "In his memo at the time, Austin said service members and their families were worried they may not get equal access to health care, including abortions. And he noted that service members who often must move for various missions or training would be forced to travel farther, take more time off work and pay more to access reproductive health care.",
      "The problem, Austin said, would create extraordinary hardship and \"interfere with our ability to recruit, retain, and maintain the readiness of a highly qualified force.\u201d",
      "He ordered the department to allow troops and dependents, consistent with federal law, to take time off and use official travel to get to other states for reproductive care not available locally. That care includes in vitro fertilization and other pregnancy aids that also may not be accessible close by.",
      "Under federal law, Defense Department medical facilities can perform abortions only when the life of the pregnant person is at risk or in cases of rape or incest, and those instances have been extremely rare. According to the department, there were 91 abortions performed in military medical facilities between 2016 and 2021."

    "story": [
      "A new study finds that rat infestation in many of the world\u2019s cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- Rat infestation in many world cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington, and a new study blames climate change, urbanization and other human actions.",
      "A first-of-its-kind examination of trends and reasons in hard-to-count rat populations uses rat sighting reports in 16 cities around the world. In 11 of those cities, rat complaints have increased, according to a study in Friday's journal Science Advances.",
      "Based on individual trends within cities, Washington was by far the leader in rat increases, followed by San Francisco, Toronto, New York City and Amsterdam. Washington's rising rat reporting trend was three times greater than Boston's and 50% more than New York's, the study said. Washington city officials did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Only three cities saw significant decreasing trends \u2014 New Orleans, Louisville and Tokyo \u2014 with the home of Mardi Gras showing the biggest drop in rat reporting. Experts said the Louisiana city can teach others how to combat the rat problem.",
      "Researchers did a statistical analysis of the rising rat reporting in those cities and concluded that slightly more than 40% of the trend seen is due to warming temperatures from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. And that comes down to sex and food, said study lead author Jonathan Richardson, a biologist at the University of Richmond.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing these increasing trends in rats in cities that are warming the fastest, probably because this is a small mammal that has physiological challenges in the cold weather months,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cIf we're warming the climate and winter starts a week or two later and spring arrives a week or two earlier, that's one, two, maybe even three or four weeks across the entire year where those rats can be above ground foraging, acquiring more food and maybe squeezing out one or two more reproductive cycles. \u201d",
      "An extra month may not sound like much, but female rats can have a litter every month. Each litter is eight to 16 baby rats, Richardson said: \u201cThat is a recipe for accelerated population growth.\u201d",
      "Researchers pointed to two other big statistical links \u2014 that fit with known biological issues \u2014 behind more rat reports: the increase in urbanization and more densely populated cities.",
      "Rats like the built-up environment and being near people and their waste, the study and outside scientists said. They essentially eat at the same table as humans, multiple experts said.",
      "\u201cThe rat is the third most successful mammal behind humans and house mice. So it evolved and engineered to live alongside us,\u201d New York City rat czar Kathleen Corradi said during a break at a New Orleans conference on improving pest management. \u201cThey followed humans, Homo sapiens, across the continents and are in every single continent except Antarctica. So it's considered a wicked problem.\u201d",
      "Even though rats are intelligent and highly adaptive, Richardson and other experts said they are a serious problem for people.",
      "\u201cWhen rodent populations are high, people get sick, motor vehicles become disabled, mental health declines, fires are started and foods fouled,\u201d said Houston rat expert Michael Parsons, who wasn't part of the study. People are rightly bothered by rats because of \u201can innate fear caused by an organism that can make us sick.\u201d",
      "Researchers have not had good figures on rats. Because of the way they live and hide, they are not as easily counted as other critters, so this is one of the first attempts to quantify them. The study is not really a count of rats, but of complaints by people.",
      "Because the statistics go back years and only cities that haven't changed their reporting methods were looked at, Richardson said the trends they spotted have scientific merit. Even though Washington has the highest increasing trend that doesn't mean it has more rats or even rat sightings, it is just that the numbers within the city are increasing fastest, he said.",
      "Several outside experts said the study is legitimate, sensible and was sorely needed.",
      "\u201cThis paper is by far the largest data-driven effort to understand changes in urban rat populations ever attempted,\u201d said Drexel University ecology professor Jason Munshi-South, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Looking at the few cities where rat reports are down may help in the fight against rats, Richardson and Corradi said. The answer is not more poison or traps, but prevention, the study said.",
      "\u201cIn New Orleans they make a big effort to get out into neighborhoods and do educational workshops and campaigns to talk to residents about what makes a property less likely to have rats,\u201d Richardson said.",
      "New York City's recently stepped up rat-fighting, which includes replacing garbage in bags on the street with rat-resistant containers, hasn't quite shown up in Richardson's data yet, but rat czar Corradi said early results are encouraging. The city has signed people up for what it calls an elite squad of rat fighters, named \" NYC rat pack.\u201d",
      "It's an uphill battle.",
      "\u201cAs our cities warm, urbanize and (increase in) density, we create more resources for rats which could result in further increases in numbers,\u201d Simon Fraser University health and rat scientist Kaylee Byers said in an email.",
      "We can fight them better, but in the end people \u201cneed to coexist with wildlife in urban environments, even with rats,\u201d University of Michigan conservation scientist Neil Carter said.",
      "\u201cZero rats is impossible,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cBut I think an expectation that we need to live with the number of rats that we're seeing in many of these cities is also an unhealthy perspective on this problem.\u201d",

      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- A New York doctor was indicted by a Louisiana grand jury on Friday for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in the Deep South state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the country.",
      "Grand jurors at the District Court for the Parish of West Baton Rouge issued an indictment against Dr. Margaret Carpenter; her company, Nightingale Medical, PC; and a third person. All three were charged with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony.",
      "The case appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state, at least since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to have strict anti-abortion laws.",
      "Carpenter was also sued by the Texas attorney general in December under similar allegations of sending pills to that state. That case did not involve criminal charges.",
      "Carpenter did not immediately return a message.",
      "The indictment comes just months after Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances.\u201d The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Under the legislation, if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years. The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "Since the fall of Roe v. Wade, Louisiana has had a near-total abortion ban, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake, since Roe v Wade was overturned, we\u2019ve witnessed a disturbing pattern of interference with women\u2019s rights,\u201d the Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine, where Carpenter is one of the founders, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret the United States has a history of violence and harassment against abortion providers, and this state-sponsored effort to prosecute a doctor providing safe and effective care should alarm everyone.\u201d",
      "Friday\u2019s indictment could be the first direct test of New York\u2019s shield laws, which are intended to protect prescribers who use telehealth to provide abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\u201cWe always knew that overturning Roe v. Wade wasn\u2019t the end of the road for anti-abortion politicians. That\u2019s why I worked with the Legislature to pass nation-leading laws to protect providers and patients,\u201d New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a prepared release.",
      "Attorney General Letitia James, who would enforce the shield law, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Pills have become the most common means of abortion in the U.S., accounting for nearly two-thirds of them by 2023. They\u2019re also at the center of political and legal action over abortion. In January, one judge let three states continue to challenge federal government approvals for how one of the drugs usually involved can be prescribed."

      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- The Alaska Gold Rush town of Nome faced a bleak winter. It was hundreds of miles from anywhere, cut off by the frozen sea and unrelenting blizzards, and under siege from a contagious disease known as the \u201cstrangling angel\u201d for the way it suffocated children.",
      "Now, 100 years later, Nome is remembering its saviors \u2014 the sled dogs and mushers who raced for more than five days through hypothermia, frostbite, gale-force winds and blinding whiteouts to deliver life-saving serum and free the community from the grip of diphtheria.",
      "Among the events celebrating the centennial of the 1925 \u201cGreat Race of Mercy\u201d are lectures, a dog-food drive and a reenactment of the final leg of the relay, all organized by the Nome Kennel Club.",

      "\u201cPeople just dropped whatever they were doing,\" she said. \"These mushers got their teams ready and went, even though it was really cold and challenging conditions on the trail.\u201d",

      "Jonathan Hayes, a Maine resident who has been working to preserve the genetic line of sled dogs driven on the run by famed musher Leonhard Seppala, is recreating the trip. Hayes left Nenana on Monday with 16 Seppala Siberian sled dogs, registered descendants of Seppala's team.",
      "Diphtheria is an airborne disease that causes a thick, suffocating film to develop at the back of the throat; it was once a leading cause of death for children. The antitoxin used to treat it was developed in 1890, and a vaccine in 1923; it is now exceedingly rare in the U.S.",
      "Nome, western Alaska\u2019s largest community, had about 1,400 residents a century ago. Its most recent supply ship had arrived the previous fall, before the Bering Sea froze, without any doses of the antitoxin. Those the local doctor, Curtis Welch, had were outdated, but he wasn't worried. He hadn\u2019t seen a case of diphtheria in the 18 years he had practiced in the area.",
      "Within months, that changed. In a telegram, Welch pleaded with the U.S. Public Health Service to send serum: \"An epidemic of diphtheria is almost inevitable here.\u201d",
      "The first death was a 3-year-old boy on Jan. 20, 1925, followed the next day by a 7-year-old girl. By the end of the month, there were more than 20 confirmed cases. The city was placed under quarantine.",
      "West Coast hospitals had antitoxin doses, but it would take time to get them to Seattle and then onto a ship for Seward, an ice-free port south of Anchorage. In the meantime, enough for 30 people was found at an Anchorage hospital.",
      "It still had to get to Nome. Airplanes with open-air cockpits were ruled out as unsuited for the weather. There were no roads or trains that reached Nome.",
      "Instead, officials shipped the serum by rail to Nenana in interior Alaska, some 675 miles (1,086 kilometers) from Nome via the frozen Yukon River and mail trails.",
      "Thanks to Alaska\u2019s new telegraph lines and the spread of radio, the nation followed along, captivated, as 20 mushers \u2014 many of them Alaska Natives \u2014 with more than 150 dogs relayed the serum to Nome. They battled deep snow, whiteouts so severe they couldn\u2019t see the dogs in front of them, and life-threatening temperatures that plunged at times to minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 51 degrees Celsius).",
      "The antitoxin was transported in glass vials covered with padded quilts. Not a single vial broke.",
      "Seppala, a Norwegian settler, left from Nome to meet the supply near the halfway point and begin the journey back. His team, led by his dog Togo, traveled more than 250 miles (320 kilometers) of the relay, including a treacherous stretch across frozen Norton Sound.",
      "After about 5 1/2 days, the serum reached its destination on Feb. 2, 1925. A banner front-page headline in the San Francisco Chronicle proclaimed: \u201cDogs victors over blizzard in battle to succor stricken Nome.\u201d",
      "The official record listed five deaths and 29 illnesses. It\u2019s likely the toll was higher; Alaska Natives were not accurately tracked.",
      "Seppala and Togo missed the limelight that went to his assistant, Gunnar Kaasen, who drove the dog team led by Balto into Nome. Balto was another of Seppala\u2019s dogs, but was used to only haul freight after he was deemed too slow to be on a competitive team.",
      "Balto was immortalized in movies and with statues in New York's Central Park and one in Anchorage intended as a tribute to all sled dogs. He received a bone-shaped key to the city of Los Angeles, where legendary movie actress Mary Pickford placed a wreath around his neck.",
      "But he and several team members were eventually sold and kept in squalid conditions at a dime museum in Los Angeles. After learning of their plight, an Ohio businessman spearheaded an effort to raise money to bring them to Cleveland. After dying in 1933, Balto was mounted and placed on display at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.",
      "Today, the most famous mushing event in the world is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, which is not based on the serum run but on the Iditarod Trail, a supply route from Seward to Nome. Iditarod organizers are nevertheless marking the serum run's centennial, with a series of articles on its website and by selling replicas of the medallions each serum run musher received a century ago, race spokesperson Shannon Noonan said in an email. This year's Iditarod starts March 1.",
      "\u201cThe Serum Run demonstrated the critical role sled dogs played in the survival and communication of remote Alaskan communities, while the Iditarod has evolved into a celebration of that tradition and Alaska\u2019s pioneering spirit,\u201d Noonan said.",

      "Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s famous name, populist stances and loyal following have earned him President Donald Trump's support, but will that get him the votes he needs from the Republican-controlled Senate to become the nation's top health official?",
      "If approved, Kennedy will control a $1.7 trillion agency that oversees food and hospital inspections, hundreds of health clinics, vaccine recommendations and health insurance for roughly half the country.",
      "His confirmation hearings are set before the Senate finance committee on Wednesday and the Health, Education, Labor and Pension committee on Thursday.",
      "Here's what to watch during his confirmation hearings:",
      "Over many years, Kennedy has been clear about his beliefs on vaccines in dozens of interviews, podcasts and social media posts.",
      "He's headed up a nonprofit that has sued the government over its authorizations of vaccines. He's said there is \u201c no vaccine that is safe and effective,\" and repeatedly called for further study of routine childhood vaccinations, despite decades of research and real-world use that proves they've safely prevented disease.",
      "But more recently, Kennedy has tried to downplay his past remarks and work, saying he's not anti-vaccine and promising not to \u201ctake away\u201d the shots.",
      "The health committee chairman, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., also has expressed concerns about Kennedy's anti-vaccine work. A physician, Cassidy said earlier this month he \u201chad a frank conversation\u201d and \u201cspoke about vaccines at length\u201d with Kennedy. On Tuesday, Cassidy told reporters that he is still unsure if he is backing Trump\u2019s nominee.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still working through it,\u201d Cassidy said during a press availability with Louisiana reporters on Tuesday. \u201cI look forward to the hearings and I will allow that to guide my decision.\u201d",
      "The intensity of the questioning on vaccines over the next two days could provide clues for how other Republicans \u2014 like Sen. Mitch McConnell, a polio survivor who represents Kentucky \u2014 might consider Kennedy\u2019s nomination.",
      "Some of the country's most conservative lawmakers have been worried about how Kennedy will handle abortion as health secretary.",
      "Republican Sen. James Lankford, who sits on the finance committee, is expected to grill Kennedy, a longtime Democrat, on the issue during Wednesday's hearing. Lankford is seen as a possible \u201cno\u201d vote over Kennedy's past comments supporting abortion. Last month, the Oklahoma senator said he had a \u201cgood conversation\u201d with Kennedy but stopped short of endorsing.",
      "HHS can influence abortion and reproductive health access in a number of ways, including with millions of dollars in grants it sends to Planned Parenthood and regulations around abortion pills. Under the Biden administration, the agency also said hospitals were required to provide emergency abortions for pregnant women in medical distress.",
      "On Monday, acting HHS Secretary Dorothy Fink signaled the agency is prepared to adopt a tougher stance on abortion under Kennedy. She ordered the agency to investigate all of its programs to make sure no taxpayer money is going toward elective abortions.",
      "Kennedy needs to earn support from nearly all Senate Republicans, but he may also try to pick up a vote or two from the Democratic Party. His closest supporters and advisers have urged followers to call the offices of Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada.",
      "Another Democratic senator may also be in play: John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who met with Kennedy and has said he's open to supporting Trump's nominees.",
      "An area where Kennedy is trying to find common ground with Democratic senators: food regulations and access to healthier foods. Kennedy has said he supports Medicare and Medicaid helping people pay for healthier foods and gym memberships, an idea Democrats have lobbied for as well. He's also called for a ban on some of the ingredients used in foods, like dyes and additives.",
      "In a letter sent to U.S. senators on Tuesday, Caroline Kennedy shared shocking personal details about her cousin, saying he is not qualified for the health secretary job.",
      "Caroline Kennedy said RFK Jr.'s views on vaccines are a problem, but she also brought up her experiences growing up with him.",
      "A copy obtained by The Associated Press notes that while she admired him for overcoming a drug addiction, she said he has gone on to \u201cmisrepresent, lie, and cheat his way through life.\u201d In an extreme anecdote, she accused him of hosting drug-fueled gatherings in his basement, dorm and garage where he \u201cenjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in the blender to feed his hawks.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, another cousin, former Rhode Island congressman and Democrat Patrick J. Kennedy, threw his support behind the health secretary nominee in an opinion piece for The Washington Post on Tuesday. RFK Jr. helped pull him out of addiction, Patrick J. Kennedy said.",
      "\u201cBobby was the first family member to call and offer his personal and public support, even at a time when some in my family criticized me for breaking the so-called family code of silence,\u201d he wrote.",

      "",
      "Despite long COVID's vast reach, the federal government's investment in researching the disease  --  to the tune of $1.15 billion as of December  --  has so far failed to bring any new treatments to market.",
      "",
      "This disappoints and angers the patient community, who say the National Institutes of Health (NIH) should focus on ways to stop their suffering instead of simply trying to understand why they're suffering.",
      "",
      "\"It's unconscionable that more than 4 years since this began, we still don't have one FDA-approved drug,\" said Meighan Stone, executive director of the Long COVID Campaign, a patient-led advocacy organization. Stone was among several people with long COVID who spoke at a workshop hosted by the NIH in September where patients, clinicians, and researchers discussed their priorities and frustrations around the agency's approach to long COVID research.",
      "",
      "Some doctors and researchers are also critical of the agency's research initiative, called RECOVER, or Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery. Without clinical trials, physicians specializing in treating long COVID must rely on hunches to guide their clinical decisions, said Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, chief of research and development with the VA St. Louis Healthcare System.",
      "",
      "\"What [RECOVER] lacks, really, is clarity of vision and clarity of purpose,\" said Al-Aly, saying he agrees that the NIH has had enough time and money to produce more meaningful progress.",
      "",
      "Now the NIH is starting to determine how to allocate an additional $662 million of funding for long COVID research, $300 million of which is earmarked for clinical trials. These funds will be allocated over the next 4 years. At the end of October, RECOVER issued a request for clinical trial ideas that look at potential therapies, including medications, saying its goal is \"to work rapidly, collaboratively, and transparently to advance treatments for long COVID.\"",
      "",
      "This turn suggests the NIH has begun to respond to patients. This has stirred cautious optimism among those who say that the agency's approach to long COVID has lacked urgency in the search for effective treatments. Stone calls this $300 million a down payment. She warns it's going to take a lot more money to help people like Hayes regain some degree of health. \"There really is a burden to make up this lost time now,\" Stone said.",
      "",
      "The NIH told KFF Health News and NPR via email that it recognizes the urgency in finding treatments. But to do that, there needs to be an understanding of the biological mechanisms that are making people sick, which is difficult to do with post-infectious conditions.",
      "",
      "That's why it has funded research into how long COVID affects lung function, or trying to understand why only some people are afflicted with the condition.",
      "",
      "Good Science Takes Time",
      "",
      "In December 2020, Congress appropriated $1.15 billion for the NIH to launch RECOVER, raising hopes in the long COVID patient community.",
      "",
      "Then-NIH Director Francis Collins, MD, PhD, explained that RECOVER's goal was to better understand long COVID as a disease and that clinical trials of potential treatments would come later.",
      "",
      "According to RECOVER's website, it has funded eight clinical trials to test the safety and effectiveness of an experimental treatment or intervention. Just one of those trials has published results.",
      "",
      "On the other hand, RECOVER has supported more than 200 observational studies, such as research on how long COVID affects pulmonary function and on which symptoms are most common. And the initiative has funded more than 40 pathobiology studies, which focus on the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms of long COVID.",
      "",
      "RECOVER's website says this research has led to crucial insights on the risk factors for developing long COVID and on understanding how the disease interacts with preexisting conditions.",
      "",
      "It notes that observational studies are important in helping scientists to design and launch evidence-based clinical trials.",
      "",
      "Good science takes time, said Leora Horwitz, MD, the co-principal investigator for the RECOVER-Adult Observational Cohort at New York University (NYU). And long COVID is an \"exceedingly complicated\" illness that appears to affect nearly every organ system, she said.",
      "",
      "This makes it more difficult to study than many other diseases. Because long COVID harms the body in so many ways, with widely variable symptoms, it's harder to identify precise targets for treatment.",
      "",
      "\"I also will remind you that we're only 3, 4 years into this pandemic for most people,\" Horwitz said. \"We've been spending much more money than this, yearly, for 30, 40 years on other conditions.\"",
      "",
      "NYU received nearly $470 million of RECOVER funds in 2021, which the institution is using to spearhead the collection of data and biospecimens from up to 40,000 patients. Horwitz said nearly 30,000 are enrolled so far.",
      "",
      "This vast repository, Horwitz said, supports ongoing observational research, allowing scientists to understand what is happening biologically to people who don't recover after an initial infection  --  and that will help determine which clinical trials for treatments are worth undertaking.",
      "",
      "\"Simply trying treatments because they are available without any evidence about whether or why they may be effective reduces the likelihood of successful trials and may put patients at risk of harm,\" she said.",
      "",
      "Delayed Hopes or Incremental Progress?",
      "",
      "The NIH told KFF Health News and NPR that patients and caregivers have been central to RECOVER from the beginning, \"playing critical roles in designing studies and clinical trials, responding to surveys, serving on governance and publication groups, and guiding the initiative.\" But the consensus from patient advocacy groups is that RECOVER should have done more to prioritize clinical trials from the outset. Patients also say RECOVER leadership ignored their priorities and experiences when determining which studies to fund.",
      "",
      "RECOVER has scored some gains, said JD Davids, co-director of Long COVID Justice. This includes findings on differences in long COVID between adults and kids. But Davids said the NIH shouldn't have named the initiative \"RECOVER,\" since it wasn't designed as a streamlined effort to develop treatments.",
      "",
      "\"The name's a little cruel and misleading,\" he said.",
      "",
      "RECOVER's initial allocation of $1.15 billion probably wasn't enough to develop a new medication to treat long COVID, said Ezekiel J. Emanuel, MD, PhD, co-director of the University of Pennsylvania's Healthcare Transformation Institute.",
      "",
      "But, he said, the results of preliminary clinical trials could have spurred pharmaceutical companies to fund more studies on drug development and test how existing drugs influence a patient's immune response.",
      "",
      "Emanuel is one of the authors of a March 2022 COVID roadmap report. He notes that RECOVER's lack of focus on new treatments was a problem. \"Only 15% of the budget is for clinical studies. That is a failure in itself  --  a failure of having the right priorities,\" he told KFF Health News and NPR via email.",
      "",
      "And though the NYU biobank has been impactful, Emanuel said there needs to be more focus on how existing drugs influence immune response.",
      "",
      "He said some clinical trials that RECOVER has funded are \"ridiculous,\" because they've focused on symptom amelioration, for example to study the benefits of over-the-counter medication to improve sleep. Other studies looked at non-pharmacological interventions, such as exercise and \"brain training\" to help with cognitive fog.",
      "",
      "People with long COVID say this type of clinical research contributes to what many describe as the \"gaslighting\" they experience from doctors, who sometimes blame a patient's symptoms on anxiety or depression, rather than acknowledging long COVID as a real illness with a physiological basis.",
      "",
      "\"I'm just disgusted,\" said long COVID patient Hayes. \"You wouldn't tell somebody with diabetes to breathe through it.\"",
      "",
      "Chim\u00e9re L. Sweeney, director and founder of the Black Long COVID Experience, said she's even taken breaks from seeking treatment after getting fed up with being told that her symptoms were due to her diet or mental health.",
      "",
      "\"You're at the whim of somebody who may not even understand the spectrum of long COVID,\" Sweeney said.",
      "",
      "Insurance Battles Over Experimental Treatments",
      "",
      "Since there are still no long COVID treatments approved by the FDA, anything a physician prescribes is classified as either experimental  --  for unproven treatments  --  or an off-label use of a drug approved for other conditions. This means patients can struggle to get insurance to cover prescriptions.",
      "",
      "Michael Brode, MD, medical director for UT Health Austin's Post-COVID-19 Program  --  said he writes many appeal letters. And some people pay for their own treatment.",
      "",
      "For example, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, low-dose naltrexone, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy are all promising treatments, he said.",
      "",
      "For hyperbaric oxygen, two small, randomized controlled studies show improvements for the chronic fatigue and brain fog that often plague long COVID patients. The theory is that higher oxygen concentration and increased air pressure can help heal tissues that were damaged during a COVID infection.",
      "",
      "However, the out-of-pocket cost for a series of sessions in a hyperbaric chamber can run as much as $8,000, Brode said.",
      "",
      "\"Am I going to look a patient in the eye and say, 'You need to spend that money for an unproven treatment'?\" he said. \"I don't want to hype up a treatment that is still experimental. But I also don't want to hide it.\"",
      "",
      "There's a host of pharmaceuticals that have promising off-label uses for long COVID, said microbiologist Amy Proal, PhD, president and chief scientific officer at the Massachusetts-based PolyBio Research Foundation. For instance, she's collaborating on a clinical study that repurposes two HIV drugs to treat long COVID.",
      "",
      "Proal said research on treatments can move forward based on what's already understood about the disease. For instance, she said that scientists have evidence  --  partly due to RECOVER research  --  that some patients continue to harbor small amounts of viral material after a COVID infection. She has not received RECOVER funds but is researching antivirals.",
      "",
      "But to vet a range of possible treatments for the millions suffering now  --  and to develop new drugs specifically targeting long COVID  --  clinical trials are needed. And that requires money.",
      "",
      "Hayes said she would definitely volunteer for an investigational drug trial. For now, though, \"in order to not be absolutely miserable,\" she said she focuses on what she can do, like having dinner with her family. At the same time, Hayes doesn't want to spend the rest of her life on a beige couch.",

The Flemish nationalist was only given a shot at successfully brokering a coalition because the PS socialists, De Wever's political nemesis, lost their generations-long grip on Wallonia. It allowed him to get a deal with a free-market MR party.",
      "In Flanders, the Vooruit socialist party will have to make sure the cornerstones of Belgium's welfare society survive. The government program is set to cut social benefits in an attempt to tackle the nation\u2019s debt-burdened budget. Overall, the nation has debt totaling just over 100% of GDP, putting it among the worst in the 27-nation EU.",
      "With Vooruit on board, the francophone MR liberals, the centrist CD&V and Engages and the N-VA complete the coalition, controlling 81 of 150 seats in the House for a comfortable majority.",
      "The length of coalition talks highlighted however how difficult it was to bridge fundamental gaps between the different parties."

      "ISLAMABAD -- A police officer working on Pakistan's first polio vaccination drive of the year was shot and killed by unidentified gunmen Monday, police said.",
      "Pakistan deployed thousands of police officers to protect health workers who go house-to-house to inoculate children and are targeted by militants who falsely claim the vaccination campaigns are a Western conspiracy to sterilize children.",
      "The police officer was killed in Jamrud, a district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan, local police official Jamshed Khan said.",
      "More than 200 polio workers and police assigned for their protection have been killed in Pakistan since the 1990s, according to health officials and authorities. In December, a roadside bomb exploded near a vehicle carrying police officers assigned to protect polio workers in the restive northwest, killing three officers and wounding two others.",
      "Though militant groups have stopped claiming attacks on polio workers and police escorting them, authorities say Pakistani Taliban and other breakaway factions of Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, have been behind such attacks. The TTP is an ally of the Afghan Taliban who seized power in Afghanistan in 2021.",
      "Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif launched the vaccination campaign Sunday when he met with medical staff and representatives of international aid agencies and vowed that Pakistan would win the war against polio.

      "Ayesha Raza Farooq, the prime minister\u2019s adviser for polio eradication, urged parents to cooperate with the polio workers to protect their children from the disease.",
      "Polio is an infection caused by a virus that mostly affects children under 5.

In severe cases, polio can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis within hours, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan are the only two countries where the virus has never been stopped. Pakistan reported one case in January and had 77 cases last year. Afghanistan had 23 cases in 2024, according to WHO data.",

    "summary": "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio says El Salvador&rsquo;s president has offered to accept deportees from the U.S. of any nationality, including violent American criminals now imprisoned in the United States",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio says El Salvador\u2019s president has offered to accept deportees from the U.S. of any nationality, including violent American criminals now imprisoned in the United States",
      "SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador -- U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said late Monday that El Salvador's president has offered to accept deportees from the U.S. of any nationality, including violent American criminals now imprisoned in the United States.",
      "President Nayib Bukele \u201chas agreed to the most unprecedented, extraordinary, extraordinary migratory agreement anywhere in the world,\u201d Rubio said at a signing ceremony for an unrelated civil nuclear agreement with El Salvador's foreign minister.",
      "\"He's also offered to do the same for dangerous criminals currently in custody and serving their sentence in the United States even though they\u2019re U.S. citizens or legal residents,\u201d Rubio said. He had just met with Bukele at his lakeside country house outside San Salvador for several hours.",
      "After Rubio spoke, a U.S. official said the Trump administration had no current plans to try to deport American citizens, but said Bukele's offer was significant. The U.S. government cannot deport American citizens and such a move would be met with significant legal challenges.",
      "Rubio was visiting El Salvador to press a friendly government to do more to meet Trump administration demands for a major crackdown on immigration amid turmoil in Washington over the status of the government\u2019s main foreign development agency.",
      "He arrived in San Salvador shortly after watching a U.S.-funded deportation flight with 43 migrants leave from Panama for Colombia. That came a day after Rubio delivered a warning to Panama that unless the government moved immediately to reduce or eliminate China's presence at the Panama Canal, the U.S. would act to do so.",
      "Migration, though, was the main issue of the day, as it will be for the next stops on Rubio's five-nation Central American tour of Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic after Panama and El Salvador.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration prioritizes stopping people from making the journey to the United States and has worked with regional countries to boost immigration enforcement on their borders as well as to accept deportees from the United States.",
      "The agreement Rubio described for El Salvador to accept foreign nationals arrested in the United States for violating U.S. immigration laws is known as a \u201csafe third country\u201d agreement. That would mean the U.S. could deport non-Salvadorean migrants to El Salvador.",
      "Officials have suggested this might be an option for Venezuelan gang members convicted of crimes in the United States should Venezuela refuse to accept them, but Rubio said Bukele's offer was for detainees of any nationality.",
      "Rubio said Bukele then went further and said his country was willing to accept and to jail U.S. citizens or legal residents convicted of and imprisoned for violent crimes.",
      "Human rights activists have warned that El Salvador lacks a consistent policy for the treatment of asylum seekers and refugees and that such an agreement might not be limited to violent criminals.",
      "Manuel Flores, the secretary general of the leftist opposition party Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front, criticized the \u201csafe third country\u201d plan, saying it would signal that the region is Washington\u2019s \u201cbackyard to dump the garbage.\u201d",
      "The deportation flight Rubio watched being loaded in Panama City was carrying migrants detained by Panamanian authorities after illegally crossing the Darien Gap from Colombia. The State Department says such deportations send a message of deterrence. The U.S. has provided Panama with financial assistance to the tune of almost $2.7 million in flights and tickets since an agreement was signed to fund them.",
      "Rubio was on the tarmac for the departure of the flight, which was taking 32 men and 11 women back to Colombia. It\u2019s unusual for a secretary of state to personally witness such a law enforcement operation, especially in front of cameras.",
      "\u201cMass migration is one of the great tragedies in the modern era,\u201d Rubio said, speaking afterward in a nearby building. \u201cIt impacts countries throughout the world. We recognize that many of the people who seek mass migration are often victims and victimized along the way, and it\u2019s not good for anyone.\u201d",
      "Monday\u2019s deportation flight came as Trump has been threatening action against nations that will not accept flights of their nationals from the United States, and he briefly hit Colombia with penalties last week for initially refusing to accept two flights. Panama has been more cooperative and has allowed flights of third-country deportees to land and sent migrants back before they reach the United States.",
      "\u201cThis is an effective way to stem the flow of illegal migration, of mass migration, which is destructive and destabilizing,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAnd it would have been impossible to do without the strong partnership we have here with our friends and allies in Panama. And we\u2019re going to continue to do it.\u201d",
      "His trip comes amid a sweeping freeze in U.S. foreign assistance and stop-work orders that have shut down U.S.-funded programs targeting illegal migration and crime in Central American countries. The State Department said Sunday that Rubio had approved waivers for certain critical programs in countries he is visiting, but details of those were not immediately available.",
      "While Rubio was out of the country, staffers of the U.S. Agency for International Development were instructed Monday to stay out of the agency\u2019s Washington headquarters after billionaire Elon Musk announced Trump had agreed with him to shut the agency.",
      "Thousands of USAID employees already had been laid off and programs shut down. Rubio told reporters in San Salvador that he was now the acting administrator of USAID but had delegated that authority so he would not be running its day-to-day operations.",
      "The change means that USAID is no longer an independent government agency as it had been for decades \u2014 although its new status will likely be challenged in court \u2014 and will be run out of the State Department by department officials.",
      "In his remarks, Rubio stressed that some and perhaps many USAID programs would continue in the new configuration but that the switch was necessary because the agency had become unaccountable to the executive branch and Congress.",
      "On his weekend discussion with Panama's president on the Panama Canal, Rubio said he was hopeful that the Panamanians would heed his and Trump's warnings on China. Panamanians have bristled at Trump's insistence on retaking control of the American-built canal, which the U.S. turned over in 1999, although they have agreed to pull out of a Chinese infrastructure and development initiative.",
      "\u201cI understand that it\u2019s a delicate issue in Panama,\u201d Rubio told reporters in San Salvador. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have a hostile and negative relationship with Panama,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we do. And we had a frank and respectful conversation, and I hope it\u2019ll yield fruits and result in the days to come.\u201d",
      "But back in Washington, Trump was less diplomatic, saying: \"China\u2019s involved with the Panama Canal. They won\u2019t be for long and that\u2019s the way it has to be.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe either want it back, or we\u2019re going to get something very strong, or we\u2019re going to take it back,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cAnd China will be dealt with.\u201d",
      "As he has in the past, Trump again criticized the Carter administration for having signed a 1970s treaty to cede control of the canal to Panama and said it was a pact that Panama has since \u201ctotally violated.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve agreed to certain things, but I\u2019m not happy with it,\u201d Trump said.",

      "Denmark\u2019s prime minister insists Greenland is not for sale and is calling for a robust show of support from her European Union partners should U.S. President Donald Trump press ahead with his threat to take control of the island",
      "BRUSSELS -- Denmark\u2019s prime minister insisted on Monday that Greenland is not for sale and called for a robust response from her European Union partners should U.S. President Donald Trump press ahead with his threat to take control of the island.",
      "\u201cI will never support the idea of fighting allies. But of course, if the U.S. puts tough terms on Europe, we need a collective and robust response,\u201d Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told reporters in Brussels as EU leaders gathered for defense talks.",
      "Greenland, home to a large U.S. military base, is an autonomous territory of Denmark, a longtime U.S. ally. Last month, Trump left open the possibility that the American military might be used to secure Greenland, as well as the Panama Canal. \u201cWe need Greenland for national security purposes,\u201d he said.",
      "Frederiksen said she has \u201cgreat support\u201d from her EU partners on the fact \u201cthat everybody has to respect the sovereignty of all national states in the world, and that Greenland is today a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. It\u2019s part of our territory and it\u2019s not for sale.\u201d",
      "She acknowledged U.S. concerns about security in the Arctic Region, where Russia and China have been increasingly active.",
      "\u201cI totally agree with the Americans that the High North, that the Arctic region is becoming more and more important when we are talking about defense and security and deterrence,\u201d Frederiksen said, adding that the U.S. and Denmark could have \u201cstronger footprints\u201d in Greenland, in security terms.",
      "\u201cThey are already there and they can have more possibilities,\u201d she said, underlining that Denmark itself can also \u201cscale up\u201d its security presence. \u201cIf this is about securing our part of the world, we can find a way forward,\u201d Frederiksen said.",
      "Last week, her government announced a roughly 14.6 billion kroner (nearly $2 billion) agreement with parties including the governments of Greenland and the Faeroe Islands to \u201cimprove capabilities for surveillance and maintaining sovereignty in the region.\u201d",
      "It would include three new Arctic naval vessels, two additional long-range surveillance drones and satellite capacity, the Defense Ministry in Copenhagen said.",
      "Frederiksen's remarks came as EU leaders met for defense talks but with no clear sign yet from Trump about how he intends to try to end Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. The Europeans fear that any attempt to pull together a quick deal would not be favorable to Ukraine.",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte were set to join the bloc\u2019s 27 leaders at a self-styled \u201cretreat\u201d at Egmont Place in the Belgian capital. The summit agenda focuses on EU-U.S. cooperation, military spending and ramping up Europe\u2019s defense industry.",
      "The meeting comes as Europe\u2019s biggest land conflict since World War II approaches its third anniversary, and with confidence in Trump shaky as he threatens his allies with tariffs. Trump already slapped duties on European steel and aluminum during his first term.",
      "\u201cWe were listening carefully to those words, and of course we are preparing also on our side,\" EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said. But, she underlined, \"there are no winners in trade wars. If \u2026 the U.S. starts a trade war, then the one laughing on the side is China. We are very interlinked.\u201d",

      "London Zoo is celebrating the birth of 33 tiny endangered froglets after they traveled thousands of miles from the forests of southern Chile to London",
      "LONDON -- It was quite the journey for such tiny froglets: traveling thousands of miles from the forests of southern Chile to London, carried and brooded inside their fathers' vocal sacs for safety.",
      "London Zoo said Monday that 33 endangered Darwin's frogs, named after scientist Charles Darwin who discovered the species, were born in their new home as part of a rescue mission to save the species from extinction.",
      "Known populations of Darwin's frogs have suffered a 90% decline within a year since a deadly disease known as chytrid fungus arrived in 2023 in their habitat, the Parque Tantauco forests in southern Chile. The fungus has affected hundreds of amphibian species around the world.",
      "The creatures have a unique reproductive strategy: after the females lay eggs, the male frogs protect and rear the tiny tadpoles inside their distensible vocal sacs for them to develop in safety.",
      "A team of conservationists traveled to Chile's forests in October in search of healthy Darwin's frogs free of the infectious disease. They collected 52 frogs, which were then placed in climate-controlled boxes for a 7,000-mile (11,265 kilometers) ride by boat, car and plane to their new home in London.",
      "Of the group, 11 male frogs \u2014 each measuring under 3 centimeters (1.2 inches) \u2014 carried 33 tadpoles that were born at the zoo.",
      "\u201cWe knew we were embarking on something special \u2014 the clock was ticking, and we needed to act quickly if we were going to save these frogs,\u201d said Ben Tapley, curator of amphibians at London Zoo.",

      "ROME -- Pope Francis convened a high-level summit Monday to demand that children be protected from war, forced labor, trafficking and exploitation, throwing his moral authority behind a global initiative to uphold children's fundamental rights despite the Catholic Church\u2019s own poor record in protecting them from sexual abuse.",
      "Queen Rania of Jordan opened the summit, recalling that the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child is the most widely ratified human rights convention in history but is hardly enforced on an equal plane.",
      "\u201cIn theory, the global consensus is clear: every right, for every child,\u201d she told the gathering in the Apostolic Palace. \u201cYet, so many children around the world are excluded from its promise -\u2013 particularly in warzones. Worse yet, people have grown desensitized to their pain.\u201d",
      "She cited a psychological study on Gaza\u2019s most vulnerable children, after more than a year of living through the Israel-Hamas war, that found 96% believed their death was imminent, and half said they wanted to die. \u201cHow did we let our humanity come to this?\u201d she asked.",
      "Italian Sen. Liliana Segre, a 94-year-old Holocaust survivor, told the gathering that she was denied the right to education when Italy\u2019s fascist-era racial laws went into effect in 1938 and Jewish children were barred from school.",
      "\u201cWe were surrounded by an indifference that sometimes is worse than violence,\u201d she said.",

      "Francis, for his part, listed the tragic summary of plights facing hundreds of millions of today\u2019s children: conflicts, homelessness, trafficking and compulsory marriage. He also referred to the 150 million stateless or \u201cinvisible\u201d children who were not registered at birth or have no documents when they migrate.",

Convention on the Rights of the Child, the U.N. treaty ratified by 196 countries which sets out the fundamental rights all children enjoy, including the right to life, nationality, freedom of thought and religion, health and education.

      "In 2014, the committee overseeing its implementation strongly criticized the Holy See for the global sex abuse and cover-up scandal and asked the Vatican to report back on implementing its recommendations by 2017.

      "More recently, a group of U.N. special rapporteurs who monitor specific human rights problems wrote to the Holy See in 2021 expressing concern about \u201cpersistent\u201d cases of abuse, cover-up and obstruction by the Catholic Church in interfering with victims' efforts to pursue justice for their abuse.",

      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Keir Starmer travels to Brussels on Monday, becoming the first British prime minster to attend a European Union leaders\u2019 meeting since the U.K. left the bloc five years ago.",
      "Starmer will head to dinner with EU leaders at Brussels\u2019s neoclassical Egmont Palace walking a diplomatic and economic tightrope. He is seeking to rebuild ties with the EU while avoiding tariffs from protectionist U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Trump has slapped import taxes on the United States\u2019 biggest trading partners \u2014 Canada, Mexico and China \u2014 and says he will also impose tariffs on goods from the 27-nation EU, with which the U.S. has a trade deficit. His attitude to Britain is more ambiguous. Trump said early Monday that \u201cthe U.K. is out of line but \u2026 I think that one can be worked out.\u201d",
      "Starmer said Sunday that he had stressed to Trump that he wanted \u201ca strong trading relationship\u201d with the U.S.",
      "Trump\u2019s trade battles complicate Starmer\u2019s aim of a \u201creset\u201d with the EU after years of bitterness over Brexit. It\u2019s already complicated enough by Britain\u2019s domestic politics.",
      "Starmer wants to remove some of the red tape and other barriers to trade with the bloc imposed by Brexit, but has ruled out the two things that would make the most difference \u2014 rejoining the bloc\u2019s customs union or single market.",
      "He also has resisted EU pressure for a youth mobility deal that would let young people from Britain and the EU live and work in the other\u2019s territory for a time.",
      "Starmer\u2019s center-left Labour Party government is wary of riling populist politicians like Reform U.K. leader Nigel Farage, who is poised to pounce on any perceived \u201cbetrayal\u201d of Brexit.",
      "Starmer is aiming for relatively modest changes such as a making it easier for artists to tour and for professionals to have their qualifications recognized, and seeking closer cooperation on law enforcement and security.",
      "Ahead of the meeting in Brussels, Starmer said he would stress the importance of \u201ckeeping up the pressure\u201d with sanctions on Russia to squeeze its \u201cwar machine\u201d targeting Ukraine.",
      "Britain and the EU say they will hold a full leaders\u2019 summit later this year. Politicians in the bloc have welcomed the change of tone from Starmer\u2019s euroskeptic Conservative predecessors, but want concrete proposals, and inevitably compromises, from the U.K.",
      "Starmer is also due to meet NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte in Brussels for talks focused on support for Ukraine. Trump\u2019s return to office has raised questions over U.S. support for Kyiv \u2014 and for the trans-Atlantic military alliance itself. Trump has said that NATO countries should spend at least 5% of their GDPs on defense, up from the current 2% target. He also has not ruled out using military force to seize control of Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO member Denmark.",
      "Britain spends 2.3% of GDP on defense and says it will increase it to 2.5%.",

      "France's prime minister has used special executive powers to get the 2025 budget approved without a vote by lawmakers",
      "PARIS -- French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou used special executive powers Monday to get the country's 2025 budget approved without a vote by lawmakers, and now faces a no-confidence motion that threatens the survival of his 6-week-old government.",
      "Opposition parties were expected to file the no-confidence motion later Monday, and a vote is expected in the National Assembly on Wednesday.",
      "That may provide France with a budget at last, or send the country into new political and economic turmoil. Bayrou's survival depends on how many parties agree to support the motion. He is France\u2019s fourth prime minister in little over a year.",
      "French politics have been in disarray since President Emmanuel Macron called snap elections last year that left no party with a majority in parliament. With one of the world's biggest economies, France\u2019s failure to pass a budget has worried investors and hurt the 20-country eurozone.",
      "France is also under pressure from the European Union to reduce its huge debt and deficit.",
      "For Macron, this is a particularly bad time for France to be weakened. U.S. President Donald Trump is threatening new tariffs on the EU and making designs on Greenland, and Russia is growing more emboldened in Ukraine.",
      "After weeks of debate, French lawmakers on Monday debated the conclusions of a joint Parliamentary committee on the state budget.",
      "The previous government collapsed over its budget plans, which included slashing 40 billion euros ($42 billion) in spending and raising taxes by 20 billion euros. Bayrou\u2019s revised version has addressed some concerns from opposition lawmakers.",
      "The joint committee has kept an extra tax on large companies while increasing a tax on financial transactions. And Bayrou agreed not to cut 4,000 jobs in national education as previously envisaged.",
      "But opposition parties said that wasn't enough. So Bayrou, who has no majority at the National Assembly, used a constitutional tool known as Article 49.3 that allows the government to pass legislation without a parliamentary vote. It is rarely used for a budget.",
      "The hard-left party France Unbowed said it would file a no-confidence motion over Bayrou\u2019s move.",
      "To pass, a no-confidence motion needs at least half the votes in the 577-seat Assembly. France Unbowed's measure will likely have the support of Communist and Green lawmakers, but that\u2019s not enough.",
      "The vote of the Socialists could be decisive. The Socialist Party said Monday that it would not vote to bring down the Bayrou government because \u201cit\u2019s time to give France a budget.\u201d Yet some lawmakers may not follow the party\u2019s instructions.",
      "Far-right leader Marine Le Pen was instrumental in ousting the previous government. Her National Rally party has the largest single group in France\u2019s lower house of parliament, and said it will give its lawmakers instructions Wednesday on how to vote.",
      "If Bayrou is voted out, Macron would face the prospect of finding a new prime minister once again and forming another government capable of finding consensus on the budget.",
      "Something similar happened in December, when a confidence motion triggered by budget disputes forced conservative Prime Minister Michel Barnier to resign.",
      "Barnier was named to solve the political impasse created by last year\u2019s elections. But his proposed austerity budget only deepened divisions.",
      "Macron then tapped the veteran centrist Bayrou in the hope he could bridge divides.",
      "Unlike Barnier, Bayrou has held intense negotiations with the Socialists aimed at reaching a non-aggression deal over the budget under which they would agree not to undercut each other."

      "Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa said Monday that the 27% tariff to be applied on Mexican goods was aimed at boosting local manufacturers.

      "The Trump administration\u2019s unprecedented freeze on foreign aid has caused chaos and uncertainty in a camp holding thousands of people with alleged links to the Islamic State group in Syria",
      "AL-HOL, Syria -- Ahmad Abdullah Hammoud was lucky to have some food stored to feed his family after a U.S.-funded organization abruptly suspended its aid activities at the sprawling tent camp in northeastern Syria where they have been forced to stay for nearly six years.",
      "His family is among 37,000 people, mostly women and children, with alleged ties to the Islamic State group at the bleak, trash-strewn al-Hol camp, where the Trump administration\u2019s unprecedented freeze on foreign aid caused chaos and uncertainty and worsened the dire humanitarian conditions.",
      "Human rights groups have for years cited poor living conditions and pervasive violence in the camp, which houses mostly wives and children of IS fighters as well as supporters of the militant group.",
      "When the freeze was announced shortly after Trump took office, U.S.-funded aid programs worldwide began shutting down operations, including the organization that runs many operations at al-Hol, which works under the supervision of the U.S.-led coalition formed to fight IS.",
      "The U.S.-based Blumont briefly suspended operations, according to the camp's director. It had been providing essentials such as bread, water, kerosene and cooking gas. Blumont didn't reply to questions.",
      "\u201cWe were troubled when Blumont suspended its activities,\" said Hammoud, who denies links with IS and had been sheltering in an IS-controlled area after being displaced during Syria's civil war.",
      "\u201cBelieve me, we did not find food. Even bread only came at 2 p.m,\u201d said another camp resident, Dirar al-Ali.",
      "Camp director Jihan Hanan told The Associated Press that other aid agencies, including the World Health Organization, had ceased some operations.",
      "\u201cIt is a disgraceful decision,\u201d Hanan said of the Trump administration's action, adding that some residents argued they should be allowed to leave if food cannot be provided.",
      "She said Blumont distributes 5,000 bags of bread daily at a cost of about $4,000, something that local authorities in the Kurdish-run enclave cannot afford.",
      "Hanan said Blumont received a two-week waiver from the Trump administration and resumed work on Jan. 28. It is not clear what will happen once the waiver ends.",
      "Mazloum Abdi, the commander of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces that control northeastern Syria, said he has raised the aid freeze issue with officials from the U.S.-led coalition.",
      "\u201cWe are on the verge of finding an alternative to this decision,\u201d Abdi said, adding that an exemption might be issued for northeastern Syria.",
      "The U.S. freeze comes as IS tries to take advantage of the vacuum created by the fall of Assad\u2019s government in early December to insurgents. Another cut in food supplies could lead to riots by camp residents that IS, which has sleeper cells there, could exploit.",
      "Hanan said the camp had received information from the U.S.-led coalition against IS, the Iraqi government and the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led SDF, that IS was preparing to attack the camp after Assad\u2019s fall. Security was increased and the situation is under control, she said.",
      "The SDF runs 28 detention facilities in northeastern Syria holding some 9,000 IS members. Security at al-Hol camp and the detention facilities are not expected to be affected by the U.S. aid freeze, according to Hanan and an official at the largest detention facility in the northeastern city of Hassakeh, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.",
      "The main part of al-Hol houses some 16,000 Iraqis and 15,000 Syrians. In a separate, heavily guarded section known as the Annex are another 6,300 people from 42 countries, the vast majority of them wives, widows and children who are considered the most die-hard IS supporters.",
      "The camp has no paved roads and piles of trash. Teenagers and children with almost nothing to do spend their time playing soccer or wandering around.",
      "Children in the Annex threw stones at visiting AP journalists and shouted \u201cYou are a Satan\" and \u201cThe Islamic State is lasting.\u201d",
      "A Chinese woman in the Annex, who identified herself as Asmaa Ahmad and said she came from the western region of Xinjiang, described her husband as \u201can Islamic State martyr\u201d killed in 2019 in the eastern Syrian village of Baghouz, where IS lost the last sliver of land it once controlled.",
      "Ahmad, who is in the camp with her four children, said she does not want to go back to China, fearing persecution. Asked about the temporary loss of U.S. aid, she replied: \u201cSustenance is from God.\u201d",
      "She said she is waiting for IS members to rescue her family one day.",
      "Al-Hol is the most dangerous place in the world, camp director Hanan asserted, adding that countries should repatriate their citizens to prevent children being fed the extremist ideology. \u201cThis place is not suitable for children,\u201d she said.",
      "The U.S. military has been pushing for years for countries who have citizens at al-Hol and the smaller, separate Roj Camp to repatriate them.",
      "\u201cWithout international repatriation, rehabilitation and reintegration efforts, these camps risk creating the next generation of ISIS,\u201d Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, head of U.S. Central Command, said during a visit to al-Hol in mid-January.",
      "Hanan said that since the fall of Assad, many Syrians in the camp have expressed a desire to return to their homes in areas held by the country\u2019s new rulers. She said camp authorities decided that any Syrian who wants to leave can go.",
      "Even if the camp population drops, \u201cthere will be a disaster\" if U.S. aid is suspended again, she added."

      "Since the start of the M23 rebels\u2019 offensive on Goma on Jan. 26, more than 700 people have been killed and nearly 3,000 have been wounded in the city and its vicinity, officials say. Bethesda hospital alone said it receives more than 100 new patients each day, overstretching its capacity of 250 beds.",
      "Bethesda is one of several hospitals in Goma that The Associated Press visited that has inadequate personnel and supplies. The city hosts many of the close to 6.5 million people displaced by the conflict, which is one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises.",

      "The popular Greek holiday island of Santorini is taking emergency measures in response to intense seismic activity",
      "SANTORINI, Greece -- Schools were closed and emergency crews deployed on the volcanic Greek island of Santorini on Monday after a spike in seismic activity raised concerns about a potentially powerful earthquake.",
      "Precautions were also ordered on several nearby Aegean Sea islands \u2014 all popular summer vacation destinations \u2014 after more than 200 undersea earthquakes were recorded in the area over the past three days.",
      "\u201cWe have a very intense geological phenomenon to handle,\u201d Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said from Brussels, where he was attending a European meeting. \"I want to ask our islanders first and foremost to remain calm, to listen to the instructions of the Civil Protection (authority).\"",
      "Mobile phones on the island blared with alert warnings about the potential for rockslides, while several earthquakes caused loud rumbles. Authorities banned access to some seaside areas, including the island's old port, that are in close proximity to cliffs.",
      "\u201cThese measures are precautionary, and authorities will remain vigilant,\u201d Civil Protection Minister Vasilis Kikilias said late Sunday following an emergency government meeting in Athens. \u201cWe urge citizens to strictly adhere to safety recommendations to minimize risk.\u201d",
      "While Greek experts say the quakes, many with magnitudes over 4.5, are not linked to Santorini\u2019s volcano, they acknowledge that the pattern of seismic activity is cause for concern.",
      "Government officials met with scientists throughout the weekend and on Monday to assess the situation, while schools were also ordered shut on the nearby islands of Amorgos, Anafi and Ios.",
      "The frequency of the quakes, which continued throughout Sunday night and into Monday, has worried residents and visitors.",
      "\u201cI have never felt anything like this and with such frequency \u2014 an earthquake every 10 or 20 minutes. Everyone is anxious even if some of us hide it not to cause panic, but everyone is worried,\" said Michalis Gerontakis, who is also the director of the Santorini Philharmonic Orchestra.",
      "\u201cWe came out yesterday and performed. Despite the earthquakes, the philharmonic performed for a religious occasion,\u201d Gerontakis said. \"When you are playing, you cannot feel the quakes but there were earthquakes when we were at the church. No one can knows what will happen. People can say whatever they like, but that has no value. You cannot contend with nature.\u201d",
      "Residents and visitors were advised to avoid large indoor gatherings and areas where rock slides could occur, while hotels were instructed to drain swimming pools to reduce potential building damage from an earthquake.",
      "Fire service rescuers who arrived on the island on Sunday set up yellow tents as a staging area inside a basketball court next to the island's main hospital.",
      "\u201cWe arrived last night, a 26-member team of rescuers and one rescue dog,\" said fire brigadier Ioannis Billias, adding that many residents, including entire families, spent the night in their cars.",
      "Some residents and local workers headed to travel agents seeking plane or ferry tickets to leave the island.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had earthquakes before but never anything like this. This feels different,\" said Nadia Benomar, a Moroccan tour guide who has lived on the island for 19 years. She bought a ferry ticket Monday for the nearby island of Naxos.",
      "\u201cI need to get away for a few days until things calm down,\u201d she said.",
      "Others said they were willing to take the risk. Restaurant worker Yiannis Fragiadakis had been away but said he returned to Santorini on Sunday despite the earthquakes.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t afraid. I know that people are really worried and are leaving, and when I got to the port it was really busy, it was like the summer,\" Fragiadakis said. \"I plan to stay and hopefully the restaurant will start working (for the holiday season) in three weeks.\u201d",
      "South Korean tourist Soo Jin Kim, from Seoul, arrived Sunday on a family vacation.",
      "\u201cWe had dinner last night at the hotel and felt mild shakes about 10 times. But at midnight we felt a big one, a big shake so I checked the news report we are half-worried and half-looking to see what the situation is,\u201d she said, adding she didn't plan to change her travel plans.",
      "Crescent-shaped Santorini is a premier tourism destination with daily arrivals via commercial flights, ferries, and cruise ships. The island draws more than 3 million visitors annually to its whitewashed villages built along dramatic cliffs formed by a massive volcanic eruption \u2014 considered to be one of the largest in human history \u2014 more than 3,500 years ago.",
      "That eruption, which occurred around 1620 B.C., destroyed a large part of the island, blanketed a wide area in meters (feet) of ash and is believed to have contributed to the decline of the ancient Minoan civilization, which had flourished in the region.",
      "Although it is still an active volcano, the last notable eruption occurred in 1950.",
      "Prominent Greek seismologist Gerasimos Papadopoulos cautioned that the current earthquake sequence \u2013 displayed on live seismic maps as a growing cluster of dots between the islands of Santorini, Ios, Amorgos, and Anafi \u2014 could indicate a larger impending event.",
      "\u201cAll scenarios remain open,\u201d Papadopoulos wrote in an online post. \u201cThe number of tremors has increased, magnitudes have risen, and epicenters have shifted northeast. While these are tectonic quakes, not volcanic, the risk level has escalated.\u201d",
      "In Santorini\u2019s main town of Fira, local authorities designated gathering points for residents in preparation for a potential evacuation, though Mayor Nikos Zorzos emphasized the preventive nature of the measures.",
      "\u201cWe are obliged to make preparations. But being prepared for something does not mean it will happen,\u201d he said during a weekend briefing. \u201cSometimes, the way the situation is reported, those reports may contain exaggerations... so people should stay calm.\u201d",

      "North Korea has lashed out at U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio for calling it a \u201crogue\u201d state and warned that such remarks will never contribute to U.S. interests",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- In its first direct criticism of the Trump administration, North Korea lashed out at U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio for calling it a \u201crogue\u201d state and warned Monday that such \u201ccoarse and nonsensical remarks\u201d will never contribute to U.S. interests.",
      "The statement is the latest in a series of North Korean signals that it will maintain its tough stance on the U.S. for now, though Trump has said he\u2019s intent on reaching out to its leader Kim Jong Un to revive diplomacy.",
      "\u201cThe hostile words and deeds of the person who is in charge of the U.S. foreign policy served as an occasion of confirming once again the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK which remains unchanged,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said, using the acronym of the country's official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.",
      "\u201cRubio\u2019s coarse and nonsensical remarks only show directly the incorrect view of the new U.S. administration on the DPRK and will never help promote the U.S. interests as he wishes,\u201d it said.",
      "The statement took issue with what the ministry called Rubio\u2019s branding of North Korea as a \u201crogue\u201d state in a media interview. It likely referred to Rubio\u2019s appearance on \u201cThe Megyn Kelly Show\u201d on Jan. 30, in which he called North Korea and Iran \u201crogue states\u201d as he addressed foreign policy challenges.",
      "It was not the first time for U.S. officials to describe North Korea as a rogue state. But the North\u2019s latest statement suggests the country won\u2019t likely quickly embrace Trump\u2019s overture.",
      "During a Fox News interview broadcast on Jan. 23, Trump called Kim \u201ca smart guy\u201d and \u201cnot a religious zealot.\u201d Asked whether he will reach out to Kim again, Trump replied, \u201cI will, yeah.\u201d",
      "Trump's comments raised prospects for a possible revival of diplomacy between the United States and North Korea, as Trump met Kim three times during his first term to discuss how to end Kim's nuclear program. Their earlier high-stakes diplomacy in 2018-19 broke down due to disputes over U.S.-led sanctions on North Korea, but Trump has still repeatedly boasted of his personal ties with Kim.",
      "North Korea hasn\u2019t directly responded to Trump\u2019s interview comments. But it has maintained its confrontational rhetoric against the U.S. and continued its weapons testing activities. Last week, Kim visited a facility to produce nuclear materials and called for boosting North Korea\u2019s nuclear capability in the face of what he called challenges posed by \u201chostile forces,\u201d an apparent reference to the U.S. and South Korea.",
      "Many experts say Kim likely thinks he now has greater leverage than before because of his expanded nuclear arsenal and deepening military ties with Russia.",
      "The previous diplomacy with Trump likely gave Kim a propaganda coup for winning the much-needed recognition of his government on the world stage. But the eventual collapse of diplomacy was still a huge embarrassment.",
      "Kim has since then focused on perfecting nuclear-capable missiles targeting the U.S. and South Korea.",
      "Last November, Kim said that his past negotiations with the United States only confirmed Washington\u2019s \u201cunchangeable\u201d hostility toward his country and described his nuclear buildup as the only way to counter external threats. During a key political meeting in December, Kim vowed to implement the \u201ctoughest\u201d anti-U.S. policy."

He promised in Tesla's investor conference call to start offering such robotaxis in June in Austin, Texas, and across the country by the end of next year.",
      "Speeding all that along will be Trump, or so the story goes, who has given Musk an office in the White House and made him the head of the new Department of Government Efficiency tasked with shrinking the size of the government.",
      "Trump\u2019s new transportation secretary, who can have a big impact on Tesla, is mostly sticking to the script. Sean Duffy has promised to cut excessive regulation on automakers as well as to come up with a single set of federal rules on self-driving technology to replace a patchwork of state-by-state ones that Musk has blasted for holding back development.",
      "Perhaps more importantly, Trump has softened his stance toward China, a big market for Tesla, hitting the country with an additional 10% tariffs starting Saturday, and not the 60% he threatened on the campaign trail. Still, Trump's decision to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico, as well as China, should affect Tesla. Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja said last week the company should feel an impact to its business because it sources parts from around the globe.",
      "Trump has also vowed to do other things that will hurt Musk\u2019s business.",
      "Tesla sources many of its parts from abroad and so Trump\u2019s decision to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico will hit the company hard if they stick.",
      "Trump also has vowed to eliminate a $7,500 federal tax rebate designed to get people to buy electric vehicles. He\u2019ll also lower emission standards, a potential blow to Tesla\u2019s business of selling \u201cregulatory credits\u201d to car makers that pollute more and fall short of the requirements. Tesla sold $692 million of these credits i n the last three months of 2024, a 60% jump from a year ago, revenue that nearly all flows straight to Tesla\u2019s bottom line.",
      "It\u2019s also unclear whether the Trump administration will hold off on investigations into Tesla, in particular a technology the company calls Full Self-Driving, a misnomer because the vehicles could require human intervention at any moment. In October, the transportation department\u2019s auto safety regulator, the National Traffic Highway Safety Administration, launched the latest of several probes into the technology after getting reports of crashes in low-visibility conditions, including one that killed a pedestrian.",
      "Transportation Secretary Duffy promised senators at a hearing earlier this month that he would let the Tesla investigations follow the facts \u2014 specifically vowing to buck any political pressure to go easy on the self-described \u201cfirst buddy\u201d of the president.",
      "Musk will need all the regulatory relief and other goodies from Trump that he can get.",
      "In early January, Tesla said sales dropped in 2024, a first in more than a dozen years, as rivals such as BMW, Volkswagen and China\u2019s BYD come out with competitive EVs and steal market share.",
      "Then on Wednesday, Tesla reported revenue, profits and other key measures of financial health for the last quarter of 2024 all fell short of what analysts had expected. The stock climbed higher anyway.",
      "\u201cThings that would hurt other automakers,\u201c marvels Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein, \u201ddon\u2019t seem to impact Tesla.\u201d",
      "Besides the business, Tesla shareholders must always keep one eye on the CEO himself. Lately, that\u2019s meant weighing Musk\u2019s foray into politics.",
      "In Europe, a major market for his cars, Musk has endorsed the far-right Alternative for Germany and called British Prime Minister Keir Starmer an \u201cevil tyrant\u201d who is running a \u201ctyrannical police state.\u201d",
      "On Inauguration Day in the U.S., Musk made a straight-arm gesture during a speech that many interpreted as Nazi salute. He scoffed at the criticism, but the backlash was fierce nonetheless. In Germany, an image of Musk making the salute was projected onto his massive Tesla factory outside Berlin in protest. In Italy, a communist youth group hung an effigy of Musk upside down in the same square in Milan where the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini was strung upside down, too.",
      "\u201cHow many of these Tesla buyers agree with Musk?\u201d said Felipe Munoz, a senior analyst at auto researcher Jato Dynamics. \u201cI don\u2019t see the point of alienating potential customers.\u201d",
      "Musk also risks turning off regulators in Europe, who he hopes will soon approve the use of Full Self-Driving there.",
      "If investors start losing faith in Musk, it\u2019s a long way down.",
      "The run-up in Tesla stock alone since the election amounts to more than the annual economic output of 160 countries. Tesla\u2019s total market value has grown to about $1.3 trillion, more than the worth of General Motors, BMW, Ford, Ferrari, Porsche and a dozen other top car makers combined.",
      "Musk thinks that, if anything, the stock should be higher.",
      "\u201cI see a path for Tesla being the most valuable company in the world \u2014 by far, not even close,\u201d he said Wednesday, before doubling down on that statement. \u201cThere is a path where Tesla is worth more than the next five companies combined.\u201d",
      "That would mean surpassing the likes of Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia. Tesla is currently the seventh-most valuable company in the S&P 500.",
      "Wedbush's Ives, the \u201cgolden age\u201d analyst, agrees the stock can only go up from here.",
      "\u201cThe bet for the ages that Musk made was on Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cMusk is going to have massive impact on deregulation in the beltway \u2014 and that is worth a trillion dollars.\u201d"

      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who said he is also banning American companies from provincial contracts, signed a $100-million Canadian (US$68 million) with Musk's company in November to deliver high-speed internet to remote residents in rural and northern Ontario.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll be ripping up the province\u2019s contract with Starlink. Ontario won\u2019t do business with people hellbent on destroying our economy,\u201d Ford said.",

      "\u201cWe just aren't going to be using American companies,\u201d Ford said. \u201cAnd no matter if we are building a hospital, if we're building anything, if we're building a dog house I want to make sure we are using Ontario steel, Canadian products, Canadian wood, Ontario wood, anything.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. President Donald Trump says he will cut all funding to South Africa over what he called a massive human rights violation",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) \u2014 U.S. President Donald Trump said he will cut all funding to South Africa over what he called a human rights violation, a move that reflects Elon Musk's repeated and false claims over the years that authorities in his country of birth are anti-white and even encouraging the killing of white people.",
      "Trump said on Sunday that \u201cterrible things are happening in South Africa. The leadership is doing some terrible things, horrible things\u201d without providing specifics. He said \u201cthey're taking away land, they're confiscating land, and actually they're doing things that are perhaps far worse than that.\u201d",
      "While it wasn't clear exactly what Trump was referring to, he appeared to be referencing a new law in South Africa that gives the government powers in some instances to expropriate land from people.",
      "Musk, a close Trump ally and head of Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency, has highlighted that law in recent social media posts and cast it as a threat to South Africa's white minority.",
      "Many South Africans viewed Trump's sudden pledge to punish America's biggest trade partner in Africa as surprising and at least partly influenced by billionaire Tesla owner Musk, who was born in the South African capital of Pretoria but left for Canada after he completed high school.",
      "The Expropriation Act was signed into law by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa last month and allows the government to take land in specific instances where it is not being used, or where it would be in the public interest if it is redistributed.",
      "It aims to address some of the wrongs of South Africa's racist apartheid era, when Black people had land taken away from them and were forced to live in areas designated for non-whites.",
      "Ramaphosa responded to Trump's comments Monday by saying the U.S. president was wrong and no land had been confiscated, and said he looked forward to \"engaging\" with the Trump administration over the issue. The South African government said that the U.S. didn't understand the law.",
      "Musk accused Ramaphosa's government in 2023 of allowing a \u201cgenocide\u201d to happen over the killings of some white farmers, which have happened for years.",
      "While the killings have been condemned, experts have said there is no evidence of any genocide and they are part of South Africa's extremely high violent crime rates and mostly related to farm robberies. Crime affects all South Africans, and the country has an average of 70 homicides a day, with the vast majority of the victims Black.",
      "Musk also waded into the issue Monday by replying to a post by Ramaphosa's official account on X with the question: \u201cWhy do you have openly racist ownership laws?\u201d",
      "Again, it remains unclear exactly what Musk was referring to, but his comments seemed to allude to South Africa's affirmative action laws in business that are designed to advance opportunities for Blacks and other racial groups who were disadvantaged under apartheid. Musk's Starlink satellite internet service has been denied a license in South Africa because it doesn't meet affirmative action criteria.",
      "More than 30 years after the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule, white people in South Africa generally still have a much higher standard of living than Black people.",
      "That's reflected in poverty statistics, with a 2021 study by the South African Human Rights Commission finding that 64% of Black people were living in poverty against 1% of white people. When it comes to land, white people make up about 7% of the population of 62 million and own around 70% of land, according to the most recent land audit, although that share has decreased since apartheid.",
      "Still, the new land law has drawn criticism even from inside the country, with civic groups that represent the interests of whites and some South African political parties saying they will challenge it in court because it allows land to be taken without compensation in some cases.",
      "While South Africa has deep socioeconomic problems and a damaging legacy from nearly a half-century of apartheid, it is regarded as a stable democracy and is not a country brimming with racial tensions as it is sometimes portrayed to be.",
      "Trump said on his Truth Social platform that South Africa was \u201ctreating certain classes of people VERY BADLY,\u201d again without elaborating, and he would stop all future funding while the U.S. investigated.",
      "That threatens around $400 million a year in aid the U.S. gives to South Africa, most of it for the country's HIV/AIDS program through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR. South Africa's U.S. funding through PEPFAR was already threatened by Trump's global aid freeze.",
      "South Africa was also concerned that Trump might remove it from the AGOA trade agreement, which gives South Africa and other African nations tariff-free access to the U.S. market. Trump has already imposed tariffs on goods from China, Canada and Mexico \u2014 although on Monday he said he is pausing his tariffs planned for Mexico by one month.",

      "With his 70th birthday looming on this year's horizon, Microsoft founder Bill Gates looked inward to open a window into the man behind Windows and other seminal software that turned the personal computer into a household staple.",
      "Gates focuses on the first quarter-century of his life in \u201cSource Code: My Beginnings,\u201d the opening installment in a retrospective trilogy about an insouciant, impertinent and often misunderstood kid who grew up to become a polarizing technology titan before morphing into an influential philanthropist.",
      "In \u201cSource Code,\u201d Gates explores how his childhood quirks, upbringing, friendships and experiences coalesced into shaping his own internal operating system. Along the way, he dissects his brain's unusual wiring, delves into the emotional trauma of his best friend dying while they were both in high school, and revisits the birth of Traf-O-Data, a trailblazing startup that he launched in Albuquerque, New Mexico with another childhood friend, Paul Allen.",
      "Traf-O-Data, conceived to create software for the groundbreaking Altair computer made Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, became Microsoft in 1975 \u2014 a year it booked $16,005 in revenue while Gates and Allen were making $9 per hour.",
      "By 1977, Microsoft had become successful enough to embolden Gates to drop out of Harvard University. In 1979, he had decided to move Microsoft to the Seattle area where he grew up. Although Gates stepped down as Microsoft's CEO 25 years ago, the Windows operating system and other software created under his reign remain the main pillar in a company that now generates $212 billion in annual revenue, boasts a $3.1 trillion market value, and accounts for most of Gates' $100 billion personal fortune.",
      "\u201cSource Code\u201d ends with Gates's drive back to Seattle in 1979, meaning it doesn't touch upon his 1994 marriage to Melinda French, nor their 2021 divorce.",
      "\u201cI am being reflective, which is not my normal mode, but it\u2019s kind of time,\u201d Gates said during an interview about the book with The Associated Press. \u201cAs we went back and got teacher\u2019s comments or people I worked with at Harvard, it was fascinating. I had confused myself into thinking I got straight A\u2019s in ninth grade.\u201d",
      "That might not sound like much of a revelation, but it was a surprise to the cerebral Gates, who paints himself in the book as a \u201cbratty smartass\u201d prone to dismissively sneering, \u201cThat's the stupidest thing I ever heard,\u201d about remarks that seemed nonsensical to him.",
      "Gate's self-portrait is that of a nerd nicknamed \u201cTrey\u201d by his card-playing grandmother because he was the third male on this father's side of the family to be named Bill. He was a pipsqueak who had difficulty making friends and preferred living in his own head before he discovered computers, which became like slot machines that rewarded him for writing elegant lines of code.",
      "When he did talk, the young Gates rocked back and forth like a metronome setting a rhythm for his brain \u2014 a habit that surfaced during parts of his 45-minute interview with the AP.",
      "\u201cIt was a little weird because it was hard to direct my attention,\u201d Gates recalled during the interview. \u201cI had one year in school where they said, \u2018Oh we should put you ahead a couple grades.\u2019 And then another time, they said, \u2018No, we should hold you back.\u2019 And it\u2019s like, \u2018Well make up your mind.\u2019 They were a little confounded.\u201d",
      "Although he didn't realize it as a boy, Gates has no doubt he was and still is neurodivergent who channeled that anomaly into learning to program computers at the right time in the right place with the patient support of his late parents (the book is dedicated to them, along with his sister, Kristi and Libby).",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I was an adult that there was this idea that there are kids that have this kind of unique ability to concentrate but less social skills. I certainly would be included in that,\u201d Gates said. \u201cI encourage people who have strengths and deficits to kind of map their ambition onto something that plays to their strengths. Being able to think just about programming and how you do it better ended up being invaluable for me.\u201d",
      "Gates also had the advantage of growing up in a family that could afford to pay for him to attend a private high school in Seattle. Still, that privilege didn't insulate him from the trauma he experienced when his best friend, Kent Evans, died in a mountain climbing accident in May 1972 \u2014 a year before they were going to graduate.",
      "Evans' death occurred while he and Gates were preparing to spend much of the summer working on a program for their school, but what hurt far more was the loss of someone who understood him and helped give him a sense of purpose for the first time in his life.",
      "\u201cI had no notion of a friend just being gone. It was the only negative thing in my childhood,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIt shapes you, that someone can just disappear \u2014 somebody you loved and would have done things with. He would have been part of whatever I ended up going on to do. I give Kent credit, along with Paul (Allen), for setting the direction that I ended up going down.\u201d",
      "Evans' death provided the impetus for Gates to reconnect with Allen, who was already attending college, to help him with his programming projects. Allen, three years older than Gates and a passionate fan of legendary guitarist Jimi Hendrix, did more than just help with the coding. He also offered Gates some LSD in an attempt to lure his partner down a more psychedelic path.",
      "Gates rebuffed Allen at first but decided to drop acid with a group of high school friends shortly before his 1973 graduation, according to the book.",
      "It wasn't a pleasant experience, a reaction that Gates thought might have been related to the dental surgery he underwent the day after his LSD trip. He tried LSD again with Allen in October 1974 while they were watching an episode of the old \"Kung Fu\" series on TV, and decided he would be better off without psychedelic drugs even though Apple co-founder Steve Jobs contended Microsoft would have created better products had Gates taken more acid.",
      "\"I thought maybe I\u2019d seem cool if I took it, but that didn\u2019t happen,\" Gates said during the interview. \u201cI would say Steve was definitely more hip than I was. He took a lot more acid than I did. He had a sense of style. I had some charisma in terms of motivating engineers and saying this great thing (with personal computers) would happen, but Steve had natural speaking and charisma capabilities, even beyond mine. So I always envied him for the things he did.\"",
      "Gates' mind is now being blown by the recent advances in artificial intelligence \u2014 a technology being planted into Microsoft's software as part of its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI.",

      "In the hills of Kentucky where most of the world\u2019s bourbon supply is crafted, a new trade war would feel like an aching hangover that won\u2019t go away",
      "LAWRENCEBURG, Ky. -- In the rolling hills of Kentucky where most of the world's bourbon supply is crafted, the prospect of a new trade war feels like an aching hangover that won't go away.",
      "Kentucky bourbon producers again find themselves in the crosshairs as a target for retaliation after President Donald Trump ordered new tariffs on U.S. neighbors Canada and Mexico. On Monday, Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum put their planned tariffs on hold for a month to give time for further negotiations.",
      "American whiskey exports slumped badly amid an earlier trade dispute during Trump's first term.",
      "Canada, a key export market for American spirits, responded to this latest outbreak of trade warfare by initially ordering tariffs on American imports including beverages starting Tuesday. Some authorities in the provinces of Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec, Manitoba and Nova Scotia planned to remove American liquor brands from government store shelves.",
      "The latest back-and-forth is a sobering prospect for Kentucky bourbon producers and their supporters. The bourbon industry pumps $9 billion into the Bluegrass State\u2019s economy each year, creating more jobs and attracting more tourists than ever before, according to a study released last year. Kentucky distillers produce 95% of the global bourbon supply, according to the Kentucky Distillers\u2019 Association.",
      "Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear warned that tariffs will hurt working families in a state that voted overwhelmingly last November to return Trump to the White House. The pain won't be limited to distilleries, but will include every segment contributing to bourbon production, said Beshear, who is widely seen by political observers as a potential candidate for president in 2028.",
      "\u201cA state that voted for this president by more than 30 points is going to feel the impact of these actions. Think about the farmers that support the industry. The people in the bottling plants and the cooperages. These are our families, our neighbors,\u201d Beshear said in a recent social media post, referring to cooperages where barrels are made.",
      "Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, whose district spans the heart of Kentucky bourbon production country, remained supportive of Trump amid the uncertainty hanging over the industry.",
      "\u201cOther nations have forgotten that the United States is the world\u2019s superpower, and under President Trump\u2019s leadership, they are quickly remembering that we will no longer be taken advantage of,\" Barr said in a statement Monday.",
      "Barr noted that discussions were continuing on the trade front and said he was committed to protecting the bourbon industry.",
      "\u201cOur distilleries are not just a proud part of our state\u2019s heritage but also a vital engine of jobs and economic growth,\u201d he said. \"I will continue to advocate for our bourbon producers to ensure they are not unfairly impacted as we take necessary steps to safeguard America\u2019s economic interests.\u201d",
      "The industry is hoping that cooler heads will prevail. Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, urged the U.S. and Canada to reach an agreement that enables the spirits industries in both countries to thrive. Many producers are boxed in by the tariffs, he said.",
      "\u201cSome spirits are recognized as \u2018distinctive products\u2019 by the U.S. and Canada and can only be made in their designated countries, such as bourbon and Tennessee Whiskey in the U.S. and Canadian Whisky in Canada,\u201d Swonger said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, the production of these products cannot simply be moved to another country or region.\u201d",
      "American whiskey producers faced headwinds even before the new trade dispute. It comes as the industry has massive inventories of aging whiskeys that will someday reach the market. In Kentucky, a record 14.3 million barrels of bourbon were aging, the Kentucky Distillers\u2019 Association said recently. That inventory is awaiting bottling at a time when younger adults appear to be drinking less alcohol.",
      "The biggest threat could be looming overseas, where the European Union is set to reinstate tariffs on American whiskey at a whopping 50% rate in late March if nothing is done to head it off. Trump told reporters Sunday that import taxes will \u201cdefinitely happen\u201d with the European Union and possibly with the United Kingdom as well. The return of tariffs in the biggest export market for American whiskey would be devastating, Swonger has said."

    "summary": "Most countries in fast-growing Southeast Asia are looking to develop nuclear energy in their quest for cleaner and more reliable energy",
    "story": [
      "Most countries in fast-growing Southeast Asia are looking to develop nuclear energy in their quest for cleaner and more reliable energy",
      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Southeast Asia's only nuclear power plant, completed four decades ago in Bataan, about 40 miles from the Philippine capital Manila, was built in the 1970s but left idle due to safety concerns and corruption. It has never produced a single watt of energy.",
      "Now the Philippines and other countries in fast-growing Southeast Asia are looking to develop nuclear energy in their quest for cleaner and more reliable energy. Nuclear energy is viewed by its proponents as a climate solution since reactors don\u2019t emit the plant-warming greenhouses gases released by burning coal, gas or oil. Advances in technology have helped reduce the risks from radiation, making nuclear plants safer, cheaper to build and smaller.",
      "\u201cWe see multiple signs of a new era in nuclear power across the world,\u201d said Faith Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, adding that it expects 2025 to be a historical high for nuclear-generated electricity because of new plants, new national plans and interest in smaller nuclear reactors.",
      "Nuclear energy has been used for decades in wealthier nations like the U.S., France and Japan. It produces about 10% of all electricity generated worldwide, with 413 gigawatts of capacity operating in 32 countries, according to the IEA. That is more than African's entire generating capacity. The IEA says construction of new nuclear power plants needs to \u201caccelerate significantly\u201d in this decade to meet global targets for ending emissions of greenhouse gases.",
      "Southeast Asia will account for a fourth of global energy demand growth between now and 2035, and fossil fuels account for most of the region's energy capacity. Many countries in the region are showing interest in building nuclear power plants \u2014 which typically produce one gigawatt of power per plant \u2014 to help clear their smoggy skies and boost capacity.",
      "Indonesia plans 20 nuclear power plants. A Korean company is assessing restarting the mothballed Philippine plant. Vietnam has revived nuclear plans, and Malaysia\u2019s future plans include nuclear energy. Singapore signed a nuclear cooperation agreement with the U.S. last year, and Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar have shown interest in nuclear power.",
      "But nuclear power plants are expensive, take years to build and require a long time to become profitable. Vietnam suspended a nuclear project in 2016 after costs soared to $18 billion, but on Jan. 14, it signed a deal with Russia on atomic energy cooperation.",
      "International financing for nuclear energy is becoming more available, said Henry Preston, a United Kingdom-based communications manager for the World Nuclear Association, noting that 14 major financial institutions endorsed a goal for tripling global nuclear energy capacity by 2050 at the latest Climate Week NYC.",
      "Financing sources are still limited, though. The World Bank does not fund any nuclear energy development projects.",
      "\u201cWe hear the call from some stakeholders to explore nuclear power to decarbonize energy and improve energy supply reliability,\" a World Bank spokesperson said in a recent written response to questions from The Associated Press. \"We continue to have conversations with our board, management, and external stakeholders to understand the facts. Any reconsideration of our position is ultimately a decision for our member countries.\"",
      "Developing robust nuclear energy policies and regulations, now lacking in many countries, could catalyze more funding by reassuring investors, Preston said.",
      "Technological advances are making nuclear power more affordable, experts say.",
      "Small modular reactors, which advocates say can generate up to roughly one-third the amount of power of a traditional reactor, can be built faster and at lower costs than large power reactors, scaling to fit the needs of a particular location. Advocates say they are safer due to simpler designs, lower core power, and more coolant, giving operators more time to respond in case of accidents.",
      "Critics question how inexpensive the technology might be since smaller reactors have not been widely commercially deployed, said Putra Adhiguna of the Jakarta-based think tank Energy Shift Institute.",
      "The small modular reactors already operating are run by state-owned entities that aren\u2019t transparent about performance or costs. The cost of the first such reactor that was to be commercially deployed in the U.S. inflated by about half before it was cancelled, he said. The Idaho-based project had a target of delivering 40 years of electricity at $55 per megawatt-hour, but project costs climbed to $89 per MWh, according to a report by The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "Nuclear disasters dimmed earlier enthusiasm for nuclear power in Southeast Asia. Ukraine\u2019s 1986 Chernobyl disaster was a factor behind the decision to shelve the project in the Philippines. Meltdowns in 2011 at the Dai-ichi nuclear power plant in Fukushima, Japan, following a catastrophic earthquake and tsunami also raised worries, leading Thailand to halt its nuclear power plans. In 2018, Malaysia\u2019s then prime minister Mahathir Mohamad cited such disasters when deciding against using nuclear energy.",
      "Some other challenges remain. Markets for nuclear technologies remain concentrated in a few countries \u2014 Russia controls roughly 40% of the world's supply of enriched uranium \u2014 and this is a \u201c\u201crisk factor for the future,\u201d said an IEA report. It added that safely disposing of spent fuel and other radioactive waste is essential to gain public acceptance of nuclear power.",
      "For countries like Vietnam, a lack of trained engineers and scientists is also a big obstacle. It estimates that it will need around 2,400 trained personnel to revive its nuclear program.",
      "\u201cThis is not just about the program but about building a nuclear power ecosystem and technology for the future,\u201d the state-run VN Express cited Minister of Industry and Trade Nguyen Hong Dien as saying.",

      "\u201cWe have to do everything to avoid this totally unnecessary and stupid tariff war or trade war,\u201d the Polish prime minister told reporters in Brussels, where EU leaders met for talks on boosting and improving military spending and ramping up Europe\u2019s defense industry.",
      "Tusk said Trump\u2019s threats amount to \u201ca serious test\u201d of European unity, and \u201cin a very strange context, because it\u2019s the first time where we have such a problem among allies.\u201d",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said the EU is \u201ca power that stands its ground\u201d and that if hit with tariffs, the 27-nation bloc \u201cwould have to make itself respected.\u201d He said Trump\u2019s threats are \u201cpushing Europeans to be more united, more active in addressing their collective security challenges.\u201d",
      "Trump slapped tariffs on European steel and aluminum during his first term, and EU leaders have already been in contact with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau since Canada imposed retaliatory duties on U.S. goods in response to a 25% tariff levied by Trump. The U.S. president later on Monday agreed to a 30-day pause on his tariff threat as America\u2019s two largest trading partners took steps to appease his concerns about border security and drug trafficking.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen underlined that ties between the bloc and the United States are part of \u201cour most consequential relationship. It is fundamental to promoting peace, security and prosperity.\u201d",
      "But she warned that \u201cthere are clearly new challenges and growing uncertainty\u201d and the EU stands ready to defend itself. \u201cWhen targeted unfairly or arbitrarily, the European Union will respond firmly,\u201d von der Leyen told reporters after the meeting.",
      "Meanwhile, Denmark\u2019s prime minister again insisted on Monday that Greenland isn't for sale and called for a robust response from the EU should U.S. Trump press ahead with his threat to take control of the island.",
      "\u201cI will never support the idea of fighting allies. But of course, if the U.S. puts tough terms on Europe, we need a collective and robust response,\u201d Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told reporters.",
      "Last month, Trump left open the possibility that the American military might be used to secure Greenland, as well as the Panama Canal. \u201cWe need Greenland for national security purposes,\u201d he said.",
      "Frederiksen said she has \u201cgreat support\u201d from her EU partners on the fact \u201cthat everybody has to respect the sovereignty of all national states in the world, and that Greenland is today a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. It\u2019s part of our territory and it\u2019s not for sale.\u201d",
      "European Council President Antonio Costa, noting that the EU has stood beside Ukraine in defense of its borders, said of Greenland: \u201cOf course, we will stand also for these principles, all the more so if the territorial integrity of a member state of the European Union is questioned.\u201d",
      "Frederiksen acknowledged U.S. concerns about security in the Arctic Region, where Russia and China have been increasingly active.",
      "\u201cI totally agree with the Americans that the High North, that the Arctic region is becoming more and more important when we are talking about defense and security and deterrence,\u201d Frederiksen said, adding that the U.S. and Denmark could have \u201cstronger footprints\u201d in Greenland, in security terms.",
      "\u201cThey are already there and they can have more possibilities,\u201d she said, underlining that Denmark itself can also \u201cscale up\u201d its security presence. \u201cIf this is about securing our part of the world, we can find a way forward,\u201d Frederiksen said.",
      "Last week, her government announced a roughly 14.6 billion kroner (nearly $2 billion) agreement with parties including the governments of Greenland and the Faeroe Islands to \u201cimprove capabilities for surveillance and maintaining sovereignty in the region.\u201d",
      "It would include three new Arctic naval vessels, two additional long-range surveillance drones and satellite capacity, the Danish Defense Ministry said."

      "\u201cThe United States won\u2019t stand for it, we will act,\u201d Trump added. \"Also, I will be cutting off all future funding to South Africa until a full investigation of this situation has been completed!\u201d",
      "The South African government said Monday that the Trump administration needed to have a better understanding of the new law, which is meant to help redress the impact of decades of white minority rule in South Africa under the apartheid regime, which ended in 1994. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said in a statement that \u201cthe South African government has not confiscated any land.\u201d",
      "No significant action has been taken since the bill was signed into law.",
      "During the apartheid era, land was taken from South Africa\u2019s Black majority, who were forced to live in areas designated for Blacks only. The law has been debated and considered for years as a means, according to the government, to right historic wrongs.",
      "Elon Musk, who is one of Trump\u2019s close allies, was born and raised in South Africa and has also targeted Ramaphosa\u2019s government, previously accusing it of being anti-white and claiming in 2023 that it was allowing a \u201cgenocide\u201d against white farmers.",
      "Experts in South Africa say that while there are cases of white farmers being killed, it's rather a reflection of the country\u2019s desperately high levels of violent crime across the board, which are some of the worst in the world.",
      "In comments to reporters, Trump said Sunday \u201cthey\u2019re taking away land, they\u2019re confiscating land and actually they\u2019re doing things that are perhaps far worse than that.\u201d",
      "Trump didn't say exactly which policy he was referring to, or which people were being mistreated. But his comments appeared to be in reaction to the new land law that South Africa passed last month that gives the government scope to acquire land from private parties if it's in the public interest.",
      "The law has been criticized by some interest groups in South Africa as opening the way to seize land from some of the country's white minority. However, the government says people's rights are still protected and land can only be taken in specific circumstances where it's not being used productively and it's in the public interest that the land is redistributed. The race of the land owner isn't a factor.",
      "Ramaphosa's office released a statement Monday, saying: \"The recently adopted Expropriation Act is not a confiscation instrument, but a constitutionally mandated legal process that ensures public access to land in an equitable and just manner as guided by the constitution.",
      "\u201cSouth Africa, like the United States of America and other countries, has always had expropriation laws that balance the need for public usage of land and the protection of rights of property owners.\u201d",
      "South African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola said that the Trump administration should use the investigation it says it is launching \u201cto deepen their understanding of South Africa\u2019s policies as a constitutional democracy. Such insights will ensure a respectful and informed approach to our democratic commitments.\u201d",
      "South Africa is a major beneficiary of U.S. funding under the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which contributes around $400 million a year to the country's HIV/AIDS program. That funding was already under threat after Trump's freeze on foreign aid across the world.",
      "Ramaphosa\u2019s office said that there is \u201cno other significant funding that is provided by the United States in South Africa,\u201d although South Africa is Washington's largest trading partner in Africa by some way, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission.",
      "A civil society group that represents the interests of South Africa\u2019s Afrikaans-speaking white minority, and which has fought against the new law, said that Trump\u2019s proposed measures would likely hurt the South African people. It said that it was asking Trump to ensure that any \u201cpunitive measures\u201d be targeted at senior government leaders.",
      "Trump has previously been critical of South Africa's government, writing in a social media post during his first term in 2018 that land was being seized from white farms and there was \"large scale killing of farmers.\" Trump said in the same message \u2014 which was roundly criticized in South Africa as making false claims \u2014 that he was ordering then U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to investigate.",
      "There are an average of around 70 homicides a day in South Africa, according to official crime statistics, and the vast majority of victims are Black.",

      "A new lawsuit alleges for the first time that people died because of the disastrous 2023 East Palestine train derailment",
      "A lawsuit alleging for the first time that people died because of the disastrous 2023 East Palestine train derailment has been filed ahead of Monday's second anniversary of the toxic crash near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border amid a flurry of new litigation.",
      "On Monday, Vice President JD Vance is also expected to visit the small community near the crash site that he used to represent as a senator, along with President Donald Trump's newly confirmed head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lee Zeldin.",
      "The new lawsuit that will be made public later on Monday contains the first seven wrongful death claims filed against Norfolk Southern railroad \u2014 including the death of a 1-week-old baby. It also alleges the railroad and its contractors botched the cleanup while officials at the EPA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signed off on it and failed to warn residents about the health risks. Many of the other parties in the lawsuit cite lingering, unexplained health problems along with concerns something more serious could develop.",
      "\u201cOur clients want truth. They want transparency,\" attorney Kristina Baehr said about the roughly 750 people she represents. \u201cThey want to know what they were exposed to, which has been hidden from them. They want to know what happened and why it happened. And they want accountability.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit provides some examples of the lingering effects on families, but it doesn't include details about the deaths.",
      "At least nine other lawsuits were filed over the past week by individuals and businesses that argue the railroad's greed is to blame for the derailment and the $600 million class-action settlement doesn't offer nearly enough compensation nor sanction the railroad enough to spur them to prevent future derailments. The dollar amount represents only a small fraction of the $12.1 billion in revenue the railroad generated in each of the past two years.",
      "Dozens of rail cars careened off the tracks on Feb. 3, 2023, after an overheating bearing failed. Several of the cars carrying hazardous materials ruptured and spilled their cargo that caught fire. But the disaster was made worse three days later when officials blew open five tank cars filled with vinyl chloride and burned that toxic plastic ingredient because they feared it would explode.",
      "Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board determined the controversial vent and burn operation never needed to be done because there was evidence the railroad ignored that the tank cars were actually starting to cool off and wouldn't explode. The state and local officials who ultimately made the decision to release and burn the vinyl chloride \u2014 generating a towering plume of thick, black smoke that spread over the town and region \u2014 have said they never heard anything suggesting the tank cars wouldn't explode.",
      "\u201cThe EPA had rules to follow and chose not to follow their own rules. The EPA was too busy trying to get the train back on track to protect the people,\u201d Baehr said.",
      "Officials didn't immediately respond to questions about the new lawsuit and separate federal claims that were filed against the EPA and CDC. But in the past the EPA has defended the agency's role in the vent and burn operation by saying they were only there to advise on the potential consequences and measure the resulting contamination.",
      "Baehr said the EPA and CDC's approach to the derailment followed a similar pattern she's seen in other environmental disasters she\u2019s been involved with like the Navy\u2019s toxic spill of jet fuel that contaminated water in Hawaii. She said the agencies tend to downplay the health risks people face. Residents have expressed frustration with the data the EPA discloses and the refusal of the class-action attorneys to reveal what their own testing expert found.",
      "A spokesperson for Norfolk Southern railroad said she couldn\u2019t comment on the pending litigation. The railroad has agreed to the $600 million class-action settlement with residents who lived or worked within 20 miles of the derailment and a separate settlement with the federal government where Norfolk Southern pledged to pay for the entire cleanup and set up funds to pay for medical exams and drinking water monitoring. But the railroad did not admit any wrongdoing in either settlement.",
      "Some people who lived near the derailment have started to receive payments for personal injuries as part of the class-action settlement, but nearly half of the settlement remains on hold as some residents appeal for higher compensation and more information about the contamination.",
      "So the main payments of up to $70,000 per household won\u2019t go out until the appeal is settled.",
      "The nine other new lawsuits included claims by a pipe manufacturer, dog kennels and a winery that the derailment harmed their businesses in various ways, from staffing shortages to having to shut down or move because of customers' concerns.",
      "One business about a quarter of a mile (0.4 kilometers) from the derailment alleged cleanup work created \u201csmoke, debris and odors\u201d that reached their property and led to routine flooding. The dog breeder who owned a business in neighboring Pennsylvania blamed the toxic chemicals for causing the deaths of at least 116 puppies and three adult dogs.",

      "A South Korean appeals court has upheld a ruling that acquitted Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Jae-yong of financial criminal charges over a contentious merger between Samsung affiliates that cemented his grip over the biggest South Korean company",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- A South Korean appeals court on Monday upheld a lower court\u2019s ruling that acquitted Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Jae-yong of financial criminal charges over a contentious merger between Samsung affiliates that cemented his grip over the biggest South Korean company.",
      "The Seoul High Court rejected an appeal by prosecutors.",
      "You Jin Kim, Lee\u2019s lawyer, welcomed the ruling, saying he hopes that Lee would now focus on his company following Monday\u2019s verdict. Prosecutors can again appeal to the Supreme Court, whose rulings are final.",
      "In February 2024, the Seoul Central District Court said the prosecution failed to sufficiently prove the merger between Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries was unlawfully conducted with an aim to strengthen Lee\u2019s control over Samsung Electronics.",
      "Lee, a third-generation corporate heir who was officially appointed chairman of Samsung Electronics in October 2022,  has led the Samsung group of companies since 2014, when his late father, former chairman Lee Kun-hee, suffered a heart attack.",
      "Lee Jae-yong served 18 months in prison after being convicted in 2017 over separate bribery charges related to the 2015 deal.",
      "He was originally sentenced to five years in prison for offering bribes to then-President Park Geun-hye and her close confidante to win government support for the 2015 merger, which was key to strengthening his control over the Samsung business empire and solidifying the father-to-son leadership succession.",
      "Lee was released on parole in 2021, and pardoned by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in August 2022.",
      "Some shareholders had opposed the 2015 merger, saying it unfairly benefited the Lee family while hurting minority shareholders."

      "Nine months ahead of the 2025 U.N. climate conference known as COP30, prices for lodging are alarming those who want to attend the event in Belem, Brazil\u2019s Amazonian host city",
      "SAO PAULO, Brazil -- Nine months ahead of this year's annual U.N. climate summit, known as COP30, lodging prices in the Brazilian host city of Belem are turning heads\u2014and may soon turn off would-be attendees from the first such meeting in the Amazon rainforest.",
      "With a shortage of housing and high interest, property owners and rental companies are feeling emboldened to charge five-digit rates, even for cramped rooms with shared bathrooms.",
      "On Booking.com, one of the last available hotel rooms listed, a flat apartment, is going $15,266 for one person, up from $158 for the same category currently\u2014a 9,562% increase. A 15-day stay during the conference in November would total $228,992, enough to buy a four-bedroom apartment in one of Belem\u2019s top neighborhoods.",
      "On Airbnb, a room with a shared bathroom in Ananindeua, a poor city near Belem, is listed at $9,320 per day. A comparable room today could be rented for as little as $11 per day. In more upscale neighborhoods, renting an apartment that accommodates eight people costs up to $446,595 for a two-week stay.",
      "\u201cThis one scared me,\" joked local architect and digital influencer Renato Balaguer about a dilapidated apartment listed at $10,000 for an 11-day stay.",
      "\"Look, this is captivity for gringos. False imprisonment is a crime!\u201d said Balaguer in a post that went viral.",
      "President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who champions himself as a protector of the environment, has boasted about hosting the event in the Amazon, which helps regulate the climate by storing large quantities of carbon dioxide, a gas that causes climate change.",
      "This is also a landmark year in the annual process because countries must come forward with updated commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions. What\u2019s more, civic groups are particularly interested in attending because Brazil allows for protests and free expression, which are sharply restricted in the previous three host countries: Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.",
      "Brazil, Latin America's largest and most populous nation, has hosted other world events, such as the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro and the 2014 World Cup, with games played in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Manaus, Belo Horizonte and several other cities. Belem, an Atlantic port city that is on the edge of the Amazon rainforest, doesn't have the same infrastructure as other big cities, which has led to many questions about its ability to host COP30.",
      "Officials estimate that about 50,000 people will attend the summit, scheduled to take place Nov. 10-21. Last year in Baku, Azerbaijan, the official tally was 54,148. Before that, in Dubai, attendance reached a record 83,884.",
      "Neither the federal government nor the Para state government responded to questions about the number of rooms currently available in Belem, a bustling and impoverished metropolis of 2.5 million people and the median income is $920 per month.",
      "Those who booked more than a year in advance secured lower prices, but many of those reservations have already been canceled without explanation\u2014a common practice in the hospitality business ahead of major events. Another issue is the increasing prices of accommodations already booked. One European nonprofit reserved a room for $2,000 in December, only to see the price rise to $7,200 two weeks later.",
      "Various groups that often attend the annual summit, including environmental nonprofits, activists, scientists, journalists and businesses, are having to rethink whether they go as the prices rocket up.",
      "\u201cPlanning for COP30 in Belem has been challenging due to limited and expensive accommodations, creating barriers for our participation,\" said Roberta Alves, deputy director of communications at Mercy Corps. The international humanitarian nonprofit has participated in several COPs, focusing its advocacy on financing a transition to green energy, adapting to climate change impacts and how climate change exacerbates conflict.",
      "\u201cWe are awaiting alternative options from the COP30 organizers\u2014critical to ensuring that all voices, especially those from the frontlines of the climate crisis, are included in global conversations,\u201d Alves added.",
      "Owners and property managers offering rentals say the prices are a question of supply and demand, and besides, they also have high costs.",
      "\u201cJust the electricity and water for my house cost 5,000 Brazilian real ($860) per month,\u201d said Gisleno da Silva, who posted the ad for the Ananindeua room for $9,320 per day.",
      "\u201cAt this price, I already have someone interested,\u201d he said, while adding he was open to negotiate.",
      "In the face of mounting criticism, the Brazilian government has said it will provide an additional 26,000 bed spaces. Those will include accommodations in docked cruise ships, public schools, new hotels and military facilities. In a social media post published Friday, COP30 organizers said accredited participants would soon be able to book accommodations on an online platform.",
      "\u201cWe have observed a disproportionate increase in rental prices, which we attribute to real estate speculation. This should stabilize as the government increases the availability of accommodations,\u201d Valter Correia, the special secretary for the event, said in the statement.",
      "Plenty of advocates are defending Belem, saying its challenges are minor compared to the significance of hosting the most important annual climate meeting in the world\u2019s largest rainforest. In an article published in Valor Economico newspaper in December, environmentalist Priscilla Santos, co-founder of the Amazonians for Climate Network, said criticism of Belem \u201cnot only reveals colonialist biases but also undermines an event that could be transformative\u201d for the region. \u201cEveryone wants to \u2018save the Amazon,\u2019 but no one wants to discuss it in the territory?\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, worried about their reputation, some property managers are distancing themselves from the speculation. In an Instagram video that went viral, Fabr\u00edcio de Menezes compared the daily rental price of an apartment in Belem, charging $21,800 during COP, to the much lower rates of the iconic Jumeirah Burj Al Arab in Dubai, which markets itself as the world\u2019s only seven-star hotel.",
      "\u201cI hope this is a joke by the owner,\u201d he said.",
      "Another local property manager, Carlos Netto, said he would never advise a propriety owner to charge such high prices.",
      "\u201cDo you think that gringos are clueless? Where in the world is a 20-day rental is more expensive than the property?\u201d he posted.",

    "story": [
      "With home prices high, American families are grappling with the prospect that homeownership might remain out of reach for them for a long time",
      "The Petersen family\u2019s two-bedroom apartment in northern California is starting to feel small.",
      "Four-year-old Jerrik's toy monster trucks are everywhere in the 1,100-square-foot unit in Campbell, just outside of San Jose. And it's only a matter of time before 9-month-old Carolynn starts amassing more toys, adding to the disarray, says her mother, Jenn Petersen.",
      "The 42-year-old chiropractor had hoped she and her husband, Steve, a 39-year-old dental hygienist, would have bought a house by now. But when they can afford a bigger place, it will have to be another rental. Petersen has done the math: With mortgage rates and home prices stubbornly high, there's no way the couple, who make about $270,000 a year and pay about $2,500 in monthly rent, can afford a home anywhere in their area.",
      "According to October data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, a San Jose family with a median income of $156,700 would need to spend 80% of their income on housing \u2014 including an $8,600 monthly mortgage payment \u2014 to own a median-priced $1.54 million home. That's far higher than the general rule of thumb that people should pay no more than 30% of their income on a mortgage or rent.",
      "Moving out of state is out of the question for the Petersens \u2014 they have strong family ties to the area and their income would plummet if they move to a lower cost-of-living area. \u201cI\u2019m not willing to give up my job and close connections with my family for a house,\u201d Petersen said.",
      "The issue is widespread and near historic highs nationally: As of last fall, the median homeowner in the U.S. was paying 42% of their income on homeownership costs, according to the Atlanta Fed. Four years ago, that percentage was 28% and had not previously reached 38% since late 2007, just before the housing market crash.",
      "\u201cThe American dream, as our parents knew it, doesn\u2019t exist anymore,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cThe whole idea that you get a house after you graduate college, get a steady job and get married? I\u2019ve done most of those milestones. But the homeownership part? That just doesn\u2019t fit financially.\u201d",
      "The same is true for an increasing number of American families.",
      "In 2024, the median first-time homebuyer was 38 years old, a jump from age 35 the previous year, according to a recent report by the National Association of Realtors. That's significantly above historic norms, when median first-time buyers hovered between 30 and 32 years old from 1993 to 2018.",
      "The biggest driver of this trend, experts said, is simple: There are far too few houses on the market to match pent-up demand, driving prices past the point of affordability for many people who are relatively early in their careers. Coupled with high mortgage rates, many have concluded that renting is their only option.",
      "\u201cWage growth hasn\u2019t kept up with the increase in home prices and interest rates,\u201d said Domonic Purviance, who studies housing at the Atlanta Fed. \u201cEven though people are making more money, home prices are increasing at a faster rate.\u201d",
      "That gap has left many out of the housing market, which for generations has been a way for Americans to build equity and wealth that they can pass down or leverage to buy a larger home. It's also led to widespread worries about housing in the U.S. About 7 in 10 voters under age 45 said they were \u201cvery\u201d concerned about the cost of housing in their community, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of more than 120,000 voters in the 2024 election.",
      "Brian McCabe, a sociology professor at Georgetown University, said he frequently tells his students that \u201cthere are few things that all Americans agree on, but one of them is that they\u2019d rather own a home than rent.\u201d",
      "McCabe said homeownership, especially as a wealth-building tool, is the right move for many, especially if the owner intends to be in one place for a long time. But he also said many are realizing that not owning a home has its advantages, too \u2014 it gives people more flexibility to move and allows them to live in exciting neighborhoods they would not be able to afford to buy property in.",
      "McCabe said millennials are getting married later, having children later, have a stronger desire to stay in cities and, especially due to remote work, value the flexibility of being able to move with ease \u2014 all of which he said could prompt an end to the notion that homeownership is the \u201capex of the American dream.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe big question is whether we see the sheen of homeownership start to fade,\u201d McCabe said. \u201cIt's such an interesting cultural marker: Why is owning a home the pinnacle for so many people?\u201d",
      "It's a question Petersen wrestles with because she knows any three-bedroom home she found in her area would leave her family \u201chouse poor.\u201d",
      "\"I used to subscribe to the idea that owning a house is just a natural milestone you have to reach,\" she said. \u201cAt some point, though, what are you sacrificing by just owning a house and gaining equity? I want to be able to travel with my kids. I want to be able to sign them up for extracurriculars. How are we supposed to do that if we're paying a mortgage that's most of our take-home pay?\u201d",
      "Petersen said she'll \u201calways hold out a little bit of hope\" that homeownership will be in her family's future. But if they find a townhouse to rent that has space for her kids and fits within their $3,600 monthly rental budget?",
      "\u201cI'd take that,\u201d she said.",
      "Lifelong Boston resident Julieta Lopez, 63, spent decades hoping to buy a home but watched as prices became increasingly out of reach.",
      "\u201cThe prices in Boston just got higher and higher and higher and higher,\u201d said Lopez, who works for the city traffic department issuing tickets for parking violations.",
      "Two years ago, furious to learn that her subsidized apartment's monthly rent was being hiked to $2,900, Lopez, who earns about $60,000 annually, took out her phone and began searching for government programs that help first-time homebuyers. She was determined to finally own her own place.",
      "Within months, she had succeeded. Lopez qualified to receive $50,000 from the local Massachusetts Affordable Homeownership Alliance nonprofit and another $50,000 from the city of Boston's Office of Housing \u2014 funds that helped her with a down payment on the $430,000 two-bedroom condominium she shares with her 30-year-old son. She now pays about $2,160 a month on her mortgage.",
      "Lopez knows she is lucky the city has placed such a focus on aiding first-time buyers like herself \u2014 Boston has poured more than $24 million into its homeownership assistance programs since Mayor Michelle Wu took office in 2021, helping nearly 700 residents get their first homes.",
      "But Lopez also feels proud to have her own place after years of working so hard \u2014 jobs that included everything from telecommunications to health care to electronics.",
      "\u201cI was determined to have my piece of the pie,\" she said. \u201cI felt I deserved that. I\u2019ve always worked. Always. Nonstop.\"",

      "Hamilton led FSU to Sweet 16 appearances in 2018, 2019 and 2021. The 2019-20 team was viewed as among FSU\u2019s best, and ESPN analyst Dick Vitale wrote a book about how the Seminoles would have won the national title had it not been for COVID-19.",
      "But since the trip to the Sweet 16 in March 2021, FSU has missed the NCAA Tournament as well as the NIT. The Seminoles have gone 56-62 in the four seasons since, including an injury-riddled 9-23 campaign in 2022-23.",
      "Hamilton will coach FSU\u2019s final nine regular-season games and the ACC Tournament.",
      "While there have been struggles on the court, adjusting to the transfer portal and generating enough NIL contributions to compete in the ACC, Hamilton has graduated nearly all of FSU\u2019s four-year players since arriving in Tallassee more than two decades ago.",
      "But the lawsuit has taken center stage the last two months. The former players allege Hamilton failed to make good on a promise to get each of them $250,000 in NIL compensation.",
      "The plaintiffs \u2014 Darin Green Jr., De\u2019Ante Green, Cam\u2019Ron Fletcher, Josh Nickelberry, Primo Spears and Jalen Warley \u2014 filed suit in Leon County Circuit Court in late December.",

Coach Hamilton\u2019s legacy extends far beyond Tallahassee and college basketball. He is one of the most respected and beloved ambassadors of FSU across the nation and in his profession.\u201d",

      "Star defensive end Myles Garrett has requested a trade from the Cleveland Browns with the hope of better positioning himself to play in a Super Bowl",
      "CLEVELAND -- Star defensive end Myles Garrett has requested a trade from the Cleveland Browns with the hope of better positioning himself to win a Super Bowl, according to a statement he sent to media outlets Monday.",
      "The Browns finished last in the AFC North with a 3-14 record and general manager Andrew Berry had said last week he would not trade Garrett in the offseason, saying he anticipated Garrett going directly from the Browns to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. A Browns spokesman said Monday the team is not entertaining trade offers for Garrett.",
      "Garrett is under contract with the Browns for two more seasons under a five-year, $125 million extension he signed in 2020.",
      "\u201cAs a kid dreaming of the NFL, all I focused on was the ultimate goal of winning a Super Bowl \u2014 and that goal fuels me today more than ever,\" Garrett said in his statement. \"My love for the community of Northeast Ohio and the incredible fanbase of the Cleveland Browns has made this one of the toughest decisions of my life. These past eight years have shaped me into the man that I am today.",
      "\u201cWhile I\u2019ve loved calling this city my home, my desire to win and compete on the biggest stages won\u2019t allow me to be complacent. The goal was never to go from Cleveland to Canton, it has always been to compete for and win a Super Bowl. With that in mind, I have requested to be traded from the Cleveland Browns.\u201d",
      "Garrett, The Associated Press NFL defensive player of the year last season, is a finalist for the award again. His 14 sacks ranked second in the league, and he became the first player in NFL history to record 14 or more in four consecutive seasons. He holds the franchise record with 102.5 career sacks.",
      "During preparations for the Senior Bowl in Mobile, Alabama, last week, Berry told reporters he would not trade Garrett even if a team were to offer two first-round draft picks.",
      "\"We feel really good about Myles obviously as a big piece of our future,\u201d Berry said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to him being on the field. Like I said in my (early January) press conference, we envision him going from Cleveland to Canton when his career is over.\u201d",
      "Garrett has relatively low salaries the next two seasons, according to Over The Cap. He is owed about $20 million in base salary and bonus in 2025 and $25 million in 2026.",
      "But he also carries significant dead money if Cleveland were to trade him. The Browns, who are currently projected at $30 million over the cap in 2025, would face a $36.2 million dead cap charge with a trade based on bonuses already paid to Garrett. Keeping Garrett in 2025 would result in just a $19.7 million cap charge for Cleveland.",

      "The list of NBA players who might get traded before the 3 p.m. Eastern deadline on Thursday is a long one, according to Milwaukee star Giannis Antetokounmpo",
      "The list of NBA players that might get traded before the 3 p.m. Eastern deadline on Thursday is a long one, according to Milwaukee star Giannis Antetokounmpo.",
      "It includes ... well, basically everybody.",
      "\u201cThis is the world we\u2019re living in,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cIt\u2019s a business. You have to understand this. Nobody\u2019s safe. Nobody\u2019s safe.",
      "After this weekend, he might be right.",
      "It's hard to envision a bigger stunner than the first deal that went down over the weekend \u2014 Luka Doncic is now with the Los Angeles Lakers and Anthony Davis is now with the Dallas Mavericks, the first time that two reigning All-NBA players were traded for one another in-season. That move overshadowed another one that, under normal circumstances, would have been seismic: De'Aaron Fox leaving Sacramento for San Antonio to join All-Star Victor Wembanyama, with Zach LaVine leaving Chicago for the Kings.",
      "Fox was an All-NBA selection two years ago. LaVine is a two-time All-Star. And when adding in D'Angelo Russell getting moved by the Lakers to Brooklyn in late December, that's five current or former All-Stars that have been traded already this season.",
      "\u201cNormally when you trade a star you get a bunch of junk back,\" Hall of Famer and NBA analyst Charles Barkley said on NBA TV, reacting to the Doncic-Davis trade. \"This is the first time I can remember when you\u2019ve got two All-NBA players traded for each other.\u201d",
      "To Antetokounmpo\u2019s point, if Doncic \u2014 the clear face of the Dallas franchise until now, the player who replaced Dirk Nowitzki in that role with the Mavericks, someone who took his team to the NBA Finals last season \u2014 can get moved, then yes, it can be argued that any player can get moved.",
      "The Spurs probably won\u2019t be trading Wembanyama anytime soon, especially now that they\u2019ve landed Fox to play alongside the French center. Golden State would only trade a franchise icon like Stephen Curry if he asked to be moved, which doesn\u2019t seem likely. The Lakers\u2019 LeBron James and Phoenix\u2019s Bradley Beal have no-trade clauses, meaning they control their own destinies to a certain extent.",
      "But for everyone else, getting a middle-of-the-night call from a general manager \u2014 like the ones Dallas' Nico Harrison tried to place to Doncic in the wee hours of Sunday, all of them going unanswered \u2014 is at least possible.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, and I\u2019ve said this in the past, you get evaluated every single day,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cYou don\u2019t take nothing for granted. Being an All-Star, you don\u2019t take it for granted. Being able to go out there and put on the jersey and represent your team, you don\u2019t take that for granted. Being out there and representing your family, you don\u2019t take that for granted. Every second that you play an NBA game, I love it. I try to play with joy.\u201d",
      "Speaking of joy, or lack thereof, another past All-Star and All-NBA selection in Jimmy Butler is still out there and desperately seeking a way out of Miami. He has as many game appearances in the last month as he does team suspensions \u2014 three games, three suspensions.",
      "For Butler to get moved, with Phoenix believed to be his preferred destination, it\u2019s very possible that another All-Star-caliber player \u2014 or at least someone with a big salary \u2014 would have to be changing addresses as well simply to make the contract math work.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s surprising, for sure,\u201d Philadelphia coach Nick Nurse said of superstar-level players like Doncic and Davis getting traded. \u201cBut I think there\u2019s been a lot of stars moving in recent years that we\u2019ve all been surprised by and all that kind of stuff.\u201d",
      "More big things could still happen. Some teams that are out of the playoff hunt, like injury-plagued New Orleans, could make deals to collect assets and think about the future. Others might add a piece or two in an effort to win now.",
      "Nobody knows what other surprises might be looming, especially with a slew of teams that are in the playoff \u2014 or play-in \u2014 chase thinking about which players could be acquired to help their postseason odds.",
      "\u201cThe play-in part of it lets the competition last longer,\" said Detroit coach J.B. Bickerstaff, whose Pistons are squarely in the Eastern Conference play-in mix. \"And more teams are competing for those spots longer into the season. The past, what, four or five years, we\u2019ve had a different champion. So now, everybody feels like they\u2019ve got a shot at it. They're making moves so that they can go and get it. I think that\u2019s great for the league.\u201d",

      "MADRID -- When the former president of Spain's Football Federation kissed a player from the national team who had just won the 2023 Women's World Cup, it sparked widespread outrage in Spain about sexism in sports and beyond.",
      "On Monday, women's World Cup winner Jenni Hermoso testified at the trial of Luis Rubiales that she did not consent to the kiss and that she felt coerced to publicly exonerate him after the incident.",
      "\u201cI felt disrespected,\u201d Hermoso said. \u201cI think it was a moment that stained one of the happiest days of my life.\u201d",
      "The 47-year-old Rubiales, who sat nearby at Madrid's High Court, is accused of sexual assault and of trying to coerce Hermoso, alongside others, to publicly support him.",
      "Rubiales has denied the charges, claiming the kiss was consensual and happened in a \u201cmoment of jubilation.\u201d Facing immense pressure, he resigned in 2023 and was banned by FIFA for three years. Rubiales had said he was the victim of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d by \u201cfalse feminists.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors, Hermoso and Spain\u2019s players\u2019 association want a prison sentence of two-and-a-half years for Rubiales, a payment of 50,000 euros ($51,800) for damages and for him to be banned from working as a sports official.",
      "When asked if at any point Rubiales had asked Hermoso if he could kiss her, the Spain forward said no.",
      "\u201cI didn't hear or understand anything,\u201d Hermoso said. \u201cThe next thing he did was to grab me by the ears and kiss me on the mouth.\u201d",
      "Rubiales could face a fine or a prison sentence of one to four years if found guilty, according to court officials.",
      "Hermoso had celebrated with her teammates after the kiss at the World Cup awards ceremony in Australia. When asked about those champagne-fueled celebrations on Monday, Hermoso said she chose to celebrate her team's victory like any footballer would.",
      "\u201cFor me, it was important to be able to celebrate this moment,\u201d she said.",
      "The trial is expected to last at least 10 days. Among the nearly 20 witnesses expected to testify are Spain\u2019s men\u2019s national team coach Luis de la Fuente and some of Hermoso\u2019s teammates on the women's team, including former world player of the year Alexia Putellas.",
      "Rubiales is required to attend only the first and the last day, according to the court.",

They are accused of allegedly pressuring Hermoso to defend Rubiales publicly in a statement after the incident, which she refused to do.",
      "Hermoso said that after the incident and ensuing controversy, her life had been put on standby. She said she was able to escape the spotlight that she was thrust into after the incident in Mexico, where she plays for a club team.",
      "The incident overshadowed Spain's first women's World Cup victory, triggering protests and widespread condemnation.",

      "Lindsey Vonn has faced a lot of second guessing about her comeback to ski racing at age 40 this season",
      "SAALBACH-HINTERGLEMM, Austria -- When Tom Brady played in the NFL well beyond the age of 40, he wasn't considered crazy for facing 300-pound defensive linemen intent on sacking him.",
      "When Lewis Hamilton recently got behind the wheel of a Ferrari Formula 1 car for the first time at 40, he wasn't told he's too old for the elite auto racing series.",
      "So why did Lindsey Vonn face so much second guessing in Europe about her comeback to ski racing at age 40 this season?",
      "Maybe it's the speeds in downhill that exceed 80 mph (130 kph). Or maybe it was because of Vonn's long history of crashes and injuries. Or maybe it's because no woman of her caliber had ever done it before \u2014 even though plenty of men have competed successfully in ski racing beyond 40.",
      "Whatever it was, Vonn has a simple explanation for why she returned. It has a lot to do with the multiple injuries that ended her career prematurely back in 2019 and the surgery to replace part of her right knee with titanium that has her feeling better than she has since she was in her 20s.",
      "\u201cThe why is that I love skiing,\u201d Vonn told The Associated Press in a recent interview ahead of the world championships starting this week. \u201cThe last few years of my career, I was in a lot of pain and I was dealing with a lot of injuries. And I haven\u2019t felt this good in a long, long time.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really solid. My position is solid. I think I\u2019m technically actually skiing better now than I was when I retired,\" Vonn added. \"But the \u2018why\u2019 is just I love it. I love going fast and I\u2019m still capable of doing it. I know that I\u2019m still competitive. I think I\u2019ve proven already that I\u2019m competitive. So why not?\u201d",
      "Before Vonn returned in December after nearly six years of retirement, two-time Olympic champion Michaela Dorfmeister suggested that the American \u201cshould see a psychologist,\u201d adding on Austrian TV, \u201cDoes she want to kill herself?\u201d",
      "Austrian downhill great Franz Klammer said \u201cshe\u2019s gone completely mad\u201d and four-time overall World Cup champion Pirmin Zurbriggen said that Vonn \u201chasn\u2019t recognized the meaning and purpose of her other life in recent years.\u201d",
      "But Vonn showed that she can still be competitive when she finished sixth and fourth in a downhill and a super-G in St. Anton, Austria, last month. She's still rediscovering her speed and has had a few minor falls during her comeback, but she also now has had more time to regain her timing entering worlds at another Austrian resort \u2014 in Saalbach-Hinterglemm.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m 40,\" Vonn said. \"I think if you would have asked this question a year and a half ago or a year ago, I would have said, \u2018Yeah, I feel really old.\u2019 But with my knee I feel so much better. And it\u2019s possible. Anything is possible.\u201d",
      "Besides Brady and Hamilton, Vonn is also inspired by the way Serena Williams excelled even at the end of her career near age 40.",
      "\u201cTom, Lewis, Serena. They\u2019ve all done it,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cThe resources that athletes have now allow for a better recovery. So even though you\u2019re older, you\u2019re still recovering faster than I was when I was in my 20s.",
      "Vonn and Mikaela Shiffrin are both back just in time to lend some serious star power to the worlds \u2014 the biggest event in skiing outside of the Olympics.",
      "Shiffrin returned to the circuit on Thursday when she placed 10th in a World Cup slalom in Courchevel, France. It was her first race back in two months after crashing and suffering a deep puncture wound on her side.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m catching up to the fastest in the world,\" Shiffrin said, \u201cso I have a lot of work to do.\u201d",
      "The two Americans are the winningest female racers in World Cup history with 99 victories for Shiffrin and 82 for Vonn.",
      "There\u2019s even a chance that Vonn and Shiffrin could team up in the new team combined event that entails one squad member competing in downhill and the other in slalom \u2014 with their two times added together to determine the final results.",
      "In terms of pedigree, there couldn't be a better team: Vonn is the all-time leader in World Cup downhill victories with 43 and Shiffrin holds the mark in slalom with 62 \u2014 both records among men and women.",
      "First, though, Vonn will be in the spotlight during her individual events of super-G and downhill on Thursday and Saturday, respectively.",
      "Shiffrin is planning to compete in only two individual events: the giant slalom and slalom on Feb. 13 and 15.",
      "The women\u2019s team combined event is scheduled for Feb. 11.",

      "IOWA CITY, Iowa -- Caitlin Clark wasn\u2019t back in her home arena to play a game.",
      "Still, the \u201cbutterflies,\u201d the former Iowa guard said, were quite similar.",
      "Clark returned to Iowa\u2019s Carver-Hawkeye Arena on Sunday to have her number 22 retired in a ceremony after the Hawkeyes\u2019 76-67 win over No. 4 USC, one season after she completed her historic college career.",
      "\u201cI feel like I already have those butterflies in your stomach when you walk in here,\u201d Clark said during a pregame press conference. \u201cNot so much for a basketball game now, but obviously just to be around everybody and to enjoy this environment. I don\u2019t have to go and compete for 40 minutes, even though I wish maybe I could. I think it will definitely be a little bit more emotional that I don\u2019t have to compete.\u201d",
      "Clark was at center court with her family as the No. 22 went up into the rafters. She was smiling throughout the ceremony.",
      "The jersey retirement capped a historic career for Clark at Iowa. She became college basketball\u2019s all-time leading scorer while leading the Hawkeyes to back-to-back appearances in the NCAA national championship game the last two seasons.",
      "A sellout crowd of 14,998 included Lisa Bluder, Clark\u2019s former coach at Iowa, and Stephanie White, Clark\u2019s current coach with the WNBA\u2019s Indiana Fever. The Fever will play an exhibition game at Iowa next season.",
      "Former Iowa teammates Kate Martin and Gabbie Marshall were in courtside seats alongside former talk-show host David Letterman. USC\u2019s coaches and players stayed on the court after the game to witness the ceremony.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t cheap to get in,\u201d Clark quipped during the ceremony.",
      "Iowa coach Jan Jensen told about seeing Clark for the first time as a freshman at West Des Moines Dowling High School.",
      "\u201cOur staff, we made a pact that we were going to do everything we could to be the last one standing,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cAnd we are so thankful that we were the last one standing. Caitlin, she\u2019s truly generational. She changed the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe positive image that you\u2019ve brought to this basketball program, this university, this state, and women\u2019s basketball nationally, is unmeasurable,\u201d Bluder said. \u201cI\u2019ve spent my entire career trying to empower young women. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. But you\u2019ve done more than that in the last four years, more than anyone can imagine.\u201d",
      "Clark reflected before the game on her time with the Hawkeyes, when she was part of teams that reached four NCAA tournaments and won three Big Ten Tournament titles.",
      "\u201cThe winning came because of the great culture that we had,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd for me, I hope that\u2019s the thing that always stays intact, and I know it will, because of the great coaching staff we have and the type of players that they are here. We had players that were selfless. We had players that didn\u2019t care how many points you were going to score. They\u2019re going to do whatever they could for your teammates. They were going to hold their teammates accountable. And I think that\u2019s a lost art in college these days, and you don\u2019t always see that.\u201d",
      "Clark knows she is in a constant media spotlight these days, whether it\u2019s attending concerts or joining Taylor Swift in a suite at a Kansas City Chiefs NFL playoff game. She said she understands the criticism that comes with the attention.",
      "\u201cI feel like one of my greatest skills is I really don\u2019t care,\u201d Clark said. \u201cI don\u2019t care \u2014 I believe in myself. I\u2019m confident in myself. I\u2019m confident in my teammates. I try to instill that in them. I\u2019m confident in the coaching staff on whatever team I was on, whether that was here, whether that\u2019s with the Fever now, and you just rely on those people. Nobody gets to step inside of your locker room. Everybody thinks they know everything and have an answer, but that\u2019s just not reality.\u201d",
      "Clark's jersey was hung in the rafters on the same day that South Carolina retired A'ja Wilson's jersey. They both wore 22 in college.",

      "Researchers across the country are in \u201ca mad scramble\u201d to sort out what public data the Trump administration has deleted from government websites",
      "NEW YORK -- Researchers are in what one described as \u201ca mad scramble\u201d to sort out what public data the Trump administration has deleted from government websites and electronic publications.",
      "Late last week, federal agencies took down scores of government webpages as staffers hurried to comply with President Donald Trump\u2019s order rolling back protections for transgender people, which required the removal of \u201cgender ideology\u201d language from websites, contracts and emails.",
      "Some of the sites were back online Monday, but data analysts say it's not clear exactly what was removed or changed.",
      "\u201cYou go looking for something and it's just not there,\u201d said Amy O'Hara, a Georgetown University researcher who is president of the Association of Public Data Users.",
      "Social science researchers and other federal data users on Monday described feeling like a five-alarm fire was triggered when they discovered late last week that vital federal datasets were inaccessible.",
      "It sparked \u201ca mad scramble right now\u201d to grab copies of whatever federal data was posted before, O'Hara said.",
      "While the administration's stated goal was to delete gender and transgender terminology, O'Hara said some researchers worry that other politically charged topics \u2014 such as climate change or vaccines \u2014 might be removed or altered.",
      "A expert panel affiliated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention demanded a meeting on the deletions.",
      "The committee, chartered by Congress to advise the CDC director, asked the agency's acting director, Susan Monarez, for an explanation about why it had cut off access to datasets \u201cthat allow people across the country to understand the health of their communities.\u201d",
      "The panel had yet to receive a response, said committee member Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a former federal health official who is now a health policy expert at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "Experts say datasets and summaries were affected, but so too were codebooks that explain different variables. They say they also saw changes to published research that used affected datasets, and even redactions to lists of publications about certain topics.",
      "\u201cThe scale of this is quite stunning,\u201d O'Hara said.",
      "Researchers are still stumbling on what was taken down or changed, she added.",
      "\u201cWe are finding out about omissions when somebody goes searching for it,\u201d O'Hara said.",
      "On Monday, for instance, when a query was made to access certain data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s most comprehensive survey of American life, users got a response that said the area was \u201cunavailable due to maintenance.\u201d",
      "The CDC\u2019s official public portal for health data, data.cdc.gov, was taken down entirely on Friday but went back up over the weekend, albeit with a yellow ribbon at the top saying: \u201cCDC\u2019s website is being modified to comply with President Trump\u2019s Executive Orders.\u201d The agency's Youth Risk Behavior Survey data was restored too, but with at least one of the gender columns missing and its data documentation removed.",
      "CDC officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The U.S. statistical system is considered the best in the world and researchers fear that the removals will undermine trust and put the integrity of the data at risk.",
      "\u201cThis sets a really dangerous precedent that any administration can come in and delete whatever they don\u2019t like,\u201d said Beth Jarosz, a senior program director at the Population Reference Bureau. \u201cRegardless of your politics, this should alarm you since this is taxpayer-funded data and it belongs to the public.\u201d",

      "Google went to appeals court Monday in an attempt to convince a three-judge panel to overturn a jury\u2019s verdict declaring its app store for Android smartphones as an illegal monopoly and block the penalties imposed by a federal judge to stop the misbeha...",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Google went to appeals court Monday in an attempt to convince a three-judge panel to overturn a jury's verdict declaring its app store for Android smartphones as an illegal monopoly and block the penalties imposed by a federal judge to stop the misbehavior. Video game maker Epic Games, which brought the case alleging Google's Play Store has been abusing its stranglehold over the Android app market, countered with arguments outlining why both the verdict and punishment should be affirmed to foster more innovation and lower prices.",
      "In a nearly hour-long presentation in San Francisco's Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Google lawyer Jessica Ellsworth explained why the company believes the judge overseeing a month-long trial in 2023 improperly allowed the market in its case to be defined differently than it had in a similar antitrust trial revolving around Apple's antitrust trial in 2021.",
      "Ellsworth also asserted the trial shouldn't have been decided by a jury in the first place because Google exercised its consent to that process and demanded the case be decided by a judge instead, as had the trial by Apple.",
      "Epic, the maker of the popular Fortnite video game, filed separate antitrust cases against Apple and Google on the same day in August 2020 and culminated in dramatically different outcomes. Unlike the jury in Google's trial in San Francisco, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers largely sided with Apple in an 185-decision that defined the Play Store and Apple's iPhone app store as part of a broader competitive market.",
      "Ellsworth told the appeals court that U.S. District Judge James Donato improperly allowed Epic to turn the Google trial into a \u201cdo-over\u201d that excluded the Apple app store as a rival in the market definition that led to the jury's verdict in its case.",
      "\"You can't just lose an issue that was fully litigated the first time (in the Apple case) and then pretend it didn't happen,\" Ellsworth said. She said the competition that Google and Apple engage in while making the two operating systems that power virtually all of the world's smartphones \u201csufficiently disciplines\u201d their actions in the app market.",
      "But the appeals judges indicated they believed the market definitions could differ in the separate app store cases because Apple bundles all its software and the iPhone together \u2014 creating what has become known as a \u201cwalled garden\u201d \u2014 while Google licenses the Android software that includes its Play Store a wide variety of smartphone makers.",
      "\u201cThere are clearly some factual differences between the Android world and Apple world,\u201d Judge Danielle J. Forrest told Ellsworth.",
      "Judge Gabriel Sanchez also sounded skeptical about Google's claims about being lumped with an improper market definition in its trial.",
      "\u201cEven if Google vigorously competes with Apple (in smartphone operating systems), that doesn't mean it can't create a different ecosystem where it's a monopolist,\u201d Sanchez interjected during Ellsworth's presentation.",
      "Epic attorney Gary Bornstein painted Google's arguments as a desperate and unfounded effort to preserve the system that boosts Google's profits with price-gouging commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on in-app purchases flowing from software downloaded through the Play Store.",
      "The penalties that Donato imposed in October and subsequently postponed while Google pursues its appeal would impose a series of sweeping changes that include making the Play Store's entire library of 2 million apps available to potential competitors \u2014 a move expected to result in lower commission rates.",
      "The appeals court hasn't set a timeline for issuing a ruling in the Play Store case, but it typically takes several months before a decision is reached.",
      "Google is also currently facing other potential penalties that could include being forced to sell its Chrome web browser after a judge in another antitrust trial ruled its ubiquitous search engine is an illegal monopoly, too.",
      "In Monday's two-hour hearing Bornstein contended that Google never tried to define the Android app market during the trial the way it presented it during its appeal and reminded the three-judge panel that the bar should be set high before reversing a jury's verdict and the ensuing punishment ordered by a lower court judge.",
      "\u201cThe benefit of the doubt does not go to the wrongdoer,\u201d Bornstein said.",
      "The judges seemed more troubled by Donato's decision to stick with a jury trial after the case changed shortly before the Epic trial when Google settled lawsuits brought by attorneys general across the U.S. and another prominent app developer, Match Group. An agreement for a jury trial had been reached when the attorneys general and Match cases were going to be combined with Epic's, but Google wanted to revert to having a judge decide the outcome after settling some of the claims only to be rebuffed by Donato.",
      "At one point during Bornstein's presentation, Forrest openly mused about the possibility of declaring the verdict as a decision rendered by the equivalent of an advisory jury and sending the case back to Donato for a more lengthy ruling.",
      "That is an approach favored by Ellsworth, who pointed out that the judge's ruling in the Apple app store case spanned nearly 200 pages while the jury in the Google trial \u201cwere asked eight questions and they offered 14 words defining a relevant market.\u201d",
      "But Bornstein urged the appeals court to resort to giving Donato a \u201chomework assignment\u201d that would give Google more time to profit from its illegal conduct.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 00:14:26 -0500",
    "summary": "America&rsquo;s national bird, the bald eagle, is having a moment",
    "story": [
      "America\u2019s national bird, the bald eagle, is having a moment",
      "WEST ORANGE, N.J. -- Along the long road from American icon to endangered species and back again, the bald eagle \u2014 the national bird of the United States, often seen against a clear blue sky \u2014 is having a moment.",
      "The eagles find themselves in an environmental updraft of sorts since the early 2000's, when the federal government took the thriving birds off its endangered species list with more states following suit. Culturally, too, the animals are soaring.",
      "In December, Joe Biden signed legislation making the raptor the country's national bird (thought that was already the case? More in a bit). This month, New Jersey became the latest state to delist the bald eagle as endangered, citing a remarkable comeback for the creatures associated with strength and independence \u2014 and that occupied just a single nest in the state decades ago. And to the chagrin or elation of football fans, the Philadelphia Eagles will be vying for a championship in the Super Bowl this weekend.",
      "How did the storied birds find their way back? As with so many tales, it's complex.",
      "The story \u2014 there was a single nesting pair in New Jersey in the 1980s and roughly 300 now, for instance \u2014 centers on the banning of DDT, a chemical insecticide with environmental side effects that included thin-shelled eagle eggs. That touched off a cratering in the number of eagles across the country, and officials prohibited the pesticide in 1972.",
      "To rebuild the birds' numbers in their historic range across the country, conservationists imported birds from places where their populations were stable, including from Canada. Early on, they also removed eggs from nesting birds' nests, replacing them with artificial ones for the eagles to \u201cincubate\u201d while the real eggs were safely hatched outside the nest before being returned, as eaglets for their parents to raise according to Kathy Clark, the head of New Jersey's Endangered and Nongame Species Program.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re one of the few conservation success stories of animals that almost went extinct on our continent. And so I think now it\u2019s really important to make sure people know that story and learn from it,\u201d said Maia Edwards, the science director at the American Bald Eagle Foundation in Alaska.",
      "Clark, whose work with the birds spans decades and includes the period when their numbers were so small they lived only in a remote part of the state, said the eagles have taught officials a number of lessons. One is that they're \u201cfairly adaptable\" and now live across densely populated (with people) New Jersey \u2014 from suburban Bergen County near New York to the wetlands along the shore in the south.",
      "She recalled the story of one fledgling eagle in a suburban town \u2014 New York Giants territory, as it were, sorry, Eagles fans \u2014 that found itself on a backyard woodpile and walking around the street. Volunteer observers worried over the bird's well-being, given the realities of suburban living. But a year later, observers spotted the eagle, identified by a band. It had apparently made it.",
      "\u201cThose birds that, you know, have that tolerance to live like in such a densely human structured environment is something I have a hard time understanding,\u201d she said. \u201cThey're Jersey birds. You got to have attitude, right?\u201d",
      "The birds do face dangers as they expand into suburbia, though. Jilian Fazio, director of the Essex County Turtle Back Zoo in suburban northern New Jersey, said the zoo rescues a number of birds hit by cars. One bird, a male named Freedom, perched atop a branch in his enclosure at the zoo recently and called out loudly. He was found dangling by a rope, left with an injury that renders him unreleasable, Fazio said.",
      "There are threats, as well. Habitat preservation and clean, open water, since the eagles feed heavily on fish, is a worry, but there's also the current outbreak of avian influenza or bird flu. Clark says officials are going to maintain surveillance amid the outbreak.",
      "Beyond the birds coming off endangered lists, they made headlines recently for finally getting their due as the county's national bird, an oversight left undone in law because the bald eagle was already on the national seal and many thought it already had that status, said Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who sponsored legislation that Biden signed last month.",
      "She and colleagues worked with Native American and veterans groups to get buy-in for the legislation, she said, and it passed the typically divisive House and Senate last year with no dissent. The birds are revered in a number of Native American cultures as symbols of strength, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, according to Paul Apodaca, a retired academic who specializes in folklore and mythology.",
      "The eagles' perch as symbols of the country contributes to their conservation, with experts considering them an \u201cumbrella species,\u201d whose need for large open spaces and waterways helps preserve lesser known wildlife.",
      "\u201cAmericans are always going to have that sort of personal relationship with bald eagles,\" Clark said.",
      "Experiencing seeing a bird in the wild or even as you're driving along a business-lined highway can leave an impression. Dan Day, a birder who's spotted bald eagles some 50 times in recent years both on nature walks and just driving around suburban New Jersey, remembered never having seen the birds as a kid growing up in Cleveland. Now a New Jersey resident and Philadelphia Eagles fan, he regularly goes out in his green \u201cBirds\u201d cap and binoculars.",
      "\u201cJust the mere thrill of seeing one \u2014 a lot of people just have never, ever looked at one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really elevates your day to see a bald eagle.\u201d",
      "Enjoy watching them, experts say, but give them space, too. Because rescuing animals threatened with extinction is expensive, uncertain work. Said Clark, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection official: \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever will lose that perspective of, of being on the brink there, not knowing if if you\u2019re going to be able to save the species.\"",

      "With his 70th birthday looming on this year's horizon, Microsoft founder Bill Gates looked inward to open a window into the man behind Windows and other seminal software that turned the personal computer into a household staple.",
      "Gates focuses on the first quarter-century of his life in \u201cSource Code: My Beginnings,\u201d the opening installment in a retrospective trilogy about an insouciant, impertinent and often misunderstood kid who grew up to become a polarizing technology titan before morphing into an influential philanthropist.",
      "In \u201cSource Code,\u201d Gates explores how his childhood quirks, upbringing, friendships and experiences coalesced into shaping his own internal operating system. Along the way, he dissects his brain's unusual wiring, delves into the emotional trauma of his best friend dying while they were both in high school, and revisits the birth of Traf-O-Data, a trailblazing startup that he launched in Albuquerque, New Mexico with another childhood friend, Paul Allen.",
      "Traf-O-Data, conceived to create software for the groundbreaking Altair computer made Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, became Microsoft in 1975 \u2014 a year it booked $16,005 in revenue while Gates and Allen were making $9 per hour.",
      "By 1977, Microsoft had become successful enough to embolden Gates to drop out of Harvard University. In 1979, he had decided to move Microsoft to the Seattle area where he grew up. Although Gates stepped down as Microsoft's CEO 25 years ago, the Windows operating system and other software created under his reign remain the main pillar in a company that now generates $212 billion in annual revenue, boasts a $3.1 trillion market value, and accounts for most of Gates' $100 billion personal fortune.",
      "\u201cSource Code\u201d ends with Gates's drive back to Seattle in 1979, meaning it doesn't touch upon his 1994 marriage to Melinda French, nor their 2021 divorce.",
      "\u201cI am being reflective, which is not my normal mode, but it\u2019s kind of time,\u201d Gates said during an interview about the book with The Associated Press. \u201cAs we went back and got teacher\u2019s comments or people I worked with at Harvard, it was fascinating. I had confused myself into thinking I got straight A\u2019s in ninth grade.\u201d",
      "That might not sound like much of a revelation, but it was a surprise to the cerebral Gates, who paints himself in the book as a \u201cbratty smartass\u201d prone to dismissively sneering, \u201cThat's the stupidest thing I ever heard,\u201d about remarks that seemed nonsensical to him.",
      "Gate's self-portrait is that of a nerd nicknamed \u201cTrey\u201d by his card-playing grandmother because he was the third male on this father's side of the family to be named Bill. He was a pipsqueak who had difficulty making friends and preferred living in his own head before he discovered computers, which became like slot machines that rewarded him for writing elegant lines of code.",
      "When he did talk, the young Gates rocked back and forth like a metronome setting a rhythm for his brain \u2014 a habit that surfaced during parts of his 45-minute interview with the AP.",
      "\u201cIt was a little weird because it was hard to direct my attention,\u201d Gates recalled during the interview. \u201cI had one year in school where they said, \u2018Oh we should put you ahead a couple grades.\u2019 And then another time, they said, \u2018No, we should hold you back.\u2019 And it\u2019s like, \u2018Well make up your mind.\u2019 They were a little confounded.\u201d",
      "Although he didn't realize it as a boy, Gates has no doubt he was and still is neurodivergent who channeled that anomaly into learning to program computers at the right time in the right place with the patient support of his late parents (the book is dedicated to them, along with his sister, Kristi and Libby).",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I was an adult that there was this idea that there are kids that have this kind of unique ability to concentrate but less social skills. I certainly would be included in that,\u201d Gates said. \u201cI encourage people who have strengths and deficits to kind of map their ambition onto something that plays to their strengths. Being able to think just about programming and how you do it better ended up being invaluable for me.\u201d",
      "Gates also had the advantage of growing up in a family that could afford to pay for him to attend a private high school in Seattle. Still, that privilege didn't insulate him from the trauma he experienced when his best friend, Kent Evans, died in a mountain climbing accident in May 1972 \u2014 a year before they were going to graduate.",
      "Evans' death occurred while he and Gates were preparing to spend much of the summer working on a program for their school, but what hurt far more was the loss of someone who understood him and helped give him a sense of purpose for the first time in his life.",
      "\u201cI had no notion of a friend just being gone. It was the only negative thing in my childhood,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIt shapes you, that someone can just disappear \u2014 somebody you loved and would have done things with. He would have been part of whatever I ended up going on to do. I give Kent credit, along with Paul (Allen), for setting the direction that I ended up going down.\u201d",
      "Evans' death provided the impetus for Gates to reconnect with Allen, who was already attending college, to help him with his programming projects. Allen, three years older than Gates and a passionate fan of legendary guitarist Jimi Hendrix, did more than just help with the coding. He also offered Gates some LSD in an attempt to lure his partner down a more psychedelic path.",
      "Gates rebuffed Allen at first but decided to drop acid with a group of high school friends shortly before his 1973 graduation, according to the book.",
      "It wasn't a pleasant experience, a reaction that Gates thought might have been related to the dental surgery he underwent the day after his LSD trip. He tried LSD again with Allen in October 1974 while they were watching an episode of the old \"Kung Fu\" series on TV, and decided he would be better off without psychedelic drugs even though Apple co-founder Steve Jobs contended Microsoft would have created better products had Gates taken more acid.",
      "\"I thought maybe I\u2019d seem cool if I took it, but that didn\u2019t happen,\" Gates said during the interview. \u201cI would say Steve was definitely more hip than I was. He took a lot more acid than I did. He had a sense of style. I had some charisma in terms of motivating engineers and saying this great thing (with personal computers) would happen, but Steve had natural speaking and charisma capabilities, even beyond mine. So I always envied him for the things he did.\"",
      "Gates' mind is now being blown by the recent advances in artificial intelligence \u2014 a technology being planted into Microsoft's software as part of its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI.",
      "\u201cWhen I finally see ChatGPT-4, where the OpenAI guys show me a very early version, I am just blown away completely,\u201d Gates said. He views AI as an \u201camazing and scary\u201d technology that should be rigorously monitored.",
      "\u201cYou should be nervous. We have to acknowledge that AI is almost uniquely dangerous because it\u2019s unbounded in terms of how good it will get and it\u2019s happening within a generation,\u201d Gates said. \u201cHopefully, the politicians and the technologists will share with each other, and we can shape this thing. We better get on top of that now.\u201d",
      "If nothing else, Gates is hoping \u201cSource Code\u201d will help people see a more human side of him, even if he might never been seen as the cultural tastemaker that Jobs was.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I was completely uncool,\u201d Gates said. \u201cBut once I got going on Microsoft, I was willing to be pretty monomaniacal. Even people I competed with found it very intimidating how focused I was. I really didn\u2019t goof off in my 20s because my whole thing was having Microsoft move at full speed.\u201d",
      "Perhaps Gates will delve deeper into the monomania that made him so rich, famous and sometimes reviled in the next book about his life \u2014 an installment that he says won't be done until sometime in 2027, at the earliest."

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Samoa\u2019s top health official on Monday denounced as \u201ca complete lie\u201d remarks that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made during his bid to become U.S. health secretary, rejecting his claim that some who died in the country's 2019 measles epidemic didn't have the disease.",
      "\"We don\u2019t know what was killing them,\" Kennedy said during tense U.S. Senate hearings last week on whether he should oversee the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, suggesting that the cause of the 83 deaths \u2014 mostly of children under age 5 \u2014 was unclear.",
      "\"It's a total fabrication,\u201d Samoa Director-General of Health Dr. Alec Ekeroma told The Associated Press of Kennedy's comments.",
      "U.S. senators grilled Kennedy last week over his 2019 Samoa trip, accusing him of downplaying his role in the epidemic.",
      "The outbreak devastated the Pacific island nation in 2019, killing 83 people in a population of 200,000. Vaccination rates were historically low because of poor public health management and the 2018 deaths of two babies whose vaccines were incorrectly prepared, prompting fears that the MMR immunization was unsafe before the nature of the error was discovered.",
      "The government suspended vaccinations for 10 months before the outbreak \u2014 the period when Kennedy visited. His trip was organized by a Samoan anti-vaccine influencer, according to a 2021 blog post by Kennedy.",
      "On Wednesday, Kennedy denied that his visit had fueled anti-vaccine sentiment. A spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.",
      "\u201cAnti-vaxxers from New Zealand came to be with him here,\u201d Ekeroma said. \u201cThat's how I know that his influence can be far-reaching.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen the tissue samples were sent to New Zealand, most of those people did not have measles,\u201d Kennedy told U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat.",
      "Ekeroma, a medical doctor who also holds a doctorate in health, said that the claim was a \u201chuge denial\u201d of the fact that doctors from several countries traveled to Samoa to treat measles patients.",
      "The Samoan official wasn't the health chief during the outbreak, but confirmed key details with his predecessor, he said. Only one autopsy was carried out and no post-mortem tissue samples were sent abroad, which was not unusual because measles is a simple disease to diagnose, said Ekeroma.",
      "Blood samples from living patients were sent to Australia and New Zealand, where the public health agency said Monday that testing had confirmed the same strain of measles circulating in New Zealand at the time.",
      "\u201cI went there \u2013 nothing to do with vaccines,\u201d Kennedy said Wednesday. \u201cI went there to introduce a medical informatics system that would digitalize records in Samoa and make health delivery much more efficient.\u201d",
      "Ekeroma rejected that assertion, referring to social media posts by anti-vaccine advocates who posed for photos with Kennedy during his trip. One later wrote on the blog of Kennedy's then nonprofit, Children\u2019s Health Defense \u2014 which has decried MMR vaccines as unsafe \u2014 that during the outbreak he received advice from people assembled by Kennedy encouraging the alternative treatments he was supplying to Samoan families.",
      "In the same blog post, Kennedy recalled meeting Samoa's then prime minister, who he said was \u201ccurious to measure health outcomes following the \u2018natural experiment\u2019 created by the national respite from vaccines.\u201d",
      "In late 2019, Kennedy wrote to the leader, saying that the deaths could have been caused by a measles vaccine \u2014 statements he repeated in written responses to senators' questions following the hearing. He urged the Samoan leader to approach a particular laboratory to investigate the source of the outbreak.",
      "\u201cMy words had nothing to do with vaccine uptake in Samoa or with the 2019 epidemic,\u201d Kennedy said in his written responses.",
      "But Kennedy emboldened anti-vaccine contacts in Samoa, Ekeroma said, and the epidemic was fueled by disinformation in social media posts in the island nation and abroad.",
      "Moelagi Leilani Jackson, a Samoan nurse who worked on the vaccination campaign, told the AP in 2023 that anti-vaccine campaigners \u201cgot louder\u201d after Kennedy\u2019s visit.",
      "\u201cI feel like they felt they had the support of Kennedy,\u201d she said.",
      "However, Ekeroma said that Kennedy's overtures weren't heeded by the nation\u2019s leaders. A vaccination campaign resumed in 2019 and measles vaccines are now compulsory for Samoan children.",
      "If Kennedy is affirmed as the top U.S. health official this week, it would be \u201ca danger to us, a danger to everyone,\u201d Ekeroma said. Kennedy would control U.S. funding for vaccination initiatives and could make affordable vaccines harder for small nations like Samoa to access, the official said.",
      "\u201cIf he\u2019s going to be appointed, then we will have to actually discuss around the Pacific as to how we\u2019re going to try to neutralize his influence in the region,\u201d he added.",

    "story": [
      "Researchers have found the oldest known evidence of lead pollution dating to around 5,200 years ago in ancient Greece",
      "WASHINGTON -- Ancient Greece produced the earliest records of democracy, western philosophy \u2014 and, it turns out, lead pollution.",
      "Researchers studying sediment cores recovered from mainland Greece and the Aegean Sea have found the oldest known evidence of lead pollution in the environment dating to around 5,200 years ago.",
      "That's 1,200 years older than the previous earliest recorded lead pollution, which was found in a peatbog in Serbia.",
      "In antiquity, lead was released into the atmosphere as a byproduct of smelting ore for copper and silver. The toxic metal later condensed as dust and settled onto the soil.",
      "\u201cSilver was used for jewelry, for special objects \u2014 but it wasn't found in a pure state,\u201d but mined in ore combined with lead, said Heidelberg University archaeologist Joseph Maran, co-author of a new study published Thursday in Communications Earth and Environment.",
      "The site with the earliest signs of lead contamination is located in northeastern Greece, near the island of Thasos. Prior archaeological evidence suggests Thasos was one of the region\u2019s most significant sites for silver mining and metalwork, said Maran.",
      "\u201cLead released from smelting is the world\u2019s first form of toxic or industrial pollution,\u201d said Yale historian Joseph Manning, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The researchers found that levels of lead contamination remained fairly low and localized in ancient Greece, considered the cradle of European civilization, throughout the Bronze Age, the Classical period and the Hellenistic period. The Classical period is famous for Athenian democracy, Socrates and Plato, and the Hellenistic period saw Greek cultural influence peak across the Mediterranean region.",
      "But around 2,150 years ago, the researchers detected \u201ca very strong and abrupt increase\" in lead emissions caused by human activities across Greece, said co-author Andreas Koutsodendris at Heidelberg University.",
      "Around that time, in 146 B.C., the Roman army conquered the Greek peninsula, transforming the region\u2019s society and economy. As Roman trade, colonies and shipping expanded across the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, demand for silver coins grew rapidly, requiring smelting that released lead, said Koutsodendris.",
      "Later the Roman Empire used lead for tableware and for construction, including pipes.",
      "Previous research \u2013 including an analysis of ice cores from Greenland \u2013 had detected high levels of lead across much of the Northern Hemisphere during Roman times.",

      "BANGKOK -- The 40-year-old founder of China\u2019s DeepSeek, an AI startup that has startled markets with its capacity to compete with industry leaders like OpenAI, kept a low profile as he built up a hedge fund and then refined its quantitative models to branch into artificial intelligence.",
      "Liang Wenfeng, who founded DeepSeek in 2023, was born in southern China's Guangdong and studied in eastern China's Zhejiang province, home to e-commerce giant Alibaba and other tech firms, according to Chinese media reports.",
      "The hedge fund he set up in 2015, High-Flyer Quantitative Investment Management, developed models for computerized stock trading and began using machine-learning techniques to refine those strategies.",
      "Like many Chinese quantitative traders, High-Flyer was hit by losses when regulators cracked down on such trading in the past year. However, it reportedly manages $8 billion in assets, ample resources for funding DeepSeek\u2019s AI research.",
      "It also has abundant computing power for AI, since High-Flyer had by 2022 amassed a cluster of 10,000 of California-based Nvidia\u2019s high-performance A100 graphics processor chips that are used to build and run AI systems, according to a post that summer on Chinese social media platform WeChat. The U.S. soon after restricted sales of those chips to China.",
      "\u201cThing is, we are sure now that we want to do this, can do this, and are capable of doing this, so we\u2019re among the best-suited candidates to tackle it at this moment,\" Liang told Waves, a tech media outlet, in 2023.",
      "\u201cCurrently, neither tech giants nor startups have an unassailable lead. With OpenAI paving the way, everyone is working with published papers and open-source code,\u201d it quoted him as saying.",
      "Liang said he spends his days reading papers, writing code, and participating in group discussions, like other researchers.",
      "DeepSeek is exploring what intelligence means, he said.",
      "\u201cPeople may think there\u2019s some hidden business logic behind this, but it\u2019s mainly driven by curiosity,\u201d Liang said.",
      "When DeepSeek was asked, \u201cWho is Liang Wenfeng?\u201d its first answer was to name a different Chinese entrepreneur with the same name, at least as spelled in English letters.",
      "When asked: \u201cWhere is Liang Wenfeng from and where did he go to university?\u201d it said that as of October 2023, the most recent knowledge cutoff for DeepSeek's R1 AI model, \u201cthere is no publicly available information about Liang Wenfeng\u2019s background, including his place of origin or educational history.\"",
      "\"If you are referring to the founder of DeepSeek, details about his personal life or academic background have not been disclosed publicly. For more information about DeepSeek, you can visit its official website,\u201d it said.",
      "Liang's focused approach fits in with his determination to push AI learning forward. After decades of relying on innovation from the West, he says China should be making its own contributions.",
      "\u201cWhat we see is that Chinese AI can\u2019t be in the position of following forever. We often say that there is a gap of one or two years between Chinese AI and the United States, but the real gap is the difference between originality and imitation,\u201d he said in another Waves interview in November. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t change, China will always be only a follower \u2014 so some exploration is inescapable.\u201d",

      "PARK CITY, Utah -- Access to the Sundance Film Festival doesn\u2019t require a trip to Park City, Utah, anymore \u2014 just an internet connection. Over half of the films that premiered this past week will be available to steam on the festival\u2019s online platform starting Thursday.",
      "What started as a COVID-era necessity has become one of the festival\u2019s most beloved components, even for those who do brave the cold and the lines to see films in person.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s really great to be able to offer that opportunity to our audiences, but also to our artists. Sundance is a festival of discovery and each of the films coming to the festival is seeking that moment with audiences,\u201d said festival director Eugene Hernandez. \u201cHow cool is it that even for that short window of time, just a few days, folks from anywhere in the country can log on in their living room with family and friends, get together and watch a few of the films?\u201d",
      "The Sundance Film Festival website has information on the technical requirements, but there are ways to watch on your computer and television. After you click the \u201cWatch Now\u201d button, you have five hours to complete the feature film.",
      "Anyone in the U.S. can access the online portal. Rights restrictions make the films and shows unavailable to stream internationally.",
      "All of the feature films playing in the main competitions are included on the platform and a few extras, many of which do not yet have theatrical distribution plans. That includes the Dylan O\u2019Brien breakout \u201cTwinless,\u201d the Marlee Matlin, Sally Ride and Selena Quintanilla documentaries, and Ukrainian documentaries \u201c2000 Meters to Andriivka\u201d and \u201cMr. Nobody Against Putin.\u201d",

A24 will release both the Ayo Edebiri film \u201cOpus\u201d and the Rose Byrne psychological thriller \u201cIf I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You\u201d in theaters this year. Same with Focus Features' Carey Mulligan charmer \u201cThe Ballad of Wallis Island,\u201d which will be in theaters in March. And in general, movies that played in the premieres section will not be available online, whether or not they have distribution plans yet. That includes Bill Condon\u2019s \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman\u201d remake.",
      "Between Jan. 30 through Feb. 2.",
      "It\u2019s $35 for a single film and up to $800 for unlimited. Proceeds benefit the Sundance Institute\u2019s artist programs and funds.",

      "Chinese artificial intelligence startup company DeepSeek stunned markets and AI experts with its claim that it built its immensely popular chatbot at a fraction of the cost of those made by American tech titans.",
      "That immediately called into question the billions of dollars U.S. tech companies are spending on a massive expansion of energy-hungry data centers they say are needed to unlock the next wave of artificial intelligence.",
      "Could this new AI mean the world needs significantly less electricity for the technology than everyone thinks? The answer has profound implications for the overheating climate . AI uses vast amounts of energy, much of which comes from burning fossil fuels, which causes climate change. Tech companies have said their electricity use is going up, when it was supposed to be ramping down, ruining their carefully-laid plans to address climate change.",
      "\u201cThere has been a very gung ho, go ahead at all costs mentality in this space, pushing toward investment in fossil fuels,\u201d said Eric Gimon, senior fellow at Energy Innovation. \u201cThis is an opportunity to tap the brakes.\u201d",
      "Making AI more efficient could be less taxing on the environment, experts say, even if its huge electricity needs are not going away.",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s claims of building its impressive chatbot on a budget drew curiosity that helped make its AI assistant the No. 1 downloaded free app on Apple\u2019s iPhone this week, ahead of U.S.-made chatbots ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden we wake up Monday morning and we see a new player number one on the App Store, and all of a sudden it could be a potential gamechanger overnight,\" said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. \u201c It caused a bit of a panic. These were the hottest stocks in the world.\u201d",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s app competes well with other leading AI models. It can compose software code, solve math problems and address other questions that take multiple steps of planning. It's attracted attention for its ability to explain its reasoning in the process of answering questions.",
      "Leading analysts have been poring through the startup's public research papers about its new model, R1, and its precursors. Among the details that stood out was DeepSeek\u2019s assertion that the cost to train the flagship v3 model behind its AI assistant was only $5.6 million, a stunningly low number compared to the multiple billions of dollars spent to build ChatGPT and other well-known systems. DeepSeek hasn\u2019t responded to requests for comment.",
      "The $5.6 million number only included actually training the chatbot, not the costs of earlier-stage research and experiments, the paper said. DeepSeek was also working under some constraints: U.S. export controls on the most powerful AI chips. It said it relied on a relatively low-performing AI chip from California chipmaker Nvidia that the U.S. hasn\u2019t banned for sale in China.",
      "Data centers consumed about 4.4% of all U.S. electricity in 2023 and that's expected to increase to 6.7% to 12% of total U.S. electricity by 2028, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.",
      "It's been axiomatic that U.S. tech giants must spend much more on building out data centers and other infrastructure to train and run their AI systems. Meta Platforms, the parent of Facebook and Instagram, says it plans to spend up to $65 billion this year, including on a massive data center complex coming to Louisiana.",
      "Microsoft said it plans to spend $80 billion this year. And Trump last week joined the CEOs of OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank to announce a joint venture that hopes to invest up to $500 billion on data centers and the electricity generation needed for AI development, starting with a project already under construction in Texas.",
      "When there's an innovative technology that's useful to the general population and it's affordable, people will use it, said Vic Shao, founder of DC Grid, which delivers off-grid, direct current power to data centers and electric vehicle charging stations.",
      "That means data centers will still be built, though they may be able to operate more efficiently, said Travis Miller, an energy and utilities strategist at Morningstar Securities Research.",
      "\u201cWe think that the growth in electricity demand will end up at the lower end of most of the ranges out there,\u201d he said.",
      "If DeepSeek's claims hold true, some routine AI queries might not need a data center and could be shifted to phones, said Rahul Sandil, vice president and general manager for global marketing and communications at MediaTek, a semiconductor company. That would ease the computing need and give more time to scale up renewable energy sources for data centers.",
      "Bloom Energy is one of the AI-related stocks that took a hit Monday. KR Sridhar, founder and CEO, said it's imperative that the U.S. leads in AI because it can power data centers with clean energy, unlike other countries that still primarily rely on coal.",
      "\u201cWe can continue to make it better and we will continue to make it better,\u201d he said.",
      "Rick Villars, an analyst for market research group IDC, said the DeepSeek news could influence how AI researchers advance their models, but they\u2019ll still need plenty of data centers and electricity.",
      "\u201cWe think this actually could boost and accelerate the time frame for when AI becomes much more embedded into our lives, in the work sense, the living sense and in health care,\u201d Villars said. \u201cSo we still think the capacity is required.\u201d",

      "HONOLULU -- Former Hawaii lawmaker Suzanne Chun Oakland remembers arriving at school one morning in 1977 to an eerie buzz.",
      "The 15-year-old had met up with girlfriends as usual before class at Honolulu's McKinley High School when she learned a student named Dawn Momohara had been found dead on the second floor of a school building.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how we got word of it, but everything spread really quickly,\u201d Chun Oakland said.",
      "Chun Oakland didn't know Momohara, who was 16, but the unsolved death has haunted her and other McKinley students and staff for nearly half a century. That was until last week, when police used advances in DNA technology to arrest a 66-year-old resident of a Utah nursing home.",
      "The suspect, former McKinley student Gideon Castro, was scheduled to make an initial court appearance Friday before a judge in Salt Lake County District Court. He remained in custody Thursday with the bond for his release set at $250,000, according to Salt Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Office records.",
      "Castro\u2019s attorney, Marlene Mohn, did not respond to email and phone messages seeking comment.",
      "Momohara had been sexually assaulted and strangled, police said.",
      "\u201cI was just really sad,\" Chun Oakland recalled earlier this week. \"I think for our student body, of course there\u2019s that concern that what if he\u2019s still out there and he does it to somebody else.\u201d",
      "On March 21, 1977, shortly after 7:30 a.m., Honolulu police found Momohara lying on her back, partially clothed, an orange cloth wrapped tightly around her neck.",
      "Details from more than four decades ago are fuzzy for 1967 McKinley graduate Grant Okamura, who was the school\u2019s 28-year-old band teacher in 1977, but the morning Momohara was found has remained a core memory.",
      "Momohara's sister \u2014 one of his flute players \u2014 arrived at school that day not knowing her sister had been found dead, he recalled. The sister was called to the office and later walked into the band room, devastated.",
      "\u201cThe other students were trying to console her,\" Okamura said. \"At that point, I couldn't have band. How do you have a class? She just sat there crying.\u201d",
      "She didn't return to school for weeks afterward.",
      "He doesn't remember the sister's name. The Associated Press was unable to make contact with any possible relatives. Okamura said he met Momohara a few times when he let her into the air-conditioned band room to wait for her sister.",
      "The morning before Momohara was killed, she got a call from an unknown male and told her mother she was going to a nearby shopping center with friends. That was the last time her mother saw her, homicide Lt. Deena Thoemmes said.",
      "Police released sketches of a person of interest and a possible vehicle described by witnesses as a 1974 or 1975 Pontiac Lemans. A witness reported seeing the car when he and his girlfriend drove through campus the night before Momohara died. The witness saw a man and the car on the grass near the school's English building, Thoemmes said.",
      "The witness circled back around but the car and the man were gone.",
      "Police were unable to identify a suspect and the case grew cold, though grief lingered over the campus.",
      "In 2019, cold case detectives asked a forensic biology unit to examine several items of evidence from the scene, including Momohara's underwear. They were able to develop a DNA profile in 2020. Then, in 2023, police received information about potential suspects, two brothers who were interviewed in 1977.",
      "Several days after Momohara was killed, detectives interviewed Castro, who graduated from McKinley High in 1976. He said he met Momohara at a school dance that year and last saw her at a carnival on campus in February 1977. Police interviewed his brother, who also met Momohara at the dance.",
      "In November 2023, Honolulu police went to Chicago, where the brother was living. They \u201csurreptitiously\u201d obtained DNA from one of the brother's adult children, Thoemmes said.",
      "Lab findings excluded the brother as a suspect, but a DNA sample from Castro's adult son, and later from Castro himself, proved he was responsible, Thoemmes said.",
      "He was arrested last week at the nursing home where he lived in Millcreek, just south of Salt Lake City, on suspicion of second-degree murder.",
      "Neither Okamura nor Chun Oakland remembered Castro.",
      "Chun Oakland graduated in 1979 and grew up to become a Democratic member of the Hawaii Senate. She said Momohara's killing bothered her over the years, especially when she would meet victims through her work as a lawmaker or as a board member of the nonprofit Sex Abuse Treatment Center, a statewide program provding services for sexual assault survivors.",
      "Chun Oakland said she is grateful an arrest was possible even after all these years.",
      "\u201cI think the community in general, and our elected officials, they know the importance of trying to preserve the evidence that can someday be able to see justice for that individual or individuals,\" she said.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Gov. Josh Shapiro said Thursday that he wants to fast-track the construction of big power plants in Pennsylvania and offer hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks for projects that provide electricity to the grid and use hydrogen.",
      "Shapiro's announcement comes a few days before he delivers his third budget proposal to lawmakers amid an energy crunch that threatens to raise electricity bills across Pennsylvania, the nation's second-biggest natural gas-producing state.",
      "Shapiro, a Democrat, said he wants to start the \u201cnext chapter in Pennsylvania\u2019s long story of energy leadership\u201d and keep pace with other states that are attracting big projects, such as data centers and electric vehicle factories.",
      "\"Pennsylvania, it\u2019s time for us to be more competitive. It\u2019s time for us to act. We need to take some big and decisive steps right now, build new sources of power so Pennsylvania doesn't miss out,\u201d Shapiro said at a news conference at Pittsburgh International Airport.",
      "Shapiro said Pennsylvania is one of just 12 states that doesn't have an entity to fast-track siting decisions for energy projects. He wants to change that by creating the Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Siting and Electric Transition Board to streamline permitting and support for new energy projects.",
      "\"We need shovels in the ground now, not in the years to come,\" Shapiro said.",
      "The tax credits Shapiro is proposing are aimed at large projects producing electricity, using hydrogen and making hydrogen-based aviation fuel.",
      "A new power plant could qualify for up to $100 million per year for three years based on the amount of power the facility can produce, under Shapiro's plan.",
      "The Shapiro administration said it would leave it to lawmakers to hammer out what sort of power plants would qualify for a tax credit, although they said it wouldn't include the proposed restart of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to feed data centers run by tech giant Microsoft.",
      "At the federal level, former President Joe Biden's administration enacted rules last year as a centerpiece of his efforts to fight climate change by requiring coal and newer, higher-usage gas plants to slash their carbon dioxide emissions by 90% to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gases from a major source.",
      "For the other tax credits, a user of hydrogen fuel could qualify for up to $49 million a year and an aviation fuel producer could qualify for up to $15 million a year, under Shapiro's plan. The hydrogen-related tax credits are an attempt to create demand for the two federally subsidized hydrogen-making projects in which Pennsylvania or some of its businesses and institutions play a role, another part of Biden\u2019s agenda to slow climate change.",
      "The plans would require approval from lawmakers. Republican lawmakers have been critical of Shapiro\u2019s energy policy, saying it is a major hurdle for Pennsylvania to attract companies that want to build big new natural gas-fired power plants and stabilize the power grid.",
      "Shapiro's plans elicited applause from renewable energy advocates, while business groups echoed Republican criticism, but said they were encouraged by Shapiro's focus on energy.",
      "Shapiro's plan unveiled last year to make power plant owners in the nation\u2019s third-biggest energy-producing state pay for their greenhouse gas emissions and require utilities to buy more electricity from renewable sources gained no traction in the Legislature.",
      "One project Shapiro said he wants to help is a proposal by natural gas producer CNX Resources to build a $1.5 billion facility at Pittsburgh\u2019s airport to make hydrogen-based fuels.",
      "CNX has said it would only go through with it if the federal government allows coal mine methane to qualify for tax credits that were central to Biden's plan to fight climate change.",
      "The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for energy-hungry data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems.",
      "That\u2019s spurred proposals to bring nuclear power plants out of retirement, develop small modular nuclear reactors and build utility-scale renewable installations or new natural gas plants.",
      "However, the growth in energy demand comes at a time when the power supply is already strained by efforts to shift away from planet-warming fossil fuels and the closure of aging nuclear power plants.",
      "In recent months, governors including Shapiro and state ratepayer advocates have pressured the operator of the mid-Atlantic electricity grid to reduce the amount of money it offers to power plant owners, warning that it will unjustifiably raise electricity bills across the region.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 08:42:26 -0500",
    "summary": "A new report says advanced artificial intelligence systems have the potential to create extreme new risks, such as fueling widespread job losses, enabling terrorism or running amok",
    "story": [
      "A new report says advanced artificial intelligence systems have the potential to create extreme new risks, such as fueling widespread job losses, enabling terrorism or running amok",
      "LONDON -- Advanced artificial intelligence systems have the potential to create extreme new risks, such as fueling widespread job losses, enabling terrorism or running amok, experts said in a first-of-its-kind international report Wednesday cataloging the range of dangers posed by the technology.",
      "The International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI is being released ahead of a major AI summit in Paris next month. The paper is backed by 30 countries including the U.S. and China, marking rare cooperation between the two countries as they battle over AI supremacy, highlighted by Chinese startup DeepSeek stunning the world this week with its budget chatbot in spite of U.S. export controls on advanced chips to the country.",
      "The report by a group of independent experts is a \u201csynthesis\u201d of existing research intended to help guide officials working on drawing up guardrails for the rapidly advancing technology, Yoshua Bengio, a prominent AI scientist who led the study, told the Associated Press in an interview.",
      "\u201cThe stakes are high,\u201d the report says, noting that while a few years ago the best AI systems could barely spit out a coherent paragraph, now they can write computer programs, generate realistic images and hold extended conversations.",
      "While some AI harms are already widely known, such as deepfakes, scams and biased results, the report said that \u201cas general-purpose AI becomes more capable, evidence of additional risks is gradually emerging\u201d and risk management techniques are only in their early stages.",
      "It comes amid warnings this week about artificial intelligence from the Vatican and the group behind the Doomsday Clock.",
      "The report focuses on general purpose AI, typified by chatbots such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT used to carry out many different kinds of tasks. The risks fall into three categories: malicious use, malfunctions and widespread \u201csystemic\u201d risks.",
      "Bengio, who with two other AI pioneers won computer science\u2019s top prize in 2019, said the 100 experts who came together on the report don\u2019t all agree on what to expect from AI in the future. Among the biggest disagreements within the AI research community is the timing of when the fast-developing technology will surpass human capabilities across a variety of tasks and what that will mean.",
      "\u201cThey disagree also about the scenarios,\u201d Bengio said. \u201cOf course, nobody has a crystal ball. Some scenarios are very beneficial. Some are terrifying. I think it\u2019s really important for policymakers and the public to take stock of that uncertainty.\u201d",
      "Researchers delved into the details surrounding possible dangers. AI makes it easier, for example, to learn how to create biological or chemical weapons because AI models can provide step by step plans. But it\u2019s \u201cunclear how well they capture the practical challenges\u201d of weaponizing and delivering the agents, it said.",
      "General purpose AI is also likely to transform a range of jobs and \u201cdisplace workers,\u201d the report says, noting that some researchers believe it could create more jobs than it takes away, while others think it will drive down wages or employment rates, though there\u2019s plenty of uncertainty over how it will play out.",
      "AI systems could also run out of control, either because they actively undermine human oversight or humans pay less attention, the report said.",
      "However, a raft of factors make it hard to manage the risks, including AI developers knowing little about how their models work, the authors said.",
      "The paper was commissioned at an inaugural global summit on AI safety hosted by Britain in November 2023, where nations agreed to work together to contain potentially \u201ccatastrophic risks.\u201d At a follow-up meeting hosted by South Korea last year, AI companies pledged to develop AI safety while world leaders backed setting up a network of public AI safety institutes.",
      "The report, also backed by the United Nations and the European Union, is meant to weather changes in governments, such as the recent presidential transition in the U.S., leaving it up to each country to choose how it responds to AI risks. President Donald Trump rescinded former President Joe Biden\u2019s AI safety policies on his first day in office, and has since directed his new administration to craft its own approach. But Trump hasn\u2019t made any move to disband the AI Safety Institute that Biden formed last year, part of a growing international network of such centers.",
      "World leaders, tech bosses and civil society are expected to convene again at the Paris AI Action Summit on Feb 10-11. French officials have said countries will sign a \u201ccommon declaration\u201d on AI development, and agree to a pledge on sustainable development of the technology.",
      "Bengio said the report's aim was not to \"propose a particular way to evaluate systems or anything.\" The authors stayed away from prioritizing particular risks or making specific policy recommendations. Instead they laid out what the scientific literature on AI says \u201cin a way that\u2019s digestible by policymakers.\"",
      "\u201cWe need to better understand the systems we\u2019re building and the risks that come with them so that we can we can take these better decisions in the future,\u201d he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Two-thirds of animal and plant populations are declining in genetic diversity, which makes it harder to adapt to environmental changes, according to research published Wednesday.",
      "Long before a species goes extinct, the population becomes smaller and more fragmented, shrinking the number of potential mates and therefore genetic mixing. This leaves a species more vulnerable to future threats such as disease.",
      "\u201cA surprisingly trend was that we saw genetic diversity declining even among\" many species that aren't considered at risk, said co-author Catherine Grueber, a conservation biologist at the University of Sydney.",
      "Researchers examined data for 628 species studied between 1985 and 2019. The greatest losses in genetic variation were seen in birds and mammals.",

    "story": [
      "A new study finds that rat infestation in many of the world\u2019s cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- Rat infestation in many world cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington, and a new study blames climate change, urbanization and other human actions.",
      "A first-of-its-kind examination of trends and reasons in hard-to-count rat populations uses rat sighting reports in 16 cities around the world. In 11 of those cities, rat complaints have increased, according to a study in Friday's journal Science Advances.",
      "Based on individual trends within cities, Washington was by far the leader in rat increases, followed by San Francisco, Toronto, New York City and Amsterdam. Washington's rising rat reporting trend was three times greater than Boston's and 50% more than New York's, the study said. Washington city officials did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Only three cities saw significant decreasing trends \u2014 New Orleans, Louisville and Tokyo \u2014 with the home of Mardi Gras showing the biggest drop in rat reporting. Experts said the Louisiana city can teach others how to combat the rat problem.",
      "Researchers did a statistical analysis of the rising rat reporting in those cities and concluded that slightly more than 40% of the trend seen is due to warming temperatures from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. And that comes down to sex and food, said study lead author Jonathan Richardson, a biologist at the University of Richmond.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing these increasing trends in rats in cities that are warming the fastest, probably because this is a small mammal that has physiological challenges in the cold weather months,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cIf we're warming the climate and winter starts a week or two later and spring arrives a week or two earlier, that's one, two, maybe even three or four weeks across the entire year where those rats can be above ground foraging, acquiring more food and maybe squeezing out one or two more reproductive cycles. \u201d",
      "An extra month may not sound like much, but female rats can have a litter every month. Each litter is eight to 16 baby rats, Richardson said: \u201cThat is a recipe for accelerated population growth.\u201d",
      "Researchers pointed to two other big statistical links \u2014 that fit with known biological issues \u2014 behind more rat reports: the increase in urbanization and more densely populated cities.",
      "Rats like the built-up environment and being near people and their waste, the study and outside scientists said. They essentially eat at the same table as humans, multiple experts said.",
      "\u201cThe rat is the third most successful mammal behind humans and house mice. So it evolved and engineered to live alongside us,\u201d New York City rat czar Kathleen Corradi said during a break at a New Orleans conference on improving pest management. \u201cThey followed humans, Homo sapiens, across the continents and are in every single continent except Antarctica. So it's considered a wicked problem.\u201d",
      "Even though rats are intelligent and highly adaptive, Richardson and other experts said they are a serious problem for people.",
      "\u201cWhen rodent populations are high, people get sick, motor vehicles become disabled, mental health declines, fires are started and foods fouled,\u201d said Houston rat expert Michael Parsons, who wasn't part of the study. People are rightly bothered by rats because of \u201can innate fear caused by an organism that can make us sick.\u201d",
      "Researchers have not had good figures on rats. Because of the way they live and hide, they are not as easily counted as other critters, so this is one of the first attempts to quantify them. The study is not really a count of rats, but of complaints by people.",
      "Because the statistics go back years and only cities that haven't changed their reporting methods were looked at, Richardson said the trends they spotted have scientific merit. Even though Washington has the highest increasing trend that doesn't mean it has more rats or even rat sightings, it is just that the numbers within the city are increasing fastest, he said.",
      "Several outside experts said the study is legitimate, sensible and was sorely needed.",
      "\u201cThis paper is by far the largest data-driven effort to understand changes in urban rat populations ever attempted,\u201d said Drexel University ecology professor Jason Munshi-South, who wasn't part of the research.",
      "Looking at the few cities where rat reports are down may help in the fight against rats, Richardson and Corradi said. The answer is not more poison or traps, but prevention, the study said.",
      "\u201cIn New Orleans they make a big effort to get out into neighborhoods and do educational workshops and campaigns to talk to residents about what makes a property less likely to have rats,\u201d Richardson said.",
      "New York City's recently stepped up rat-fighting, which includes replacing garbage in bags on the street with rat-resistant containers, hasn't quite shown up in Richardson's data yet, but rat czar Corradi said early results are encouraging. The city has signed people up for what it calls an elite squad of rat fighters, named \" NYC rat pack.\u201d",
      "It's an uphill battle.",
      "\u201cAs our cities warm, urbanize and (increase in) density, we create more resources for rats which could result in further increases in numbers,\u201d Simon Fraser University health and rat scientist Kaylee Byers said in an email.",
      "We can fight them better, but in the end people \u201cneed to coexist with wildlife in urban environments, even with rats,\u201d University of Michigan conservation scientist Neil Carter said.",
      "\u201cZero rats is impossible,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cBut I think an expectation that we need to live with the number of rats that we're seeing in many of these cities is also an unhealthy perspective on this problem.\u201d",

We\u2019ve got teams that have been working this since the beginning and we\u2019re committed to making this happen,\" Pera said.",
      "He added that preparation for the salvage operation began on Friday, with divers equipped with multiple cameras surveying the submerged wreckage, focusing on large pieces of wreckage to remove from the river first. He said that during the survey on Saturday, remains were also recovered from the water.",
      "\"I just want to make sure that everyone is crystal clear in understanding that all salvage operations will be completed in close coordination with the Unified Command, all of our partners just really to ensure strict adherence to our central priority that the dignified recovery of missing flight passengers and personnel takes precedence,\" Pera said at a news conference on Sunday.",
      "Crews working with multiple agencies, including the Navy and 200 members of the U.S. Coast Guard, conducted rehearsals on the best way to remove the wreckage while simultaneously preparing for the discovery of more victims, according to Pera.",
      "\"We've got a wide debris field. Within that wide debris field, we're employing different techniques to make sure we understand what's in the water,\" Pera said.",
      "Family members of the crash victims were driven to the banks of the Potomac River on Sunday to pay respects to their lost loved ones. Among those killed in the crash were a civil rights attorney, a biology professor, several champion figure skaters and many others.",
      "\u201cThese people have suffered a terrible loss and they\u2019re grieving and I think that that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019d expect,\" said Fire Chief John Donnelly of the Washington, D.C., Fire Department, who has visited with the families. \"There\u2019s a whole range of emotions in that. I would say they are a strong group of families that are focused on getting their loved ones back, and I think that\u2019s the appropriate place to be at this point.\u201d",
      "If pieces of wreckage removed from the water contain remains, those pieces will be moved close to a barge and a tent will be erected so \"we have full discretion and then we will bring in proper personnel to deal with at the time,\" Pera explained.",
      "Donnelly said that local teams will continue to search the shoreline and around the river to make sure that all the debris is collected.",
      "\"And if by chance as a member of the public you come across some of that, you should call 911 and report it to them and we will get it taken care of and get it examined,\" Donnelly said.",
      "Donnelly called the salvage and recovery mission a \"tough operation\" for those doing the work. He said each agency supporting the mission has peer counselors to help divers and others working to clear the river to cope with the grim task.",
      "\"For our first responders, all of the people that are coming in here to support, this is a tough operation -- and if you are a responder listening to this, we want you to know that you can have a lot of different feelings about this, and there are people out here to help you,\" Donnelly said.",

      "At a press briefing Monday, officials said there were no credible threats to the game, or its many surrounding events.",
      "\"Right now we have no specific credible threats to this event ... which I think should give us all a sense of security,\" Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told reporters in New Orleans on Monday. \"We recognize the importance of making sure that we're doing due diligence and being prepared for events as proactive as possible, and pre-deploying resources and partnerships that will help us make sure that these events come off safely and with a focus on security.\"",
      "She added, \"We have partners that we are dedicated to working with to make sure we get through these types of events in a way that has been important to focus on the priorities.\"",
      "NFL Chief of Security Cathy Lanier said in the days after the terrorist attack, the NFL changed their security plan.",
      "\"We have reviewed and re-reviewed all the details of what happened on Jan. 1,\" Lainer said. \"We have reviewed and re-reviewed each of our roles within the overarching security plan, and we have reassessed and stressed tested -- our timing, our communication protocols, our contingency measures and our emergency response plans multiple times over, over the past several weeks.\"",
      "There will be over 2,700 state, federal and local law enforcement members securing the game, according to officials.",
      "Lainer said the event is a \"no-drone zone\" meaning drones are not allowed anywhere near the stadium. A drone that was not cleared to fly over M&T Bank Stadium briefly halted the Steelers-Ravens wild card game last month.",
      "Noem was on Bourbon Street on Monday at the site of the terrorist attack. Bollards that were not in place during the New Year's celebrations, due to repair, are now back in place.",
      "\"We have an opportunity to learn from what happened,\" Noem told reporters earlier in the day, she said she also wanted to honor the victims lost. \"The Super Bowl is the biggest Homeland Security event we do every single year.\"",

      "DeLaune is a Louisiana native and securing the game is personal for him, he said.",
      "\"I have worked to coordinate the security of the land, air and local waterways, with the vital support of our partners, leveraging a united front of all of those law enforcement entitles,\" he said. \"In the days ahead, there will be a significant increased law enforcement presence in New Orleans, some of which will be visible and obvious.\"",

      "The Democrats called the actions against USAID \u201cillegal\u201d and a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d while vowing to take their defense of the agency to the courts.",
      "\u201cWhat Trump and Musk have done is not only wrong, it's illegal,\" said Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia during a news conference outside USAID headquarters. \"USAID was established by an act of Congress, and it can only be disbanded by an act of Congress. Stopping this will require action by the courts and for Republicans to show up and show courage and stand up for our country.\u201d",

      "\u201cSenator Schatz and I have talked, we\u2019re all in this together,\u201d he said.",

      "The Democratic lawmakers argued on Monday that USAID's work is crucial for counterterrorism, disease prevention and providing humanitarian aid globally.",
      "\u201cWe're here today, not only to fight for federal employees who dedicate themselves every day to a humanitarian task. We are here to save lives, because that is what USAID does,\" said Connolly, the ranking Democrat on the Oversight Committee. \"You name it, USAID is there in the fight against HIV, in the fight to protect the Uyghur population in China, in the fight to protect refugees, in the fight to make sure that there's food security everywhere \u2026 It is the lead development agency in the world, and no one elected Elon Musk to dismantle it.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are going to fight in every way we can in the courts, in public opinion, with the bully pulpit, in the halls of Congress, and here at USAID itself. We are not going to let this injustice happen,\u201d Connolly added.",

      "\u201cMake no mistake, this effort by Elon Musk and so-called DOGE to shut down the Agency for International Development is an absolute gift to our adversaries, to Russia, to China, to Iran and others, because USAID is an essential instrument of U.S. foreign policy and U.S. national security policy. So this has nothing to do with making the U.S. government more efficient, and everything to do with aiding and abetting our adversaries around the world,\u201d Van Hollen said.",

      "\"Q: Does the deferred resignation program comply with all records and privacy laws?\" the question asks.",
      "\"A: Yes,\" the email says. \"The deferred resignation program uses only basic contact information about federal employees, like name and government email address, along with short, voluntary email responses. That information is stored on secure government systems. To the extent the Privacy Act applies, all information relevant to the program is covered by existing OPM System of Records Notices.\"",
      "The email says that employees eligible for Voluntary Early Retirement (VERA) can combine that with their deferred resignation, provided they qualify.",

They are not required to do work-related tasks during this time, nor are they required to come into the office. Employees who were placed on leave also had their government email access suspended as they received the letters. There's no set time for the leave period, according to the letter.",
      "The letters have caused a frenzy throughout the department, as some employees had been locked out of their accounts and had to check their private email addresses for the notice, according to Sheria Smith, president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) Local 252.",
      "Smith told ABC News more than 50 employees in \"extremely diverse roles\" within the department received the email notices to their government email addresses or their private email accounts after regular business hours over the weekend.",
      "ABC News spoke with three Department of Education employees who received the letters and described their leave as \"paid administrative hell\" since Friday evening.",
      "\"It's very, very, unsettling,\" one department employee of over 20 years, who works in Washington, D.C., told ABC News. \"I don't get it. What's my crime? What have I done?\"",
      "Smith said the positions of Department of Education employees placed on leave run the gamut, from senior civil rights attorneys to attorneys for borrower defense to press specialists. She said she feared more letters would be sent in the coming days.",
      "An attorney who works for the department in Washington, D.C., said they were put on leave from their \"dream job.\" The employee has two children and received the notice after putting them to bed on Friday night, they said. The person said Friday was tough and the news was shocking to receive, but now they're feeling \"different levels\" of sadness.",
      "\"My mood felt a little bit different just waking up knowing that I wasn't going to be working,\" the employee told ABC News.",
      "\"But I just feel like there's a lot of information that I'm trying to process and, with small kids, it's like you're trying to balance a lot,\" the employee added.",
      "The letters came as the Trump administration worked to scrub the federal government's DEI policies and programs. The president issued an executive order during his first week in office calling on agencies to \"combat\" private-sector DEI programs.",
      "Trump's rhetoric -- including threatening for months to shutter the Department of Education -- has created fear throughout the department, according to Smith.",
      "\"People took these jobs because they care about the mission,\" Smith told ABC News. \"And so it absolutely impacts us. You know, the very thing that brought us to these jobs we're unable to do.\"",
      "The department employee with two small children has worked for the department for just over four years and comes from a family of educators. The employee said education is the \"great equalizer,\" and the Department of Education benefits everyone.",
      "\"I believe in the department,\" the department attorney said, adding: \"I always wanted to work here.\"",
      "In a statement to ABC News, Department of Education Deputy Assistant Secretary for Communications Madi Biedermann said the president was elected to enact \"unprecedented reform\" that is merit-based and efficient at serving the interests of the American people.",
      "\"We are evaluating staffing in line with the commitment to prioritizing meaningful learning ahead of divisive ideology in schools and putting student outcomes above special interests,\" Biedermann wrote.",
      "ABC News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "Meanwhile, the three department employees who spoke to ABC News said they're completely stumped on why they were issued administrative leave notices. The department employee with decades of experience in Washington also said it's puzzling, in part, because during Trump's first term, managers were evaluated on upholding DEI standards via a department performance rating system.",
      "\"We were expected to do DEI,\" the employee said. \"That's what Trump and [then-Education Secretary] Betsy DeVos wanted us to do. They wanted to do that. They put it in our [performance] plans. We did not put that in our plans. And not only that, it is in every manager's plan in the department, not just people that are on administrative leave.\"",
      "\"Every single person in the Department of Education that's a supervisor or a manager right now has [DEI] in their performance plan -- that is programmed in by the department,\" the employee added.",
      "The administrative leave notices may have been tied to a two-day \"Diversity Change-Agent Training Program,\" a facilitator-led training, according to training document slides obtained by ABC News. The training took place over two days dating as far back as March 2019, under DeVos and during Trump's first term, according to a February 2019 email obtained by ABC News with the subject \"Diversity Change Agent Course.\"",
      "The training program aimed to create specific action plans to \"drive diversity and inclusion\" and increase creativity and innovation. The program also challenged employees to achieve greater results by championing the diversity of its workforce while creating and sustaining an inclusive environment, according to the training document slides.",
      "Another department employee, who took the 2019 training and works remotely out of the New York offices, called the notice \"bizarre,\" especially since the 2019 training occurred during the president's first term.",
      "\"The whole thing is bizarre,\" the department employee told ABC News. \"Betsy DeVos -- and [Trump's] prior administration -- was a decent champion of these programs, and they didn't come with any warning to me to say, 'Hey, taking this training might lead to an adverse personnel action one day,' right? So it's just strange how they can retroactively apply something.\"",
      "The department employees on leave who spoke to ABC News said they have no official DEI responsibilities in their roles. All three department employees who spoke with ABC News also confirmed the only DEI-like program that would potentially be barred under Trump's executive order would be the change-agent training sessions.",
      "However, to their knowledge, the three employees on leave said there's no official list or way of matching the employees on administrative leave with the training programs. Even though they're convinced these trainings link them to the Trump administration's definition of DEI, the employees haven't confirmed why they're on leave, according to the ones who spoke to ABC News.",
      "The employee who works out of New York has more than a dozen years of experience in administering federal programs. Multiple other employees on administrative leave that this employee spoke to over the weekend said they also took the 2019 training, according to the employee.",
      "\"That's the only thing we can think of that any of us did,\" the employee said.",
      "After reaching out to other colleagues with the same titles, the employee in New York said, they \"pieced it together.\" This employee said they took at least three training programs like the diversity change-agent training program since the initial training.",

      "White House officials announced Saturday that Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada and 10% tariffs on goods from China. Trump had long threatened tariffs against Canada and Mexico to ensure their cooperation to stop illegal immigration and the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "The tariffs are expected to be implemented on Tuesday but Hillman said her government is continuing to discuss the situation with the Trump administration.",
      "\"We're hopeful that they don't come into effect on Tuesday,\" she said. \"We're ready to continue to talk to the Trump administration about that, and in particular about all the work that we're doing with them and on our own, with respect to the border.\"",
      "Hillman said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Trump discussed Canada's plan to meet some of his demands, although not recently, and discussions between the two governments are continuing.",
      "\"Not in recent days, but they have discussed it, and we've discussed it with senior members of the White House as well, and we've laid out our plan, and my understanding is that the plan and some of the actual outcomes, results of what we have done, have been presented to the president,\" she said.",
      "Trudeau responded to the tariffs on Saturday evening, announcing his country will implement 25% tariffs on $155 billion Canadian dollars (about $107 billion U.S. dollars) of U.S. goods. The prime minister said he has not talked to Trump since his inauguration.",
      "Hillman said the proposed tariff's are \"disrupting an incredibly successful trading relationship.\"",
      "\"The Canadian people are going to expect that our government stands firm and stands up for itself,\" she said. \"I don't think we're not at all interested in escalating, but I think that there will be a very strong demand on our government to make sure that we stand up for the deal that we have struck with the with the United States.\"",
      "\"They just don\u2019t understand where this is coming from, and probably there's a little bit of hurt,\" she added.",
      "The U.S. and Canada have always had a \"sense of common purpose,\" Hillman said, and Trump's actions constitute a significant heel turn.",
      "\"This is not something that Canada wants to do,\" she said. \"This is not a path that we are interested in going down. We are actually interested in being and continuing to be your best customer.\"",

      "Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party Chairman Ken Martin has been elected chairman of the Democratic National Committee.",
      "Martin secured 246.5 votes of the total 428 members who voted in person and by proxy, and DNC members cheered after he was announced as the winner, chanting, \"Yes, we Ken!\"",
      "\"Ken Martin is now the Chair of the Democratic Party,\" outgoing DNC Chairman Jamie Harrison said upon reading the vote count.",
      "Runner-up Ben Wikler, chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, received 134.5 votes, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley received 44 votes and four people abstained.",
      "Faiz Shakir received two votes, Jason Paul received one vote and there were no votes for Nate Snyder, Quintessa Hathaway or Marianne Williamson.",
      "\"We have one team: the Democratic Party. We have one fight. \u2026 The fight is for our values. The fight is for working people. The fight right now is against Donald Trump and the billionaires who bought this country,\" Martin said in his victory speech.",
      "In a meeting with reporters immediately after his win, Martin told ABC News his first three priorities are setting up a rapid response \"war room\" to message against Trump and define the party's agenda, beginning the process of reviewing the party's strategy that led to its losses in the White House and Congress and conducting a review of the party's finances.",
      "Martin said his posture will be aggressive against Trump and leading Republicans in Washington, claiming he'd \"take the low road so my candidates and elected officials can take the high road.\"",
      "\"Meaning, I'm going to throw a punch,\" Martin said. \"So Donald Trump, Republican Party -- this is a new DNC. We are not going to sit back and not take you on when you fail the American people.\"",
      "After the tally was announced, Democratic governors, some of the highest profile of whom endorsed Wikler in the race, offered Martin congratulations.",
      "\"I can't wait to work together to unite the Democratic Party, fight for working families, and win,\" posted Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who supported Wikler.",
      "Martin also received praise from his home governor, Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee this cycle. Walz was an outlier among his fellow governors in backing Martin over Wikler.",
      "\"Congratulations, Ken!\" Walz posted on X.",
      "Several party heavyweights endorsed Wikler in the final days of the election, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. When asked what his victory means despite those leaders endorsing his challenger, Martin said he doesn't see their support for Wikler as \"personal\" and looks forward to working with those Democratic leaders.",
      "\"This is not personal. We're all on the same team. It's one team, one fight now, right? I have longstanding relationships in the party, and at the end of the day, I am buoyed by that enthusiastic support. It was a one-ballot victory for a reason,\" Martin said.",
      "Meanwhile, Martin earned last-minute backing from some of his fellow candidates for chair. In their final speeches on Saturday, author and spiritualist Marianne Williamson and Nate Snyder, a former Department of Homeland Security official, publicly endorsed Martin.",
      "\"In contribution to what I feel is our best chance to intervene, our best chance to cut the cord with the billionaire funded corruption that will otherwise obstruct and limit our possibilities, I heartily endorse Ken Martin,\" Williamson said during her address to the DNC.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 13:51:32 -0500",
    "summary": "Marco Rubio is set to embark on his first diplomatic mission abroad since being confirmed to his post, visiting five countries in Central and South America.",
    "story": [
      "The trip is Rubio's first as America's top diplomat.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to embark on his first diplomatic mission abroad since being confirmed to his post, visiting five countries in Central and South America over the first week of February.",
      "During the trip, Rubio is expected to reinforce the Trump administration's immigration priorities with leaders in the region, according to a senior official, who said the secretary is also planning to address Beijing's influence during several of the stops.",
      "The State Department is also billing Rubio's trip as historic -- saying his six-day journey to Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic marks the first time a U.S. secretary of state has opted to make his or her first official visit to Latin America in over 100 years.",
      "\"This is where we live\"",
      "In an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, Rubio said the trip is part of a realignment of American diplomatic priorities.",
      "\"For many reasons, U.S. foreign policy has long focused on other regions while overlooking our own. As a result, we've let problems fester, missed opportunities and neglected partners,\" he said. \"That ends now.\"",
      "State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said the region's proximity to the United States was an important factor in selecting it for Rubio's first trip.",
      "\"The fact of the matter is, this is where we live. This is who we are,\" she said. \"This is about not just wanting to have new partnerships -- but that's always good -- but the nature of what it means to have an extended relationship with the people closest to you.\"",
      "Those relationships are vital for fulfilling the Trump administration's border security and deportation plans, Rubio noted.",
      "\"Diplomacy's role in this effort is central. We need to work with countries of origin to halt and deter further migrant flows, and to accept the return of their citizens present in the U.S. illegally,\" he said.",
      "Cooperation and coercion",
      "However, the countries on his itinerary have largely been very cooperative with the administration so far, as other countries in the region Rubio will skip over remain hesitant to comply.",
      "Guatemala, for instance, has accepted hundreds of migrants brought to the country on military planes since Trump took office, and the country's leadership has signaled it is open to accepting deportees of other nationalities.",
      "Meanwhile, Mexico, which is traditionally the U.S.' most important partner in handling illegal immigration, has been much more tentative.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum originally said the country wouldn't accept migrants from other countries, but she quietly reversed course in late January when she revealed Mexico had accepted over 4,000 deportees and that while \"the large majority\" was Mexican, others were not.",
      "Mexico has also so far refused requests from the U.S. to allow military flights carrying deportees to land in the country, according to officials from both countries.",
      "Honduras has posed another challenge to the administration's agenda. According to data from Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the end of 2024, Hondurans made up the largest share of the population in the deportation pipeline. But ahead of Trump's inauguration, the president of Honduras threatened to expel members of the U.S. military stationed in the country in response to mass deportations of Honduran nationals.",
      "However, Honduran authorities have signaled the country's position may be softening. The country's foreign minister wrote on X that the government is in the process of launching a program to support returning migrants called \"Brother, Come Home.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also had some early success in overtly pressuring countries to acquiesce. His threatened trade war against Colombia prompted its government to allow military deportation flights to land on its territory.",
      "\"It sends a message that this administration, President Trump, Secretary Rubio -- they mean what they say,\" said Mauricio Claver-Carone, special envoy for Latin America.",
      "Claver-Carone also suggested the Trump administration would use gentler diplomatic tactics as well, saying that during Rubio's trip, he will attempt to lay the groundwork for a program to repatriate migrants travelling through Central America with the government of Costa Rica.",
      "He also addressed Richard Grenell's visit to Venezuela to meet with strongman Nicolas Maduro on Friday.",
      "\"President Trump expects Nicolas Maduro to take back all of the Venezuelan criminals and gang members that have been exported to United States and to do so unequivocally and without condition,\" he said, adding that Grenell, the envoy for special missions, will also urge Maduro to release American hostages held in the country.",
      "A \"direct threat\" from China",
      "Beyond immigration, Claver-Carone said Beijing's growing influence in Central America will also be top of mind for Rubio through much of the trip, but it is expected to take center stage during the secretary's first stop in Panama.",
      "Trump has lodged a litany of complaints related to Panama's operation of the canal that cuts through the country -- claiming that American vessels are overcharged, lamenting that the U.S. ceded control of the vital waterway in the first place and promising \"we're taking it back\" during his inaugural address.",
      "Rubio has taken a more measured approach in discussing the Panama Canal while also underscoring that what he says are Trump's legitimate concerns about the waterway -- especially when it comes to companies controlled by Beijing located on each end of it.",
      "\"If the government in China in a conflict tells them to shut down the Panama Canal, they will have to,\" Rubio said in an interview on Thursday. \"That is a direct threat.\"",
      "Rubio continued to say it is a dynamic that cannot be allowed to continue.",
      "\"It is not in the national interest of the United States to have a canal we paid for and we built used as a leverage and a weapon against us. That can't happen,\" he said.",
      "But ahead of Rubio's visit, Panama President Jose Raul Mulino said handing back control of the canal isn't a thought he can entertain.",
      "\"It's impossible,\" Mulino said during a press conference on Thursday. \"I cannot negotiate, and much less open, a process of negotiation over the canal. That's sealed. The canal belongs to Panama.\"",

      "International aid organizations are warning that humanitarian efforts in Gaza would be severely impacted if the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is shut down by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Musk said he was \"in the process\" of \"shutting down\" the agency -- which oversees foreign aid, disaster relief and international development programs -- and that President Donald Trump agreed with him.",
      "Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Monday that he had been appointed acting director of USAID, saying the agency is \"not functioning\" and that it needs to be aligned with U.S. national interests.",
      "Alex Smith, a former contractor for USAID who advised on nutrition, child health and maternal health, told ABC News that the dismantling of the agency could have a major impact on aid in Gaza.",
      "\"It's going to be devastating,\" said Smith, who left the agency last year. \"You know, countries are already trying to figure out how they're going to fill the gaps, but they just don't have the money, and finding new donors could take years.\"",
      "Smith noted that the Trump administration said previous federal funding freezes wouldn't affect emergency food programs, but that the USAID also provides humanitarian assistance on other fronts.",
      "\"There's a lot more than food aid that USAID does. That's a kind of common misconception -- that all we do is just drop off big bucks and food,\" he said. \"It's about fighting infectious disease, malaria, TB, HIV all over the world. You know, with the conditions in Gaza as they are, we've seen some polio. It's very likely that cholera is already there and it's going to get worse. So we used to have a lot of programs to try to combat those specific infectious diseases.\"",
      "Jesse Marks, senior advocate for the Middle East at the humanitarian organization Refugees International, told ABC News he's worried the stoppage of aid from USAID could put the Israel-Hamas ceasefire in jeopardy.",
      "\"An aid freeze in general, but particularly for Gaza, threatens to undermine what has already been a fragile ceasefire, and the potential for phase two and phase three release of hostages,\" Marks said.",
      "\"I think one of the facets of this that people are not necessarily connecting is that the humanitarian access to Gaza -- which is underpinned by USAID, State Department funds -- was a central feature of the bargain that underpins ceasefire,\" he continued. \"So, if you remove aid to Gaza, whether directly or as a second-order effect of the aid freeze, this raises the risk of a broader ceasefire collapse.\"",
      "USAID has been contributing aid to Gaza and the West Bank since at least 2021, with increased aid after the Israel-Hamas war broke out.",
      "In November 2024, USAID announced it was providing $230 million in additional funding \"to support economic recovery and development programs in the West Bank and Gaza.\" It has given more than $2.1 billion in humanitarian assistance since Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "The U.S. Office of Palestinian Affairs said funding from USAID would allow the agency's partners to provide food assistance, emergency health care and psychosocial services, and could help with providing access to clean drinking water, hygiene products and sanitation services.",
      "In a statement to ABC News last week, the nonprofit International Medical Corps (IMC) said it had received $68 million from USAID to set up and run two large field hospitals in Gaza so it could treat more than 33,000 civilians per month.",
      "The spokesperson also rejected claims from a U.S. State Department official that IMC had used funding from USAID to procure or distribute condoms.",
      "USAID was partly responsible for renewed international pressure on Israel to increase the flow of aid into Gaza.",
      "In April 2024, USAID Administrator Samantha Power testified before Congress, stating that parts of Gaza were experiencing a famine and that conditions were \"as dire as any I have seen in my career.\"",
      "Her assessment came after a March 2024 report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification that famine was \"imminent\" in northern Gaza and the entire population was experiencing high levels of food insecurity.",

      "According an email sent to the FBI workforce late Friday, and obtained by ABC News, the requested information is to be provided by Tuesday afternoon to the office of the acting Deputy Attorney General, Emil Bove, whose office will then conduct a review to determine if any \"personnel actions\" are warranted.",
      "\"We understand that this request encompasses thousands of employees across the country who have supported these investigative efforts,\" the email from acting FBI director Brian Driscoll said. \"I am one of those employees, as is [the] acting Deputy Director.\"",
      "It's unclear why Bove is interested in the Hamas-related case.",

      "Earlier Friday, several sources told ABC New that the Trump administration is compiling a list of agents and other FBI officials from around the country who they believe should be fired or forced to resign in the coming days, several sources told ABC News.",
      "Firings were expected to begin as early as Friday, but a list was expected to be finalized on Monday, sources said.",
      "The list of those who could be fired includes the heads of dozens of field offices across the country and could include scores of agents in the FBI's Washington, D.C., Field Office alone, sources said.",

      "The FBI Agents Association said the actions \"contradict the commitments\" Patel made to the association ahead of his Senate confirmation hearing, saying Patel said FBI agents \"would be afforded appropriate process and review and not face retribution based solely on the cases to which they were assigned.\"",
      "\"If true, these outrageous actions by acting officials are fundamentally at odds with the law enforcement objectives outlined by President Trump and his support for FBI Agents,\" the FBI Agents Association added in a statement. \"Dismissing potentially hundreds of Agents would severely weaken the Bureau's ability to protect the country from national security and criminal threats and will ultimately risk setting up the Bureau and its new leadership for failure.\"",
      "Separately, about 40 prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia who had previously worked on Jan. 6 cases were also dismissed Friday by acting U.S. Attorney Ed Martin, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to ABC News.",
      "The prosecutors who were dismissed had been hired to permanent career posts after serving in the office on a temporary detail, but they remained on probationary status -- which cleared the way for their firings under DOJ policy, the sources said.",
      "In the Oval Office later Friday, Trump was asked by reporters about Justice Department employees who may be fired or forced out in the coming days and he appeared to indicate it could be a \"good thing.\"",
      "\"If they fired some people over there, that's a good thing because they were very bad,\" Trump said. \"They used the Justice Department to correct their political opponents, which in itself is illegal.\"",
      "Asked if he specifically requested any action, Trump denied, \"No, but we have some very bad people over there. It was weaponized at a level that nobody's ever seen before.\"",

      "\"At a time when we are facing a multitude of threats to the homeland -- from terrorism and espionage to drug trafficking and Salt Typhoon -- it is deeply alarming that the Trump administration appears to be purging dozens of the most experienced agents who are our nation's first line of defense,\" he said.",

He pointed to the lack of a contract and the fact that Congress has not allocated funds for large-scale federal buyouts, and he worried people might offer to resign but not actually be paid in the end or may have their benefits stripped.",
      "\"Absolutely do not resign. There is nothing that says that the day that you resign, that they can't just let you go,\" he said. \"They don't have to pay you -- there's nothing that says they have to pay you till Sept. 30. This is nothing that has been done before. This is not in our regulations. There's no regs about it. We're not even sure if it's actually legal. So, yeah, absolutely do not resign.\"",
      "The buyout offers come as President Donald Trump has pushed for federal employees to return to working in person, signing an executive order on his first day in office calling for an end to teleworking.",
      "However, the email went to many workers across the country who never had telework agreements, including firefighters with the U.S. Forest Service and nurses at hospitals with the Department of Veterans Affairs, and many remain skeptical about the intention of the offer and ramifications for those who reply.",
      "Asked about the buyout offers in the Oval Office on Friday, Trump was blunt, saying, \"We'd love to have them leave.\"",
      "\"We're trying to reduce government,\" Trump added, noting that he didn't know how many people had taken the offer but that it would become clear on Feb. 6, when the offer expires.",
      "\"Nobody knows how that's going to turn out,\" Trump said. \"Everybody's replaceable, and we'll get very good people to replace them if it turns out to be more than we thought it could be.\"",

      "The U.S. transportation secretary has visited the site of a medical transportation plane crash in Philadelphia with city and state officials",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- The impact area where a medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia was notably \u201cexpansive,\u201d U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday after viewing the site with investigators and city officials.",
      "Duffy said he was struck by \u201chow expansive it was. And the issues that fire and police were dealing with. Again, this is a very populated area.\u201d",
      "The crash Friday evening killed all six people on the Learjet 55 air ambulance, including a girl who had been receiving medical treatment at Shriners Children\u2019s Philadelphia hospital. A seventh person inside a vehicle was killed on the ground.",
      "Mayor Cherelle Parker said two more people who were hurt on the ground have been identified, bringing the total to 24. Four people remained hospitalized Monday, two in critical condition.",
      "Parker said footage of the crash has made her \u201cthink about what could have been, had a gas line been hit.\u201d",
      "The air ambulance was taking Valentina Guzm\u00e1n Murillo and her mother, Lizeth Murillo Osuna, home to Mexico. It plummeted within a minute of taking off from Northeast Philadelphia Airport.",
      "Debris from the crash exploded into a fireball, and pieces of the plane were blown into the residential and commercial Castor Gardens neighborhood, severely damaging several businesses and at least 11 homes.",
      "\u201cIt was a very steep angle at which that aircraft came down,\u201d Duffy said.",
      "The aircraft\u2019s cockpit voice recorder, recovered about 8 feet (2.4 meters) beneath the ground's surface, was on its way to be examined in Washington, D.C., Duffy said. He said the plane did not have a data recorder, but investigators are hoping to retrieve flight data from the jet\u2019s ground proximity warning system.",
      "\u201cInformation can come off that device, whether it\u2019s the speed or location of the aircraft. We will be able to get some data, hopefully, off that device,\u201d he said.",
      "The Philadelphia crash occurred two days after the deadliest U.S. air disaster in a generation, when an American Airlines jet with 60 passengers and four crew members collided in midair in Washington, D.C., with an Army helicopter carrying three soldiers.",
      "The girl who died in the Philadelphia crash had recently completed treatment for a condition not easily treated in Mexico, hospital officials have said. Others killed in the plane were neonatologist Dr. Ra\u00fal Meza of the State of Mexico near Mexico City and copilot Josu\u00e9 Ju\u00e1rez of Veracruz.",
      "Audio recorded by LiveATC captured an air traffic controller at Northeast Philadelphia Airport telling \u201cMedevac Medservice 056\u201d to turn right when departing. About 30 seconds later, the controller repeats the request before asking, \u201cYou on frequency?\u201d Minutes later the controller says, \u201cWe have a lost aircraft. We\u2019re not exactly sure what happened, so we\u2019re trying to figure it out. For now the field is going to be closed.\u201d"

      "U.S. District Judge Algenon Marbley agreed Friday to end Tommy Thompson's sentence on the civil contempt charge, saying he \u201cno longer is convinced that further incarceration is likely to coerce compliance.\u201d However, he also ordered that the research scientist immediately start serving a two-year sentence he received for a related criminal contempt charge, a term that was delayed when the civil contempt term was imposed.",
      "Thompson has been held in contempt of court since Dec. 15, 2015, and also incurred a daily fine of $1,000. In his ruling, Marbley assessed Thompson\u2019s total civil contempt fine at $3,335,000.",
      "Thompson\u2019s case dates to his discovery of the S.S. Central America, known as the Ship of Gold, in 1988. The gold rush-era ship sank in a hurricane off South Carolina in 1857 with thousands of pounds of gold aboard, contributing to an economic panic.",
      "Despite an investor lawsuit and a federal court order, Thompson still won\u2019t cooperate with authorities trying to find 500 coins minted from some of the gold, according to court records. He has previously said, without providing details, that the coins \u2014 valued at about $2.5 million \u2014 were turned over to a trust in Belize.",
      "After Thompson failed to appear for a 2012 Ohio hearing to discuss the coins, U.S. marshals eventually tracked him to Florida in 2015 and arrested him. He pleaded guilty in April 2015 to skipping that hearing and was given the two-year prison sentence.",
      "Federal law generally limits jail time for contempt of court to 18 months. But a federal appeals court in 2019 rejected Thompson\u2019s argument that that law applies to him, saying his refusal violated conditions of a plea agreement."

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- In its first direct criticism of the Trump administration, North Korea lashed out at U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio for calling it a \u201crogue\u201d state and warned Monday that such \u201ccoarse and nonsensical remarks\u201d will never contribute to U.S. interests.",
      "The statement is the latest in a series of North Korean signals that it will maintain its tough stance on the U.S. for now, though Trump has said he\u2019s intent on reaching out to its leader Kim Jong Un to revive diplomacy.",
      "\u201cThe hostile words and deeds of the person who is in charge of the U.S. foreign policy served as an occasion of confirming once again the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK which remains unchanged,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said, using the acronym of the country's official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.",
      "\u201cRubio\u2019s coarse and nonsensical remarks only show directly the incorrect view of the new U.S. administration on the DPRK and will never help promote the U.S. interests as he wishes,\u201d it said.",
      "The statement took issue with what the ministry called Rubio\u2019s branding of North Korea as a \u201crogue\u201d state in a media interview. It likely referred to Rubio\u2019s appearance on \u201cThe Megyn Kelly Show\u201d on Jan. 30, in which he called North Korea and Iran \u201crogue states\u201d as he addressed foreign policy challenges.",
      "It was not the first time for U.S. officials to describe North Korea as a rogue state. But the North\u2019s latest statement suggests the country won\u2019t likely quickly embrace Trump\u2019s overture.",
      "During a Fox News interview broadcast on Jan. 23, Trump called Kim \u201ca smart guy\u201d and \u201cnot a religious zealot.\u201d Asked whether he will reach out to Kim again, Trump replied, \u201cI will, yeah.\u201d",
      "Trump's comments raised prospects for a possible revival of diplomacy between the United States and North Korea, as Trump met Kim three times during his first term to discuss how to end Kim's nuclear program. Their earlier high-stakes diplomacy in 2018-19 broke down due to disputes over U.S.-led sanctions on North Korea, but Trump has still repeatedly boasted of his personal ties with Kim.",
      "North Korea hasn\u2019t directly responded to Trump\u2019s interview comments. But it has maintained its confrontational rhetoric against the U.S. and continued its weapons testing activities. Last week, Kim visited a facility to produce nuclear materials and called for boosting North Korea\u2019s nuclear capability in the face of what he called challenges posed by \u201chostile forces,\u201d an apparent reference to the U.S. and South Korea.",
      "Many experts say Kim likely thinks he now has greater leverage than before because of his expanded nuclear arsenal and deepening military ties with Russia.",
      "The previous diplomacy with Trump likely gave Kim a propaganda coup for winning the much-needed recognition of his government on the world stage. But the eventual collapse of diplomacy was still a huge embarrassment.",
      "Kim has since then focused on perfecting nuclear-capable missiles targeting the U.S. and South Korea.",
      "Last November, Kim said that his past negotiations with the United States only confirmed Washington\u2019s \u201cunchangeable\u201d hostility toward his country and described his nuclear buildup as the only way to counter external threats. During a key political meeting in December, Kim vowed to implement the \u201ctoughest\u201d anti-U.S. policy.",

      "The U.S. Justice Department has ordered a halt to programs that provide information and guidance to people in immigration proceedings",
      "Just days after President Donald Trump's second inauguration, Ruby Robinson went to Detroit's immigration court to post a notice that a help desk his organization ran for people facing deportation was no longer available.",
      "The desk staffed by the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center shut down after a Trump executive order prompted the Justice Department to instruct nonprofit organizations \u201cto stop work immediately\u201d on four federally funded programs that provided information to people in immigration proceedings.",
      "\u201cThere were individuals in the waiting room who we otherwise would have been able to assist, but we're not able to do so at this time,\u201d said Robinson, managing attorney for the center, which he said has helped about 10,000 people since it began operating the help desk in December 2021.",
      "Without the programs that educate people in immigration courts and detention centers about their rights and the complicated legal process, many will end up navigating the system on their own. Advocates worry that due process and the backlogged immigration courts will suffer as Trump tries to make good on his campaign promise to crack down on illegal immigration.",
      "A coalition of nonprofit groups that provide the services filed a lawsuit Friday challenging the stop-work order and seeking to immediately restore access to the programs.",
      "Despite the loss of federal funding, staff from the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights went to a Virginia detention center to provide services the day after the Jan. 22 stop-work order. They had spoken to about two dozen people when detention center staff escorted them out, telling them they could no longer provide those services, Amica executive director Michael Lukens said, describing the stoppage as \u201cdevastating.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe often hear that people don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. Why are they detained? What\u2019s going to happen next? And we are being stopped from even giving that basic level of orientation,\u201d Lukens said.",
      "Lawyers running a help desk inside Chicago\u2019s busy immigration court provided services to more than 2,000 people in 2024. The National Immigrant Justice Center started the effort in 2013 with private funding and expanded it three years later with federal funds.",
      "Since the stop-work order, the organization has provided scaled-down services, but they are unsure how long they will be able to continue that with the gap left by federal funding cuts, spokesperson Tara Tidwell Cullen said.",
      "Several organizations said they\u2019ve been told that posters informing people of their services and information about legal help hotlines have been removed from detention centers.",
      "Congress allocates $29 million a year for the four programs \u2014 the Legal Orientation Program, the Immigration Court Helpdesk, the Family Group Legal Orientation and the Counsel for Children Initiative \u2014 funding that's spread among various groups across the country providing the services, Lukens said, adding that the programs have broad bipartisan support. The amount is the same regardless of the number of people they're helping, and the organizations often do additional fundraising to cover their costs, he said.",
      "Trump previously targeted these programs during his first term, but this time things are different.",
      "In 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the funding would be pulled from the programs, but the threat of legal action by a coalition of organizations that provide the services, as well as bipartisan support from members of Congress, caused the Justice Department to reverse course.",
      "This time, the action was more abrupt, with the stop-work order issued just hours before it took effect and program staff being barred from detention centers.",
      "Immigration law is incredibly complicated and, unlike in criminal courts, people do not have a right to have an attorney appointed if they cannot afford one, and many end up going through the system without legal representation.",
      "Immigration courts throughout the country are clogged by a backlog of about 3.7 million cases, which can leave people in limbo for years. When people know what to expect and have their affairs in order, hearings move more quickly because judges don't have to explain the basics to each person who appears before them, advocates assert. It can also reduce lines at filing windows in immigration courts because people know what forms they have to fill out and can get help completing them correctly.",
      "People can make informed choices to either move forward with a case knowing their chances and the risks involved or, if they don't want to go through a court battle or don't see any available relief that fits their situation, they may decide not to fight and to just go home, said Edna Yang, co-executive director of American Gateways, which operates in three detention centers and the immigration court in San Antonio, Texas.",
      "\u201cStopping programs that actually help people get the information they need isn\u2019t going to fix the system,\u201d Yang said. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to make it worse.\u201d",
      "The organizations also make sure due process rights are respected, alert people to imminent filing deadlines, ensure that translators are available and help avoid deportation orders that could unlawfully return asylum seekers to a harmful situation, advocates said.",
      "Milagro, a 69-year-old woman from Venezuela, arrived in the U.S. in May 2024 when she got an appointment through a U.S. government app after spending four years in Mexico. The Associated Press agreed not to use her last name because she fears that speaking out could affect her pending case.",
      "She filed an asylum application, citing a fear for her life in Venezuela as part of the political opposition. She didn\u2019t have a job when she arrived and used the help desk operated by Estrella del Paso at the immigration court in El Paso, Texas, for help with her asylum application. The last time she went, she discovered it was closed because of the stop-work order.",
      "\u201cYou feel a kind of frustration because the window that you had open to ask, to get advice, is closed,\u201d she said in Spanish. \u201cIt is a feeling of helplessness and loneliness.\u201d",
      "Without their help, she said, \u201cI would have had to pay money that I do not have.\u201d",

      "Staffers of the U.S. Agency for International Development have been instructed to stay out of its Washington headquarters, and yellow police tape and officers have blocked the lobby",
      "WASHINGTON -- Staffers of the U.S. Agency for International Development were instructed to stay out of the agency\u2019s Washington headquarters, and yellow police tape and officers blocked the agency's lobby on Monday, after billionaire Elon Musk announced President Donald Trump had agreed with him to shut the agency.",
      "USAID staffers also said more than 600 additional employees had reported being locked out of the aid agency\u2019s computer systems overnight. Those still in the system received emails saying that \u201cat the direction of Agency leadership\u201d the headquarters building \u201cwill be closed to Agency personnel on Monday, Feb. 3.\u201d The agency's website vanished Saturday without explanation.",
      "The fast-moving developments come after thousands of USAID employees already have been laid off and programs shut down in the two weeks since President Donald Trump took office. And they show the extraordinary power of Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, in the Trump administration. Musk announced closing of the agency early Monday, as Trump\u2019s secretary of state, Marco Rubio, was out of the country on a trip to Central America.",
      "At a stop in El Salvador, Rubio told reporters that USAID was an uncooperative and opaque agency that had failed to answer questions about its funding or operate in line with the Trump administration's policy agenda.",
      "\u201cAnd that sort of level of insubordination makes it impossible to conduct the sort of mature and serious review that I think foreign aid, writ large, should have,\u201d said Rubio, who added that he was acting director of USAID but also had delegated that authority.",
      "The upheaval follows Trump ordering a freeze on foreign assistance, with widespread effects around the world. The moves by the U.S., the world's largest provider of humanitarian aid, have upended decades of policy that put humanitarian, development and security assistance in the center of efforts to build alliances and counter adversaries including China and Russia.",
      "U.S. and international companies have been forced to shut down tens of thousands of programs globally, leading to furloughs, layoffs and financial crises that have left many fearing the aid community has been too damaged by the freeze to resume work even if funding resumes.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have protested the moves, saying Trump lacks constitutional authority to shut down USAID without congressional approval and decrying Musk\u2019s accessing sensitive government-held information through his Trump-sanctioned inspections of federal government agencies and programs.",
      "\u201cThis is a corrupt abuse of power that is going on,\" Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland said at a rally with agency supporters and other Democratic lawmakers in front of the USAID building. \u201cAs my colleague said, it\u2019s not only a gift to our adversaries, but trying to shut down the Agency for International Development by executive order is plain illegal.\u201d",
      "On Monday, two State Department employees who tried to get into the USAID offices said they were turned away by security guards. Later, uniformed Department of Homeland Security officers and security officers blocked the lobby of the USAID\u2019s headquarters using yellow tape with the words \u201cdo not cross.\u201d",
      "The white USAID flag still flew on the empty plaza in front of the agency headquarters Monday morning. Staffers said employees earlier Monday had been able to reach other parts of the agency to clear personal belongings from their offices.",
      "Musk, who's leading an extraordinary civilian review of the federal government with Trump's agreement, said early Monday that he had spoken with Trump about the six-decade U.S. aid and development agency and \u201che agreed we should shut it down.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt became apparent that it's not an apple with a worm it in,\u201d Musk said in a live session on X Spaces early Monday. \u201cWhat we have is just a ball of worms. You\u2019ve got to basically get rid of the whole thing. It\u2019s beyond repair.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re shutting it down,\u201d he said.",
      "Musk, Trump and some Republican lawmakers have targeted the U.S. aid and development agency, which oversees humanitarian, development and security programs in some 120 countries, in increasingly strident terms, accusing it of promoting liberal causes.",
      "Since Trump took office, appointees brought in from his first term such as Peter Marocco placed more than 50 senior officials on leave for investigation without public explanation, gutting the agency\u2019s leadership. When the agency\u2019s personnel chief announced that the allegations against them were groundless and tried to reinstate them, he was placed on leave as well.",
      "Over the weekend, the Trump administration placed two top security chiefs at USAID on leave after they refused to turn over classified material in restricted areas to Musk\u2019s government-inspection teams, a current and a former U.S. official said.",
      "Musk\u2019s DOGE earlier carried out a similar operation at the Treasury Department, gaining access to sensitive information including the Social Security and Medicare customer payment systems. The Washington Post reported that a senior Treasury official had resigned over Musk\u2019s team accessing sensitive information.",
      "USAID, meanwhile, has been one of the federal agencies most targeted by the Trump administration in an escalating crackdown on the federal government and many of its programs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been run by a bunch of radical lunatics. And we\u2019re getting them out,\u201d Trump said to reporters about USAID on Sunday night.",
      "The Trump administration freeze on foreign assistance has shut down much of USAID\u2019s aid programs worldwide, including an HIV-AIDS program started by Republican President George W. Bush credited with saving more than 20 million lives in Africa and elsewhere. Aid contractors spoke of millions of dollars in medication and other goods now stuck in port that they were forbidden to deliver.",
      "Other programs that would shut down provided education to schoolgirls in Afghanistan under Taliban rule and monitored an Ebola outbreak spreading in Uganda. A USAID-supported crisis monitoring program, which was credited for helping prevent repeats of the 1980s famine in Uganda that killed up to 1.2 million people, has gone offline.",

      "NEW YORK -- New York Attorney General Letitia James on Monday told hospitals that they would be violating state law if they stop offering gender-affirming care for people under age 19 in response to an executive order from President Donald Trump aimed at curtailing federal funding for such treatments.",
      "In a letter, James, a Democrat, told health care facilities that refusing to provide the treatments would violate New York's anti-discrimination laws.",
      "\"Regardless of the availability of federal funding, we write to further remind you of your obligations to comply with New York State laws,\" her letter reads.",
      "Trump, a Republican, last week signed an executive order that directed agencies to take steps to make sure that hospitals receiving federal research and education grants \u201cend the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\u201d The language in the order \u2014 using words such as \u201cmaiming,\u201d \u201csterilizing\u201d and \u201cmutilation\u201d \u2014 contradicts what is typical for gender-affirming care in the United States.",
      "The letter from James came as some hospitals in Colorado, Virginia and Washington, D.C., said they were pausing gender-affirming treatments for young people while administrators evaluate the order. The White House on Monday released a statement that said the executive order was \u201calready having its intended effect.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Greater New York Hospital Association said they were in close contact with member hospitals about the gender-affirming care executive order.",
      "\u201cWe are collaboratively working through every aspect of the EO to determine its legal and clinical implications. That work is ongoing,\u201d Brian Conway said in an email.",
      "Gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth is not common but such treatments have been the subject of fierce political debate. Fewer than 1 in 1,000 adolescents in the U.S. with commercial insurance received puberty blockers or hormones during a recent five-year period, according to a new study."

      "Wright, CEO of Denver-based Liberty Energy, has been one of the industry\u2019s loudest voices against efforts to fight climate change. He says more fossil fuel production can lift people out of poverty around the globe and has promised to help Trump \u201cunleash energy security and prosperity.\u201d",
      "The Senate approved his nomination, 59-38. Eight Democrats \u2014 including both senators from Wright's home state of Colorado \u2014 voted in favor.",

      "\u201cPresident Trump shares my passion for energy,\u201d Wright said at his confirmation hearing last month, promising that if confirmed, he would \u201cwork tirelessly to implement (Trump's) bold agenda as an unabashed steward for all sources of affordable, reliable and secure American energy.\u201d",
      "That includes oil and natural gas, coal, nuclear power and hydropower, along with wind and solar power and geothermal energy, Wright said.",
      "Trump\u2019s energy wishes are likely to run into real-world limits, including the fact that U.S. oil production is already at record levels. The federal government cannot force companies to drill for more oil, and production increases could lower prices and reduce profits.",
      "Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the second-ranking Republican, called Wright an innovator who \u201ctells the truth about energy production.\"",

      "Wright, 60, has been chairman and CEO of Liberty Energy since 2011 and has no prior experience in government. He grew up in Colorado, earned an undergraduate degree at MIT and did graduate work in electrical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley and MIT. In 1992, he founded Pinnacle Technologies, which helped launch commercial shale gas production through hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.",
      "He later served as chairman of Stroud Energy, an early shale gas producer, before founding Liberty Resources in 2010.",

      "Just a day before President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China go into effect, the world appears to be bracing for the possible impacts",
      "WASHINGTON -- Just a day before President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China go into effect, the world is bracing for the possible impacts. There is uncertainty about whether a deal could be reached or whether the tariffs are a harbinger of a broader trade war as Trump has promised more import taxes to come.",
      "Trump posted on social media that he spoke Monday morning with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and would \u201cbe speaking to him again at 3:00 P.M.\u201d The U.S. president has said he also would talk Monday with his counterpart in Mexico. Both Canada and Mexico are about to levy their own tariffs in response to U.S. actions.",
      "Trump used his Monday social media post to repeat his complaints that Canada has been uncooperative, despite decades of friendship and partnerships that range from World War II to the response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States.",
      "\u201cCanada doesn\u2019t even allow U.S. Banks to open or do business there,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cWhat\u2019s that all about? Many such things, but it\u2019s also a DRUG WAR, and hundreds of thousands of people have died in the U.S. from drugs pouring through the Borders of Mexico and Canada.\u201d",
      "Financial markets, businesses and consumers are braced for the impact of the new tariffs that also include an import tax against China. Stock market indices were set for a modest selloff, suggesting some hope that the import taxes that could push up inflation and disrupt global trade and growth would be short-lived.",
      "But the outlook reflected a deep uncertainty about a Republican president who has talked with adoration about tariffs, even saying the U.S. government made a mistake in 1913 by switching to income taxes as its primary revenue source. Trump said Sunday the tariffs would lift if Canada and Mexico did more to crack down on illegal immigration and fentanyl smuggling, though there are no clear benchmarks. Trump also said the U.S. can no longer run a trade imbalance with its two largest trade partners.",
      "Mexico is facing a 25% tariff, while Canada would be charged 25% on its imports to the United States and 10% on its energy products. China is facing a 10% additional tariff due to its role in the making and selling of fentanyl, the Trump White House said.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, said Monday that it was misleading to characterize the showdown as a trade war despite the planned retaliations and risk of escalation.",
      "\u201cRead the executive order where President Trump was absolutely, 100% clear that this is not a trade war,\u201d Hassett said. \u201cThis is a drug war.\"",
      "But even if the orders are focused on illegal drugs, Trump's own remarks have often been more about his perceived sense that foreign countries are ripping off the United States by running trade surpluses. On Sunday, Trump said that tariffs would be coming soon on countries in the European Union. He has discussed tariffs as both a diplomatic tool on national security issues, a way to raise revenues and a vehicle for renegotiating existing trade pacts.",
      "Multiple economists outside the administration have warned that the tariffs would push up prices and hamper growth, with Trump himself saying there would be some short term pain after having campaigned last year on the promise that he could tame inflation.",
      "Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at the consultancy RSM, said the United States was unlikely to fall into a recession this year, but the tariffs would hurt growth and push up the cost of government borrowing, which would potentially keep the interest rates charged on mortgages and auto loans elevated.",
      "\u201cIf there is no resolution, the impact on the U.S. economy will be significant,\u201d he said. \u201cGrowth will slow notably from the 2.9% average over the past three years as inflation and interest rates rise. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, currently around 4.5%, could climb to a range between 4.75% and 5%.\u201d"

      "LANSING, Mich. -- Jonathan Zou, a second-year student at the University of Michigan, was among the thousands of students who joined pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses nationwide this past year. Although the campus protests have subsided, the repercussions for students like Zou remain.",
      "Since his arrest by university police last Oct. 7 after using a megaphone during a pro-Palestinian march, Zou has been banned from all University of Michigan campuses, except for attending class or seeking medical care.",
      "Zou is one of five individuals facing similar bans who the American Civil Liberties Union is representing in a lawsuit that accuses the University of Michigan of violating their right to free speech. The lawsuit, filed Monday by the ACLU in federal court, also argues that the university \u201cabused its authority to ban people from public property.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe university says it appreciates this history of activism, but it will arrest students, ban students, surveil students and repress them through legal or school disciplinary means,\" Zou said in an interview before the lawsuit was filed.",
      "In response to a request for comment, a University of Michigan spokesperson said the university has not been served with the lawsuit and has no comment at this time.",
      "Pro-Palestinian demonstrations swept college campuses last spring, with activists setting up tent encampments and, in some cases, escalating their protests further. Thousands were arrested; while many had their cases dismissed, others remain in legal limbo as they pursue their education.",
      "On Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order calling for aggressive action to fight antisemitism on college campuses and promising to prosecute offenders and revoke visas for international students found to be what he called \u201cHamas sympathizers.\u201d",
      "Michigan has been deeply affected by tensions over the Israel-Hamas war, with metro Detroit home to the nation\u2019s largest Arab American community and a significant Jewish population. These dynamics have sparked unrest on University of Michigan campuses, resulting in police clashes with protesters and demonstrators targeting university regents for protests.",
      "Last week, the University of Michigan suspended a pro-Palestinian group for two years and pulled its funding after accusing the group of violating the university\u2019s standards of conduct.",
      "The ACLU's lawsuit was brought on behalf of Zou and one other current student, two recent graduates and an Ann Arbor community member. According to the lawsuit, the individuals were each issued trespass bans after being accused of misconduct during protests, but never formally charged for it.",
      "Zou was participating in a march on the University of Michigan's Ann Arbor campus on the one-year anniversary of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and another 250 were taken hostage. The 2023 attack sparked a war that has devastated the Hamas-ruled Gaza strip.",
      "Zou was arrested after using a megaphone during the march, but never formally charged.",
      "The trespass bans have upended individuals \u201cdaily lives, disrupted their, education and work, and are blocking their ability to speak and protest freely on the University\u2019s vast campus,\u201d according to the lawsuit. The individuals are asking the federal court to lift their bans and prevent the university from issuing broad trespassing bans in the future.",
      "A ceasefire took effect last month between Hamas and Israel, leading to hostage-for-prisoner swaps and a flood of aid into the Gaza Strip after a 15-month ground war marked by devastation, hunger and mass displacement in the territory. Looming large is the possibility that fighting will resume if the ceasefire breaks down after the six-week first phase.",

The first trial resulted in the conviction of five people last year and received widespread attention after some defendants and people linked with them allegedly tried \u2014 unsuccessfully \u2014 to bribe a juror with a bag of $120,000 in cash. The juror went straight to police instead.",
      "Bock is one of 70 defendants charged in the overall case. They're being tried in batches. Thirty of them have already pleaded guilty to various charges, including some who had been scheduled to go on trial with Bock this week. One defendant from the first trial was sentenced this month to 17 1/2 years, the longest prison term handed down in the case so far.",

      "Federal prosecutors allege that the conspiracy revolved around two groups \u2014 Feeding Our Future and Partners in Nutrition \u2014 that were both small nonprofits that were approved as sponsors of the Federal Child Nutrition Program before the pandemic. But the two groups dramatically increased the number of meal sites that they claimed to be sponsoring during the pandemic. Feeding Our Future went from receiving and disbursing $3.4 million in federal funds in 2019 to nearly $200 million in 2021. Sites sponsored by Feeding Our Future falsely claimed to be serving thousands of children daily, prosecutors allege.",

The total included administrative fees to which Feeding Our Future was not entitled, they said.",
      "\u201cBock and other Feeding Our Future employees also solicited and received bribes and kickbacks from individuals and companies sponsored by Feeding Our Future,\u201d prosecutors continued. \u201cFeeding Our Future operated a pay-to-play scheme, where individuals seeking to operate fraudulent sites under the sponsorship of Feeding Our Future had to kick back a portion of their fraudulent proceeds to Feeding Our Future employees.\u201d",
      "Bock's attorney, Kenneth Udoibok, said they'll argue at trial that she's not guilty of the federal fraud, conspiracy and bribery charges against her.",
      "\u201cShe's innocent and she's going to express that belief, that truth, until the day she dies,\u201d Udoibok said in an interview last week. \u201cThis woman was hoodwinked, played by people she trusted. She trusted that these people that have pled guilty, she trusted them to have delivered food to needy children, needy people, deserving folks. And they played her.\u201d",
      "Udoibok said the large number of guilty pleas, and the fact that they're now down to just Bock and a co-defendant for this trial, doesn't change the defense strategy. He said the jury will be able to see the difference between her and the rest of the defendants despite the complexities of the overall case.",
      "\u201cShe accepted no bribes or kickbacks from anybody. She did not know that the invoices were fraudulent. She was focused on providing as much access to needy people as possible, that is, feeding adults and children during COVID and during the George Floyd protests,\u201d Udoibok said.",
      "An attorney for Bock's co-defendant, Salim Ahmed Said, did not return a call seeking comment on the case.",
      "Five people were charged with bribery because of the attempt in the first trial, including three who were on trial at the time. Two of the five have already pleaded guilty, while one more is scheduled to change his plea to guilty in the bribery case in March. U.S. Attorney Andrew Luger described the elaborate scheme as \u201csomething out of a mob movie.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Judge Nancy Brasel, who is overseeing Bock's trial, has ordered extra steps to shield the jurors' identities and prevent any further bribe attempts.",
      "The federal money flowed through the state Department of Education, and the loss of 250 million taxpayer dollars became a major political problem for Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. His administration largely blamed federal authorities, saying the FBI asked them not to cut off the flow of funds to protect its investigation. Walz's critics insist he should have done more. While Walz comfortably won reelection in 2022, the issue resurfaced after presidential candidate Kamala Harris picked him as her running mate.",
      "This year, Republicans in the closely divided Minnesota Legislature have made fighting fraud in government programs one of their top issues, and not just because of Feeding our Future. Walz himself has proposed his own anti-fraud package. But the 2025 legislative session is off to a contentious start and it's not clear yet if the sides can reach the bipartisan consensus that will be needed to pass anything.",

    "title": "American bald eagles are having a moment, ecologically and culturally",
    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 02:39:52 -0500",
    "summary": "America&rsquo;s national bird, the bald eagle, is having a moment",
    "story": [
      "America\u2019s national bird, the bald eagle, is having a moment",
      "WEST ORANGE, N.J. -- Along the long road from American icon to endangered species and back again, the bald eagle \u2014 the national bird of the United States, often seen against a clear blue sky \u2014 is having a moment.",
      "The eagles find themselves in an environmental updraft of sorts since the early 2000's, when the federal government took the thriving birds off its endangered species list with more states following suit. Culturally, too, the animals are soaring.",
      "In December, Joe Biden signed legislation making the raptor the country's national bird (thought that was already the case? More in a bit). This month, New Jersey became the latest state to delist the bald eagle as endangered, citing a remarkable comeback for the creatures associated with strength and independence \u2014 and that occupied just a single nest in the state decades ago. And to the chagrin or elation of football fans, the Philadelphia Eagles will be vying for a championship in the Super Bowl this weekend.",
      "How did the storied birds find their way back? As with so many tales, it's complex.",
      "The story \u2014 there was a single nesting pair in New Jersey in the 1980s and roughly 300 now, for instance \u2014 centers on the banning of DDT, a chemical insecticide with environmental side effects that included thin-shelled eagle eggs. That touched off a cratering in the number of eagles across the country, and officials prohibited the pesticide in 1972.",
      "To rebuild the birds' numbers in their historic range across the country, conservationists imported birds from places where their populations were stable, including from Canada. Early on, they also removed eggs from nesting birds' nests, replacing them with artificial ones for the eagles to \u201cincubate\u201d while the real eggs were safely hatched outside the nest before being returned, as eaglets for their parents to raise according to Kathy Clark, the head of New Jersey's Endangered and Nongame Species Program.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re one of the few conservation success stories of animals that almost went extinct on our continent. And so I think now it\u2019s really important to make sure people know that story and learn from it,\u201d said Maia Edwards, the science director at the American Bald Eagle Foundation in Alaska.",
      "Clark, whose work with the birds spans decades and includes the period when their numbers were so small they lived only in a remote part of the state, said the eagles have taught officials a number of lessons. One is that they're \u201cfairly adaptable\" and now live across densely populated (with people) New Jersey \u2014 from suburban Bergen County near New York to the wetlands along the shore in the south.",
      "She recalled the story of one fledgling eagle in a suburban town \u2014 New York Giants territory, as it were, sorry, Eagles fans \u2014 that found itself on a backyard woodpile and walking around the street. Volunteer observers worried over the bird's well-being, given the realities of suburban living. But a year later, observers spotted the eagle, identified by a band. It had apparently made it.",
      "\u201cThose birds that, you know, have that tolerance to live like in such a densely human structured environment is something I have a hard time understanding,\u201d she said. \u201cThey're Jersey birds. You got to have attitude, right?\u201d",
      "The birds do face dangers as they expand into suburbia, though. Jilian Fazio, director of the Essex County Turtle Back Zoo in suburban northern New Jersey, said the zoo rescues a number of birds hit by cars. One bird, a male named Freedom, perched atop a branch in his enclosure at the zoo recently and called out loudly. He was found dangling by a rope, left with an injury that renders him unreleasable, Fazio said.",
      "There are threats, as well. Habitat preservation and clean, open water, since the eagles feed heavily on fish, is a worry, but there's also the current outbreak of avian influenza or bird flu. Clark says officials are going to maintain surveillance amid the outbreak.",
      "Beyond the birds coming off endangered lists, they made headlines recently for finally getting their due as the county's national bird, an oversight left undone in law because the bald eagle was already on the national seal and many thought it already had that status, said Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who sponsored legislation that Biden signed last month.",
      "She and colleagues worked with Native American and veterans groups to get buy-in for the legislation, she said, and it passed the typically divisive House and Senate last year with no dissent. The birds are revered in a number of Native American cultures as symbols of strength, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, according to Paul Apodaca, a retired academic who specializes in folklore and mythology.",
      "The eagles' perch as symbols of the country contributes to their conservation, with experts considering them an \u201cumbrella species,\u201d whose need for large open spaces and waterways helps preserve lesser known wildlife.",
      "\u201cAmericans are always going to have that sort of personal relationship with bald eagles,\" Clark said.",
      "Experiencing seeing a bird in the wild or even as you're driving along a business-lined highway can leave an impression. Dan Day, a birder who's spotted bald eagles some 50 times in recent years both on nature walks and just driving around suburban New Jersey, remembered never having seen the birds as a kid growing up in Cleveland. Now a New Jersey resident and Philadelphia Eagles fan, he regularly goes out in his green \u201cBirds\u201d cap and binoculars.",
      "\u201cJust the mere thrill of seeing one \u2014 a lot of people just have never, ever looked at one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really elevates your day to see a bald eagle.\u201d",
      "Enjoy watching them, experts say, but give them space, too. Because rescuing animals threatened with extinction is expensive, uncertain work. Said Clark, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection official: \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever will lose that perspective of, of being on the brink there, not knowing if if you\u2019re going to be able to save the species.\""

      "BALTIMORE -- The founder of a Florida-based neo-Nazi group was convicted Monday of conspiring with his former girlfriend to plan an attack on Maryland\u2019s power grid in furtherance of their shared racist beliefs.",
      "Brandon Russell, 29, encouraged Sarah Beth Clendaniel to carry out a series of \u201csniper attacks\u201d on electrical substations around Baltimore that could have caused significant damage to the regional power grid, according to federal prosecutors. Their goal was to create chaos in the majority-Black city, prosecutors say.",
      "The two were arrested in February 2023 \u2014 before the plans were executed.",
      "The 12-person jury deliberated for less than an hour after hearing about four days of testimony in federal court in Baltimore. They found Russell guilty of one count of conspiracy to damage an energy facility, the only charge he faced.",
      "Russell will be sentenced at a later date. He appeared in court wearing a light blue jacket and glasses. He conferred regularly with his attorney throughout the trial, looking cheerful and engaged.",
      "Several years ago, Russell co-founded the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division, which is German for \u201catomic weapon.\u201d",
      "This wasn\u2019t his first run-in with law enforcement. Russell previously pleaded guilty to possession of an unregistered destructive device and improper storage of explosive materials after investigators searched his home and found a stash of highly explosive materials and a cache of neo-Nazi signs, posters, books and flags.",
      "During closing arguments Monday afternoon, prosecutor Joseph Baldwin recounted trial testimony, including from a confidential informant who got connected with Russell through the social media app Telegram. Russell introduced Clendaniel and the informant, hoping the person could help her obtain a firearm to use in the attack, according to prosecutors.",
      "\u201cHe was the team leader taking care of his warrior,\u201d Baldwin told the jury.",
      "Prosecutors played a clip from a recorded phone call in which Russell used a racist expletive and requested secrecy from the informant, telling him: \u201cIt\u2019s important you don\u2019t talk about this to anyone.\u201d",
      "While prosecutors claimed Russell hoped to incite a race war, his defense attorney downplayed his involvement in the plot, calling the case \u201ca setup from the very beginning.\u201d",
      "Russell was in Florida the entire time with no plans to travel to Maryland and actively assist in carrying out the attack, attorney Ian Goldstein said. Russell may have supported efforts to disrupt modern society and restore white supremacy, but he wasn\u2019t a co-conspirator in this case, Goldstein said during his closing argument.",
      "\u201cHe was a cheerleader \u2014 as terrible as that sounds,\u201d Goldstein said, acknowledging his client\u2019s \u201crepulsive\u201d ideology. \u201cThat\u2019s what he was, and that\u2019s not illegal.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t enough to convince the jury. Before jurors began deliberating Monday evening, U.S. District Judge James Bredar told them a guilty verdict would require a finding that Russell had \u201cengaged, advised or assisted\u201d in the conspiracy with knowledge of its objectives.",
      "Russell apparently wasn\u2019t on law enforcement\u2019s radar until police responded to a 2017 double homicide at a Tampa apartment building and found him outside crying, dressed in military fatigues. One of his roommates had killed the other two, officials said.",
      "Police concluded Russell had nothing to do with the deadly shootings. But while detectives investigated, they discovered the explosive materials and neo-Nazi paraphernalia in Russell\u2019s possession, including flyers that said, \u201cDon\u2019t prepare for exams, prepare for a race war\u201d and a framed photo of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.",
      "Russell was in the Florida National Guard at the time and had attended the University of South Florida.",
      "Devon Arthurs, who later pleaded guilty to killing his roommates, told detectives he shot them for teasing him about his recent conversion to Islam. He also said it was to thwart a terrorist attack by Atomwaffen and claimed Russell had materials in the house \u201cto kill civilians and target locations like power lines, nuclear reactors, and synagogues,\u201d prosecutors said.",
      "Goldstein also represented Russell in that case, when the attorney argued that possessing explosives didn\u2019t mean Russell intended to use them to cause harm. Goldstein said his client was traumatized by the deaths of his roommates and already suffered from mental health issues. Family members said Russell was just a follower looking for community and trying to please his friends.",
      "Russell ultimately pleaded guilty to possession of an unregistered destructive device and improper storage of explosive materials. He was sentenced in 2018 to serve five years in prison. During the sentencing hearing, a federal judge in Tampa expressed explicit concern that Russell could fall in with the wrong crowd behind bars.",
      "Several years later, federal investigators discovered his relationship with Clendaniel, who similarly had a long history of white supremacist beliefs.",
      "She and Russell began exchanging letters around 2018 while they were incarcerated in different facilities. They developed a romantic relationship that continued after they were released from prison, court records show.",
      "Clendaniel, 36, pleaded guilty to plotting the attack and was sentenced in September to 18 years in prison."

      "Hundreds of internal emails show executives of the New Orleans Saints were far more involved than previously known in providing public relations help to Catholic church leaders as they confronted a clergy sex abuse crisis",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- As New Orleans church leaders braced for the fallout from publishing a list of predatory Catholic priests, they turned to an unlikely ally: the front office of the city\u2019s NFL franchise.",
      "What followed was a months-long, crisis-communications blitz orchestrated by the New Orleans Saints\u2019 president and other top team officials, according to hundreds of internal emails obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The records, which the Saints and church had long sought to keep out of public view, reveal team executives played a more extensive role than previously known in a public relations campaign to mitigate fallout from the clergy sexual abuse crisis. The emails shed new light on the Saints' foray into a fraught topic far from the gridiron, a behind-the-scenes effort driven by the team's devoutly Catholic owner who has long enjoyed a close relationship with the city's embattled archbishop.",
      "They also showed how various New Orleans institutions \u2014 from a sitting federal judge to the local media \u2014 rallied around church leaders at a critical moment.",
      "Among the key moments, as revealed in the Saints\u2019 own emails:",
      "\u2014 Saints executives were so involved in the church\u2019s damage control that a team spokesman briefed his boss on a 2018 call with the city\u2019s top prosecutor hours before the church released a list of clergymen accused of abuse. The call, the spokesman said, \u201callowed us to take certain people off\u201d the list.",
      "\u2014 Team officials were among the first people outside the church to view that list, a carefully curated, yet undercounted roster of suspected pedophiles. The disclosure of those names invited civil claims against the church and drew attention from federal and state law enforcement.",
      "\u2014 The team\u2019s president, Dennis Lauscha, drafted more than a dozen questions that Archbishop Gregory Aymond should be prepared to answer as he faced reporters.",
      "\u2014 The Saints\u2019 senior vice president of communications, Greg Bensel, provided fly-on-the-wall updates to Lauscha about local media interviews, suggesting church and team leaders were all on the same team. \u201cHe is doing well,\u201d Bensel wrote as the archbishop told reporters the church was committed to addressing the crisis. \u201cThat is our message,\u201d Bensel added, \u201cthat we will not stop here today.\u201d",
      "The emails obtained by AP sharply undercut assurances the Saints gave fans about the public relations guidance five years ago when they asserted they had provided only \u201cminimal\u201d assistance to the church. The team went to court to keep its internal emails secret.",
      "\u201cThis is disgusting,\u201d said state Rep. Mandie Landry, D-New Orleans. \u201cAs a New Orleans resident, taxpayer and Catholic, it doesn\u2019t make any sense to me why the Saints would go to these lengths to protect grown men who raped children. All of them should have been just as horrified at the allegations.\u201d",
      "The Saints told AP last week that the partnership is a thing of the past. The emails cover a yearlong period ending in July 2019, when they were subpoenaed by attorneys for victims of a priest later charged with raping an 8-year-old boy.",
      "In a lengthy statement, the team criticized the media for using \u201cleaked emails for the purpose of misconstruing a well-intended effort.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo member of the Saints organization condones or wants to cover up the abuse that occurred in the Archdiocese of New Orleans,\" the team said. \"That abuse occurred is a terrible fact.\u201d",
      "The team's response did little to quell the anger of survivors of clergy sexual abuse. \u201cWe felt betrayed by the organization,\u201d said Kevin Bourgeois, a former Saints season ticket holder who was abused by a priest in the 1980s. \u201cIt forces me to question what other secrets are being withheld. I\u2019m angry, hurt and re-traumatized again.\u201d",
      "After the AP first reported on the alliance in early 2020, Saints owner Gayle Benson denied that anyone \u201cassociated with our organizations made recommendations or had input\u201d on the list of pedophile priests.",
      "The Saints reiterated that denial in its statement Saturday, saying no Saints employees \u201chad any responsibility for adding or removing any names from that list.\u201d The team said that no employees offered \"any input, suggestions or opinions as to who should be included or omitted from\u201d the list.",
      "Leon Cannizzaro, the district attorney at the time, last week denied any role in shaping the credibly accused clergy list, echoing statements he made in 2020. He told AP he \u201cabsolutely had no involvement in removing any names from any list.\" Cannizzaro said he did not know why the Saints' spokesman would have reported he had been on a call related to the list.",
      "The emails, sent from Saints accounts, don\u2019t specify which clergymen were removed from the list or why. They raise fresh questions, however, about the Saints\u2019 role in a scandal that has taken on much larger legal and financial stakes since the team waded into it, potentially in violation of the NFL\u2019s policy against conduct \u201cdetrimental to the league.\u201d",
      "The outsized role of Saints executives could draw new attention from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who is scheduled to address reporters Monday as New Orleans prepares to host its 11th Super Bowl. Messages requesting comment were sent to the NFL.",
      "Taken together, the emails portray a coalescing of several New Orleans institutions. U.S. District Court Judge Jay Zainey, who was copied by the Saints on the public relations efforts, cheered Bensel on from his personal email account, thanking the team\u2019s spokesman \u201cfor the wonderful advice.\u201d A newspaper editor similarly thanked Bensel for getting involved.",
      "\u201cYou have hit all the points,\u201d Zainey, a fellow Catholic, wrote in another email to Bensel, praising a lengthy note the Saints spokesman sent to local newspaper editors. \u201cBy his example and leadership, Archbishop Aymond, our shepherd, will continue to lead our Church in the right direction \u2014 helping us to learn and to rebuild from the mistakes of the past.\u201d",
      "Zainey later struck down a Louisiana law, vigorously opposed by the church, that would have allowed victims to bring civil claims irrespective of how long ago the alleged sex abuse took place. He declined to comment.",
      "The list marked a watershed in heavily Catholic New Orleans \u2014 a long-awaited mea culpa to parishioners intended to usher in healing and local accountability. It came at a time when church leaders were seeking to retain public trust \u2014 and financial support \u2014 as they reckoned with generations of abuse and mounting litigation that eventually drove the Archdiocese of New Orleans into bankruptcy.",
      "That litigation, filed in 2020, involves more than 600 people who say they were abused by clergy. The case has produced a trove of still-secret church records said to document years of abuse claims and a pattern of church leaders transferring clergy without reporting their crimes to law enforcement.",
      "While it has since expanded, the list of accused priests was missing a number of clergy when it was originally released, an earlier AP investigation found.",
      "The AP identified 20 clergymen who had been accused in lawsuits or charged by law enforcement with child sexual abuse who were inexplicably omitted from the New Orleans list \u2014 including two who were charged and convicted of crimes.",
      "Still, the list has served as a roadmap for both the FBI and Louisiana State Police, which launched sweeping investigations into New Orleans church leaders\u2019 shielding of predatory priests.",
      "Last spring, state police carried out a wide-ranging search warrant at the Archdiocese of New Orleans, seizing records that include communications with the Vatican.",
      "Since the Saints began assisting the archdiocese, at least seven current and former members of the local clergy have been charged with crimes ranging from rape to possession of child pornography.",
      "The extent of the abuse remained largely unknown in 2018, a year the Saints won nine consecutive games on the way to an NFC Championship appearance. As the church prepped for a media onslaught, Bensel carried out an aggressive public relations campaign in which he called in favors, prepared talking points and leaned on long-time media contacts to support the church through a \u201csoon-to-be-messy\u201d time.",
      "Far from freelancing, Bensel had the Saints\u2019 backing and blessing through what he called a \u201cGalileo moment,\u201d suggesting Aymond would be a trailblazer in releasing a credibly accused clergy list at a critical time for the church. In emails to editorial boards, he warned against \u201ccasting a critical eye\u201d on the archbishop \u201cis neither beneficial nor right.\u201d",
      "He urged the city's newspapers to \u201cwork with\u201d the church, reminding them the Saints and New Orleans Pelicans \u2014 the city's NBA team, also owned by Benson \u2014 had been successful thanks, in part, to their support.",
      "\u201cWe did this because we had buy-in from YOU,\" Bensel wrote to the editors of The Times-Picayune and New Orleans Advocate, \u201csupporting our mission to be the best, to make New Orleans and everything within her bounds the best.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are sitting on that opportunity now with the Archdiocese of New Orleans,\" he added. \"We need to tell the story of how this Archbishop is leading us out of this mess.\u201d",
      "Benson and Aymond, the archbishop, have been confidants for years. It was the archbishop who introduced Benson to her late husband, Tom Benson, who died in 2018, leaving his widow in control of New Orleans\u2019 NFL and NBA franchises.",
      "The Bensons\u2019 foundation has given tens of millions of dollars to the archdiocese and other Catholic causes. Along the way, Aymond has flown on the owner\u2019s private jet and become almost a part of the team, frequently celebrating pregame Masses.",
      "When the clergy abuse allegations came to a head, Bensel, the Saints' spokesman, worked his contacts in the local media to help shape the story. He had friendly email exchanges with a Times-Picayune columnist who praised the archbishop for releasing the clergy list. He also asked the newspaper\u2019s leadership to keep their communications \u201cconfidential, not for publication nor to share with others.\u201d",
      "His emails revealed that The Advocate \u2013 after Aymond privately complained to the publisher \u2014 removed a notice from one online article that had called for clergy abuse victims to reach out.",
      "Kevin Hall, president and publisher of Georges Media, which owns the newspaper, said the publication welcomes engagement from community leaders but that outreach \"does not dilute our journalistic standards or keep us from pursuing the truth.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo one gets preferential treatment in our coverage of the news,\" he said in a statement. \u201cOver the past six years, we have consistently published in-depth stories highlighting the ongoing serious issues surrounding the archdiocese sex abuse crisis, as well as investigative reports on this matter by WWL-TV and by The Associated Press.\u201d",
      "It was The Advocate\u2019s reporting that prompted Bensel to help the church, the emails show. He first offered to \u201cchat crisis communications\u201d with church leaders after the newspaper exposed a scandal involving a disgraced deacon, George Brignac, who remained a lay minister even after the archdiocese settled claims he raped an 8-year-old altar boy.",
      "\u201cWe have been through enough at Saints to be a help or sounding board,\u201d Bensel wrote, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want to overstep!\u201d"

      "In the heart of thriving Oklahoma City lies a more than 100-year-old relic to the city's western heritage: one of the largest cattle stockyards in the world",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- On the edge of a thriving downtown dotted with luxury hotels and trendy restaurants is a more than 100-year-old relic of Oklahoma City's western heritage: One of the world's largest cattle stockyards.",
      "But maybe not for much longer.",
      "The Oklahoma National Stockyards \u2014 the last big-city stockyard in the U.S. \u2014 is for sale. The $27 million price tag includes 100 acres (40 hectares) of prime property along the Oklahoma River in a growing city of roughly 700,000 residents, where a state-of-the-art NBA arena is set to break ground and a developer is pushing plans for the country's tallest skyscraper.",
      "Although the stockyard's owners are hopeful a buyer will keep the cattle coming, they acknowledge the land is attractive for redevelopment.",
      "The sale is a sign of the times for livestock auctions and America's cattle market, a volatile industry squeezed in recent years by drought, higher production costs and the lowest number of cattle in the U.S. since the 1950s.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s imposition of tariffs on imported goods has created uncertainty in the industry, although the potential impact is not yet clear. The U.S. is the world's largest producer of beef but is still a net beef importer, with Canada and Mexico among the top countries accounting for U.S. beef imports.",
      "The number of cattle moving through the maze of wooden pens in Oklahoma City is down roughly 20% over the past two years, said Jerry Reynolds, the stockyard's president.",
      "The same family has owned the grounds since 1910, but Reynolds said younger generations of the owners are simply not interested in overseeing a major stockyard and the daily grind that entails: a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week operation with tens of thousands of animals auctioned every week and a seemingly endless maintenance to-do list.",
      "\u201cThe handwriting has kind of been on the wall for a long time, as the cities grow and surround these facilities,\u201d said Derrell Peel, a professor at Oklahoma State University who studies cattle markets. \u201cNot only is that a prime piece of real estate, but the increasing challenges, the environmental challenges, of operating a stockyard in a major city, is pretty tricky.\u201d",
      "The stockyard went on the market in October and the current owners do not have a timetable for completing the sale.",
      "As many as 10,000 head of cattle still rumble each week through the stockyard, an urban survivor in an industry that is largely now scattered across rural America. One of the largest stocker/feeder cattle markets in the world, the Oklahoma City grounds are the last of the so-called \u201cterminal markets\u201d that dotted the Midwest, where cattle were shipped, sold, slaughtered and then processed at nearby packing houses.",
      "In the mid-20th century, such stockyards thrived in bigger cities including Chicago, Kansas City, Omaha, Nebraska, and Fort Worth, Texas. But with the advent of refrigeration and the increasing value of those properties in urban centers, they slowly transitioned to more rural areas closer to feedlots and meatpacking plants, according to Peel, a professor of agricultural economics.",
      "If Oklahoma City's stockyard is shuttered, an auction market in Joplin, Missouri, would likely claim the title of the largest in the country, Peel said. That stockyard, a little more than 200 miles (320 kilometers) from Oklahoma City, as well as another large facility just west of the metro in El Reno, Oklahoma, would pick up much of the business, he said.",
      "\u201cAs a member of the family that began the yards and has been involved throughout our entire 115-year history, obviously I have some feelings about the outcome there,\" said Chris Bakwin, chairman of the stockyard's board and one of the major shareholders in the company founded by his great-grandfather. \u201cBut I have to do what\u2019s best for shareholders.\u201d",
      "The stockyard's pens are set up on the original bricks laid during its construction more than a century ago. From a metal catwalk that runs over the stockyard, visitors can hear the thundering sound of hoofs and the yells of cowboys on horseback leading them into pens or running a few at a time into a small, tightly packed arena where buyers signal their interest to a fast-talking auctioneer.",
      "On a recent January morning, rancher Garrison Duke, his wife Pamela, and their children, Pecos, 3, and 1-year-old Sterling, hauled a trailer full of cattle from their ranch in Lexington, on the outskirts of Oklahoma City.",
      "Duke was a boy when he first started going to the stockyard with his father and, on a good trip, they would leave town with a full stomach after a steak dinner and perhaps a new pair of boots.",
      "\u201cIt was just always a thrill, getting to see all the cattle and how they all handled them, seeing them sell and my dad get a big paycheck at the end of the year. It was good for everybody,\" Duke said. \u201cNow we're trying to keep the kids a part of it all.\"",
      "Adjacent to the stockyard is a business district filled with shops boasting western charm: Shorty's Hattery, National Saddlery, western wear stores and popular steakhouses. The area has become a tourist destination for travelers seeking a bit of Americana in the U.S. heartland.",
      "Oklahoma City's population grew by 3% over the past few years, according to the Census Bureau, making it the nation's 20th largest city.",
      "And while other stockyards in major cities have gone away, largely because of the increasing value of urban land, Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt said he believes the stockyard can coexist in the center of a booming city.",
      "\u201cI do, probably for no other reason but that Oklahoma City is so geographically large,\" Holt said. \u201cIt's not like the stockyards is in midtown Manhattan.\u201d",
      "Still, there is some fear among those who make their living at the stockyard that a buyer could have a different vision in mind.",
      "\u201cThere definitely is,\u201d said Jason Baker, who owns one of the nine commission firms that buy and sell cattle at the stockyard. \u201cIt's very vital for my family. It's our livelihood.\""

      "The annual ritual goes back more than a century in western Pennsylvania, with far older roots in European folklore, but it took Bill Murray's 1993 movie to transform it into what it is today, with tens of thousands of revelers at the scene and imitators scattered around the United States and beyond.",
      "Last year's crowd may have been a record and organizers are bracing for a similar turnout on Sunday.",
      "If the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club members declare Phil did not see his shadow, that is said to usher in an early spring. If he does see it, it's six more weeks of winter, although what that means can be subjective.",

      "Tom Dunkel, president of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, says there are two types of people who make the trek to Gobbler's Knob: the faithful seeking to validate their beliefs and the doubters who want to confirm their skepticism.",
      "Phil communicates his forecast through \u201cGroundhog-ese\u201d with the help of a special cane that Dunkel has inherited as the club's leader. It's not as if he speaks in English words.",

      "Attendance is free but it costs $5 to take a bus and avoid a 1 mile (1.6 kilometer) trek from the middle of town to the stage where the prediction is made, some 80 miles (123 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh. The need for so many buses is why the local schools, where the sports mascot is the Chucks, close when Groundhog Day falls on a weekday.",
      "A new welcome center opened four years ago and the club is working on an elaborate second living space for Phil and family so they can split time between Gobbler's Knob and Phil's longtime home at the town library. The club also is putting up large video screens and more powerful speakers this year to help attendees in the back of the crowd follow the proceedings.",
      "\"It\u2019s a holiday where you don\u2019t really owe anyone anything,\u201d said A.J. Dereume, who among the club's 15-member inner circle serves as Phil's handler. \u201cYou\u2019re grasping onto the belief, you know, in something that\u2019s just fun to believe in.\u201d",
      "Phil has a wife, Punxsutawney Phyllis, and two pups born this spring, Shadow and Sunny, although his family won't join him on stage for the big event. The groundhog family eats fruits and vegetables, get daily visits from Dereume and see a veterinarian at least once a year.",
      "The club's lore is that Phil is the same woodchuck who has been issuing weather forecasts for the past century, thanks to an \u201celixir of life\u201d that keeps him immortal.",
      "\u201cThere's only one Phil, and it's not something that can be handed down,\u201d Dunkel said. \u201cJust like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, there's only one.\u201d",
      "Groundhog Day celebrations, formal and informal, are being held in many Pennsylvania towns and elsewhere on Sunday. There have been Groundhog Day events in at least 28 U.S. states and Canadian provinces."

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has taken the first step towards setting up a sovereign wealth fund for the United States, and suggested that it could end up buying TikTok.",
      "The president signed an executive order on Monday, to kickstart the process, saying the fund would soon be \"one of the biggest\".",
      "More than 90 countries have sovereign wealth funds, investing surplus income for the benefit of future generations. However, the US currently runs a budget deficit.",
      "\"We're going to create a lot of wealth for the fund,\" Trump told reporters, without clarifying where the money would come from.",
      "When Trump first floated the idea of a sovereign wealth fund during his election campaign, he suggested it could be funded by \"tariffs and other intelligent things\".",

      "But on Tuesday the levies on Mexico and Canada were paused for 30 days.",

      "Saudi Arabia and Norway have two of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds, supported by the proceeds of fossil fuel sales. They invest in companies and projects around the world.",
      "President Trump has previously said that a US sovereign wealth fund would finance \"great national endeavours\" including infrastructure projects such as airports, roads as well as medical research.",
      "After signing the executive order for the fund's creation, he also floated the idea that it could buy up the social media platform TikTok.",
      "The Chinese-owned social media company was briefly taken offline in the US last month, over national security concerns, after the previous administration ordered its owner to sell its US operations or face a ban.",
      "Trump has delayed the ban, promising to find a solution, after TikTok's US users protested at its shutdown.",
      "\"We're going to be doing something, perhaps with TikTok, and perhaps not,\" Trump said. \"If we make the right deal, we'll do it. Otherwise, we won't... we might put that in the sovereign wealth fund.\"",
      "However, the president has also recently said that technology giant Microsoft was in discussions to acquire TikTok and that he would like to see a \"bidding war\" over the sale of the social media app.",
      "Other big names in tech, including Larry Ellison and Elon Musk, have also been floated as possible buyers.",

    "title": "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 18:32:13 GMT",
    "summary": "How might the UK be affected by Trump's tariffs, even if they are not imposed on the UK?",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has been unclear about whether he will impose tariffs on the UK but  economists warn there are still ways Britain could be negatively affected by the president's wider trade policies even if it avoids being hit directly.",
      "The impact could be felt through slower growth in some of the UK's important trading partners. Industrial exports could be diverted from the US and flood the UK market and there could be impacts on our financial markets, including a possible increase to borrowing costs.",
      "Asked about future tariffs, Trump told the BBC on Sunday night: \"The UK is way out of line but I'm sure that one\u2026 I think that one can be worked out.\"",
      "The president did not specify in which way he regarded the UK as being \"out of line\".",
      "One of the justifications Trump has given for imposing tariffs on countries is they have a trade surplus with the US - in other words they sell more to the US than they import from America.",
      "He has claimed these trade surpluses amount to \"massive subsidies that we're giving to Canada and to Mexico\".",
      "The tariffs on Mexico were paused for a month by Trump on Monday but the president has complained about unbalanced trade with the EU, saying on Sunday: \"They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products, they take almost nothing and we take everything from them. Millions of cars, tremendous amounts of food and farm products.\"",
      "So one way the UK might be seen to be out of line in the mind of Trump - and at risk of tariffs - is if Britain was also running a trade surplus with America.",
      "Does the UK have a trade surplus with the US?",
      "The UK's Office for National Statistics estimates the UK had a surplus of around \u00a371bn in trade with the US in 2023, the most recent full year for which we have data.",
      "But the American statistics office, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, estimates the US had a surplus on its trade with the UK in that year of $14.5bn, around \u00a312bn.",
      "How can both be true?",
      "The two stats agencies have looked at this discrepancy and agree it is due to different ways of measuring trade.",
      "One factor is the UK agencies, unlike their US counterparts, do not count trade flows through British crown dependencies such as the Isle of Man, some of which are significant financial services hubs and markedly affect the overall figures.",
      "Another key, related, element seems to be differences in the measurement of services trade - things such as banking and finance - as opposed to physical goods.",
      "But the bottom line is there is still a degree of uncertainty about what precisely is driving the overall difference in the statistics and both agencies are trying to work it out.",
      "In the meantime, the UK government will doubtless be hoping President Trump prefers to use the US data, which shows America is selling more to the UK than it is buying - and will focus on the goods rather than services trade.",
      "If the president were to impose a blanket tariff on UK exports to the US it would affect around \u00a360bn of goods sent in 2023, according to the UK's figures.",
      "Pharmaceutical products accounted for \u00a38.8bn of the UK's goods exports to the US in that year, cars \u00a36.4bn and power generation machinery \u00a36.4bn.",
      "While the immediate impact of the tariffs would be to make the price of these imported goods for US firms and consumers higher, over time they could reduce American demand for them, which could have a negative impact on the UK firms exporting them.",
      "How else could the UK be affected?",
      "There are other ways in which Britain could be negatively affected by US tariffs on other countries.",
      "Slower growth in the global economy and, in particular, the EU - with which the UK still does around half of its trade - would impede the UK's growth prospects.",
      "If our trading partners were to fall into recession due to tariffs, analysts say they would cut interest rates and their currencies would drop in value making British exports to them more expensive.",
      "\"The US imposing tariffs on our other trading partners will still have a negative effect on the UK economy through its effect on supply chains and the exchange rate,\" said Ahmet Kaya, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR).",
      "Niesr has estimated that the 25% tariffs the US has threatened to impose on Mexico and Canada could reduce UK GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points in 2025.",
      "Some economists warn exports - such as Chinese-made steel - that might get diverted from the US markets due to the new tariffs, could be sold at below the cost of production, or \"dumped\" in UK markets, which might have a negative impact on the sales of UK steel producers.",
      "Some analysts say higher US interest rates as a result of the tariffs could also spill over to UK borrowing markets.",
      "One of the reasons UK government borrowing costs, or Gilt yields, temporarily spiked upwards in January, was because American government bond yields had also risen.",
      "\"The main threat to the UK economy from Trump's tariffs may well be the spillover from higher US interest rates, rather than tariffs themselves,\" says the economist Julian Jessop.",
      "\"US and UK government bond yields are now moving in lockstep again. If the Fed [US central bank] is more reluctant to cut US rates, as seems likely, borrowing costs will be higher for longer in the UK as well.\"",
      "Higher borrowing costs could slow the UK economy and also put pressure on the UK government to cut public spending or raise taxes in order to keep within its chosen borrowing rules.",

      "Last-minute agreements with the leaders of Mexico and Canada have suspended for a month a tit-for-tat trade war in North America.",
      "The three trade partners have deeply integrated economies and supply chains, with an estimated $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) worth of manufactured goods crossing the borders daily.",
      "Trump says he wants to protect American industry, but many economists warn such duties could lead to prices rising for consumers in the US.",
      "That's because tariffs are paid by the domestic company importing the goods, who may choose to pass the cost on to customers directly, or to reduce imports, which would mean fewer products available.",
      "So what could get more expensive if Trump's tariffs do eventually go ahead?",
      "Cars",
      "Cars would probably go up in price - by about $3,000 according to TD Economics.",
      "That's because parts cross the US, Canadian and Mexican borders multiple times before a vehicle is assembled.",

      "Modelo became the number one beer brand in the US in 2023, and remains in the top spot, for now.",
      "It's more complex when it comes to spirits. The sector has been largely free of tariffs since the 1990s. Industry bodies from the US, Canada and Mexico issued a joint statement in advance of the tariffs being announced saying they were \"deeply concerned\".",
      "They say that certain brands, such as Bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, tequila and Canadian whisky are \"recognized as distinctive products and can only be produced in their designated countries\".",
      "So given the production of these drinks cannot simply be moved, supplies might be impacted, leading to price rises. The trade bodies also highlighted that many companies own different spirit brands in all three countries.",

      "While 25% has been slapped on Canadian goods imported to the US, its energy faces a lower 10% tariff.",
      "Now the US doesn't have a shortage of oil, but the type its refineries are designed to process means it depends on so-called \"heavier\" - i.e. thicker - crude oil from mostly Canada and some from Mexico.",
      "\"Many refineries need heavier crude oil to maximize flexibility of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel production,\" according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.",
      "That means if Canada decided in retaliation to any US tariffs to reduce crude oil exports, that could lead to prices rising at the petrol pumps.",
      "Avocados",
      "One food import that American consumers could see a significant price increase in is avocados. Grown primarily in Mexico due to its warm, humid climate, Mexican avocados make up nearly 90% of the US avocado market each year.",
      "However, if tariffs come into force, the US Agriculture Department has warned that the cost of avocados - along with popular avocado-based dishes like guacamole - could surge, especially by Super Bowl Sunday on 9 February.",
      "What about goods in Canada?",
      "Before Trump's agreement with Justin Trudeau to pause tariffs was announced on Monday, Canada had threatened retaliatory import taxes.",
      "An initial C$30bn tranche had been due to begin on Tuesday - meaning prices would have probably increased for consumers north of the border as well.",
      "Ottawa had released a list of all the US imports that would have immediately been targeted with matching 25% tariffs. They included grocery store staples, like oranges - a produce that Canada cannot grow in abundance due to its cooler climate.",
      "Alcohol originating from the US would also be harder for Canadians to find. Provinces like Ontario, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia said they would pull all American booze off their shelves starting on Tuesday.",
      "Any US alcohol - including beer and wine - that Canadians could find would likely see a price increase, as it's on the menu for retaliatory tariffs.",

      "Failure to secure approval will see Thames edge closer to a temporary nationalisation, which could cost the government some \u00a32bn a year.",
      "The company is still considering whether to appeal against a decision by the water industry regulator Ofwat to increase bills by 35% above inflation over the next five years \u2013 short of the 53% increase it applied for.",
      "Thames Water has been struggling for some time and has been heavily criticised over its performance following a series of sewage discharges and leaks.",
      "The dire state of the company's finances emerged about 18 months ago when it began a search for funding to avoid collapse.",
      "The Thames fiasco is a combination of poor historical regulation, greedy shareholders, climate change and management failure. Its debt pile is currently about \u00a317bn.",
      "But regardless of what happens to the company in the future, water supplies to households will continue as normal.",
      "In the latest bid to survive, lenders have offered Thames a further loan of up to \u00a33bn in two instalments.",
      "The first payment is to get it through to the autumn, and a second is to be used if the company decides to appeal against Ofwat's 35% bill rise to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) - a process that could take up to a year.",
      "The company has until 18 February to launch an appeal to the CMA.",
      "Why is Thames Water in so much trouble?",
      "The water industry is in crisis. Can it be fixed?",
      "Investment bank Rothschild is also soliciting bids to take over the company and inject much-needed funds.",
      "The court hearing on Monday is scheduled for four days with a possible extension as a much smaller group of lenders is challenging the terms of the lifeline and proposing an alternative.",
      "Although Thames will not collapse immediately if the deal is not approved by the judge, insiders have acknowledged that the company will move a step closer to temporary nationalisation \u2013 a so-called Special Administration Regime \u2013 if it fails.",
      "The government has already sounded out a number of consultancies to take that on if the situation arises.",
      "The company has been keen to stress that whatever happens, its services to 16 million customers would continue uninterrupted, but big questions about the future of Thames and other key infrastructure providers have been thrown up.",
      "Some argue that Thames should be allowed to go bust and have the government take over the company due to it being the architect of its own misfortune. Previous owners loaded the company with debt, took out big dividends and paid executives handsomely. Caving in to its demands for customers to pay more now for a failing service would be a gross injustice.",
      "Others say that poor regulation has allowed this mess. Bills were kept too low for too long which hampered investment in the aging infrastructure that is now being overwhelmed by a wetter climate. Ofwat is fighting yesterday's battle and making things worse by imposing fines of tens of millions of pounds for failures, thus further depriving the company of the funds to fix the very things it is being fined for.",
      "What Thames and ministers both agree on is that neither want this sprawling company on the government's books. Consultancy Teneo has predicted a temporary nationalisation would cost up to \u00a32bn a year.",
      "However, a wider, perhaps more important argument made by some is that the failure of Thames as a private company would send an unhelpful message to the international investors that Chancellor Rachel Reeves hopes will invest hundreds of billions in UK airports, wind farms, rail links and everything else on her long shopping list of growth-boosting projects.",
      "Sources close to the company and its creditors argue that we cannot agonise over and regulate for past mistakes. We are where we are - between a rock and a hard place. Carve out a special deal for Thames - or risk its collapse.",
      "Thames has just over two weeks to appeal to the CMA to bump up the bills it's allowed to charge. It's not without risk - the CMA could revise them down.",
      "Last week, the chair of the CMA was forced out by ministers unimpressed by the regulator's focus on growth. Thames says it needs higher bills to invest \u00a320bn over the next five years. It will be an interesting test case for the new chair."

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has imposed new tariffs on goods entering the US from Canada, Mexico and China.",
      "The US president signed an executive order putting a 25% tariff - or tax on imports - on all goods coming from Canada and Mexico, to get both countries to crack down on illegal immigration and drug trafficking.",
      "Goods coming from China will also be hit with a 10% tariff \"above any additional tariffs\" until it cuts fentanyl smuggling. He has already pledged to target the country with a 60% rate, and has mulled a 200% tax on some car imports.",
      "Tariffs are a central part of Trump's economic vision - he sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue.",
      "During his election campaign, he told voters that the taxes were \"not going to be a cost to you, it\u2019s a cost to another country\".",

      "China, Canada and Mexico vow swift response to Trump tariffs",
      "How world responds to Trump's tariffs is what matters next",
      "How do tariffs work?",
      "In practical terms, a tariff is a domestic tax levied on goods as they enter the country, proportional to the value of the import.",
      "So a car imported to the US with a value of $50,000 (\u00a338,000) subject to a 25% tariff, would face a $12,500 charge.",
      "The charge is physically paid by the domestic company that imports the goods, not the foreign company that exports them.",
      "So, in that sense, it is a straightforward tax paid by domestic US firms to the US government.",
      "Over the course of 2023, the US imported around $3.1tn of goods, equivalent to around 11% of US GDP.",
      "And tariffs imposed on those imports brought in $80bn in that year, around 2% of total US tax revenues.",
      "The question of where the final \u201ceconomic\u201d burden of tariffs falls, as opposed to the upfront bill, is more complicated.",
      "If the US importing firm passes on the cost of the tariff to the person buying the product in the US in the form of higher retail prices, it would be the US consumer that bears the economic burden.",
      "If the US importing firm absorbs the cost of the tariff itself and doesn\u2019t pass it on, then that firm is said to bear the economic burden in the form of lower profits than it would otherwise have enjoyed.",
      "'Is it for a day or four years?' Tariff uncertainty spooks small businesses",
      "Trump's tariffs hit China hard before - this time, it's ready",
      "Alternatively, it is possible that foreign exporters might have to lower their wholesale prices by the value of the tariff in order to retain their US customers.",
      "In that scenario, the exporting firm would bear the economic burden of the tariff in the form of lower profits.",
      "All three scenarios are theoretically possible.",
      "But economic studies of the impact of the new tariffs that Trump imposed in his first term of office between 2017 and 2020 suggest most of the economic burden was ultimately borne by US consumers.",
      "A survey by the University of Chicago in September 2024 asked a group of respected economists whether they agreed with the statement that \"imposing tariffs results in a substantial portion of the tariffs being borne by consumers of the country that enacts the tariffs, through price increases\". Only 2% disagreed.",
      "Raising prices",
      "Let\u2019s use a concrete example.",
      "Trump imposed a 50% tariff on imports of washing machines in 2018.",
      "Researchers estimate the value of washing machines jumped by around 12% as a direct consequence, equivalent to $86 per unit, and that US consumers paid around $1.5bn extra a year in total for these products.",
      "There is no reason to believe the results of even higher import tariffs from a future Trump administration would be any different in terms of where the economic burden would fall.",
      "The non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics has estimated Trump\u2019s new proposed tariffs would lower the incomes of Americans, with the impact ranging from around 4% for the poorest fifth to around 2% for the wealthiest fifth.",
      "A typical household in the middle of the US income distribution, the think tank estimates, would lose around $1,700 each year.",
      "The left-of-centre think tank Centre for American Progress, using a different methodology, has an estimate of a $2,500 to $3,900 loss for a middle-income family.",
      "Various researchers have also warned that another major round of tariffs from the US would risk another spike in domestic inflation.",
      "Impact on jobs",
      "Yet Trump has used another economic justification for his tariffs: that they protect and create US domestic jobs.",
      "\u201cUnder my plan, American workers will no longer be worried about losing your jobs to foreign nations, instead, foreign nations will be worried about losing their jobs to America,\" he said on the campaign trail.",
      "The political context for Trump\u2019s tariffs was longstanding concern about the loss of US manufacturing jobs to countries with lower labour costs, particularly after the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with Mexico in 1994 and the entry of China into the World Trade Organisation in 2001.",
      "In January 1994, when Nafta came into effect, the US had just under 17 million manufacturing jobs. By 2016, this had declined to around 12 million.",
      "Yet economists say it is misleading to attribute this decline to trade, arguing that growing levels of automation are also an important factor.",
      "And researchers who studied the impact of Trump\u2019s first-term tariffs found no substantial positive effects on overall employment in US industrial sectors that were protected.",
      "Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imported steel in 2018 to protect US producers.",
      "By 2020, total employment in the US steel sector was 80,000, still lower than the 84,000 it had been in 2018.",
      "It is theoretically possible that employment might have dropped even further without the Trump steel tariffs but detailed economic studies of their impact on US steel still showed no positive employment impact.",
      "And economists have also found evidence suggesting that, because the domestic price of steel rose after the tariffs were imposed, employment in some other US manufacturing sectors, which relied on steel as an input - including the agricultural machinery manufacturer Deere & Co - was lower than it otherwise would have been.",
      "Impact on trade deficit",
      "Trump has criticised America's trade deficit, which is the difference between the value of all the things the country imports and the value of its exports in a given year.",
      "\u201cTrade deficits hurt the economy very badly,\u201d he has said.",
      "In 2016, just before Trump took office, the total goods and services deficit was $480bn, around 2.5% of US GDP. By 2020, it had grown to $653bn, around 3% of GDP, despite his tariffs.",
      "Part of the explanation, according to economists, is that Trump\u2019s tariffs increased the international relative value of the US dollar (by automatically reducing demand for foreign currencies in international trade) and that this made the products of US exporters less competitive globally.",
      "Another factor behind this failure to close the trade deficit is the fact that tariffs, in a globalised economy with multinational companies, can sometimes be bypassed.",
      "For example, the Trump administration imposed 30% tariffs on Chinese imported solar panels in 2018.",
      "The US Commerce Department presented evidence in 2023 that Chinese solar panel manufacturers had shifted their assembly operations to countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam and then sent the finished products to the US from those countries, effectively evading the tariffs.",
      "There are some economists who support Trump\u2019s tariff plans as a way to boost US industry, such as Jeff Ferry of the Coalition for A Prosperous America, a domestic lobby group, but they are a small minority of the profession.",
      "Oren Cass, the director of the conservative think tank American Compass, has argued tariffs can incentivise firms to keep more of their manufacturing operations in America, which he argues has national defence and supply chain security benefits.",
      "And the Biden/Harris administration, while sharply criticising Trump\u2019s proposed extension of tariffs, kept in place many of the ones he implemented after 2018.",
      "It also imposed new tariffs on imports of things like electric vehicles from China, justifying them on the grounds of national security, US industrial policy and unfair domestic subsidies from Beijing.",

      "\"I think once upon a time there was an element of pretentiousness to number plates, which I think is gone, because you can pick up a number plate as cheap as \u00a325 right up to hundreds of thousands,\" he says.",
      "\"So I think the market is just so much more accessible to everybody.\"",
      "Neal Bircher, who describes himself as a \"number plates nerd\", has been collecting them his entire adult life and is in the process of writing a book on the subject.",
      "As well as a current collection of about 220, most of which are for sale, Neal has plates representing his first and second names, as well GL05 for Gloucestershire, the county where he was born.",
      "He says in the distant past the DVLA had seen personalised plates as an inconvenience, but in the 1990s changed its mind and chose to engage with the trade, making its vast pool of unused registrations available to the public.",
      "The DVLA figures show transactions peaking in 2021, which Neal puts down to the lifestyle changes brought about by Covid.",
      "\"Presumably it was due to many people having time on their hands and spare money that they weren't spending on commuting, socialising and holidays,\" he says.",
      "\"The momentum continued throughout the Covid period and even today, interest has only eased off a little.\"",
      "But, despite private plates' popularity, Neal warns it isn't always easy to make money from them.",
      "\"Plenty of people dabble,\" he says.",
      "\"I would urge anyone to go in with a little bit of caution, because I've seen many examples of people thinking 'gosh, this is easy' and then buy a hoard of plates and maybe they're not all saleable.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 23:11:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Retaliatory taxes against the US by other nations could lead global trade into uncharted territory.",
    "story": [
      "It was not a bluff, the tariffs are here - and this is just the opening salvo from the Oval Office.",
      "The world trading system has not been here before. A slide towards a wider trade conflict is very much on the cards, as President Trump prepares similar tariffs firstly against Europe, and then at a lower level universally.",
      "But what matters as much as the actions the US takes, is how the rest of the world responds.",
      "That, in turn, requires a judgement about what the president is actually trying to achieve.",
      "Trump regularly changes his rationale for tariffs - either to coerce diplomatic change, to deal with trade imbalances or to raise significant revenues.",
      "These policy objectives cannot all be achieved simultaneously.",
      "For example, learning from the experience of Trump's first term \"China deal\", Western diplomats have been scrambling to find lists of US goods they might buy more of, in order to give the White House some wins.",
      "Europe could say it is increasing its purchases of US shipments of liquefied natural gas, or arms, or specialised magnets for wind farms.",
      "It doesn't really matter if these trends were already in train, as long as the US president can be allowed to chalk up a \"win\".",
      "But is changing trade deficit numbers really the aim here?",
      "Officially, the rationale for Trump's move is punishment for the trade in the synthetic opioid fentanyl, but that is widely seen as a legal pretext for \"emergency\" action that would normally require a congressional decision.",
      "Canada has signalled it will take a robust approach to Trump, best articulated by the contender to be the country's next prime minister, Mark Carney.",
      "\"We will retaliate \u2026 dollar for dollar\" he told the BBC, ridiculing the fentanyl rationale and saying Canada would \"stand up to a bully\".",
      "This is significant whether or not Carney succeeds Justin Trudeau and ends up chairing the G7, which is the group of the world's seven largest so-called \"advanced\" economies.",
      "As a former governor of the Bank of England, Carney witnessed Trump on the world stage at G20 and G7 meetings first hand and has clearly concluded that the US leader only respects strength.",
      "He had a coded warning for any nation seeking to stay quiet and not catch the eye of the president: \"Good luck.\"",
      "In recent conversations I have had with European trade negotiators, they have stressed cooperation and partnership, as well as deals with the US. When asked, they avoided directly criticising even the extraordinary suggestion of using tariffs against Nato ally Denmark over the fate of Greenland.",
      "The real question here is whether the rest of the world, even tacitly, coordinates retaliatory tariffs on, for example, high profile political supporters of President Trump, such as Elon Musk, which is a typical feature of previous smaller disputes.",
      "Tesla, the electric vehicle maker led by Musk, last week warned on the impact of tit-for-tat tariffs.",
      "All of this would be aimed at making the rival courts around the Oval Office, and interests in Congress, assert their concerns about the impact on US factories' global exports.",
      "This is all before the impact on US domestic prices.",
      "This could also come, more circuitously, through the application of a planned carbon trade tax in various jurisdictions.",
      "Exactly how this plays out depends on perceptions of just how powerful the US remains.",
      "Some nations may conclude that these days, there are other options in the world.",
      "With tariffs threats being sprayed in multiple directions every day, the world is in uncharted territory.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 00:00:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The Microsoft co-founder says he enjoys giving away his fortune and it won't leave his kids poor.",
    "story": [
      "It's towards the end of our interview that Bill Gates reveals new numbers on how much his charitable Foundation has now spent in its efforts to combat preventable diseases and reduce poverty.",
      "\"I've given over 100 billion,\" he says, \"but I still have more to give.\"",
      "That's dollars, just to clarify, worth about \u00a380bn.",
      "It's roughly equivalent to the size of the Bulgarian economy or the cost of building the whole HS2 line.",
      "But to put it in context, it's also around the same as just one year of Tesla sales. (Tesla owner Elon Musk is now the richest man on the planet, a position Gates held for many years.)",
      "The co-founder of Microsoft and his fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett are combining their billions through the Gates Foundation he originally set up with his now ex-wife Melinda.",
      "Gates says philanthropy was instilled in him early on. His mother regularly told him \"with wealth came the responsibility to give it away\".",
      "His Foundation's 25th anniversary is in May, and Gates exclusively revealed the $100bn figure to the BBC.",
      "He tells me, for his part, he enjoys giving his money away (and around $60 billion of his fortune has gone into the Foundation so far).",
      "When it comes to his day-to-day lifestyle, he doesn't actually notice the difference: \"I made no personal sacrifice. I didn't order less hamburgers or less movies.\" He can also, of course, still afford his private jet and his various huge houses.",
      "He plans to give away \"the vast majority\" of his fortune, but tells me he has talked \"a lot\" with his three children about what might be the right amount to leave them.",
      "Will they be poor after he's gone? I ask him. \"They will not,\" he replies with a quick smile, adding \"in absolute, they'll do well, in percentage terms it's not a gigantic number\".",
      "Gates is a maths guy and it shows. At Lakeside School in Seattle, in eighth grade, he competed in a four-state regional maths exam and did so well that, at 13, he was one of the best high school maths students of any age in the region.",
      "Maths terminology comes second nature to him. But to translate, if you're worth $160bn, which Bloomberg's Billionaires Index claims he is, even leaving your children a tiny percentage of your fortune still makes them very rich.",
      "I'm with one of only 15 people on the planet who are centibillionaires (worth more than $100bn), according to Bloomberg. We're in his childhood home in Seattle, a mid-century modern four-bedroom house set into a hill, and we're meeting because he's written a memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, focusing on his early life.",
      "I want to find out what shaped a challenging, obsessive child who didn't fit the norm into one of the tech pioneers of our age.",
      "He's brought along his sisters, Kristi and Libby, and all three excitedly tour the home where they grew up. They haven't been back in some years and the current owners have refurbished (fortunately, the Gates siblings seem to approve of the changes).",
      "But it's bringing back memories including, as they walk into the kitchen, of the now-long-gone intercom system between rooms beloved by their mother. She used it to \"sing to us in the morning\", Gates tells me, to get them out of their bedrooms for breakfast.",
      "Mary Gates also set their watches and clocks eight minutes fast so the family would work to her time. Her son often rebelled at her efforts to improve him, but now tells me \"the crucible of my ambition was warmed through that relationship\".",
      "He puts his competitive spirit down to his grandmother \"Gami\", who was often with the family in this house and who taught him to outsmart the competition early on with games of cards.",
      "I follow him down the wooden stairs as he heads off to find his old childhood bedroom in the basement. It's a neat guest room now, but young Bill spent hours, even days, in here \"thinking\", as his sisters put it.",
      "At one point, his mum was so fed up with the mess that she confiscated any item of clothing she found on the floor and charged her stubborn son 25 cents to buy it back. \"I started wearing fewer clothes,\" he says.",
      "By this time, he was hooked on coding and, with some tech-savvy school friends, had been given access to a local firm's one computer in return for reporting any problems. Obsessed with learning to program in those nascent days of the tech revolution, he would sneak out at night through his bedroom window without his parents knowing to get more computer time.",
      "\"Do you think you could do it now?\" I ask.",
      "He starts unwinding the catch and opens the window. \"It's not that hard,\" he says with a smile as he climbs up and out. \"It's not hard at all.\"",
      "There is a famous early clip of Gates in which a TV presenter asks him if it's true he can jump over a chair from a standing position. He does it right there in the studio. I'm in the Gates childhood bedroom for something that feels like \"a moment\". The guy's nearly 70. But he's still game.",
      "He seems at ease - and it isn't just because we're in a familiar environment. In the memoir, he's revealed publicly for the first time that he thinks if he were growing up today, he'd probably be diagnosed on the autism spectrum.",
      "The only time I met him before was in 2012. He barely looked me in the eye as we did a quick interview about his goal to protect children from life-threatening diseases. There was certainly no pre-interview small talk. I wondered after our interaction whether he was on the spectrum.",
      "The book lays it out: his ability to hyperfocus on subjects he was interested in; his obsessive nature; his lack of social awareness.",
      "He says at elementary school he turned in a 177-page report on Delaware, having written off for brochures about the state, even sending stamped addressed envelopes to local companies asking for their annual reports. He was 11.",
      "His sisters tell me they knew he was different. Kristi, who's older, says she felt protective of him. \"He was not a normal kid\u2026 he would sit in his room and chew pencils down to the lead,\" she said.",
      "They're obviously close. Libby, a therapist, tells me she wasn't surprised to hear he believes he is on the spectrum. \"The surprise was more his willingness to say 'this might be the case',\" she says.",
      "Gates says he hasn't had a formal diagnosis and doesn't plan to. \"The positive characteristics for my career have been more beneficial than the deficits have been a problem for me,\" he says.",
      "He thinks neurodiversity is \"certainly\" over-represented in Silicon Valley because \"learning something in great depth at a young age - that helps you in certain complex subjects\".",
      "Elon Musk has also said he is on the spectrum, referencing Asperger's syndrome. The Tesla, X and SpaceX billionaire is famously courting Donald Trump, as are the other modern-day tech bros, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos among other Silicon Valley attendees at Trump's inauguration.",
      "Gates tells me although \"you can be cynical\" about their motives, he too reached out to the president. They had a three-hour dinner on 27 December \"because he's making decisions about global health and how we help poor countries, which is a big focus of mine now\".",
      "I ask Gates, himself a target of some pretty wild conspiracy theories, what he thinks of the decision taken by Zuckerberg after Trump's election to dump fact-checking in the US on his sites. Gates tells me he's not \"that impressed\" by how governments or private companies are navigating the boundaries between free speech and truth.",
      "\"I don't personally know how you draw that line, but I'm worried that we're not handling that as well as we should,\" he says.",
      "He also thinks children should be protected from social media, telling me there's a \"good chance\" that banning under-16s, as Australia is doing, is \"a smart thing\".",
      "Gates tells me \"social networking, even more than video gaming, can absorb your time and make you worry about other people approving you\" so we have to be \"very careful how it gets used\".",
      "As for Trump's first pick for US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who claims he isn't anti-vaccination but has promoted debunked claims about vaccines, Gates makes short shrift. He tells me RFK Jr is \"misleading people\".",
      "The Bill Gates origin story isn't rags to riches. His dad was a lawyer, money wasn't tight, although the decision to send their son to private school to try to motivate him was \"a stretch, even on my father's salary\".",
      "If they hadn't, we might never have heard of Bill Gates.",
      "He first got access to an early mainframe computer via a teletype machine at the school, after the mothers held a jumble sale to raise the money. The teachers couldn't figure it out, but four students were on it day and night. \"We got to use computers when almost nobody else did,\" he says.",
      "Much later, he would set up Microsoft with one of those school friends, Paul Allen. Another, Kent Evans, Gates' best friend, would die tragically age 17 in a climbing accident. As we walk around Lakeside School, we pass the chapel where they held his funeral and where Gates remembers crying on the steps.",
      "Together, they'd had big plans. When they weren't on computers, they were reading biographies to work out what factors made people successful.",
      "Now Gates has written his own. His philosophy? \"Much of who you are was there from the start.\"",

    "summary": "Entrepreneurs in the US, Mexico and Canada worry that even a short trade war could push up prices and cost jobs.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump's talk of applying new tariffs to goods from America's biggest trade partners has sparked months of uncertainty for business owners.",
      "On Saturday, the president made good on his threats, ordering a new 25% tax on shipments from Mexico and Canada and raising existing tariffs on goods from China by 10%.",
      "But that has not stopped the questions.",
      "\"Is it for a day, is it a political flex or is it something that will last for four years?\" asked Nicolas Palazzi, the founder of Brooklyn-based PM Spirits. He runs a 21-person business that imports and sells wine and spirits, about 20% of which come from Mexico.",
      "Trump's orders set in motion threats that the president has discussed for months, striking at shipments from America's top three trade partners, which together account for more than 40% of the roughly $3tn goods the US imports each year.",
      "Canadian oil and other \"energy resources\" will face a lower 10% rate. But otherwise, there will be no exceptions, the White House said.",
      "Trump said the tariffs were intended to hold Canada and Mexico accountable for promises to address illegal immigration and drug trafficking.",
      "The measures go into effect on 4 February and are to remain in place \"until the crisis is alleviated,\" according to the orders.",
      "If the plans were not a surprise, they still presented a potentially stunning blow to many businesses, especially for those in North America. The three countries have become tightly linked economically after decades of free trade under a treaty signed in the 1990s, known then as Nafta and updated and renamed under the Trump administration to USMCA.",
      "The growth of mezcal in the US, brought in by businesses like Palazzi's, has been part of this shift.",
      "Since 2003, consumption of tequila and mezcal has roughly tripled, increasing at a rate of more than 7% each year, according to Distilled Spirits Council, a trade group.",
      "Overall since the 1990s, trade in spirits between the US and Mexico has surged by more than 4,000% percent, said the organisation, which issued a statement after the president's announcement warning that the tariffs would \"significantly harm all three countries\".",
      "For months, Palazzi has been fielding nervous questions from his suppliers in Mexico, who are typically small, family owned businesses and may not survive if the tariffs are prolonged.",
      "If it sticks, he said the 25% tax on the bottles of mezcal, tequila and rum he brings in will push up prices - and sales will drop.",
      "\"Definitely this is going to impact the business negatively. But can you really plan? No,\" he said. \"Our strategy is roll-with-the-punches, wait and see and adapt to whatever craziness is going to unfold.\"",
      "Economists say the hit from the tariffs could push the economies of Mexico and Canada into recession.",
      "Ahead of the announcement, Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses, described the looming tariffs from the US, and expected retaliation, as \"existential\" for many of his members.",
      "\"Look, we get that the government has got to respond in some fashion \u2026. But at the same time we urge the government to use caution,\" he said, comparing tariffs on imports to chemotherapy: \"It poisons your own people in order to try and fight the disease.\"",
      "\"It's going to have an effect everywhere,\" said Sophie Avernin, director of De Grandes Vi\u00f1edos de Francia in Mexico, noting that many Americans own Mexican alcohol brands and Modelo beer is actually owned by a Belgian company.",
      "Trump, who has embraced tariffs as a tool to address issues far removed from trade, has dismissed concerns about any collateral damage to the economy in the US.",
      "But analysts have warned the measures will weigh on growth, raise prices and cost the economy jobs - roughly 286,000, according to estimates by the Tax Foundation, not including retaliation.",
      "Those in the alcohol business said the industry had already been struggling to emerge from the shadow of the pandemic and its after-shocks, including inflation, which has prompted many Americans to cut back on dining out and drinking.",
      "Smaller firms, who typically have less financial cushion and ability to swallow a sudden 25% jump in cost, will bear the brunt of the disruption.",
      "\"I'm pretty frustrated,\" said California-based importer Ben Scott, whose nine-person business Pueblo de Sabor brings in brands from Mexico such as Mal Bien and Lalocura.",
      "\"There's just a huge cost that's going to affect so many people in ways other than they're paying a couple bucks more for a cocktail, which doesn't sound like a tragedy.\"",
      "Fred Sanchez has spent years pushing to expand his business, Bad Hombre Importing, a small California-based importer and distributor of Mexican agave-based spirits like Agua del Sol, and was recently working on deals in New York and Illinois.",
      "But his potential partners started hesitating as Trump's tariff talk ramped up last year.",
      "Now, instead of expanding, he is contemplating selling off his stock of liquor and possibly shutting down. He said he had little capacity to absorb the jump in costs and saw little scope for raising prices in the current economy.",
      "\"25% is just not something that we can realistically pass onto the consumer,\" he said.",
      "Sanchez said he believed that Trump might be using tariffs as a negotiating tactic, and the tax could be short-lived. Still, for his business, damage is already done.",

    "story": [
      "Sainsbury's and Morrisons are displaying adverts for tobacco products in their stores which Trading Standards says are against the law.",
      "Video screens and posters promote devices that deliver nicotine by heating tobacco rather than burning it.",
      "The two supermarkets say they believe the laws banning tobacco advertising do not apply to the devices.",
      "Heated tobacco is less harmful than cigarettes, but experts say it is probably more harmful than vapes, and less effective at helping smokers quit.",
      "Tobacco adverts were banned in 2002. But if you walk into a Sainsbury's or a Morrisons you may well see adverts for iQos, a device that uses an electric current to heat tobacco.",
      "Some are on flashing video screens in places where they can easily be seen by children. The BBC has also seen adverts in Morrisons for a similar device called Ploom.",
      "Heated tobacco is different from vapes, which contain nicotine but no tobacco, and they are much less popular. But tobacco companies are keen to promote it as a new revenue stream to replace dwindling cigarette sales.",
      "The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI), which represents local authority trading standards teams, says the ads are \"prohibited\" by the 2002 law.",
      "CTSI says the issue has never been tested in court, so it cannot say conclusively that running them is illegal.",
      "\"The only people who can definitively test it are the courts. Now the courts are chocka. Trading Standards is very stretched, and I think that's probably the reason why you're seeing more and more of these ads,\" Kate Pike, lead officer for tobacco and vaping at CTSI, told the BBC.",
      "\"It's taking the mick, is my view.\"",

      "Morrisons cited the same argument. \"On that basis, we are comfortable that it is legal for heated tobacco products to be advertised in store,\" it said.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 01:41:46 GMT",
    "summary": "The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Five years ago, on 31 January 2020, the UK left the European Union.",
      "On that day, Great Britain severed the political ties it had held for 47 years, but stayed inside the EU single market and customs union for a further 11 months to keep trade flowing.",
      "Northern Ireland had a separate arrangement.",
      "Brexit was hugely divisive, both politically and socially, dominating political debate and with arguments about its impacts raging for years.",
      "Five years on from the day Britain formally left the EU, BBC Verify has examined five important ways Brexit has affected Britain.",
      "1) Trade",
      "Economists and analysts generally assess the impact of leaving the EU single market and customs union on 1 Jan 2021 on the UK's goods trade as having been negative.",
      "This is despite the fact that the UK negotiated a free trade deal with the EU and avoided tariffs - or taxes - being imposed on the import and export of goods.",
      "The negative impact comes from so-called \"non-tariff barriers\" - time consuming and sometimes complicated new paperwork that businesses have to fill out when importing and exporting to the EU.",
      "There is some disagreement about how negative the specific Brexit impact has been.",
      "Some recent studies suggest that UK goods exports are 30% lower than they would have been if we had not left the single market and customs union.",
      "Some suggest only a 6% reduction.",
      "We can't be certain because the results depend heavily on the method chosen by researchers for measuring the \"counterfactual\", i.e what would have happened to UK exports had the country stayed in the EU.",
      "One thing we can be reasonably confident of is that small UK firms appear to be more adversely affected than larger ones.",
      "They have been less able to cope with the new post-Brexit cross-border bureaucracy. That's supported by surveys of small firms.",
      "It's also clear UK services exports - such as advertising and management consulting - have done unexpectedly well since 2021.",
      "But the working assumption of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's independent official forecaster, is still that Brexit in the long-term will reduce exports and imports of goods and services by 15% relative to otherwise. It has held this view since 2016, including under the previous Government.",
      "And the OBR's other working assumption is that the fall in trade relative to otherwise will reduce the long-term size of the UK economy by around 4% relative to otherwise, equivalent to roughly \u00a3100bn in today's money.",
      "The OBR says it could revise both these assumptions based on new evidence and studies. The estimated negative economic impact could come down if the trade impact judged to be less severe. Yet there is no evidence, so far, to suggest that it will turn into a positive impact.",
      "After Brexit, the UK has been able to strike its own trade deals with other countries.",
      "There have been new trade deals with Australia and New Zealand and the government has been pursuing new agreements with the US and India.",
      "But their impact on the economy is judged by the government's own official impact assessments to be small relative to the negative impact on UK- EU trade.",
      "However, some economists argue there could still be potential longer term economic benefits for the UK from not having to follow EU laws and regulations affecting sectors such as Artificial Intelligence.",
      "2) Immigration",
      "Immigration was a key theme in the 2016 referendum campaign, centred on freedom of movement within the EU, under which UK and EU citizens could freely move to visit, study, work and live.",
      "There has been a big fall in EU immigration and EU net migration (immigration minus emigration) since the referendum and this accelerated after 2020 due to the end of freedom of movement.",
      "But there have been large increases in net migration from the rest of the world since 2020.",
      "A post-Brexit immigration system came into force in January 2021.",
      "Under this system, EU and non-EU citizens both need to get work visas in order to work in the UK (except Irish citizens, who can still live and work in the UK without a visa).",
      "The two main drivers of the increase in non-EU immigration since 2020 are work visas (especially in health and care) and international students and their dependents.",
      "UK universities started to recruit more non-EU overseas students as their financial situation deteriorated.",
      "The re-introduction of the right of overseas students to stay and work in Britain after graduation by Boris Johnson's government also made the UK more attractive to international students.",
      "Subsequent Conservative governments reduced the rights of people on work and student visas to bring dependents and those restrictions have been retained by Labour.",
      "3) Travel",
      "Freedom of movement ended with Brexit, also affecting tourists and business travellers.",
      "British passport holders can no longer use \"EU/EEA/CH\" lanes at EU border crossing points.",
      "People can still visit the EU as a tourist for 90 days in any 180 day period without requiring a visa, provided they have at least three months remaining on their passports at the time of their return.",
      "EU citizens can stay in the UK for up to six months without needing a visa.",
      "However, a bigger change in terms of travel is on the horizon.",
      "In 2025, the EU is planning to introduce a new electronic Entry Exit System (EES) - an automated IT system for registering travellers from non-EU countries.",
      "This will register the person's name, type of the travel document, biometric data (fingerprints and captured facial images) and the date and place of entry and exit.",
      "It will replace the manual stamping of passports. The impact of this is unclear, but some in the travel sector have expressed fears it could potentially add to border queues as people leave the UK.",
      "The EES was due to be introduced in November 2024 but was postponed until 2025, with no new date for implementation yet set.",
      "And six months after the introduction of EES, the EU says it will introduce a new European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS). UK citizens will have to obtain ETIAS clearance for travel to 30 European countries.",
      "ETIAS clearance will cost \u20ac7 (\u00a35.90) and be valid for up to three years or until someone's passport expires, whichever comes first. If people get a new passport, they need to get a new ETIAS travel authorisation.",
      "Meanwhile, the UK is introducing its equivalent to ETIAS for EU citizens from 2 April 2025 (though Irish citizens will be exempt). The UK permit - to be called an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - will cost \u00a316.",
      "4) Laws",
      "Legal sovereignty - the ability of the UK to make its own laws and not have to follow EU ones - was another prominent Brexit referendum campaign promise.",
      "To minimise disruption immediately following Brexit in 2020, the UK incorporated thousands of EU laws into UK law, becoming known as \"retained EU law\".",
      "According to the latest government count there were 6,901 individual pieces of retained EU law covering things like working time, equal pay, food labelling and environmental standards.",
      "The previous Conservative government initially set a deadline of the end of 2023 to axe these EU laws.",
      "But with so much legislation to consider there was concern there was not enough time to review all the laws properly.",
      "In May 2023 Kemi Badenoch - the Trade Secretary at the time - announced only 600 EU laws would be axed by the end of 2023, with another 500 financial services laws set to disappear later.",
      "Most were relatively obscure regulations and many of them had been superseded or become irrelevant.",
      "All other EU legislation was kept, though ministers reserved powers to change them in future.",
      "And the UK has changed some EU laws. For example, it banned the export of live animals from Great Britain for slaughter and fattening and changed EU laws on gene editing crops.",
      "Brexit has also given the UK more freedom in certain areas of tax law.",
      "EU member states are prohibited from charging VAT on education under an EU directive. Leaving the EU enabled Labour to impose VAT on private school fees.",
      "A zero rate of VAT on tampons and other sanitary products was introduced by the UK government in 2021. This would not have been possible in the EU as the EU VAT Directive at the time mandated a minimum 5% tax on all sanitary products. However, in April 2022 the EU's rules changed so the bloc also now allows a zero rate on sanitary products.",
      "5) Money",
      "The money the UK sent to the EU was a controversial theme in the 2016 referendum, particularly the Leave campaign's claim the UK sent \u00a3350m every week to Brussels.",
      "The UK's gross public sector contribution to the EU Budget in 2019-20, the final financial year before Brexit, was \u00a318.3bn, equivalent to around \u00a3352m per week, according to the Treasury.",
      "The UK continued paying into the EU Budget during the transition period but since 31 December 2020 it has not made these contributions.",
      "However, those EU Budgets contributions were always partially recycled to the UK via payments to British farmers under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and \"structural funding\" - development grants to support skills, employment and training in certain economically disadvantaged regions of the nation. These added up to \u00a35bn in 2019-20.",
      "Since the end of the transition period UK governments have replaced the CAP payments directly with taxpayer funds.",
      "Ministers have also replaced the EU structural funding grants, with the previous government rebranding them as \"a UK Shared Prosperity\" fund.",
      "The UK was also receiving a negotiated \"rebate\" on its EU Budget contributions of around \u00a34bn a year - money which never actually left the country,",
      "So the net fiscal benefit to the UK from not paying into the EU Budget is closer to to \u00a39bn per year, although this figure is inherently uncertain because we don't know what the UK's contribution to the EU Budget would otherwise have been.",
      "The UK has also still been paying the EU as part of the official Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and its financial settlement. The Treasury says the UK paid a net amount of \u00a314.9bn between 2021 and 2023, and estimated that from 2024 onwards it will have to pay another \u00a36.4bn, although spread over many years.",
      "Future payments under the withdrawal settlement are also uncertain in part because of fluctuating exchange rates.",
      "However, there are other ways the UK's finances remained connected with the EU, separate from the EU Budget and the Withdrawal Agreement.",
      "After Brexit took effect, the UK also initially stopped paying into the Horizon scheme, which funds pan-European scientific research.",
      "However, Britain rejoined Horizon in 2023 and is projected by the EU to pay in around \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32bn) per year on average to the EU budget for its participation, although historically the UK has been a net financial beneficiary from the scheme because of the large share of grants won by UK-based scientists.",
      "The future",
      "There are, of course, a large number of other Brexit impacts which we have not covered here, ranging from territorial fishing rights, to farming, to defence.

    "title": "Faisal Islam: The 'Iron Chancellor' will have to flex to get the growth she wants",
    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 11:00:14 GMT",
    "summary": "In choppy global seas, going for growth will require tricky navigation",
    "story": [
      "It has been a wild January for Rachel Reeves and frankly for economics in the UK and the world.",
      "When Labour swept to victory last summer, Reeves pledged she would be an \"iron\" chancellor, reining in public spending and improving the lives of working people through growing the economy. Without solid public finances, she argued, the government couldn't achieve any of its other aims.",
      "This month has tested that plan.",
      "It started off with a global bond market tantrum - UK borrowing costs hit their highest level for several years and the pound fell sharply.",
      "Some argued that Reeves's Budget decisions had made the UK more vulnerable to such shocks. The prime minister was forced to confirm Reeves had his backing after political opponents called for her resignation.",
      "The market turbulence sparked concerns that a verdict of sorts was being made on the chancellor.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this Parliament. That meant, the rise in global and UK debt interest costs would require some spending cuts.",
      "The message was sent out that the government, with its massive majority, could do and would do what it takes to keep to the self-imposed rules, which it said were \"non-negotiable\".",
      "The markets have now recovered all their negative moves. Short term and long term government borrowing costs are all lower than at the beginning of the year.",
      "While the \"gilt crisis\" hyperbole was overdone, there have been consequences.",
      "From doom to promises of a boom",
      "The chancellor sped up an already planned \"drumbeat\" of pro-growth measures, culminating in this week's speech. Reeves's counsel of doom and warnings about black holes and pain has been replaced by a promise of an investment boom.",
      "She has vowed a new runway at Heathrow, visas for those with AI and life science skills and said she would ease the non-dom ban to allow a more generous phase out of tax benefits.",
      "Alongside this are plans to make it easier to build, delays to new rules on banks and the ousting of the boss of the competition regulator, which shows she's serious on growth. As Meatloaf might have scripted for her: \"I would do anything for growth\".",
      "But Reeves's plans are not yet a fully fledged growth plan. Her announcements signal that she is willing to take a series of political hits to foster long term growth.",
      "The chancellor will deploy the near total executive power from her party's commons majority to flatten the sort of opposition that has prevented or critically delayed these sorts of plans in the past.",
      "Some outside advisers who support the chancellor say that stability is not enough, and nor is planning, and nor is deregulation.",
      "Reeves has not pledged any allocation of public money to these grand projects.",
      "Heathrow boss Thomas Woldbye sounded a little coy after plans for a third runway were confirmed, saying they would not spend more money on it unless they really believed it was going to happen.",
      "\"This will take years, it will take what I call Churchillian resolve and lots of ingenuity but we can trust a government that will be with us for many years to deliver this,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Reeves's UK growth mission",
      "Reeves is focusing on a very specific type of growth - increasing the supply of goods and services. She believes a lack of this supply side growth has held back the UK, and she is on a mission to remove barriers, and open new markets.",
      "For example, Reeves is very concerned about small businesses who have told her they have given up on exporting to the EU, because post Brexit it is now easier to export to the US.",
      "At a meeting last week, one business told the chancellor that exports to Europe meant for Christmas, had only just arrived.",
      "The problem is that while the chancellor awaits a long term growth spurt, she has prioritised stabilising public finances through significant tax rises.",
      "In April, employers will be hit with an increase in national insurance payments and a higher minimum wage. These costs could be passed on in price rises meaning inflation - already higher than target at 2.5%, could remain sticky.",
      "Reeves would have preferred employers to squeeze pay settlements rather than raise prices or cut staff.",
      "Retail and hospitality businesses using low wage labour will be most impacted by the bumper rise in minimum wages. Downing Street insiders acknowledge that many domestic business bosses are \"grumpy\" as they put it.",
      "The concern is whether the impact will show up in higher unemployment. At last October's Budget, the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted extra government spending would help boost the economy and bring unemployment down to 4% this year. Some outside forecasters now think it will top 5%.",
      "It is a critical few months for the animal spirits in the economy to reignite.",
      "How far will she go?",
      "But how far is Rachel Reeves willing to push this pro-growth agenda?",
      "Will she follow the US away from the decarbonisation path to benefit from cheaper hydrocarbon prices promised by President Trump? Will she accede to construction industry requests to import foreign workers to meet the target to build 1.5 million homes?",
      "Will she push the Brexit reset to remove all the barriers to UK-EU trade in food and farm products, and many goods too? Will she offer Britain to the global tech and pharma industries as a deregulatory haven from the EU and US respectively?",
      "Taken at face value, she will do most of this, with big political consequences. Take the Brexit reset. Cabinet ministers at The World Economic Forum were delighted with the tone of the EU's new trade chief Maros Sefcovic in his interview with me, saying he was open to Britain joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention (PEM).",
      "The arrangement allows for tariff-free trade of some goods from across dozens of countries in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.",
      "But if the UK demanded effective single market treatment in certain sectors, it would need to follow the EU rule book in those areas. There would be counter asks, such as extending EU fishing arrangements in UK waters, and some sort of youth cultural exchange scheme.",
      "The need for delicate diplomacy",
      "Push is coming to shove on these issues, and the question is whether the chancellor's pro growth agenda is the overwhelming factor in making decisions. I suspect it is.",
      "However, that approach will require delicate diplomacy in the middle of a potential goods tariff war. If Trump follows through on his threat of a universal tariff then the G7 could decide to coordinate retaliatory tariffs. Does the UK join in?",
      "What if the US decides it wants its allies to help contain China's tech ascendancy? What if Trump wants to deter the UK from rebuilding free-flowing trade with the EU?",
      "The sudden emergence of China's AI expertise via DeepSeek underlines how important it is to be nimble. There was only one mention of China in the government's big AI paper earlier this month - in Science Secretary Peter Kyle's foreword.",
      "The pharma industry is lobbying the government to quietly open the door for relocation of key top talent into the UK, concerned about the Trump / Robert F Kennedy Jr approach to medicines regulation. Our leading universities are saying that for the first time since Brexit, it's easier to recruit some of the very best international scientists who are not keen to bring up their families in Trump's America.",
      "Trump's decision to abandon Biden's green subsidies also levels the playing field for net zero investment here.",
      "After a tumultuous start to the year, with the US administration threatening different tariffs almost every day, and tech giant shares falling over concerns they've been overvalued in the light of China's AI app DeepSeek, the UK remains a safe haven for investors.",
      "The self declared iron chancellor remains very attached to stability. But zero growth is a form of stability too. In choppy global seas, going for growth is going to require some very tricky navigation - and it will make some big domestic political waves too.",

      "Sales of Apple iPhones dropped at the end of last year, as the tech firm's roll out of new artificial intelligence (AI) features was met with a lukewarm response.",
      "Chief executive Tim Cook said the new features helped to drive stronger sales in the countries where they were available, such as the US.",
      "But iPhone sales slipped about 1% overall compared with last year, to $69.1bn (\u00a355bn).",
      "The company is also contending with other challenges, including a sales drop in China and the possibility its US sales will be hit by tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump.",
      "He has called for tariffs of up to 60% on products made in China, where Apple does much of its manufacturing.",
      "But the timing and full scope of those plans, which would put a new tax on imports into the US, remains highly uncertain.",
      "Mr Cook told investors on Thursday the company was monitoring the situation.",
      "Apple has been gradually introducing AI features to its products, starting last year in the US.",
      "Investors have been hoping this will re-ignite sales, which have slowed as customers hold onto their phones and other products for longer.",
      "Mr Cook said Apple was expecting to push out the AI features to more languages in April.",
      "However, the features have not been without controversy. The AI's news roundup alerts came under fire earlier this month for making repeated mistakes in their summaries of news headlines - including ones from the BBC.",
      "The feature was eventually suspended following over a week of criticism.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr Cook said on Thursday Apple had seen a record number of purchases of new iPhones from people who already own older iPhones.",

It didn't stop the track's creator trying to nominate it for a Grammy award. And even though the artists were fake, it was still wildly popular.",
      "\"I do not think the use of generative AI for creative purposes should be banned, but I do think that generative AI for these purposes that is trained on people's work without permission should be banned,\" Mr Newton Rex adds. \"AI can be very powerful but let's build it ethically and fairly.\"",

    "summary": "The commodities giant went on trial in Switzerland over attempts to gain access to Angola's oil market.",
    "story": [
      "Switzerland's highest court has convicted the commodities trading giant Trafigura and one of its senior executives of bribery over payments made by the firm to gain access to Angola's lucrative oil market.",
      "In a landmark case, the court handed the company's British former chief operating officer Mike Wainwright, who has also competed as a racing driver, a 32-month jail sentence and fined the company $148m (\u00a3119m).",
      "This is the first time an entire company has been charged by Switzerland's highest court, and bribery convictions of senior staff are rare.",
      "Trafigura's lawyers said the company and Wainwright intended to appeal against the verdict, so the former executive was not jailed immediately.",
      "The case against Trafigura has had all the elements of a financial thriller: millions of dollars, shady middlemen and a chain of shell companies located in offshore havens like the Virgin Islands.",
      "Trafigura's strategy, the court heard, was to set up a complex payment web, through which an official with Angola's state oil company was paid almost $5m (\u00a34.02m; \u20ac4.81) between 2009 and 2011.",
      "Documents presented to the court by Swiss prosecutors showed payments authorised on Trafigura's own headed notepaper.",
      "The strategy appeared to work: over the next few years, the court heard, Angola signed contracts with Trafigura worth almost $144m (\u00a3115.93; \u20ac138.56).",
      "Trafigura, whose lawyers appeared bullish before the verdict, denied bribery. The company said its own compliance and anti-corruption measures had been independently assessed and found to be excellent.",
      "But the sheer weight of the evidence - which included dozens of documents, emails and memos - revealed a different picture: strict anti-corruption measures on paper but an intricate structure set up to evade those measures in reality. At the heart of it sat a middleman named \"Mr Non-Compliant\" in an anonymous Geneva office.",
      "The case will send a chill through commodity brokers worldwide but especially in Geneva, where Trafigura and many other commodity trading houses are headquartered.",
      "In an eerie coincidence, the night before the verdict was delivered, a fire broke out at the five star Hotel des Bergues - where, court documents showed, an Angolan official stayed at the expense of Trafigura in 2008.",
      "Swiss federal prosecutors hope the case will be a symbol that the old ways of doing business are finally over.",
      "They brought the charges to Switzerland's highest court, reserved for the worst crimes, such as terrorist offences.",
      "Trafigura now faces a large fine and Wainwright, who was in court for the verdict and denied the charges, was told he must serve at least one year of his 32 month sentence in jail.",

    "title": "Will a third runway at Heathrow help UK growth?",
    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 11:32:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce expansion plans but some question the short-term benefits.",
    "story": [
      "The expansion of Heathrow Airport has been backed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who is hoping investment in a third runway, along with a series of other transport projects, will drive economic growth in the UK.",
      "Reeves has said expansion of the UK's biggest airport is \"badly needed\" and could lead to 100,000 jobs.",
      "However opponents claim expanding the airport would lead to higher emissions and blight local communities with extra noise and pollution. Friends of the Earth has said it would be \"hugely irresponsible in the midst of a climate emergency\".",
      "So is a third runway at Heathrow the right way to bring an immediate boost to the economy in any case?",
      "In terms of actual spades in the ground at Heathrow, the short answer is no.",
      "A third runway has been on the cards for many years. It has also been kicked into the long grass on several occasions.",
      "The argument in favour has always been an economic one. Large airports create jobs, promote trade and bring in both business travellers and tourists.",
      "Heathrow currently handles \u00a3200bn worth of trade a year and - the airport's owner would argue - provides a vital avenue for exports, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "But Heathrow's infrastructure is straining at the seams.",
      "Last year, a record 83.9 million passengers passed through its terminals with its two runways handling around 1,300 landings and take-offs every day.",
      "Flights from the airport are currently capped at a maximum of 480,000 per year and in practical terms it has reached that limit.",
      "A third runway would potentially increase the number of flights permitted to 720,000.",
      "Expanding the airport would, in theory, provide an avenue for growth that simply isn't there at the moment.",
      "The construction project itself - the biggest privately-funded infrastructure scheme in Europe - would create thousands of jobs.",
      "But a third runway at Heathrow is unlikely to become a reality for many years.",
      "HS2 blew billions - here's how and why",
      "Reeves hints at support for Heathrow expansion",
      "Firstly, a formal planning process has to take place. This type of major infrastructure project would require a Development Consent Order and unless the government changes the system, that would take between 18 months and two years.",
      "Secondly, it is highly likely any decision in favour of a third runway would be subject to a judicial review.",
      "Expansion of Heathrow is highly controversial - opponents include environmental groups, local authorities as well as nearby residents, and this stage could take another year and a half.",
      "So even with favourable winds, it could take at least three years to get to the construction stage which is itself expected to take another six or seven years.",
      "In terms of what can be achieved sooner that could potentially create bankable short-term benefits, separate projects to expand Gatwick and Luton airports are well-advanced and could be signed off by the Transport Secretary within weeks.",
      "The real value of backing a third runway at Heathrow is the less tangible but no less important signal to investors about the UK's attitude towards major infrastructure projects, say supporters.",
      "The uncertainty over the construction of the HS2 high speed line under the previous Conservative government is widely believed to have undermined confidence in the country's ability to turn ambitious plans into reality.",
      "A strong commitment to Heathrow expansion might help to reverse that perception.",
      "With the plan itself expected to cost close to \u00a320bn, insiders say firm government support will be vital if it goes ahead.",
      "Although the project would be privately-funded, people close to the scheme warn that it could not proceed without close co-ordination with ministers - including changes to the policy framework that sets out how the costs of the investment can be recovered.",
      "For the chancellor herself, there could be a short-term benefit in throwing her weight behind airport expansion plans now.",
      "Some economists have argued that if additional growth can be factored into economic forecasts currently being prepared by the Office for Budget Responsibility, it might make it easier for her to meet self-imposed fiscal rules within this parliament.",
      "If not, then Reeves is likely to bump into her own \"iron\" fiscal rules to pay for day-to- day spending out of tax receipts by 2029 - meaning spending cuts or further tax rises.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 14:10:01 GMT",
    "summary": "The chancellor says expanding Heathrow would boost growth, but there is a lot of vocal opposition.",
    "story": [
      "The government has backed the expansion of Heathrow Airport after years of heated debate, saying it could create 100,000 jobs.",
      "The move, alongside potential confirmation of the expansion of other London airports including Gatwick and Luton, is likely to be met by fierce opposition.",
      "Critics say increasing air travel would make it much harder for the UK to meet its climate change commitments.",
      "However, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"a third runway is badly needed\", adding the government \"cannot duck the decision any longer\".",
      "How would Heathrow Airport be expanded?",
      "Heathrow is already the UK's busiest airport, serving more than 80 million travellers a year with its four passenger terminals and two runways.",
      "A third runway would mean demolishing hundreds of homes, diverting rivers, and rerouting the M25 motorway between junctions 14 and 15 through a tunnel under the new runway.",
      "The number of flights, currently capped at 480,000 a year, could go up to 720,000 - or nearly 2,000 a day on average.",
      "Heathrow told the BBC that it would eventually be able to serve up to 140 million passengers a year once the third runway is in operation.",
      "The airport's owners, who include Saudi Arabia and Qatar's sovereign wealth funds and private equity firm Ardian, said the costs of expansion would be met by charging airlines for use of the larger airport.",
      "But after years of wrangling over the original plans, the initial cost estimate of \u00a314bn will need to be revised.",
      "When could a third runway open?",
      "Even with government backing, the formal planning process could take up to two years.",
      "Any planning decision could then be subject to a judicial review, as well as needing to answer questions from opponents over environmental concerns.",
      "Local authorities and nearby residents will also have questions.",
      "After all that, construction is expected to take another six or seven years.",
      "Reeves has told the BBC she wants to see \"spades in the ground\" in the current Parliament and planes to start using the runway by 2035.",
      "Does Labour support a third runway?",
      "A third runway was first proposed by Gordon Brown's Labour government in 2009 but was only finally given the go-ahead by the Supreme Court in 2020.",
      "Several members of the current government - including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer - voted against a Heathrow expansion when in opposition.",
      "But Sir Keir recently told the BBC that the government has climate commitments, \"but growth is really important too\".",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"Any aviation expansion will only be able to go ahead if it is consistent with our carbon budgets.\"",
      "However, London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office said he has \"a long-standing opposition to airport expansion around London\" because of the impact on air quality and noise.",
      "Heathrow's boss, Thomas Woldbye, said in December he was waiting for a \"clear steer\" from the government before he could take plans forward.",
      "Could an extra runway help the economy?",
      "Some arguments for investing in the UK's transport infrastructure include a boost in growth, more jobs, and help for UK exports.",
      "Other European cities boast hub airports with more runways, including Amsterdam which serves fewer passengers than Heathrow but has five runways. Paris Charles de Gaulle and Frankfurt have four.",
      "Currently, over \u00a3200bn of British trade passes through Heathrow annually. Heathrow has not devised figures on how much trade is expected to increase after a third runway, which it will do when it arrives at planning stage.",
      "The Airport Commission, an independent panel that examines the need for additional UK airport capacity, looked into the likely impact of Heathrow expansion and reported in 2015 that there would be benefits to the tune of \u00a361bn over 60 years.",
      "It said that included reduced fares, fewer delays, greater resilience, and the creation of up to 77,000 jobs.",
      "Forging ahead with Heathrow expansion would also send a clear message to foreign investors that the government means what it says about making growth its priority.",
      "However, some critics, including think tank the New Economics Foundation say the impact on growth is exaggerated, arguing more capacity in the south of England might simply displace activity from other regions.",
      "Will a third runway at Heathrow help UK growth?",
      "What would the environmental impact be?",
      "Aviation is one source of damaging emissions that can contribute to climate change, and the industry is under pressure to find ways to reduce its impact.",
      "Reeves pointed to progress on creating sustainable fuels, and electric planes. A third runway at Heathrow would also mean \"that instead of circling London, flights can land\" she added, meaning less fuel is used.",
      "But it is far from clear that those technologies will be enough to make up for the growing demand for air travel. Heathrow will have to prove that its plan meets the governments net-zero by 2050 targets in any planning application.",
      "Last year the government's independent adviser on cutting emissions, the Climate Change Committee, warned that the UK should not go ahead with airport expansion without a framework in place to manage capacity across the country.",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Friends of the Earth has described the plan for a third runway as \"hugely irresponsible\".",
      "Alethea Warrington, head of aviation at climate charity Possible, said: \"This huge increase in emissions won't help our economy, and would just encourage the small group of frequent flyers who take most of the flights.\"",
      "What about Gatwick, Luton and London's other airports?",
      "Plans to expand London's other airports are already further along than Heathrow's and have in the past been viewed as an alternative to a third Heathrow runway.",
      "Work is set to start this year to expand capacity at Stansted's terminal.",
      "The government is due to make a decision on Gatwick airport by 27 February.",
      "Gatwick wants to increase its capacity to 75 million passengers per year, according to previously published plans. Pre-covid, its record was 47 million.",
      "Meanwhile, a decision on Luton airport's expansion, which includes plans for a new terminal, is due by 3 April.",
      "In total these expansions could create capacity for more than 60 million extra passengers by the 2040s.",

      "Bridget Phillipson said in a speech on Monday that the old single-word Ofsted judgements, which were scrapped last year, were \"too blunt\" and \"too vague\" to serve a purpose.",
      "She said new regional teams, with a budget of up to \u00a3100,000 per school, would help turn around the 600 \"stuck\" schools in England which had received back-to-back negative judgements from Ofsted.",

      "Lawyers for actors Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively spent their first day in court sparring over the sexual harassment and other allegations that have erupted surrounding their film, It Ends With Us.",
      "In December, Lively filed a legal complaint against Baldoni, accusing him of sexual harassment and starting a smear campaign against her. Baldoni has denied her claims and, in response, sued her on a various grounds, including defamation.",
      "The movie co-stars were not required to attend the pretrial meeting at federal court in Manhattan on Monday.",
      "But the hour-and-a-half hearing still turned heated as lawyers for each side claimed the other was badmouthing their client outside of court.",
      "The case \"is supposed to be resolved here in court\", Lively's attorney, Michael Gottlieb told Jude Lewis Liman. \"It's not supposed to be resolved in the press.\"",
      "Mr Gottlieb accused Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, of making \"inflammatory extrajudicial comments\" about Lively's \"character and motives\" during appearances on news channels.",
      "In response, Mr Freedman said Mr Gottlieb was trying to impose a \"gag order\" preventing him from talking to the media. Baldoni, he said, was the one who had suffered harm to his reputation.",
      "\"My client is devastated financially and emotionally,\" Mr Freedman told the court.",
      "Based on a bestselling novel by Colleen Hoover, It Ends With Us became a box office hit after it was released in August. But despite its financial success, rumours of a bitter feud between Baldoni and Lively began swirling before the film was even released.",

      "Both sides in the legal fights have \"given the public plenty to feast upon\", Judge Liman said on court in Monday.",
      "He said that if the case ended up being \"litigated in the press\", he could be forced to move up a March 2026 trial date so that jurors do not become prejudiced against either of the defendants.",
      "The judge also said he would adopt a New York Bar Association measure - Rule 3.6 - that bars lawyers from making statements publicly that could sway the outcome of a trial.",
      "Monday's hearing came after Baldoni filed an amended complaint against Lively, which included a 168-page \"timeline\" of events in the case. His team also launched a website with the new complaint as well as other publicly available videos and text messages surrounding the case.",
      "Lively's lawyer brought up the website in court on Monday. \"Who created the website?\" Mr Gottlieb asked. \"Who funded it?\"",
      "Mr Gottlieb also took issue with out-takes Baldoni has released from a romantic scene in It Ends With Us, which he says proves that Lively's allegations of sexual harassment are unfounded.",
      "But Lively has responded by saying the footage of the pair filming a slow dance scene is \"damning\" and corroborates her claims.",
      "Lively's team on Monday pledged to file an amended complaint of its own, which  would involve even more people in the case.",
      "Several other parties already are embroiled in the legal drama. Baldoni is suing the New York Times for libel, claiming his co-star gave the outlet advance access to her civil rights complaint. The Times was the first a story to publish about her suit last December. The New York Times has denied these allegations.",
      "Several public relations firms who worked with Baldoni and Lively during their film  are also defendants in the case.",
      "Some of those matters will be dealt with in a separate trial after Lively and Baldoni's, Judge Liman said on Monday.",
      "He also said Baldoni and Lively's legal teams would need to agree to a protective order, a legal document that shields people involved in the case from another person accused of abusing or harassing them.",
      "Such an order is necessary, Judge Liman said, because of the \"significant number of high-profile individuals\" in the case and the \"nature of the allegations\".",
      "During the hearing, Baldoni's attorney also pressed the judge to stick to the pre-trial schedule that both sides suggested, saying his client wanted the case to progress \"as quickly as possible\".",
      "Judge Liman agreed to Baldoni's lawyer's request, with a few small schedule changes.",

      "Sunday night saw Beyonce and Kendrick Lamar win big at the Grammy Awards, which was dedicated to fundraising for wildfire relief efforts in Los Angeles.",

      "Well, now we're in a pickle.",
      "On her eighth solo record, Cowboy Carter, Beyonc\u00e9 sang about the Grammys' constant, stubborn refusal to award her album of the year.",
      "\"AOTY, I ain't win,\" she sang. \"Take that s--- on the chin.\"",
      "But now she has won, for the album that contains that very lyric. Will she have to go back and re-record it? At the very least, we expect a rewrite on the tour she just announced.",
      "Joking aside, this victory was long, long overdue.",
      "In 2017, Adele even flirted with the idea of handing back her album of the year trophy, saying the music on her album, 25, couldn't compare to Beyonc\u00e9's \"monumental\u2026 beautiful and soul-baring\" Lemonade.",
      "Eyebrows were raised again in 2023, when Harry Styles' fun, but conceptually flimsy, Harry's House bested Beyonc\u00e9's Renaissance \u2013 a meticulous exploration of how oppressed black and queer musicians found salvation through house music.",
      "In the end, it took Beyonc\u00e9 to approach a genre that conservative Grammy voters could understand \u2013 country \u2013 in order to secure a victory.",
      "But that's not to downplay the scale of her achievement. Cowboy Carter is a masterpiece that weaves hundreds of musical threads into a thesis about America's cultural past, and the futility of gatekeeping musical genres along racial lines.",
      "The arguments it makes are both timely and urgent, without suffocating the songs.",
      "As the second part of a planned trilogy, this surely won't be Beyonc\u00e9's last trip to the podium.",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Sabrina Carpenter's stage malfunction",
      "Sabrina Carpenter has literally been practising for this moment all her life. She made her TV debut in 2011, aged 12 years old, and has been hovering on the fringes of pop superstardom pretty much ever since.",
      "So, after a huge breakthrough in 2024, she was primed and ready for the Grammy stage.",
      "Or was she?",
      "She emerged in a razzle-dazzle showgirl outfit and instantly missed her spotlight. Then she dropped the cane she was supposed to dance with. And, as she descended a grand pearlescent staircase, she suddenly disappeared through a trap door.",
      "Luckily, it was all a humorous ruse! Carpenter skipped back to the stage for a big band version of Espresso, complete with ankle-endangering tap routine.",
      "After changing into a blue, crystal-studded Victoria's Secret bodysuit, she segued effortlessly into Please, Please, Please\u2026 And then the set collapsed on her.",
      "As she leapt into the safety of a dancer's arms, she couldn't contain her laughter.",
      "It was a perfect piece of vaudeville, and the audience lapped it up. Host Trevor Noah, however, wasn't so impressed.",

      "Among those people were Abel Tesfaye \u2013 aka The Weeknd himself.",
      "He declared the awards were \"corrupt\" and criticised their lack of \"transparency\". Since then, he's refused to submit any of his music for consideration.",
      "So it was something of a coup when he gave an unannounced, unexpected performance in the middle of Sunday's ceremony.",
      "He was introduced by the Recording Academy's CEO, Harvey Mason Jr, who acknowledged the star's criticisms, and described his efforts to revamp the Grammys' electorate, by boosting the number of women and people of colour.",
      "After that, the star took to the stage with two songs from his brand new album, Cry For Me and Timeless.",
      "It was meant to be a celebration of people's ability to learn and grow, but the music was so oppressively drab \u2013 with the Weeknd constantly shrouded in smoke and shadow -  that you wondered whether he'd simply returned to sabotage the Grammys from within.",

      "Backed by dancers dressed as rodeo clowns, Roan - herself wearing a sequinned cowboy hat and sparkly boots - rode a a giant pink carousel pony, complete with an 80s perm.",

      "The pair then made a swift exit, electing to skip the ceremony, driving off into the LA night.",
      "Early reports suggested they had been kicked out, but the BBC understands they left of their own accord, with one source saying that West, \"walked the carpet, got in his car and left\".",
      "They may well have been home by the time West's track Carnival lost out to Kendrick Lamar in the best rap song category.",

      "HIGHLIGHT: Brat Green picks up a prize",
      "Among the three awards Charli XCX picked up was one of the night's most obscure: Best artwork.",
      "At first glance, that might seem odd. The album cover is a plain green square, with the word \"brat\" printed in a deliberately low-resolution Arial font.",
      "But the cover took five months to put together, with designer Brent David Freaney testing around 500 shades of green to produce a garish, nausea-inducing effect.",
      "Charli wanted the artwork to be deliberately off-putting \u2013 reflecting the album's dual themes of partying and self doubt. And she said it was important to challenge the convention of women dressing provocatively to promote their music.",
      "\"Why should anyone have that level of ownership over female artists?\" she asked Vogue magazine.",
      "She added: \"I wanted to go with an offensive, off-trend shade of green to trigger the idea of something being wrong. I'd like for us to question our expectations of pop culture - why are some things considered good and acceptable, and some things deemed bad?",
      "\"I'm interested in the narratives behind that and I want to provoke people. I'm not doing things to be nice.\"",
      "Towards the end of the ceremony, the star's live performance of Von Dutch and Guess saw her transform the biggest and glitziest night in music into a packed and sweaty nightclub.",
      "Emerging from a black SUV, she strutted towards the camera, throwing a glass of champagne against the wall of a parking garage, before launching into what appeared to be an underground rave.",
      "As the performance progressed, she appeared on stage with model Julia Fox and hundreds of dancers, who were then showered in underwear (a reference to the song's lyrics).",

      "LOWLIGHT (if you\u2019re Drake): Kendrick Lamar\u2019s clean sweep",
      "The Grammys have a wobbly history with hip-hop. They didn't introduce a rap category until 1989, a full decade after the Sugarhill Gang introduced the genre to a wide audience with Rapper's Delight. And no rap act has won album of the year since OutKast in 2001.",
      "So it was a rare victory when Compton-born rapper Kendrick Lamar won all five of the awards in which he was nominated for Not Like Us, a furious takedown of his musical rival, Drake.",
      "Among those awards were the prestigious record and song of the year - categories that have only ever recognised a rap song once before (Childish Gambino's This Is America in 2019).",
      "Lamar didn't perform at the ceremony - he plays the Super Bowl halftime show next week instead - but, dressed head to toe in denim, he delivered a powerful message to Grammy voters.",
      "\"At the end of the day, nothing is more powerful than rap music. I don't care what it is. We are the culture\u2026 respect the art form\".",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Janelle Mona\u00e9's moonwalk moment",
      "Music lost one of its biggest legends in 2024, when Quincy Jones died at the age of 91.",
      "As the producer for everyone from Frank Sinatra to Michael Jackson, the Grammys gave him a star-studded send-off that lasted almost 20 minutes.",
      "Cynthia Erivo and Herbie Hancock played a beautiful version of Fly Me To The Moon; while Stevie Wonder's sang We Are The World with choirs from two schools affected by the devastating LA fires.",
      "But it was Janelle Mona\u00e9's performance of Michael Jackson's Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough that blew the roof off.",
      "Dressed in MJ's Billie Jean outfit, she pirouetted and moonwalked and jumped on the tables as if she'd been possessed by the man himself.",
      "Towards the end of the performance, she threw off her jacket to reveal a t-shirt bearing the legend \"I Love QJ\".",
      "And guess who caught it and wore it for the rest of the night?",
      "Taylor Swift.",
      "LOWLIGHT: Snubs for Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift",
      "Even with 94 awards to consider, some people will get overlooked - but nobody expected two of the Grammys' biggest darlings to go home empty-handed.",
      "Taylor Swift was blanked despite scoring six nominations. Voters clearly decided that The Tortured Poets Department wasn't worthy of comparison with her four previous album of the year winners (Fearless, 1989, Folklore and Midnights).",
      "Billie Eilish's wipeout was even more unexpected. She had been the bookmakers' favourite for album of the year, for her third release Hit Me Hard And Soft - but she lost all seven of the categories she was nominated for.",
      "Still, there was a lot of competition this year, especially in the pop categories. And Swift has spoken in the past about how losing album of the year for Red inspired her pop opus, and biggest-seller to date, 1989.",
      "Don't count either of these artists out just yet.",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Trevor Noah's easy-going hosting",
      "There's a reason they keep inviting Trevor Noah back to host the Grammys: He's got the tone right.",
      "He's relaxed, he's engaged with the music, and his humour never punches down.",
      "Here are some of his best quips from the night:",
      "\"Yesterday, Beyonce announced her new tour. Everyone saw that. I will say, though, Beyonce, there's tariffs. We can't afford a new tour, right?

Which means she would break the record of four wins, set all the way back in 2024 by Taylor Swift. I'm just gonna say Taylor, if you break Taylor's record, the Swifties are gonna come for you. And you don't wanna mess with them.\"\"The Beatles are nominated tonight for Record of the Year. Yes, the legendary band from Liverpool used AI to put out a new song after 53 years. So good luck to the Beatles. I think if they win, this could open up a few doors for them.\"\"And who knows, through the power of AI, one day, we could even get another Rihanna album.\"",

      "\"Cancelling, pushing, moving does not accomplish what us standing together\" does, Mr Mason argued in a webcast before the show. The show will be \"unifying and coming together, honouring music, but also using the power of music to heal, rebuild and provide services to people who need it\".",
      "\"I think this might be one of the most important Grammy weeks we've ever had.\"",

      "Artists had to adjust to a new way of promoting their music, relying on digital platforms rather than in-person Grammy week events, which were either cancelled or moved online.",
      "\"I wouldn't necessarily compare the COVID pandemic to what's happening here,\" senior music writer for Variety, Steven J Horowitz, told the BBC. \"COVID lasted for so long and the effects were devastating for years. People had to cancel major releases, and everything shifted to a digital space.\"",

      "There is also a ripple effect in the industry on those not personally impacted by the fires.",
      "The week of events typically held before the show, which were cancelled this year to help with fundraising efforts instead, helps new musicians and allows them to break out in a crowded market - getting time with top executives and those at major record labels.",
      "\"Visibility is very important for artists,\" Mr Horowitz told the BBC.",
      "\"Say you're a Best New Artist nominee who is relatively unknown to the public - being on these platforms and at these parties is a really big look if you're trying to get your music out in front of the industry. It really does help.\"",
      "One of the most sought-after parties is Spotify's event honouring the nominees for Best New Artist of the year. It is half party, half concert, with previous nominees showcasing their new music, and celebrities from all parts of the entertainment industry there to celebrate.",
      "Following the fires, Spotify chose to cancel this year's event.",
      "\"We've decided that the most impactful approach is cancelling all our Grammy Week events, including our annual Best New Artist party, and redirecting funds to support efforts to reach local fans and charitable organizations,\" Spotify's Global Head of Music Partnerships and Audience Joe Hadley wrote in an announcement.",
      "The music industry and the Grammys are deeply rooted in Los Angeles, and though the city is going through a devastating period, it has reinforced a sense of community, especially in the music industry.",
      "\"Even if people lost everything, they still have hope. And I think that feeds into what we're going to see in the music industry in the future,\" Mr Horowitz said. \"People aren't going to flee Los Angeles because of this one thing.

      "But it was Meteor Garden, a TV adaptation of a 1990s Japanese comic of the same name, that turned Hsu into a star whose fame stretched beyond Chinese entertainment.",

      "It's towards the end of our interview that Bill Gates reveals new numbers on how much his charitable Foundation has now spent in its efforts to combat preventable diseases and reduce poverty.",
      "\"I've given over 100 billion,\" he says, \"but I still have more to give.\"",
      "That's dollars, just to clarify, worth about \u00a380bn.",
      "It's roughly equivalent to the size of the Bulgarian economy or the cost of building the whole HS2 line.",
      "But to put it in context, it's also around the same as just one year of Tesla sales. (Tesla owner Elon Musk is now the richest man on the planet, a position Gates held for many years.)",
      "The co-founder of Microsoft and his fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett are combining their billions through the Gates Foundation he originally set up with his now ex-wife Melinda.",
      "Gates says philanthropy was instilled in him early on. His mother regularly told him \"with wealth came the responsibility to give it away\".",
      "His Foundation's 25th anniversary is in May, and Gates exclusively revealed the $100bn figure to the BBC.",
      "He tells me, for his part, he enjoys giving his money away (and around $60 billion of his fortune has gone into the Foundation so far).",
      "When it comes to his day-to-day lifestyle, he doesn't actually notice the difference: \"I made no personal sacrifice. I didn't order less hamburgers or less movies.\" He can also, of course, still afford his private jet and his various huge houses.",
      "He plans to give away \"the vast majority\" of his fortune, but tells me he has talked \"a lot\" with his three children about what might be the right amount to leave them.",
      "Will they be poor after he's gone? I ask him. \"They will not,\" he replies with a quick smile, adding \"in absolute, they'll do well, in percentage terms it's not a gigantic number\".",
      "Gates is a maths guy and it shows. At Lakeside School in Seattle, in eighth grade, he competed in a four-state regional maths exam and did so well that, at 13, he was one of the best high school maths students of any age in the region.",
      "Maths terminology comes second nature to him. But to translate, if you're worth $160bn, which Bloomberg's Billionaires Index claims he is, even leaving your children a tiny percentage of your fortune still makes them very rich.",
      "I'm with one of only 15 people on the planet who are centibillionaires (worth more than $100bn), according to Bloomberg. We're in his childhood home in Seattle, a mid-century modern four-bedroom house set into a hill, and we're meeting because he's written a memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, focusing on his early life.",
      "I want to find out what shaped a challenging, obsessive child who didn't fit the norm into one of the tech pioneers of our age.",
      "He's brought along his sisters, Kristi and Libby, and all three excitedly tour the home where they grew up. They haven't been back in some years and the current owners have refurbished (fortunately, the Gates siblings seem to approve of the changes).",
      "But it's bringing back memories including, as they walk into the kitchen, of the now-long-gone intercom system between rooms beloved by their mother. She used it to \"sing to us in the morning\", Gates tells me, to get them out of their bedrooms for breakfast.",
      "Mary Gates also set their watches and clocks eight minutes fast so the family would work to her time. Her son often rebelled at her efforts to improve him, but now tells me \"the crucible of my ambition was warmed through that relationship\".",
      "He puts his competitive spirit down to his grandmother \"Gami\", who was often with the family in this house and who taught him to outsmart the competition early on with games of cards.",
      "I follow him down the wooden stairs as he heads off to find his old childhood bedroom in the basement. It's a neat guest room now, but young Bill spent hours, even days, in here \"thinking\", as his sisters put it.",
      "At one point, his mum was so fed up with the mess that she confiscated any item of clothing she found on the floor and charged her stubborn son 25 cents to buy it back. \"I started wearing fewer clothes,\" he says.",
      "By this time, he was hooked on coding and, with some tech-savvy school friends, had been given access to a local firm's one computer in return for reporting any problems. Obsessed with learning to program in those nascent days of the tech revolution, he would sneak out at night through his bedroom window without his parents knowing to get more computer time.",
      "\"Do you think you could do it now?\" I ask.",
      "He starts unwinding the catch and opens the window. \"It's not that hard,\" he says with a smile as he climbs up and out. \"It's not hard at all.\"",
      "There is a famous early clip of Gates in which a TV presenter asks him if it's true he can jump over a chair from a standing position. He does it right there in the studio. I'm in the Gates childhood bedroom for something that feels like \"a moment\". The guy's nearly 70. But he's still game.",
      "He seems at ease - and it isn't just because we're in a familiar environment. In the memoir, he's revealed publicly for the first time that he thinks if he were growing up today, he'd probably be diagnosed on the autism spectrum.",
      "The only time I met him before was in 2012. He barely looked me in the eye as we did a quick interview about his goal to protect children from life-threatening diseases. There was certainly no pre-interview small talk. I wondered after our interaction whether he was on the spectrum.",
      "The book lays it out: his ability to hyperfocus on subjects he was interested in; his obsessive nature; his lack of social awareness.",
      "He says at elementary school he turned in a 177-page report on Delaware, having written off for brochures about the state, even sending stamped addressed envelopes to local companies asking for their annual reports. He was 11.",
      "His sisters tell me they knew he was different. Kristi, who's older, says she felt protective of him. \"He was not a normal kid\u2026 he would sit in his room and chew pencils down to the lead,\" she said.",
      "They're obviously close. Libby, a therapist, tells me she wasn't surprised to hear he believes he is on the spectrum. \"The surprise was more his willingness to say 'this might be the case',\" she says.",
      "Gates says he hasn't had a formal diagnosis and doesn't plan to. \"The positive characteristics for my career have been more beneficial than the deficits have been a problem for me,\" he says.",
      "He thinks neurodiversity is \"certainly\" over-represented in Silicon Valley because \"learning something in great depth at a young age - that helps you in certain complex subjects\".",
      "Elon Musk has also said he is on the spectrum, referencing Asperger's syndrome. The Tesla, X and SpaceX billionaire is famously courting Donald Trump, as are the other modern-day tech bros, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos among other Silicon Valley attendees at Trump's inauguration.",
      "Gates tells me although \"you can be cynical\" about their motives, he too reached out to the president. They had a three-hour dinner on 27 December \"because he's making decisions about global health and how we help poor countries, which is a big focus of mine now\".",
      "I ask Gates, himself a target of some pretty wild conspiracy theories, what he thinks of the decision taken by Zuckerberg after Trump's election to dump fact-checking in the US on his sites. Gates tells me he's not \"that impressed\" by how governments or private companies are navigating the boundaries between free speech and truth.",
      "\"I don't personally know how you draw that line, but I'm worried that we're not handling that as well as we should,\" he says.",
      "He also thinks children should be protected from social media, telling me there's a \"good chance\" that banning under-16s, as Australia is doing, is \"a smart thing\".",
      "Gates tells me \"social networking, even more than video gaming, can absorb your time and make you worry about other people approving you\" so we have to be \"very careful how it gets used\".",
      "As for Trump's first pick for US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who claims he isn't anti-vaccination but has promoted debunked claims about vaccines, Gates makes short shrift. He tells me RFK Jr is \"misleading people\".",
      "The Bill Gates origin story isn't rags to riches. His dad was a lawyer, money wasn't tight, although the decision to send their son to private school to try to motivate him was \"a stretch, even on my father's salary\".",
      "If they hadn't, we might never have heard of Bill Gates.",
      "He first got access to an early mainframe computer via a teletype machine at the school, after the mothers held a jumble sale to raise the money. The teachers couldn't figure it out, but four students were on it day and night. \"We got to use computers when almost nobody else did,\" he says.",
      "Much later, he would set up Microsoft with one of those school friends, Paul Allen. Another, Kent Evans, Gates' best friend, would die tragically age 17 in a climbing accident. As we walk around Lakeside School, we pass the chapel where they held his funeral and where Gates remembers crying on the steps.",
      "Together, they'd had big plans. When they weren't on computers, they were reading biographies to work out what factors made people successful.",
      "Now Gates has written his own. His philosophy? \"Much of who you are was there from the start.\"",

      "The body positivity movement finds its origins in the hazy days of the 1960s and was helped by icons like Marilyn Monroe who broadened Hollywood's rigid beauty standard.",
      "It was brought to the forefront again in the 2010s, when Instagram was launched and influencers began to highlight fashion and beauty outside of the glossy magazines and runways.",
      "Helping this was the celebrity Kardashian family, whose curves triggered BBLs  (Brazilian butt lift surgery) around the world.",
      "Enrika, a 28-year-old plus-sized model, said: \"When the body positivity movement emerged, it felt incredibly empowering and liberating.\"",
      "\"It felt like an act of rebellion - what had always been criticised was now being appreciated. It was as if we had finally had enough of being judged.\"",
      "Plus-size models were being booked for big brands, including Rihanna's highly coveted lingerie label, 'Savage x Fenty' which launched in 2018.",
      "The brand, valued at $1bn, became known for its runway extravaganzas, reminiscent of a modern alternative to the iconic Victoria's Secret shows, but this time with every body type on display.",
      "Felicity Hayward, a 36-year-old plus-sized model, reflects on being scouted in 2011.",
      "\"When I got that call from my first modelling agency Storm - who discovered Kate Moss - I thought I was being punk'd,\" she said.",
      "\"Before the 2010s, attitudes around bigger bodies weren't positive and I never thought being a plus-size model was a possibility.",
      "\"Seeing that narrative change over the last decade and a half has been life changing both emotionally, physically and financially.\"",
      "The 2020s: The era of Ozempic",
      "But then around 2020, progress started to slow. And come the autumn and winter of 2024, of the 8,800 looks across 230 shows, just 0.8 per cent were on plus-size models, Vogue reports.",
      "At the same time, a new weight loss drug used to treat diabetes came onto the market and skyrocketed in popularity.  Semaglutide, also known as Ozempic and Wegovy, curbs the appetite of users, and was approved by the NHS for weight loss in 2023.",
      "Celebrities including Elon Musk started crediting the drug for their newly slim frame and it was only a matter of time before that trickled down to consumers.",
      "As Ozempic and its counterparts become more commercially available for aesthetic purposes, industry insiders claim it has affected the body positivity movement.",
      "Model, Moya, said: \"We've seen how quickly the narrative shifted, with celebrities and influencers using surgeries or medication like Ozempic to chase what's considered 'in Vogue'.\"",
      "Another model, Jenny, said: \"When I realised skinny was back, it was positive because I was going to get more jobs.",
      "\"But I've realised it means now I have to keep up. Now I have to be the skinniest.\"",
      "Even the editorial director of British Vogue said that the fashion industry \"should be concerned\" by a recent trend back to using more skinny models",
      "Chioma Nnadi told BBC Radio 4's Today programme:  \"I do think maybe perhaps Ozempic has something to do with it.\"",
      "\"We're in this moment where we're seeing the pendulum sort of swing back to skinny being 'in' and often these things are treated like a trend and we don't want them to be.\"",
      "Then Berlin brand, Namilia, went viral for an \"I love Ozempic\" T-shirt on their 2024 Fashion Week runway.",
      "\"The 'I love Ozempic' tee really hit a nerve,\" laughed Nan Li, the brand's creative director who claims the T-shirt was satire.",
      "\"With the rise of Ozempic, so many people are using it. Over the last few years, celebrities just lost weight and didn't talk about it.\"",
      "Paris 'celebrates elitism'",
      "Fast-forward to January, when Men's AW25 Fashion Week lands in Paris and audiences get a litmus test in real-time of exactly where brands stand.",
      "Aside from a selection of designers, including Rick Owens, LGN and Charles Jeffrey LOVERBOY, I can count on two hands how many plus-sized models I saw at a week of shows.",
      "Nan Li said: \"Paris celebrates elitism, and elitism means skinny and white.\"",
      "\"There's a handful of plus-sized models [at the shows] but they're not really plus - they're normal-sized. They are cast in every show to make the brand appear body positive.\"",
      "Amidst the hustle and bustle of fashion week, Shaun Beyen, casting director for iconic French brand Fursac, told the BBC: \"The only motivation for a brand is to sell clothes - that's it. I don't think we need to lie about this.",
      "\"Brands adopted body positivity in the 2010s because in part they saw it as a commercial opportunity, and when they saw it was no longer performing as they would hope in 2020, they hopped off.\"",
      "Beyen added: \"Full transparency - I don't really want to see clothes on someone like me. I want to see it on somebody I aspire to look like.\"",
      "Gauthier Borsarello, Fursac's creative director, laughed in agreement and said: \"I hate my body. I don't want to see clothes on people like me.\"",
      "On the other hand, designers like Charles Jeffrey believe brands have a moral imperative to cast inclusively. \"Body positivity was never a trend for me,\" he said. \"It was an opportunity to start being responsible.\"",
      "Body positivity is knitted into the very fabric of Charles' brand, which takes inspiration from the queer nightlife scene. This is readily apparent throughout his Paris Fashion Week show.",
      "The designer explained: \"The people in my shows are people I was clubbing with. It was never about models, it was my friends and their different body shapes. It was about the community I surrounded myself with.\"",
      "Body positivity 'taken a backseat now'",
      "It seem the reality is that designers like Charles are the exception to the rule. As much as activists resist it, industry insiders confirm that body positivity is behind us.",
      "Daniel Mitchell-Jones, co-founder of modelling agency Chapter Management, said: \"Yes, things have shifted. In 2020 and 2021, we saw so much more diversity and inclusion on the runways - but body-wise, that's taken a backseat now.\"",
      "Daniel said when he sends his curve models to castings, they're always pushed, but is often told the brand isn't interested this season.",
      "Plus-size model Enrika told the BBC that not only are plus-sized models being booked less, their agents are actively struggling to secure work for them.",
      "She explained: \"It's not unusual to see campaigns featuring four sample-size models and only one plus-size model. This can make you feel like you're just a token.\"",
      "Enrika said these brands sometimes often use tactics in campaigns to virtue-signal being inclusive - such as highlighting stretch marks on plus-sized models, whilst airbrushing them on others.",
      "She said: \"It sends the message that 'We don't actually think you look as good as the slim models in our skirt. But we accept you because we are such kind-hearted good people, so please give us your hard-earned money', it's nasty work and I don't support it.\"",
      "If you want change, change your buying habits. At least, that's what Shaun Beyen, believes: \"Everything is consumer-driven\".",
      "\"It's this kind of vicious circle. Every fashion house gives their version of what they know the customer wants, it's their interpretation and it's up to the consumer.\"",
      "Gauthier Borsarello said: \"There's a famous French saying: 'If people stop producing, people will stop buying.' But the inverse is true. If people stop buying, we stop producing.",
      "\"No-one is forcing you to do anything. It's an education of the customer: In a polite way - educate yourself.\"",
      "And the one benefit of bodies as trends is that the pendulum will eventually swing back. Beyen said: \"Nothing is ever gone, especially not in fashion.\"",

    "story": [
      "For Christmas I received an interesting gift from a friend - my very own \"best-selling\" book.",
      "\"Tech-Splaining for Dummies\" (great title) bears my name and my photo on its cover, and it has glowing reviews.",
      "Yet it was entirely written by AI, with a few simple prompts about me supplied by my friend Janet.",
      "It's an interesting read, and very funny in parts. But it also meanders quite a lot, and is somewhere between a self-help book and a stream of anecdotes.",
      "It mimics my chatty style of writing, but it's also a bit repetitive, and very verbose. It may have gone beyond Janet's prompts in collating data about me.",
      "Several sentences begin \"as a leading technology journalist\u2026\" \u2013 cringe \u2013 which could have been scraped from an online bio.",
      "There's also a mysterious, repeated hallucination in the form of my cat (I have no pets). And there's a metaphor on almost every page \u2013 some more random than others.",
      "There are dozens of companies online offering AI-book writing services. My book was from BookByAnyone.",
      "When I contacted the chief executive Adir Mashiach, based in Israel, he told me he had sold around 150,000 personalised books, mainly in the US, since pivoting from compiling AI-generated travel guides in June 2024.",
      "A paperback copy of your own 240-page long best-seller costs \u00a326. The firm uses its own AI tools to generate them, based on an open source large language model.",
      "I'm not asking you to buy my book. Actually you can't \u2013 only Janet, who created it, can order any further copies.",
      "There is currently no barrier to anyone creating one in anybody's name, including celebrities \u2013 although Mr Mashiach says there are guardrails around abusive content. Each book contains a printed disclaimer stating that it is fictional, created by AI, and designed \"solely to bring humour and joy\".",
      "Legally, the copyright belongs to the firm, but Mr Mashiach stresses that the product is intended as a \"personalised gag gift\", and the books do not get sold further.",
      "He hopes to broaden his range, generating different genres such as sci-fi, and perhaps offering an autobiography service. It's designed to be a light-hearted form of consumer AI \u2013 selling AI-generated goods to human customers.",
      "It's also a bit terrifying if, like me, you write for a living. Not least because it probably took less than a minute to generate, and it does, certainly in some parts, sound just like me.",
      "Musicians, authors, artists and actors worldwide have expressed alarm about their work being used to train generative AI tools that then churn out similar content based upon it.",
      "\"We should be clear, when we are talking about data here, we actually mean human creators' life works,\" says Ed Newton Rex, founder of Fairly Trained, which campaigns for AI firms to respect creators' rights.",
      "\"This is books, this is articles, this is photos. It's works of art. It's records\u2026 The whole point of AI training is to learn how to do something and then do more like that.\"",
      "In 2023 a song featuring AI-generated voices of Canadian singers Drake and The Weeknd went viral on social media before being pulled from streaming platforms because it was not their work and they had not consented to it. It didn't stop the track's creator trying to nominate it for a Grammy award. And even though the artists were fake, it was still wildly popular.",
      "\"I do not think the use of generative AI for creative purposes should be banned, but I do think that generative AI for these purposes that is trained on people's work without permission should be banned,\" Mr Newton Rex adds. \"AI can be very powerful but let's build it ethically and fairly.\"",

      "The UK government is considering an overhaul of the law that would allow AI developers to use creators' content on the internet to help develop their models, unless the rights holders opt out.",
      "Ed Newton Rex describes this as \"insanity\".",
      "He points out that AI can make advances in areas like defence, healthcare and logistics without trawling the work of authors, journalists and artists.",
      "\"All of these things work without going and changing copyright law and ruining the livelihoods of the country's creatives,\" he argues.",
      "Baroness Kidron, a crossbench peer in the House of Lords, is also strongly against removing copyright law for AI.",

      "\"The government is undermining one of its best performing industries on the vague promise of growth.\"",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"No move will be made until we are absolutely confident we have a practical plan that delivers each of our objectives: increased control for right holders to help them license their content, access to high-quality material to train leading AI models in the UK, and more transparency for right holders from AI developers.\"",
      "Under the UK government's new AI plan, a national data library containing public data from a wide range of sources will also be made available to AI researchers.",
      "In the US the future of federal rules to control AI is now up in the air following President Trump's return to the presidency.",
      "In 2023 Biden signed an executive order that aimed to boost the safety of AI with, among other things, firms in the sector required to share details of the workings of their systems with the US government before they are released.",
      "But this has now been repealed by Trump. It remains to be seen what Trump will do instead, but he is said to want the AI sector to face less regulation.",
      "This comes as a number of lawsuits against AI firms, and particularly against OpenAI, continue in the US. They have been taken out by everyone from the New York Times to authors, music labels, and even a comedian.",
      "They claim that the AI firms broke the law when they took their content from the internet without their consent, and used it to train their systems.",
      "The AI companies argue that their actions fall under \"fair use\" and are therefore exempt. There are a number of factors which can constitute fair use \u2013 it's not a straight-forward definition. But the AI sector is under increasing scrutiny over how it gathers training data and whether it should be paying for it.",
      "If this wasn't all enough to ponder, Chinese AI firm DeepSeek has shaken the sector over the past week. It became the most downloaded free app on Apple's US App Store.",
      "DeepSeek claims that it developed its technology for a fraction of the price of the likes of OpenAI. Its success has raised security concerns in the US, and threatens American's current dominance of the sector.",
      "As for me and a career as an author, I think that at the moment, if I really want a \"bestseller\" I'll still have to write it myself. If anything, Tech-Splaining for Dummies highlights the current weakness in generative AI tools for bigger projects. It is full of inaccuracies and hallucinations, and it can be quite difficult to read in parts because it's so long-winded.",

      "Over on the runway, the offering was a perfect spring palette of creams and pinks, with plenty of nods to classic Chanel tweed.",
      "The show was a celebration of the fashion house's 110 years in haute couture, using huge ramps that aerially displayed the double C motif of the brand.",
      "Created by Chanel's in-house team of designers (new creative director Matthieu Blazy won't be exhibiting his first collection until later this year), it took inspiration from Coco Chanel's 1980s colour palette.",

      "Maria Grazia Chiuri's collection was said to draw inspiration from Alice in Wonderland, with much of the designs looking like they belonged to the fantasy world.",
      "The show was described by many as dramatic - with dresses that more closely resembled lampshades, complete with delightful feathers, tassels and tulle.",

      "Given the chance to restart her singing career, she went on to make more than 20 albums.",
      "Her whisky-soaked voice, turned cracked and dusky, conveyed the inner torments of her painful life-experiences.",

      "After divorcing, Lady Sacher-Masoch spirited her six-year-old daughter to a terraced house in Reading, discouraging further contact with Major Faithfull.",
      "According to Marianne, she was raised like \"one of her mother's cats\".",

      "While still at school, Marianne began singing folk songs a cappella in Reading coffee-houses - and, before long, her exquisite looks and obvious talent saw her sucked into the vortex of Swinging 60s London.",
      "In 1964, she attended a Rolling Stones launch party, on the arm of British artist John Dunbar, and was spotted by the flamboyant record producer Andrew Loog Oldham.",
      "Famously, he described her as an \"angel\" with impressive vital statistics.",
      "Oldham was the Rolling Stones' manager and felt he could package his new discovery as a pop star.",
      "She would, he thought, be a useful vehicle for songs that weren't quite a fit for his more important act.",

      "She appeared at London's Royal Court in an adaptation of Chekhov's Three Sisters, alongside Glenda Jackson.",
      "She became the first person ever to utter the F-word in a mainstream film, I'll Never Forget What'sisname, in 1967.",
      "A year later, she starred opposite Alain Delon, as a doomed, leather-clad beauty in The Girl on a Motorcycle.",

      "Of course, there were a lot of drugs.",
      "During a police raid on Keith Richards' house in Sussex, Faithfull was discovered naked, draped in a fur rug - which she took indecent pleasure in occasionally letting slip.",
      "Allegations involving a Mars bar, she insisted, were entirely made up. But the drugs bust took a toll on her reputation. \"It destroyed me,\" she later said.",
      "\"To be a male drug addict and to act like that is always enhancing and glamorising, she explained.",

      "Faithfull co-wrote Sister Morphine with Jagger and Richards and released the song in 1969.",

      "The relationship with Jagger - whom she accused of having a misogynistic streak - fell apart at the turn of the decade.",

      "She looked back on these years in a BBC interview in 2002, describing her addiction as a kind of brutal therapy.",
      "\"I was in agony and I healed myself as best I could,\" she said. \"One of the ways was with drugs, because they are painkillers.",

      "Occasional attempts to emerge from her squat in Chelsea failed.",
      "Her voice - affected by drug abuse and laryngitis - had become permanently rough and lower in pitch.",
      "But, a decade after her split with Jagger, Faithfull made Broken English - her most critically acclaimed album.",
      "Gone was the innocence of the 1960s - and in its place, a post-punk performer of depth and world-weary experience.",
      "The album's final track, Why'd Ya Do It?, is the rasping rant of a woman reacting to a man's infidelity - set to a riff inspired by Jimi Hendrix.",
      "It was a moment of metamorphosis: the Rolling Stone party-girl had become a gravel-voiced, truth-telling sophisticate.",
      "The album's critical success was not matched commercially. It did well in France and Germany but reached just number 57 in the UK charts.",
      "But it did earn Faithfull a Grammy nomination in 1981, for best female rock vocal performance.",
      "She moved to America, where Island Records put her into rehab.",
      "Still suffering from alcohol and drug addiction, she had a string of mishaps - including breaking her jaw on the stairs. On one occasion, her heart actually stopped.",
      "But she held it together, and released more than a dozen albums over the next three decades.",
      "She also wrote an autobiography, Faithfull - looking back on the 1960s and 70s with a notable absence of self-pity.",
      "Constantly worried about money, she auctioned off much of her 1960s memorabilia in 2024 - saying that she preferred gardening to looking back.",
      "Now in her late 70s, she had inherited her mother's ancient title and - technically a baroness - was living in Paris.",
      "In the last decade of her life, Faithfull had to cancel concert tours after being diagnosed first with breast cancer and then hepatitis C.",
      "She was also troubled by the complications of a broken back and hip, and thought she would never sing again after weeks in hospital with the coronavirus.",

      "The lawyers said private clinics are providing these to under 18s, despite the fact that they pose at least an equal risk as puberty blockers.",
      "The letter, seen by the BBC, points to potential health risks to children's developing brains, bones and reproductive system.",
      "Keira Bell has previously taken legal action against the NHS - after her treatment when she was a teenager more than a decade ago at what was then the only NHS gender clinic.",
      "She was given puberty blockers at 16 and then the male hormone testosterone at 17 before having surgery to remove her breasts.",
      "Ms Bell, 28, told BBC News: \"I was very vulnerable and was dealing with a lot of issues.",

      "\"He banned puberty blockers, but failed to ban even more harmful cross-sex hormones that expose children to irreversible lifelong changes.",

      "When she finally had the test done last month, she brought her partner with her for support and to help her in case she had a flashback or a panic attack. Having them there also made the experience feel more \"comfortable and casual\", she says.",
      "Bianca Ionici, 27, who lives in London, says she put off her cervical screening \"for at least two years\" because of concerns about pain.",

      "But \"it was over before I knew\", she says.",
      "Others say they didn't experience any discomfort - like Megan Burns, a social media content creator living in Brighton.",
      "\"It was nothing,\" says Megan, who had her first screening in September aged 25. \"I couldn't feel anything.\" She says the fact she'd already had two children made her less anxious about the experience.",
      "\"These nurses have seen everything,\" Megan adds.",
      "Some people feel under pressure to shave their pubic hair or wear their best underwear, she says. But speaking as a former healthcare worker, Megan says \"you're there to do a job, you don't care about these things\".",

      "Some of the people the BBC spoke to said they weren't aware they could have asked for accommodations.",
      "Bianca says she asked the nurse to use a smaller speculum after reading about it online.",
      "But she thinks information about adjustments should be flagged more clearly when you book the appointment, because some need to be thought about in advance - like bringing a friend or booking a double slot.",
      "What is it like to have the test as a transgender man?",
      "Jack Latham, a 28-year-old personal trainer living in Kent, says he received his first screening invite aged 25, just after he came out as trans. He says his GP was \"incredibly supportive\" and there was even a poster in his surgery's waiting room encouraging trans men to have a cervical screening.",

      "NHS England data from March 2024 showed 44.5% of women aged 25-29 had not been screened in the last 3.5 years. For those aged 30-34, this figure was 35.3%.",
      "The proportion of younger women who have been adequately screened has been falling a little in recent years.",

      "She emphasised that adjustments are always available and that women should book their screenings, even if they were invited months or years ago.",
      "A display at the Vagina Museum in east London last year encouraged visitors to write improvements they'd like to see to the NHS's cervical screening service on slips of paper.",
      "Artist Ella Clancy, who produced the display, says common requests included more information about the adjustments available - especially asking for smaller speculums - nurses talking people through exactly what they were doing as they performed the screening and staff being more trauma-aware.",
      "Eleanor says there should be more education around what HPV is. School pupils are typically vaccinated against HPV between year eight and year 10 but Eleanor says it wasn't clear at the time what the jab was for.",
      "Jessica thinks doctors should explain the results using plainer language, and says she had to call her GP for further explanation after receiving her results letter.",
      "Would you rather do the test yourself?",
      "Some people prefer to carry out medical tests in the comfort of their own homes where possible. Do-it-yourself cervical tests are available in some countries, and researchers at King's College London trialled them in London in 2021 with \"fantastic\" results. They involve doing a vaginal swab which is then sent to a lab.",
      "The NHS said last year it was assessing whether to roll the scheme out more widely.",
      "Eleanor says she felt \"reassured\" knowing that a healthcare professional performed her first screening, but would try doing an at-home version of the test after that if the option were available.",
      "Jack, on the other hand, has his doubts. He says he'd prefer an at-home kit for \"the convenience and flexibility\" but that he'd \"have some hesitation about whether I'd done it correctly\".",

      "About 50 people a year with the inherited blood disorder are likely to receive it, experts say.",
      "Prof Bola Owolabi, of NHS England, called it a \"monumental step forward\", and said the one-off treatment Casgevy, also known as Exa-cel, \"holds a very real prospect of  a cure\".",
      "A confidential agreement has been made with manufacturer Vertex on how much the NHS will pay.",
      "Campaigners have described the treatment as \"groundbreaking\" and its availability on the NHS as a \"milestone\".",
      "Sickle cell disease can be life-threatening and cause recurring intense pain, when blood vessels become blocked by misshapen red cells.",
      "About 15,000 people in England live with the condition, which mainly affects people of Black African and Black Caribbean heritage.",
      "It is caused by genetic change that means people make haemoglobin - a key protein in red blood cells - that doesn't work properly.",
      "This results in red blood cells becoming sickle in shape and stiff and sticky - rather than flexible smooth discs.",
      "These sickle cells do not live as long as healthy red blood cells and can clump as they travel around blood vessels - reducing oxygen to vital parts of the body.",
      "This puts people at risk of organ damage, stroke, heart failure and a greatly  reduced quality of life.",
      "In trials all patients who received the therapy - which tweaks a specific gene and allows the body to make more healthy red blood cells - avoided stays in hospital for a year after treatment and most for three-and-a-half years. Further data is still being studied.",
      "NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said the therapy \"could be absolutely transformative \u2013 it could enable patients to live free from the fear of sickle cell crises hanging over them\".",
      "Asiawu Imam, 26, lives in London, where she works as a nurse looking after people who have sickle cell disorder. She also lives with the condition.",
      "When she was younger she was in and out of hospital three to four times a year with painful sickle cell crises.",
      "\"It feels like a stabbing pain, like someone is stabbing you form the inside outwards. It can last anything from half an hour to four days. It is excruciating,\" she said.",
      "The therapy being made available on the NHS gives her hope, and a sense to the community that people with the condition are being taken seriously.",
      "\"This is going to be a life-changing moment for many of my patients.\"",
      "How the gene therapy works",
      "It is a multi-step process.",
      "First, blood stem cells from a patient's bone marrow (where all blood cells originate) are removed from the body.",
      "In the laboratory, a gene-editing tool called Crispr is used.",
      "This allows a specific gene to be pinpointed and very precise editing to take place.",
      "However, instead of directly editing a faulty gene, Casgevy instead takes advantage of a process that happens when babies are in the womb, where they make red blood cells with foetal haemoglobin (a key protein that carries oxygen). This switches to the adult form once they are born.",
      "Crucially foetal haemoglobin is not affected by sickle cell disease, so Crispr acts by dampening down the \"switch\" that makes the body produce the adult form.",
      "Patients have to undergo \"conditioning\" chemotherapy to make sure their bodies are ready to accept the edited stem cells.",
      "Modified stem cells are then transfused back into the body, where they multiply and increase the production of stable, well-functioning red cells.",
      "The full treatment must be considered carefully - it can involve lengthy stays in hospital and may have side effects, including headaches and bleeding problems.",
      "UK approves gene-edit drug for sickle cell disease",
      "First gene-editing therapy may cure blood disorder",
      "The only other current option for a cure is a stem cell transplant - but this can only happen if a closely matched donor is available. There is also a risk of the transplant being rejected.",
      "The gene therapy will be available in specialist centres in London, Manchester and Birmingham to people aged 12 and over who get recurrent sickle cell crises and who cannot find a donor for a stem cell transplant.",
      "John James, chief executive of the Sickle Cell Society, said: \"We are absolutely thrilled to see this groundbreaking gene therapy treatment available on the NHS\", adding \"the significance of this milestone for the sickle cell community could not be understated\".",
      "He said the news would \"give hope to many\" and was \"incredible\".",
      "However, he added: \"We remain acutely aware that not everyone with sickle cell will be eligible for the potentially life-changing benefits of Casgevy.",
      "\"There is still much work ahead to ensure that everyone living with sickle cell has access to the care, treatments, and support they deserve.\"",
      "The therapy has already been approved for another inherited blood disorder, transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia.",
      "It is already being given to patients in other countries such as France, Germany and Italy.",
      "Wales is also expected to provide it in the next few months."

      "Tobacco adverts were banned in 2002. But if you walk into a Sainsbury's or a Morrisons you may well see adverts for iQos, a device that uses an electric current to heat tobacco.",
      "Some are on flashing video screens in places where they can easily be seen by children. The BBC has also seen adverts in Morrisons for a similar device called Ploom.",
      "Heated tobacco is different from vapes, which contain nicotine but no tobacco, and they are much less popular. But tobacco companies are keen to promote it as a new revenue stream to replace dwindling cigarette sales.",
      "The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI), which represents local authority trading standards teams, says the ads are \"prohibited\" by the 2002 law.",
      "CTSI says the issue has never been tested in court, so it cannot say conclusively that running them is illegal.",
      "\"The only people who can definitively test it are the courts. Now the courts are chocka. Trading Standards is very stretched, and I think that's probably the reason why you're seeing more and more of these ads,\" Kate Pike, lead officer for tobacco and vaping at CTSI, told the BBC.",

      "How are the vaping rules changing?",
      "How many people still smoke in the UK?",
      "In June 2018, then-health minister Steve Brine wrote to the company that makes iQos, Philip Morris International (PMI), to say advertising for it was \"prohibited\" and to ask them to \"desist from such promotion in the future\".",
      "Two months later, he wrote to thank them for \"agreeing to comply with our request to stop advertising and promoting the iQos device\".",
      "PMI says it only agreed to suspend advertising, not stop.",
      "A spokesperson said: \"We maintain our view that communications regarding the iQos device at appropriate points of sale is lawful.\"",
      "Japan Tobacco International (JTI), which makes Ploom, said the 2002 law defines a tobacco product as something that is \"smoked, sniffed, sucked or chewed\", and because heated tobacco products do not produce smoke, they aren't covered by that definition.",
      "Morrisons cited the same argument. \"On that basis, we are comfortable that it is legal for heated tobacco products to be advertised in store,\" it said.",
      "Sainsbury's said the ads were \"in line with current tobacco legislation\".",
      "Both supermarkets say they do not sell the devices to children.",
      "PMI and JTI say their heated tobacco devices are only intended for existing nicotine and tobacco users.",
      "Hazel Cheeseman, chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health, said supermarkets advertising these products was \"disgraceful behaviour\".",
      "\"[It] puts pressure on overstretched enforcement services and risks introducing children and young people to new tobacco products.\"",
      "The government would not say whether it still thinks advertising heated tobacco is prohibited.",
      "A spokesperson said: \"This government's landmark Tobacco and Vapes Bill will enhance existing legislation, including on advertising, and put us on track for a smoke-free UK.\"",
      "The forthcoming bill is expected to ban all advertising of nicotine and tobacco products including nicotine pouches and vapes.",
      "The UK's biggest supermarket Tesco said it does not run tobacco ads, while a spokesperson for Asda said it doesn't advertise tobacco products \"in order to comply with current legislation as we understand it\"."

    "summary": "How might the UK be affected by Trump's tariffs, even if they are not imposed on the UK?",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has been unclear about whether he will impose tariffs on the UK but  economists warn there are still ways Britain could be negatively affected by the president's wider trade policies even if it avoids being hit directly.",
      "The impact could be felt through slower growth in some of the UK's important trading partners. Industrial exports could be diverted from the US and flood the UK market and there could be impacts on our financial markets, including a possible increase to borrowing costs.",
      "Asked about future tariffs, Trump told the BBC on Sunday night: \"The UK is way out of line but I'm sure that one\u2026 I think that one can be worked out.\"",
      "The president did not specify in which way he regarded the UK as being \"out of line\".",
      "One of the justifications Trump has given for imposing tariffs on countries is they have a trade surplus with the US - in other words they sell more to the US than they import from America.",
      "He has claimed these trade surpluses amount to \"massive subsidies that we're giving to Canada and to Mexico\".",
      "The tariffs on Mexico were paused for a month by Trump on Monday but the president has complained about unbalanced trade with the EU, saying on Sunday: \"They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products, they take almost nothing and we take everything from them. Millions of cars, tremendous amounts of food and farm products.\"",
      "So one way the UK might be seen to be out of line in the mind of Trump - and at risk of tariffs - is if Britain was also running a trade surplus with America.",
      "Does the UK have a trade surplus with the US?",
      "The UK's Office for National Statistics estimates the UK had a surplus of around \u00a371bn in trade with the US in 2023, the most recent full year for which we have data.",
      "But the American statistics office, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, estimates the US had a surplus on its trade with the UK in that year of $14.5bn, around \u00a312bn.",
      "How can both be true?",
      "The two stats agencies have looked at this discrepancy and agree it is due to different ways of measuring trade.",
      "One factor is the UK agencies, unlike their US counterparts, do not count trade flows through British crown dependencies such as the Isle of Man, some of which are significant financial services hubs and markedly affect the overall figures.",
      "Another key, related, element seems to be differences in the measurement of services trade - things such as banking and finance - as opposed to physical goods.",
      "But the bottom line is there is still a degree of uncertainty about what precisely is driving the overall difference in the statistics and both agencies are trying to work it out.",
      "In the meantime, the UK government will doubtless be hoping President Trump prefers to use the US data, which shows America is selling more to the UK than it is buying - and will focus on the goods rather than services trade.",
      "If the president were to impose a blanket tariff on UK exports to the US it would affect around \u00a360bn of goods sent in 2023, according to the UK's figures.",
      "Pharmaceutical products accounted for \u00a38.8bn of the UK's goods exports to the US in that year, cars \u00a36.4bn and power generation machinery \u00a36.4bn.",
      "While the immediate impact of the tariffs would be to make the price of these imported goods for US firms and consumers higher, over time they could reduce American demand for them, which could have a negative impact on the UK firms exporting them.",
      "How else could the UK be affected?",
      "There are other ways in which Britain could be negatively affected by US tariffs on other countries.",
      "Slower growth in the global economy and, in particular, the EU - with which the UK still does around half of its trade - would impede the UK's growth prospects.",
      "If our trading partners were to fall into recession due to tariffs, analysts say they would cut interest rates and their currencies would drop in value making British exports to them more expensive.",
      "\"The US imposing tariffs on our other trading partners will still have a negative effect on the UK economy through its effect on supply chains and the exchange rate,\" said Ahmet Kaya, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR).",
      "Niesr has estimated that the 25% tariffs the US has threatened to impose on Mexico and Canada could reduce UK GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points in 2025.",
      "Some economists warn exports - such as Chinese-made steel - that might get diverted from the US markets due to the new tariffs, could be sold at below the cost of production, or \"dumped\" in UK markets, which might have a negative impact on the sales of UK steel producers.",
      "Some analysts say higher US interest rates as a result of the tariffs could also spill over to UK borrowing markets.",
      "One of the reasons UK government borrowing costs, or Gilt yields, temporarily spiked upwards in January, was because American government bond yields had also risen.",
      "\"The main threat to the UK economy from Trump's tariffs may well be the spillover from higher US interest rates, rather than tariffs themselves,\" says the economist Julian Jessop.",
      "\"US and UK government bond yields are now moving in lockstep again. If the Fed [US central bank] is more reluctant to cut US rates, as seems likely, borrowing costs will be higher for longer in the UK as well.\"",
      "Higher borrowing costs could slow the UK economy and also put pressure on the UK government to cut public spending or raise taxes in order to keep within its chosen borrowing rules.",

    "story": [
      "The government will step in more quickly to help struggling schools based on the findings of new Ofsted report cards, the education secretary has said.",
      "Bridget Phillipson said in a speech on Monday that the old single-word Ofsted judgements, which were scrapped last year, were \"too blunt\" and \"too vague\" to serve a purpose.",
      "She said new regional teams, with a budget of up to \u00a3100,000 per school, would help turn around the 600 \"stuck\" schools in England which had received back-to-back negative judgements from Ofsted.",
      "However, the report cards have drawn strong criticism from school leaders, who said the proposals risk \"replicating the worst aspects of the current system\".",
      "Prof Julia Waters, whose sister Ruth Perry took her own life after an Ofsted inspection, said it appeared to be \"a rehash of the discredited and dangerous system it is meant to replace\".",
      "The changes follow a major public debate around Ofsted after a coroner ruled that an inspection contributed to the death of primary school head teacher Mrs Perry in 2023.",
      "Phillipson pushed back on the criticism of the report cards after her speech, saying parents wanted more information about schools.",
      "She also said she was \"delighted to see the debate raging\" over the proposed reforms, saying \"that is how we shape the best education system\".",
      "She said report cards would provide \"rich, granular insight\" which would help to deliver \"tailored\" support for struggling schools.",
      "Those schools which do not improve will be transferred to a successful academy trust, even if they are already run by a different academy or a council.",
      "Under Ofsted's proposals, the old one or two-word judgements, ranging across four grades from \"Outstanding\" to \"Inadequate\", will be replaced from the 2025 autumn term by a report card describing what inspectors have found on key aspects of each school, including:",
      "Quality of educationBehaviour and attendancePersonal developmentLeadership and management",
      "Quality of education",
      "Behaviour and attendance",
      "Personal development",
      "Leadership and management",
      "There will be five possible grades for each area, which are also one or two words in length: \"causing concern\", \"attention needed\", \"secure\", \"strong\" and \"exemplary\".",
      "The grading scales will focus on how schools support disadvantaged and vulnerable pupils, and there will be more emphasis on the local circumstances in which schools operate.",
      "A separate part of the report card will say whether the school's duties around safeguarding have been met.",
      "The new format will be used for inspections across all settings, from early years to further education colleges, but will be tailored to the type of provider, Ofsted said.",
      "Ofsted boss Sir Martyn Oliver said the proposals were designed to \"raise standards and improve the lives of children, particularly the most disadvantaged\".",
      "He said the \"suite of grades\" would give parents \"much more detail\" and help identify a school's strengths and areas for improvement.",
      "However, school leaders' unions said the new system would add \"enormous pressure\" to schools, and could \"worsen an already severe recruitment and retention crisis\" in teaching.",
      "Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the plans would generate a \"new league table based on the sum of Ofsted judgements across at least 40 points of comparison\".",
      "It would be \"bewildering for teachers and leaders, never mind the parents whose choices these reports are supposedly intended to guide\", he added.",
      "Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the plans would \"do little to reduce the enormous pressure school leaders are under\".",
      "Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the National Education Union, said the five-point grading scale \"maintains the current blunt, reductive approach that cannot capture the complexity of school life nor provide more meaningful information to parents\".",
      "As well as criticism over its single-word judgements, Sir Martyn has also previously said Ofsted's inspection process should be \"far more empathetic\".",
      "Those comments came in the wake of the inquest into Ruth Perry's death, in which the coroner said the inspection at her school had \"lacked fairness, respect and sensitivity\" and was at times \"rude and intimidating\".",
      "Ofsted removed its practice of issuing overall grades for a school at the start of the current academic year, bringing in a temporary system of grading individual aspects of a school's performance, ahead of the introduction of report cards later this year.",
      "Wirral head teacher Stuart Mycroft had his school, Castleway Primary, inspected under the current system in the autumn term.",

      "He said the inspection process had been confrontational and unpleasant.",
      "\"The impact emotionally was huge,\" he said. \"I was absolutely exhausted.\"",
      "Ofsted's consultation on its new report cards will run until 22 April. It said it would be trialling the new system over the coming months."

      "Cooper said AI was \"industrialising the scale\" of sexual abuse against children and said government measures \"may have to go further.\"",
      "Other laws set to be introduced include making it an offence to run websites where paedophiles can share child sexual abuse content or provide advice on how to groom children. That would be punishable by up to 10 years in prison.",
      "And the Border Force will be given powers to instruct individuals who they suspect of posing a sexual risk to children to unlock their digital devices for inspection when they attempt to enter the UK, as CSAM is often filmed abroad. Depending on the severity of the images, this will be punishable by up to three years in prison.",

      "\"Of course, we understand that keeping a cat locked up inside all the time, it is really difficult to provide for their welfare, so it's really about striking a balance between protecting Scottish wildlife and ensuring cats have good welfare,\" she said.",
      "Microchipping of all domestic cats is currently not compulsory in Scotland, unlike in England and Wales, and this was another recommendation from the advisers.",
      "\"A proper database allows us to see where cats have come from and reduce the number of strays and feral cats, which have very poor welfare in Scotland - they are not well adapted to live in Scotland,\" Prof Dwyer said.",

      "Violent and extremist videos are still online despite government calls for their removal, the home secretary has told the BBC.",
      "Yvette Cooper condemned tech giants for failing to take down disturbing videos, including footage watched by the Southport killer, calling their response \"disgraceful\" and a clear breach of their \"moral responsibilities\".",
      "Last week it emerged that Axel Rudakubana, who murdered three young girls and seriously injured eight other children and two adults at a dance class in July, had watched graphic footage of a knife attack in Australia and downloaded an academic study of an Al-Qaeda training manual.",
      "Cooper told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that, despite her letter to X, Meta, TikTok, Google, and YouTube, much of the harmful content is still available.",

      "In the home secretary's letter, which was co-written with Technology Secretary Peter Kyle, Cooper said that, while possession of the al-Qaeda study was illegal under existing anti-terror laws, Rudakubana had been \"able to easily obtain access\" to it.",
      "Kuenssberg asked Cooper why, given her position as home secretary, she appeared to be powerless to stop it. The home secretary said the Online Safety Act, which comes into force this spring, will require social media platforms to remove illegal content. She warned that the government is ready to take further steps if these companies don't comply.",
      "Visibly angry, Cooper said: \"They really should be doing more, but this will mean if they don't, then there will be new penalties brought in. Much stronger action can be taken against them and then further stronger measures on the protection of children later in the year.\"",

      "\"Different organisations all have partial responsibilities, but that network collectively failed to identify the scale of risk that this young man poses.\"",
      "Asked what she proposed as a remedy to the problem, Cooper said \"the system needs to be strengthened.\"",
      "She pointed out that when someone demonstrates clear ideological extremism, such as Islamist extremism, the Prevent programme is well-equipped to intervene. But when individuals, like Rudakubana, show a dangerous obsession with extreme violence \u2013 without a clear ideology \u2013 the current system struggles to address the threat.",
      "\"The impact of what they do may be terrorising in the same way,\" she said, explaining that such individuals can cause widespread fear, even if their motives are not linked to terrorism.",
      "Kuenssberg once again pressed the home secretary on a solution and Cooper acknowledged that, in some cases, mental health services might need to take the lead, while in others, the police or social services should be more involved.",
      "She claimed that the current approach is a legacy of previous failures and suggested that the inception of youth prevention partnerships, which would bring together different agencies, could be a step towards a more coordinated response.",

      "\"We are not keeping up with the challenge that we're seeing,\" she said.",

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced at the end of January that the government would look at changing laws to allow perpetrators of \"extreme individualised violence,\" like Rudakubana, to be charged with terrorism offences.",

      "The plans are part of one of the government's key missions, a drive to decarbonise the UK's electricity system by 2030. Just over half of our power currently comes from wind, solar, nuclear and biomass - organic matter.  The government wants to raise that to 95% by 2030 - just five years' time.",
      "The target is ambitious, and controversial. Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband, told the BBC it is essential to \"cut bills, tackle the climate crisis and give us energy security\".",

      "\"You need the solar farms, you need the rooftop solar. You need onshore wind, you need offshore wind, you need nuclear. You need all of these things,\" he says.",
      "It will also mean more pylons, cables and substations. But what about the local communities who told us they felt they were not being heard and feared their concerns would be overridden?",
      "\"The answer is to listen to local people but to make decisions. That's what our country needs,\" Mr Milliband says.",
      "He says the government has committed to provide direct benefits to affected communities via community funds, he adds. People who live near transmission lines could also have discounts on their energy bills.",
      "But Mr Miliband also says: \"I can't say to you local people will have a veto over individual projects in their area.\"",

      "The Climate Change Committee, an independent body that advises the government on the most efficient way to achieve its climate targets, says the industry has reasons for choosing pylons.",
      "\"One of which is cost, in many cases, it's the cheapest route to delivering clean electricity to people from where it's produced,\" says chief executive Emma Pinchbeck. \"And that's important because ultimately consumers are paying for that infrastructure on their energy bills.",
      "\"The second is technical. We're talking about high voltage lines in many cases. These are really big cables and it's often better for the physics of the energy system to have them up in the air and accessible.\"",

      "The county is a potential hub for new energy projects. Miles of trenches may be dug for cabling, large new electricity substations and converter stations have been proposed, and plans for offshore wind farms have already been approved.",
      "Like Eileen in Aberdeenshire, Fiennes questions the impact on the local landscape and whether alternatives - like building offshore grid infrastructure and using undersea cabling so the electricity can be brought ashore on former industrial sites - are being overlooked.",
      "\"We need this energy. The planet is lost without it,\" he says. \"But what's the best version of bringing in this green, clean energy?\"",
      "William Rose meets us on the farm in Lincolnshire he has run for more than half a century. Nearby, three large solar farms have been approved and another is proposed. Soon the fields could be full of ordered ranks of metal frames holding millions of shiny solar panels.",

      "Ukrainians can again bring their children to join them in the UK, after the government reversed changes to visa rules.",
      "Last February - without notice - the government restricted eligibility so Ukrainians without the right to live in the UK permanently could no longer sponsor people under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which allows people to host those fleeing the war.",
      "Charities said this left families torn apart, with some desperate parents resorting to illegal routes to bring their children to the UK.",
      "They welcomed the announcement as a \"huge relief\" for parents separated from their children but warned it will not help those forced apart from other family members such as siblings or parents.",
      "More than 190,000 people have come to the UK under the Homes for Ukraine scheme since it was launched in March 2022, following the Russian invasion.",
      "However, under changes brought in last February under the Conservatives, only British or Irish citizens, or those with the right to live in the UK permanently, have been able to act as sponsors, who provide somewhere for people to live.",
      "This meant Ukrainians living in the UK without permanent residence could no longer sponsor family members to join them in the UK.",
      "At the same time the Ukraine Family Scheme, which allowed Ukrainians to join family members who already had permanent residence in the UK, was also closed.",

      "Ukraine family visa scheme closes to new applicants",
      "The government has now announced a parent or legal guardian who is in the UK under any of the visa schemes for Ukrainians can apply to sponsor their child under the Homes for Ukraine scheme.",
      "Valentyna - not her real name - applied for her 12-year-old son to join her in the UK last August but her application had remained pending because Ukrainians were no longer allowed to act as sponsors.",
      "She first came to the UK before the invasion for seasonal work on a farm and extended her visa when the war broke out.",
      "Her son was staying with relatives in Odessa while she found somewhere permanent to live before applying for him to join her.",
      "Valentyna has not seen her son for six months and became emotional when asked how it felt to be separated from him.",
      "She told the BBC the change in the rules gave her hope they would finally be reunited.",
      "Dora-Olivia Vicol, chief executive of Work Rights Centre, a charity supporting migrants, said: \"It will come as a huge relief to those parents who have been separated from their children, and will finally be able to bring them to the UK to reunite in safety.\"",
      "She added: \"However, this action does not help those who have been forced apart from other family members, including siblings, parents or partners.",
      "\"We know there are many Ukrainians in the UK who left behind elderly, sick or disabled relatives with the belief they would be able to bring them later. They face a cruel choice: leave the safety of the UK to care for them in Ukraine, or remain in safety leaving their loved ones vulnerable at risk.\"",
      "The charity says it has heard from hundreds of Ukrainians separated from family members and trying to bring them to the UK.",
      "Settled, another charity which supports Ukrainians applying for visas, said some families had resorted to bringing their children to join them through illegal routes, rather than leave them in danger.",
      "Yuliia Ismail, an immigration advisor for the charity, said: \"We ask that the Home Office now acts quickly to decide outstanding applications from children stuck in Ukrainian conflict zones some of which have been in limbo for almost a year.\"",
      "A Home Office spokesperson said: \"Under the previous government, a change was made to the Homes for Ukraine scheme, which meant that parents could not sponsor their children to join them in the UK even if they had appropriate accommodation.",
      "\"We have taken urgent action to resolve this issue, which will now enable parents with Ukraine Scheme visas to sponsor their children to join them in the UK. These will apply to both applications that have already been made, as well as future applications.\""

    "story": [
      "The Home Office's response to the \"serious and growing problem\" of violence against women and girls (VAWG) has been ineffective, the UK's spending watchdog has said.",
      "In a report published on Friday, the National Audit Office (NAO) said the department had \"not led an effective whole-system response\" to the rising incidence of rape and sexual assault recorded by police.",
      "Its efforts as the lead on the government's response to VAWG have so far \"not improved outcomes\" for victims, the report found.",
      "A Home Office spokesperson said the report had looked at the previous government's \"failure to deliver systemic change\", and that Labour was \"delivering a step-change in the government's response\".",
      "The report noted that three separate strategies aimed at reducing VAWG have been published since 2010, when the Conservative party began its 14 years in power.",
      "But the NAO said its own analysis of Office for National Statistics data showed the percentage of women aged 16 to 59 in England and Wales to have suffered a sexual assault was estimated to be 4.3% in 2023-24, up from 3.4% in 2009-10.",
      "It said incidents of rape and sexual assault recorded by police had increased almost fourfold during the same period, from 34,000 to 123,000 - but cautioned that this could be partially explained by improved recording of these crimes.",
      "The NAO also found \"little evidence\" that the Home Office had improved on earlier strategies, while the department and the wider government had \"a poor understanding of what works to prevent and tackle VAWG\".",
      "The report added that as part of the 2021 strategy, at least \u00a34.2m had been spent on research into preventing VAWG, but the projects it funded were \"yet to provide insights to inform any future interventions\".",
      "The report noted that \"low charge rate and long wait times\" contributed to a considerable number of rape victims dropping out before cases reached a conviction.",
      "Meanwhile, only a minority of domestic abuse cases recorded by police led to charges, the NAO said.",
      "In 2021, under the previous Conservative government, the department created a dedicated team to lead VAWG strategy.",
      "The NAO said the Home Office \"found it challenging to get buy-in from other government departments\" and had a \"limited understanding\" of the extent of resources devoted to addressing VAWG across government.",
      "Its dedicated team did not meet until a year after the launch, the NAO found, and had only met four times in total.",
      "The Home Office \"does not know what effect the government's work is having on VAWG\", the report said.",
      "The NAO said: \"Government's efforts to tackle violence against women and girls have not yet improved outcomes for the victims of these crimes.",
      "\"The lack of an effective, cross-government approach and a limited understanding of what works to help reduce these crimes, means the Home Office cannot be confident that government is doing the best it can to keep women and girls safe.\"",

      "Andrea Simon, director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: \"The lack of attention to prevention is deplorable, especially as we know VAWG is significantly under-reported.\"",
      "But she added that the strategy's \"worth\" could not \"be determined solely on a value-for-money basis\".",

      "As Leeds West MP, Reeves had opposed proposals for a new terminal at the Yorkshire site over environmental and noise concerns.",
      "On Wednesday, Reeves announced the government's backing of a third runway at London Heathrow and the re-opening of the Doncaster Sheffield airport, citing the progress of \"sustainable aviation\" since the pandemic.",

      "Speaking in Yorkshire following the government decision to back a third runway at Heathrow, the chancellor said \"sustainable aviation and economic growth go hand-in-hand\".",
      "She defended her previous position of opposing the Leeds Bradford expansion, insisting \"a lot has changed since 2020 when those plans last came forward - no one was flying because it was during the pandemic, but also the way we fly has changed\".",

      "Better training and coaching can help, but the amount of money involved may not sit well with a Treasury that's in savings mode.",
      "That's complicated enough - and that's before you even get to the finances and the politics.",
      "On the finances, this round of welfare reform is designed to generate savings that can be \"scored\", in other words accounted for, by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) at the next Budget in the autumn.",
      "But those involved in past Budgets caution that it is \"basically impossible\" to persuade the OBR that the savings will actually happen.",
      "And then there's the politics.",
      "As McSweeney, now Sir Keir's chief of staff, found - the Labour Party is deeply committed to the welfare state and deeply anxious about anything which looks like the safety net is fraying.",
      "That's not just true of party members but MPs too. Among the vast 2024 intake of Labour MPs, one of their most common reasons for getting involved in the Labour Party was opposition to Conservative austerity and welfare cuts.",
      "That means that even some of those most loyal to Starmer and Reeves are privately expressing significant anxiety about the direction of travel.",
      "Some of these tensions are beginning to spill into public view.",
      "At PMQs this week Debbie Abrahams, the Labour chair of the work and pensions select committee, said that \"speculation\" about billions of pounds of savings to be found from the social security budget had left \"many vulnerable claimants [feeling] worried\".",
      "She warned the prime minister that \"language matters\".",
      "Senior Labour figures involved in the discussions are adamant that it is Reeves and Starmer who are in line with public opinion, not concerned Labour MPs.",
      "One complained: \"If you ask Labour MPs whether they'd rather be on the side of the public or on the side of a lot of the Labour movement and vocal disability campaigners - well, for some of them that's a marginal call.\"",
      "Others caution about public opinion on this issue though: \"The public think they support welfare cuts until they hear a story about someone they feel sympathy for losing money. Then they don't.\"",
      "Some older hands warn of how quickly the government could be left out of step with its base, pointing to the party's decision to abstain on a Conservative welfare bill in July 2015.",
      "Such was the scale of Labour members' fury that Conservative welfare cuts were not being opposed, it is seen by many as the main reason that Jeremy Corbyn's longshot leadership campaign took off.",
      "Jon Ashworth, a former shadow cabinet minister who is still close to top party figures, urged the government to put \"helping people move into good, well-paid jobs\" at the heart of their arguments for reform.",
      "He said: \"The welfare system as currently designed traps people out of work and actively denies people who want to work real, genuine help.\"",
      "These political considerations are not new territory for Reeves. She was shadow work and pensions secretary for two years before the 2015 general election.",
      "Her vow that Labour would be \"tougher than the Tories on benefits\" made her deeply controversial with the party's grassroots for years afterwards. Speaking to the New Statesman in 2021, Reeves acknowledged she may have made her point \"badly\", but insisted that \"spending more on benefits wasn't always a sign of success. And actually the benefits bill goes up when society fails.\"",
      "These dilemmas may not be new for Reeves, but they have left some of her colleagues feeling uneasy at best.",
      "\"Of course I'm worried about the politics of this,\" one minister said.",
      "\"Anyone with a brain would worry about this.\"",

    "title": "Five key impacts of Brexit five years on",
    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 01:41:46 GMT",
    "summary": "The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Five years ago, on 31 January 2020, the UK left the European Union.",
      "On that day, Great Britain severed the political ties it had held for 47 years, but stayed inside the EU single market and customs union for a further 11 months to keep trade flowing.",
      "Northern Ireland had a separate arrangement.",
      "Brexit was hugely divisive, both politically and socially, dominating political debate and with arguments about its impacts raging for years.",
      "Five years on from the day Britain formally left the EU, BBC Verify has examined five important ways Brexit has affected Britain.",
      "1) Trade",
      "Economists and analysts generally assess the impact of leaving the EU single market and customs union on 1 Jan 2021 on the UK's goods trade as having been negative.",
      "This is despite the fact that the UK negotiated a free trade deal with the EU and avoided tariffs - or taxes - being imposed on the import and export of goods.",
      "The negative impact comes from so-called \"non-tariff barriers\" - time consuming and sometimes complicated new paperwork that businesses have to fill out when importing and exporting to the EU.",
      "There is some disagreement about how negative the specific Brexit impact has been.",
      "Some recent studies suggest that UK goods exports are 30% lower than they would have been if we had not left the single market and customs union.",
      "Some suggest only a 6% reduction.",
      "We can't be certain because the results depend heavily on the method chosen by researchers for measuring the \"counterfactual\", i.e what would have happened to UK exports had the country stayed in the EU.",
      "One thing we can be reasonably confident of is that small UK firms appear to be more adversely affected than larger ones.",
      "They have been less able to cope with the new post-Brexit cross-border bureaucracy. That's supported by surveys of small firms.",
      "It's also clear UK services exports - such as advertising and management consulting - have done unexpectedly well since 2021.",
      "But the working assumption of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's independent official forecaster, is still that Brexit in the long-term will reduce exports and imports of goods and services by 15% relative to otherwise. It has held this view since 2016, including under the previous Government.",
      "And the OBR's other working assumption is that the fall in trade relative to otherwise will reduce the long-term size of the UK economy by around 4% relative to otherwise, equivalent to roughly \u00a3100bn in today's money.",
      "The OBR says it could revise both these assumptions based on new evidence and studies. The estimated negative economic impact could come down if the trade impact judged to be less severe. Yet there is no evidence, so far, to suggest that it will turn into a positive impact.",
      "After Brexit, the UK has been able to strike its own trade deals with other countries.",
      "There have been new trade deals with Australia and New Zealand and the government has been pursuing new agreements with the US and India.",
      "But their impact on the economy is judged by the government's own official impact assessments to be small relative to the negative impact on UK- EU trade.",
      "However, some economists argue there could still be potential longer term economic benefits for the UK from not having to follow EU laws and regulations affecting sectors such as Artificial Intelligence.",
      "2) Immigration",
      "Immigration was a key theme in the 2016 referendum campaign, centred on freedom of movement within the EU, under which UK and EU citizens could freely move to visit, study, work and live.",
      "There has been a big fall in EU immigration and EU net migration (immigration minus emigration) since the referendum and this accelerated after 2020 due to the end of freedom of movement.",
      "But there have been large increases in net migration from the rest of the world since 2020.",
      "A post-Brexit immigration system came into force in January 2021.",
      "Under this system, EU and non-EU citizens both need to get work visas in order to work in the UK (except Irish citizens, who can still live and work in the UK without a visa).",
      "The two main drivers of the increase in non-EU immigration since 2020 are work visas (especially in health and care) and international students and their dependents.",
      "UK universities started to recruit more non-EU overseas students as their financial situation deteriorated.",
      "The re-introduction of the right of overseas students to stay and work in Britain after graduation by Boris Johnson's government also made the UK more attractive to international students.",
      "Subsequent Conservative governments reduced the rights of people on work and student visas to bring dependents and those restrictions have been retained by Labour.",
      "3) Travel",
      "Freedom of movement ended with Brexit, also affecting tourists and business travellers.",
      "British passport holders can no longer use \"EU/EEA/CH\" lanes at EU border crossing points.",
      "People can still visit the EU as a tourist for 90 days in any 180 day period without requiring a visa, provided they have at least three months remaining on their passports at the time of their return.",
      "EU citizens can stay in the UK for up to six months without needing a visa.",
      "However, a bigger change in terms of travel is on the horizon.",
      "In 2025, the EU is planning to introduce a new electronic Entry Exit System (EES) - an automated IT system for registering travellers from non-EU countries.",
      "This will register the person's name, type of the travel document, biometric data (fingerprints and captured facial images) and the date and place of entry and exit.",
      "It will replace the manual stamping of passports. The impact of this is unclear, but some in the travel sector have expressed fears it could potentially add to border queues as people leave the UK.",
      "The EES was due to be introduced in November 2024 but was postponed until 2025, with no new date for implementation yet set.",
      "And six months after the introduction of EES, the EU says it will introduce a new European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS). UK citizens will have to obtain ETIAS clearance for travel to 30 European countries.",
      "ETIAS clearance will cost \u20ac7 (\u00a35.90) and be valid for up to three years or until someone's passport expires, whichever comes first. If people get a new passport, they need to get a new ETIAS travel authorisation.",
      "Meanwhile, the UK is introducing its equivalent to ETIAS for EU citizens from 2 April 2025 (though Irish citizens will be exempt). The UK permit - to be called an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - will cost \u00a316.",
      "4) Laws",
      "Legal sovereignty - the ability of the UK to make its own laws and not have to follow EU ones - was another prominent Brexit referendum campaign promise.",
      "To minimise disruption immediately following Brexit in 2020, the UK incorporated thousands of EU laws into UK law, becoming known as \"retained EU law\".",
      "According to the latest government count there were 6,901 individual pieces of retained EU law covering things like working time, equal pay, food labelling and environmental standards.",
      "The previous Conservative government initially set a deadline of the end of 2023 to axe these EU laws.",
      "But with so much legislation to consider there was concern there was not enough time to review all the laws properly.",
      "In May 2023 Kemi Badenoch - the Trade Secretary at the time - announced only 600 EU laws would be axed by the end of 2023, with another 500 financial services laws set to disappear later.",
      "Most were relatively obscure regulations and many of them had been superseded or become irrelevant.",
      "All other EU legislation was kept, though ministers reserved powers to change them in future.",
      "And the UK has changed some EU laws. For example, it banned the export of live animals from Great Britain for slaughter and fattening and changed EU laws on gene editing crops.",
      "Brexit has also given the UK more freedom in certain areas of tax law.",
      "EU member states are prohibited from charging VAT on education under an EU directive. Leaving the EU enabled Labour to impose VAT on private school fees.",
      "A zero rate of VAT on tampons and other sanitary products was introduced by the UK government in 2021. This would not have been possible in the EU as the EU VAT Directive at the time mandated a minimum 5% tax on all sanitary products. However, in April 2022 the EU's rules changed so the bloc also now allows a zero rate on sanitary products.",
      "5) Money",
      "The money the UK sent to the EU was a controversial theme in the 2016 referendum, particularly the Leave campaign's claim the UK sent \u00a3350m every week to Brussels.",
      "The UK's gross public sector contribution to the EU Budget in 2019-20, the final financial year before Brexit, was \u00a318.3bn, equivalent to around \u00a3352m per week, according to the Treasury.",
      "The UK continued paying into the EU Budget during the transition period but since 31 December 2020 it has not made these contributions.",
      "However, those EU Budgets contributions were always partially recycled to the UK via payments to British farmers under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and \"structural funding\" - development grants to support skills, employment and training in certain economically disadvantaged regions of the nation. These added up to \u00a35bn in 2019-20.",
      "Since the end of the transition period UK governments have replaced the CAP payments directly with taxpayer funds.",
      "Ministers have also replaced the EU structural funding grants, with the previous government rebranding them as \"a UK Shared Prosperity\" fund.",
      "The UK was also receiving a negotiated \"rebate\" on its EU Budget contributions of around \u00a34bn a year - money which never actually left the country,",
      "So the net fiscal benefit to the UK from not paying into the EU Budget is closer to to \u00a39bn per year, although this figure is inherently uncertain because we don't know what the UK's contribution to the EU Budget would otherwise have been.",
      "The UK has also still been paying the EU as part of the official Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and its financial settlement. The Treasury says the UK paid a net amount of \u00a314.9bn between 2021 and 2023, and estimated that from 2024 onwards it will have to pay another \u00a36.4bn, although spread over many years.",
      "Future payments under the withdrawal settlement are also uncertain in part because of fluctuating exchange rates.",
      "However, there are other ways the UK's finances remained connected with the EU, separate from the EU Budget and the Withdrawal Agreement.",
      "After Brexit took effect, the UK also initially stopped paying into the Horizon scheme, which funds pan-European scientific research.",
      "However, Britain rejoined Horizon in 2023 and is projected by the EU to pay in around \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32bn) per year on average to the EU budget for its participation, although historically the UK has been a net financial beneficiary from the scheme because of the large share of grants won by UK-based scientists.",
      "The future",
      "There are, of course, a large number of other Brexit impacts which we have not covered here, ranging from territorial fishing rights, to farming, to defence. And with Labour looking for a re-set in EU relations, it's a subject that promises to be a continuing source of debate and analysis for many years to come.",
      "Clarification: This article has been updated to clarify the amount of time EU citizens can spend in the UK, visa free.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 11:00:14 GMT",
    "summary": "In choppy global seas, going for growth will require tricky navigation",
    "story": [
      "It has been a wild January for Rachel Reeves and frankly for economics in the UK and the world.",
      "When Labour swept to victory last summer, Reeves pledged she would be an \"iron\" chancellor, reining in public spending and improving the lives of working people through growing the economy. Without solid public finances, she argued, the government couldn't achieve any of its other aims.",
      "This month has tested that plan.",
      "It started off with a global bond market tantrum - UK borrowing costs hit their highest level for several years and the pound fell sharply.",
      "Some argued that Reeves's Budget decisions had made the UK more vulnerable to such shocks. The prime minister was forced to confirm Reeves had his backing after political opponents called for her resignation.",
      "The market turbulence sparked concerns that a verdict of sorts was being made on the chancellor.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this Parliament. That meant, the rise in global and UK debt interest costs would require some spending cuts.",
      "The message was sent out that the government, with its massive majority, could do and would do what it takes to keep to the self-imposed rules, which it said were \"non-negotiable\".",
      "The markets have now recovered all their negative moves. Short term and long term government borrowing costs are all lower than at the beginning of the year.",
      "While the \"gilt crisis\" hyperbole was overdone, there have been consequences.",
      "From doom to promises of a boom",
      "The chancellor sped up an already planned \"drumbeat\" of pro-growth measures, culminating in this week's speech. Reeves's counsel of doom and warnings about black holes and pain has been replaced by a promise of an investment boom.",
      "She has vowed a new runway at Heathrow, visas for those with AI and life science skills and said she would ease the non-dom ban to allow a more generous phase out of tax benefits.",
      "Alongside this are plans to make it easier to build, delays to new rules on banks and the ousting of the boss of the competition regulator, which shows she's serious on growth. As Meatloaf might have scripted for her: \"I would do anything for growth\".",
      "But Reeves's plans are not yet a fully fledged growth plan. Her announcements signal that she is willing to take a series of political hits to foster long term growth.",
      "The chancellor will deploy the near total executive power from her party's commons majority to flatten the sort of opposition that has prevented or critically delayed these sorts of plans in the past.",
      "Some outside advisers who support the chancellor say that stability is not enough, and nor is planning, and nor is deregulation.",
      "Reeves has not pledged any allocation of public money to these grand projects.",
      "Heathrow boss Thomas Woldbye sounded a little coy after plans for a third runway were confirmed, saying they would not spend more money on it unless they really believed it was going to happen.",
      "\"This will take years, it will take what I call Churchillian resolve and lots of ingenuity but we can trust a government that will be with us for many years to deliver this,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Reeves's UK growth mission",
      "Reeves is focusing on a very specific type of growth - increasing the supply of goods and services. She believes a lack of this supply side growth has held back the UK, and she is on a mission to remove barriers, and open new markets.",
      "For example, Reeves is very concerned about small businesses who have told her they have given up on exporting to the EU, because post Brexit it is now easier to export to the US.",
      "At a meeting last week, one business told the chancellor that exports to Europe meant for Christmas, had only just arrived.",
      "The problem is that while the chancellor awaits a long term growth spurt, she has prioritised stabilising public finances through significant tax rises.",
      "In April, employers will be hit with an increase in national insurance payments and a higher minimum wage. These costs could be passed on in price rises meaning inflation - already higher than target at 2.5%, could remain sticky.",
      "Reeves would have preferred employers to squeeze pay settlements rather than raise prices or cut staff.",
      "Retail and hospitality businesses using low wage labour will be most impacted by the bumper rise in minimum wages. Downing Street insiders acknowledge that many domestic business bosses are \"grumpy\" as they put it.",
      "The concern is whether the impact will show up in higher unemployment. At last October's Budget, the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted extra government spending would help boost the economy and bring unemployment down to 4% this year. Some outside forecasters now think it will top 5%.",
      "It is a critical few months for the animal spirits in the economy to reignite.",
      "How far will she go?",
      "But how far is Rachel Reeves willing to push this pro-growth agenda?",
      "Will she follow the US away from the decarbonisation path to benefit from cheaper hydrocarbon prices promised by President Trump? Will she accede to construction industry requests to import foreign workers to meet the target to build 1.5 million homes?",
      "Will she push the Brexit reset to remove all the barriers to UK-EU trade in food and farm products, and many goods too? Will she offer Britain to the global tech and pharma industries as a deregulatory haven from the EU and US respectively?",
      "Taken at face value, she will do most of this, with big political consequences. Take the Brexit reset. Cabinet ministers at The World Economic Forum were delighted with the tone of the EU's new trade chief Maros Sefcovic in his interview with me, saying he was open to Britain joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention (PEM).",
      "The arrangement allows for tariff-free trade of some goods from across dozens of countries in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.",
      "But if the UK demanded effective single market treatment in certain sectors, it would need to follow the EU rule book in those areas. There would be counter asks, such as extending EU fishing arrangements in UK waters, and some sort of youth cultural exchange scheme.",
      "The need for delicate diplomacy",
      "Push is coming to shove on these issues, and the question is whether the chancellor's pro growth agenda is the overwhelming factor in making decisions. I suspect it is.",
      "However, that approach will require delicate diplomacy in the middle of a potential goods tariff war. If Trump follows through on his threat of a universal tariff then the G7 could decide to coordinate retaliatory tariffs. Does the UK join in?",
      "What if the US decides it wants its allies to help contain China's tech ascendancy? What if Trump wants to deter the UK from rebuilding free-flowing trade with the EU?",
      "The sudden emergence of China's AI expertise via DeepSeek underlines how important it is to be nimble. There was only one mention of China in the government's big AI paper earlier this month - in Science Secretary Peter Kyle's foreword.",
      "The pharma industry is lobbying the government to quietly open the door for relocation of key top talent into the UK, concerned about the Trump / Robert F Kennedy Jr approach to medicines regulation. Our leading universities are saying that for the first time since Brexit, it's easier to recruit some of the very best international scientists who are not keen to bring up their families in Trump's America.",
      "Trump's decision to abandon Biden's green subsidies also levels the playing field for net zero investment here.",
      "After a tumultuous start to the year, with the US administration threatening different tariffs almost every day, and tech giant shares falling over concerns they've been overvalued in the light of China's AI app DeepSeek, the UK remains a safe haven for investors.",
      "The self declared iron chancellor remains very attached to stability. But zero growth is a form of stability too. In choppy global seas, going for growth is going to require some very tricky navigation - and it will make some big domestic political waves too.",

      "BBC Verify has examined some of the key numbers and claims.",
      "How slow is the UK's growth?",
      "The most recent official data shows there was virtually no growth in GDP - the overall size of the UK economy - between the July 2024 election and November 2024.",
      "And the latest medium term official growth forecast from the Office for Budget Responsiblity, the government's official forecaster, is for 1.6% GDP growth in 2029, which would be well below the pre-2008 financial crisis average growth of 2.8% a year.",
      "However, the International Monetary Fund has forecast that the UK's growth rate for 2025 and 2026 will be higher than in France and Germany.",
      "Lower rates of GDP growth would translate into slower growth in our wages and incomes and general living standards.",
      "Heathrow expansion",
      "The chancellor said that allowing Heathrow to build a third runway would \"create 100,000 jobs\", boost investment and exports and \"unlock futher growth\".",
      "She cited a new report by the consultancy Frontier Economics which found it could increase the UK's potential GDP by 2050 by 0.43%, around \u00a317bn.",
      "That is broadly in line with the findings of an independent commission by Sir Howard Davies in 2015, which concluded a third runway at Heathrow would support UK trade and enhance productivity and push up GDP by 0.65-0.75% by 2050 relative to otherwise.",
      "However, most analysts believe it would likely take many years before shovels went into the ground to start building a new runway, even with new reforms to speed up the planning process.",
      "And the government will have a difficult balancing act to both expand Heathrow and meet its climate goals.",
      "BBC Verify asked the Treasury for its source for the 100,000 jobs figure and it pointed to a 2017 report by the Department for Transport estimating that a new runway at Heathrow could add between 57,000 and 114,000 additional local jobs. Though that report added that \"these jobs are not additional at the national level, as some jobs may have been displaced from other airports or other sectors.\"",
      "Oxford-Cambridge Growth Corridor",
      "The chancellor in her speech claimed an Oxford and Cambridge Growth Corridor \"could add up to \u00a378bn to the UK economy by 2035\".",
      "This corridor is a resurrection of the previous government's plans to join Oxford and Cambridge with new transport links and allow those two university and research hubs to expand.",
      "In support of the chancellor's figure, the Treasury has cited research by an industry group called the Oxford-Cambridge Supercluster.",
      "This research shows that this \u00a378bn is a \"cumulative figure\" over 10 years, not the boost in a given year.",
      "The analysis suggests the project could add \u00a325bn in Gross Value Added (GVA) a year to the UK economy by 2035.",
      "That would constitute roughly a permanent 1% boost to UK GDP by that date.",
      "Estimates of the impacts of an infrastructure project on growth are inherently uncertain and very sensitive to the assumptions of researchers about what would have happened to growth if it had never been built.",
      "Yet most economists do believe infrastructure projects, especially those that allow already productive places to expand, will ultimately help the UK economy grow more rapidly than otherwise.",
      "Ben Caswell, a senior economist at The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr), said: \"Big infrastructure projects typically deliver growth over the long term, approximately 10 to 20 years.\"",
      "\"There may be a small demand side boost in the short term when shovels are in the ground, but nothing so significant that you would see it in headline GDP growth figures.",
      "\"However, after the project is complete, the supply capacity of the economy is permanently enhanced, and, all other things equal, that delivers higher sustained GDP growth than would have otherwise been.\"",
      "Pensions reform",
      "Another reform the chancellor says will be pro-growth is enabling UK companies to access the funds from their \"defined benefit pension\" pots, held on behalf of their workforces to fund their retirement.",
      "Defined benefit pension schemes guarantee an annual pension payment to retired workers, based on their salary while they were in work.",
      "Many of these defined benefit pension pots have moved into surplus in recent years due to the rise in interest rates since the pandemic, meaning their financial assets (their investments) are greater than their financial liabilities (what they have to pay out to pensioners).",
      "The Treasury has said that approximately 75% of schemes are now in surplus and that the total surplus adds up to \u00a3160bn.",
      "The chancellor wants to legislate to allow the firms to use these funds to invest, while keeping safeguards to protect and guarantee workers' pension pay-outs.",

      "At a glance: What was in Rachel Reeves's speech?",

      "The official Pension Regulator estimates that on one measurement the size in September 2024 was \u00a3207bn, but \u00a3137bn on a different measurement.",
      "The Treasury's estimate is roughly midway between the two.",
      "If such sums were deployed that could, in theory, make a positive difference to overall UK business investment, which is regarded by economists as both a short term and a long term driver of GDP growth.",
      "Total business investment in 2023, according to official data, was \u00a3258bn.",
      "But the size of any boost from this pension reform would depend on companies being willing to invest their surpluses, which is subject to great uncertainty as many firms have been looking to offload their defined benefit pension schemes to insurance companies in recent years.",

      "Many of those Labour MPs most in favour of what the chancellor has said in her speech on economic growth are part of the Labour Growth Group, a new alliance formed last year to push the government to deliver major infrastructure projects and housebuilding as fast as possible.",
      "MP Chris Curtis, the group's co-chair, told the BBC: \"Anyone worrying about the opposition the Chancellor will face should know there's more than 100 MPs in the Labour Growth Group who are ready to back her every step of the way in bringing this bold vision to life.\"",
      "He added: \"This speech was bullish and that's exactly what it needed to be \u2013 bullish on the potential of our economy and in taking on those who will stand in the way of realising that potential.\"",

His instant restatement of his opposition to the scheme  - because of its \"severe impact\" on noise, air pollution and climate change  - may well embolden Labour critics in the House of Commons, including within the government.",
      "One senior government source insisted this morning that Reeves's decision to publicly invite Heathrow to submit an application should be seen as just that - an invitation that will kick off a long process with plenty more opportunities for internal opponents to make their case.",

      "Of course, Heathrow was not the only meaty part of the chancellor's speech. There is some private unease among Labour MPs who represent seats in the Midlands and the north of England that the projects are mostly, but not all, located in the south.",
      "Even one Labour MP for a seat in the south of England urged the government to talk not only about the benefits of the developments to Oxford and Cambridge, but also to stress the benefits for the communities in between the two cities  - noting acidly that Reeves, Sir Keir Starmer and all the previous five Conservative prime ministers went to Oxford University.",
      "While the response of Labour MPs will play a big role in determining how Reeves's speech is assessed in Westminster, the actual delivery of her plans will rely in large part on private finance and local government.",
      "The entire speech was designed to boost business confidence in Britain's prospects. The decisions firms make over the coming weeks, months and years will help to show whether that was a success.",
      "When it comes to local government, some of the signs are not auspicious.",
      "The BBC revealed last month that local councils, many of them Labour-led, had told the government its housebuilding plans were \"unrealistic\" and \"impossible to achieve\".",
      "Ministers are eager to strike devolution deals across the country but in some areas on the growth corridor this is proving complicated.",
      "More housebuilding will also require new Labour MPs, many of whom claimed long-term Conservative seats in last year's election landslide, to face down local campaigners arguing against development and argue for prioritising growth instead.",
      "It was striking this afternoon how many centre-right think tanks, disappointed by the pace of building projects under the Conservatives, praised Reeves's approach this afternoon.",
      "Even among those most supportive of Reeves's agenda, some argue that plans for long-term growth need to be accompanied by short-term ways to boost Britons' living standards.",
      "The prime minister's \"plan for change\" shift at the end of last year was in part an attempt to move the main focus of the government away from targeting GDP and towards \"milestones\" tangible to people's everyday lives.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 17:02:12 GMT",
    "summary": "The asteroid named YR4 has a 1% chance of hitting Earth in 2032",
    "story": [
      "UN planetary defence organisations are closely monitoring an asteroid that has a tiny risk of hitting the Earth.",
      "The European Space Agency (ESA) has said that it has an almost 99% chance of safely passing Earth on 22 December 2032, but a possible impact \"cannot yet be entirely ruled out\".",
      "The probability that the asteroid, called 2024 YR4, may impact Earth on 22 December 2032 is currently estimated to be 1.3%.",
      "Dr Robert Massey of the Royal Astronomical Society, says that he is \"not panicking or losing sleep over it\".",
      "\"There is no need for alarm,\" he said. \"The thing about this kind of event is that historically they tend to go away when the calculations are refined.\"",
      "We need to be aware alert and we need to give astronomers the resources they need to track these kinds of threats so that we can take action as soon as possible.\"",
      "YR4 was detected on 27 December 2024. Astronomers calculated that it was between 40m and 90m across. This would have the power of a nuclear bomb were it to hit the Earth and cause severe damage if the impact was in a populated area.",
      "But it is much more likely that YR4 would fall into the ocean or a remote part of the planet. It is too far away from Earth and there are too many uncertainties at this stage to determine where a potential impact could occur in the unlikely event of a collision.",
      "Since early January, astronomers have been using telescopes to calculate the asteroid's size and trajectory more precisely. YR4 is now rated at level 3 out of 10 on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale: \"a close encounter that warrants attention from astronomers and the public\". A collision is only certain when it reaches 8, 9 or 10, with the numbers rising in line with the damage likely caused.",
      "When asteroids are initially calculated to have a small probability of hitting the Earth, that impact probability usually drops to zero after additional observations.",
      "This happened in 2004 when an asteroid called Apophis was calculated to have a 2.7% chance of striking Earth in 2029; further observations ruled out an impact.",
      "Any object that may be more than 50m wide and has a greater than 1% chance of hitting the Earth, triggers a set of precautionary measures. These are to ensure that the threat, however tiny, is closely monitored and, if necessary, steps are taken to nullify it.",
      "The first stage is to activate two UN-endorsed asteroid reaction groups: the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), chaired by Nasa, and the Space Mission Planning Advisory Group (SMPAG), chaired by the European Space Agency.",
      "The SMPAG is having a series of meetings this week to determine its next steps.  It has already concluded that it is too early to take immediate action but said that it would \"monitor the evolution of impact threat and possible knowledge about the size closely\".",
      "Another meeting to take decisions on future activities will be held towards the end of April or early May, or earlier, \"if the evolution of the threat merits\".",
      "If the asteroid's impact probability remains above the 1% threshold, SMPAG will provide recommendations to the UN and may begin to evaluate options.",
      "In the unlikely event YR4 were headed our way, one option would be to divert it by hitting it with a robotic spacecraft, as was successfully tested out with Nasa's Dart mission in 2022. That changed the course of an asteroid that was not on a collision course with the Earth.",
      "\"Nasa's Dart mission showed that we have the means to divert an asteroid, but only if we spot it early enough,\" says Dr Massey.",
      "YR4 is currently moving away from Earth in almost a straight line, making it difficult to accurately determine its precise orbit before it returns towards Earth.",
      "Over the next few months, the asteroid will begin to fade from view, after which  it will be monitored by ground and space telescopes.",
      "According to ESA \"It is possible that asteroid 2024 YR4 will fade from view before we are able to entirely rule out any chance of impact in 2032. In this case, the asteroid will likely remain on ESA's risk list until it becomes observable again in 2028.\""

      "Since then, there have been more adventures: last year he demonstrated Captain Kirk-like daring by travelling in an upgraded SpaceX capsule and performing the first commercial spacewalk.",
      "During the mission, he tested an experimental spacesuit and a new cost-saving protocol to exit and re-enter the spacecraft without using an airlock.",
      "The photograph of Mr Isaacman, silhouetted with the world at his feet, is now iconic \u2013 it demonstrated that this was not a playboy billionaire paying to act out Star Trek, but someone pushing the envelope of what was possible with current technology.",
      "And yet it is a more recent achievement that has drawn greater attention still \u2013 being nominated by Donald Trump in December to be the new head of Nasa.",
      "The question is why Trump chose him and what has he asked him to do \u2013 especially in the context that the President has appointed SpaceX owner Elon Musk to a government role to cut $2 trillion (\u00a31.6 trillion) off the Federal budget.",
      "The Nasa post is a presidential appointment, though it requires the confirmation of the US Senate. And if confirmed, Mr Isaacman's appointment will also raise broader questions about the future of humanity in space, given his vision for space travel for the masses. It also has significant implications for the future of the space agency, if Mr Isaacman's role leads to Nasa using the private sector even more than it does now.",
      "Brink of a second space age?",
      "In the past, the heads of Nasa have come from a variety of backgrounds: some, such as the previous incumbent Bill Nelson, have been former astronauts; others, such as Michael Griffin (in charge from 2005 to 2009) came from a government background, and before him Dan Goldin was an entrepreneur, striving to lower costs.",
      "Despite their disparate backgrounds, those who have led Nasa have all been company people, charged with defending the space agency and its values.",
      "And yet Mr Isaacman, along with Mr Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, is among a new wave of billionaires who have been challenging the old order in space.",
      "They have accelerated the pace of innovation and are aiming to dramatically reduce the cost of human space travel.",
      "On the day of his nomination in December, Mr Isaacman posted a statement on X that gave an early glimpse into his vision. \"This second space age has only just begun,\" he wrote.",
      "\"There will inevitably be a thriving space economy \u2013 one that will create opportunities for countless people to live and work in space\u2026 At Nasa, we will\u2026 usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilisation.\"",
      "Many presidents have talked about sending astronauts to the Moon since the end of the Apollo lunar landings of the 1960s and 70s, but Trump was the first to turn talk into action, authorising Nasa's Artemis programme to send humans back to the Moon during his first term. His record suggests that he is a big Nasa fan.",
      "But since then, two factors are likely to have changed his thinking: Nasa's rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), has been delayed and costs have spiralled; at the same time Mr Musk's SpaceX and Bezos's Blue Origin are developing reusable low-cost Moon rockets.",
      "That is a worrying backdrop for Nasa, according to Courtney Stadd of New York-based Beyond Earth Institute think tank.",
      "\"You have a government looking to slash,\" he said at a webinar hosted by Space News. \"If you are the new administrator, you are going in in that context, so you are going to have to look at everything that is a drain on your budget\u2026",
      "\"This next two years is going to be the equivalent of a tsunami and everything is on the table.\"",
      "Future of Nasa's moon rocket",
      "One of the biggest questions is what to do with the space agency's SLS Moon rocket. In 2021, Nasa's Office of Inspector General (OIG), which provides oversight of the space agency for Congress, reported that the cost was $4.1bn (\u00a33.3bn) for each and every launch.",
      "By contrast, SpaceX's equivalent rocket system, Starship, is estimated to cost around $100m (\u00a380m) per launch \u2013 and Musk has said he aims to bring the costs down further to $10m (\u00a38m) as he develops his system.",
      "Bezos's new Moon rocket, New Glenn, had its maiden test launch at the beginning of January. Blue Origin has not announced its cost per launch, but it is estimated currently to be around $68m (\u00a354.5m).",
      "Competition between the two billionaires is likely to speed up innovation and reduce costs further.",
      "Starship and New Glenn are projected to be cheaper because, unlike SLS, they are designed to be reusable. But \"that's only a part of the reason for the disparity in costs\", according to Dr Adam Baker, an expert on the space industry at Cranfield University.",
      "\"SpaceX is given a sum of money and contracted to deliver on time and on budget,\" he continues. \"They are driven by profit, and they want to minimise costs.",
      "\"A Nasa programme is not driven by profit; it is driven by the programme objectives and so those in charge don't think they need to track costs in the same way.",
      "\"There is a general acceptance that SLS has no future.\"",
      "Questions around spiralling costs",
      "The OIG could only come up with a best guess for the full cost of the Artemis programme in its review for Congress because, as it put it: \"Nasa lacks a comprehensive and accurate cost estimate that accounts for all programme costs.",
      "\"Instead, the Agency's plan presents a rough estimate that excludes $25bn (\u00a320bn) for key activities\".",
      "Nasa's project management of SLS is not an aberration \u2013 some would say it is typical. For example, the James Webb Space Telescope was given a $1bn (\u00a3800m) budget and a launch date of 2010 \u2013 but it cost ten times that amount and launched in 2021, earning it the nickname of \"the telescope that ate astronomy\".",
      "(Other important scientific programmes had to be scaled back, delayed or scrapped entirely to make way for the overruns.)",
      "It was a similar story of delays and budget overruns during the development of the Space Shuttle in the 1970s and the construction of the International Space Station in the 2000s.",
      "Nasa got away with it because it was responsible for arguably America's greatest moment when it sent the first astronauts to the Moon. The Apollo programme laid the foundations for America's technology businesses and ushered in a vibrant new era for the US.",
      "But the world has changed significantly since then, and Nasa has simply not kept up, according to Emeritus Prof John Logsdon, former director of the Space policy Institute at George Washington University. \"Changing the way the United States goes about its civilian space programme is long overdue.\"",
      "New light on the 'old way of doing things'",
      "The current model is to give so-called \"cost-plus\" contracts to big heritage aerospace companies, such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, which guarantee to pay the development costs and an agreed profit.",
      "The model gave the firms the financial reassurance they needed for ambitious projects such as the space shuttle, the SLS, and developing parts of the Saturn V rocket that took Apollo astronauts to the Moon, but these contracts provided no incentives to cut costs or increase efficiency. For example, there were no penalties for delays or cost overruns.",
      "Dr Simeon Barber at the Open University, who has worked with Nasa on robotic space missions, was originally sceptical that the new commercial companies would deliver. But he is now a convert to the new way of doing things.",
      "\"We were used to big projects falling behind schedule and going over budget. But the new companies have shone a light on the old way of doing things.\"",
      "Moves to change what some saw as an overly cosy relationship with the heritage space companies gained pace in 2009 when President Obama introduced fixed-price contracts to some private sector firms. The companies were given latitude to innovate to cut costs and increase their profits provided they delivered on schedule and on budget.",
      "Among those firms was the dynamic new start-up, SpaceX, which was awarded a contract to develop its reusable Falcon rockets and Dragon Space capsule to resupply the International Space Station with crew and cargo.",
      "The heritage space company Boeing was also given a similar contract in 2014 to develop its Starliner capsule to do the same job.",
      "SpaceX, with its riskier but faster development processes, began delivering to the ISS within four years of receiving its contract. By contrast, Boeing's Starliner, which had a series of delays due to technical problems and cost overruns, took 10 years \u2013 only to have more issues with some of its engines, which left astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams stranded on the space station.",
      "The ultimate humiliation is that they will be brought back to Earth by rival SpaceX's Dragon capsule.",
      "\"Starliner is an embarrassment for the traditional way of doing business,\" says Prof Logsdon. \"So, shaking up the system is very positive.\"",
      "On the brink of a big shakeup?",
      "Prof Logsdon expects big changes under Trump, Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman: scrapping programmes, closing Nasa centres and more contracting out to SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private sector firms. Mr Isaacman has called the SLS \"outrageously expensive\" and said that the major aerospace contractors are \"incentivised to be economically inefficient\".",
      "But changes like that are not going to be easy. Nasa's budget is controlled by Congress. Although President Trump's party controls both legislative houses, individual senators and congressmen on the committees that oversee Nasa are from states with jobs and industries dependent on Nasa's $25bn (\u00a320bn) annual budget.",
      "\"Party discipline takes second place where there is constituency money involved,\" says Prof Logsdon, a seasoned watcher of the horse trading that goes on with space politics in Congress.",
      "Although Nasa's projects have been expensive, they have shown us the wonders of the universe and shifted humanity's perception of ourselves and our place in the cosmos.",
      "The creation of the first reusable space shuttle, the construction of an orbiting space station, the images of distant worlds captured by its robotic spacecraft and the awe-inspiring photos from Hubble have all inspired generations and supercharged interest in science. As a result, senators and congressmen know that America and the world owe Nasa an unpayable debt.",
      "\"The old way of doing things gave us a lot of success, so you don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. There will be significant change, but not the radical change that Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman want to see,\" argues Prof Logsdon.",
      "\"There is a delicate balance between the interests of Nasa, Congress and the White House.\"",
      "Where that balance will fall will emerge in the coming months: some are speculating that the return-to-the-Moon programme might be scrapped altogether in favour of going straight to Mars, as President Trump alluded to during his inauguration, with the greatest proponent of that policy \u2013 Musk \u2013 seated nearby.",
      "Others fear cuts in Nasa's Earth Observation programmes, which monitor and model environmental changes from space, and include the impact of climate change; and some worry that the robotic scientific missions to other planets might be cut back to boost efforts for the human spaceflight programme.",
      "Where SpaceX fits in",
      "There is concern in some quarters about the close relationship between Mr Isaacman and Mr Musk. Mr Isaacman paid SpaceX for his two ventures into space. The company has already received $20bn (\u00a316bn) in contracts from government since 2008.",
      "But if SLS is scrapped, and SpaceX were to receive the lion's share of Nasa's Moon programme work, Mr Musk's firm stands to receive contracts that might be ten or even a hundred times greater, possibly at the expense of other private-sector players.",
      "And there are many innovative US start-up companies hoping to build parts for spacecraft and infrastructure in Nasa's return-to-the-Moon programme, including Texas-based Firefly, which has a spacecraft on its way to land on the Moon in March.",
      "But industry analysts say that the US government has a long tradition of breaking up monopolies so that they don't stifle innovation. And in any case, just because Mr Isaacman has worked with Mr Musk, it does not mean that any outcome is inevitable, argues Prof Logsdon.",
      "\"Isaacman is his own man,\" he adds. \"He is not a disciple of Elon Musk.\"",
      "Fatbergs turned into perfume - inside Britain's bizarre new industrial revolution",
      "Friends reunited? Trump faces a very different Kim Jong Un this time",
      "Future of space travel: Could robots really replace human astronauts?",
      "Ultimately, however, it has become painfully clear, even to Nasa's most ardent supporters, that it needs saving from itself. And the need for Nasa reform is not a partisan issue \u2013 Democrat and Republican presidents alike have set the wheels in motion.",
      "But the coincidental timing of the success of SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private-sector space firms with a new administration impatient to cut costs and energise the private sector means that Mr Isaacman has a unique opportunity to make some of the biggest changes to Nasa since its inception.",
      "\"Nasa truly is a crown jewel, and we aren't doing what we should be doing on behalf of the American people,\" argued former deputy head of Nasa Lori Garver during the Space News webinar. \"That is frustrating for all of us.\"",
      "Asked if a private sector billionaire was the right person to be entrusted with one of America's greatest national treasures, Ms Garver responded: \"Jared is a patriot, and he is doing this for public service.",
      "\"The truth of Jared agreeing has something to do with him willing to take on these hard things \u2013 and there are so many hard things\".",

    "summary": "Some scientists fear the risk of a collapse to warm Atlantic currents has not been taken seriously.",
    "story": [
      "Of all the possible climate futures, there's a scenario where the United Kingdom and north-west Europe buck the trend of global warming and instead face plunging temperatures and freezing winters.",
      "It's not the most likely outcome, but a number of scientists fear that the chance of it happening is growing, and that the consequences would be so great that it deserves proper consideration.",
      "They are concerned that the ocean currents that bring warm water from the tropics to the North Atlantic could weaken - or even collapse - in response to climate change.",
      "Huge uncertainties remain about when - or even whether - a collapse could happen. So, how likely is it, and what would it mean?",
      "The system of Atlantic currents, called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc), is a key reason why the UK is warmer than Moscow, despite being a similar distance from the Equator.",
      "Forming a vital part of our climate system, this conveyor belt distributes energy around the planet, bringing warm, salty water from the tropical Atlantic to cooler regions south of Greenland and Iceland, and also the Nordic Seas.",
      "The warmth from the ocean is transferred to the air above it, helping keep temperatures milder than they otherwise would be.",
      "As this salty water cools, it becomes denser, and sinks, before flowing back towards the southern hemisphere as a deep ocean current. This water eventually gets pulled back up to the surface, and the circulation continues.",
      "But Amoc appears to be getting weaker.",
      "We don't know for sure, because direct and continuous measurements of Amoc strength have only been taken since 2004. That's not long enough to be able to identify a definite change.",
      "But indirect evidence suggests it could have already slowed by around 15% over the last couple of centuries, although not all scientists agree.",
      "One indication is the sediments on the ocean floor. Larger grains indicate a stronger current. By measuring the size of the grains and calculating their age, scientists can estimate how much Amoc has slowed over time.",
      "Another piece of evidence is the so-called 'cold blob' or 'warming hole' in the north Atlantic. This describes a region which appears to have cooled in recent decades, unlike the vast majority of the world.",
      "A slowdown in Amoc - meaning less warmer water would be transported to this region - is seen as a possible culprit.",
      "This is \"a very clear signature and footprint of a classic Amoc slowdown\" says Matthew England, professor of oceanography at the University of New South Wales.",
      "The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) expects Amoc to weaken this century. But the major concern is that Amoc could suddenly \"switch off\", as appears to have happened repeatedly in the Earth's past.",
      "Today, global warming appears to be making the water in the north Atlantic less salty, due to extra freshwater from a melting Greenland ice sheet and more rainfall.",
      "As fresher water doesn't sink as easily, this is expected to slow the circulation and so bring less saltwater northwards from the tropics.",
      "Beyond a \"tipping point\", this loop could lead Amoc to runaway collapse.",
      "\"We really want to avoid a tipping point because then there's nothing we can do about it,\" warns David Thornalley, professor of ocean and climate science at University College London.",
      "Where might the tipping point be?",
      "No one really knows how close it may be.",
      "In 2021, the IPCC said it had \"medium confidence\" that Amoc would not collapse abruptly this century, although it expected it to weaken.",
      "But some more recent studies have pointed to a growing possibility of Amoc passing a tipping point in the coming decades, beyond which full collapse would be inevitable.",
      "Each study comes with various caveats and uncertainties, and different climate models can give different results for a system as complex as Amoc.",
      "\"We don't believe the idea of an Amoc collapse this century has substantially changed because of these new results,\" cautions Dr Laura Jackson, oceanographer at the Met Office.",
      "But many scientists are growing increasingly concerned. Prof Thornalley argues that, whatever the imperfections of individual studies, taken together they \"lead to a conclusion that we maybe need to be worried\".",
      "Following the new evidence, more than 40 leading ocean and climate scientists signed an open letter last October calling for wider recognition of the \"greatly underestimated\" risks.",
      "That is not to say the signatories believe Amoc will pass a tipping point this century. But they warn it is now enough of a possibility to warrant proper consideration.",
      "\"I'd say you're looking at a risk of reaching a tipping point in the coming decades that could be at the 10 or 20% level even if we hold the line at 2C warming [above temperatures of the late 19th Century, before humans started significantly warming the climate],\" warns Tim Lenton, professor of Earth system science at the University of Exeter.",
      "Given the magnitude of the consequences from Amoc collapse, these probabilities \"are not trivial,\" he adds.",
      "What would happen if Amoc collapsed?",
      "Even the most likely scenario - where Amoc continues to weaken this century - could have serious effects.",
      "\"If the Amoc gradually weakens over the next century, you're going to get global warming but less warming over Europe,\" says Dr Jackson.",
      "That would still mean the UK getting hotter summers with climate change, but a weaker Amoc could also fuel more winter storms as regional temperature patterns change.",
      "A full-scale collapse, meanwhile, would be \"like a war situation [\u2026] something almost unimaginable,\" says Prof Lenton.",
      "While it could take a century or more for impacts to play out, temperatures in northern Europe could fall by a couple of degrees a decade.",
      "In the UK, it could \"become horribly, horribly cold \u2026 like living in northern Norway,\" Prof Thornalley warns.",
      "\"Our infrastructure is not set up for that.\"",
      "There could be global consequences too, such as shifts to the tropical rain belts.",
      "\"That's a big story,\" warns Prof Lenton.",
      "\"If you lost the monsoon or seriously disrupted it, you'd have humanitarian catastrophes, in simple terms, in west Africa [and] probably in India.\"",
      "How we prepare for this alternative future poses challenges for governments.",
      "Prof Lenton draws parallels with preparations for the Covid-19 pandemic - another major event which scientists had warned about, but had no way of knowing when it might occur.",
      "But a recent report warned the UK has a \"glaring national security blind spot for climate threats\" such as those posed by Amoc collapse. The government admitted last year that it \"has not assessed the effect of any [Amoc] slowing or collapse\" on economic planning.",
      "Scientists are clear that the fundamental way to reduce these risks is to cut the greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change.",
      "\"We're playing a bit of a Russian roulette game,\" warns Prof England.",
      "\"The more we stack up the atmosphere with greenhouse gases, the more we warm the system, the more chance we have of an Amoc slowdown and collapse.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 00:48:19 GMT",
    "summary": "Vaccinating poultry against bird flu is still not allowed in the UK despite a rise in farm outbreaks.",
    "story": [
      "Poultry farmers are appealing to the government to let them vaccinate their flocks against the \"devastating\" bird flu virus spreading across the UK.",
      "Vaccinating poultry against avian influenza is currently not allowed in the UK. The government says that strong biosecurity measures and culling are the most effective ways of fighting it. Meanwhile, there are concerns that poultry vaccinations might be linked to the virus evolving.",
      "Overall levels of the virus have not yet reached the peak of recent years.",
      "But one farmer, who has previously lost 30% of his flock because of bird flu, told the BBC that, without a vaccine, it was only a matter of time before \"it all kicks off again\".",
      "A bird flu prevention zone enforcing strict hygiene standards around domesticated birds has been declared for England, Wales and Scotland amid a rising number of cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).",
      "The risk to humans remains low, with chicken and eggs safe to eat if properly cooked, according to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).",
      "Defra has set up a cross-government and poultry industry taskforce that is looking at the potential use of vaccines, and is due to publish its report later this year. But poultry farmers say things are moving too slowly.",
      "Essex turkey farmer Paul Kelly, whose business was hit hard in the worst avian flu outbreak from 2021 to 2023, told the BBC that \"the foot has been taken off the gas\" when it comes to making poultry vaccines available to UK farmers.",
      "\"This is poor planning as we need to be ready for another huge outbreak as opposed to reacting to another outbreak and being behind the curve on rolling out vaccination,\" he said.",
      "\"Avian influenza is so highly pathogenic that if a farmer gets it [in his flock][ it is devastating.\"",
      "There have so far been 25 farm outbreaks of bird flu since the annual winter recording season began in October.",
      "In comparison, between October 2021 and January 2022, during the UK's worst outbreak, there had been more than 70 cases in poultry or other captive birds.",
      "But Gary Ford, of the British Free Range Egg Producers Association, said that there was still \"panic, concern and fear out there\" among farmers over the virus spreading.",
      "He added that the organisation was a \"huge supporter\" of vaccination for poultry but recognised there were challenges, including the cost to farmers and the impact on trade with other countries that prohibit imports from producers that vaccinate.",
      "Meanwhile, there have also been some scientific questions raised about bird flu vaccinations.",
      "Recent work by researchers from the UK's Royal Veterinary College and institutions in China found possible evidence that they may be linked to changes in how the virus evolves.",
      "They carried out genetic analysis of avian flu samples collected from wild birds and farmed poultry between 1996 and 2023.",
      "While they found that infections occurred more often in unvaccinated birds, they also found that in countries with high vaccination rates, there was a higher rate of change in the virus itself.",
      "They said such evolution could, in theory, lead to vaccines needing to be updated frequently to remain effective and to the virus spilling over into unvaccinated populations. They acknowledged that more research was needed to establish whether there was a direct causal link between vaccination and virus evolution.",
      "'Refocus efforts'",
      "Earlier this week, the government agency that deals with infectious diseases, UKHSA, confirmed a case of the H5N1 avian influenza virus in a farm worker in the West Midlands region.",
      "It said bird-to-human transmission of avian influenza was rare and that the risk to the wider public continues to be very low.",
      "Farmers in Shropshire, North Yorkshire, East Riding of Yorkshire, City of Kingston Upon Hull, Lincolnshire, Norfolk and Suffolk have to keep their birds caged under mandatory housing rules put in place to manage the spread.",
      "Biosecurity restrictions are also in place across England, Wales and Scotland as part of an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone.",
      "The National Farmers' Union said it was \"essential that Defra refocuses efforts\" on coming up with a workable avian influenza vaccination plan for the UK.",
      "The government currently only allows licensed zoos to vaccinate captive birds against HPAI.",
      "It said it would continue to invest in research and that any future decisions on the use of emergency or preventive vaccination would be based on the latest scientific evidence and veterinary advice.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 00:00:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The Microsoft co-founder says he enjoys giving away his fortune and it won't leave his kids poor.",
    "story": [
      "It's towards the end of our interview that Bill Gates reveals new numbers on how much his charitable Foundation has now spent in its efforts to combat preventable diseases and reduce poverty.",
      "\"I've given over 100 billion,\" he says, \"but I still have more to give.\"",
      "That's dollars, just to clarify, worth about \u00a380bn.",
      "It's roughly equivalent to the size of the Bulgarian economy or the cost of building the whole HS2 line.",
      "But to put it in context, it's also around the same as just one year of Tesla sales. (Tesla owner Elon Musk is now the richest man on the planet, a position Gates held for many years.)",
      "The co-founder of Microsoft and his fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett are combining their billions through the Gates Foundation he originally set up with his now ex-wife Melinda.",
      "Gates says philanthropy was instilled in him early on. His mother regularly told him \"with wealth came the responsibility to give it away\".",
      "His Foundation's 25th anniversary is in May, and Gates exclusively revealed the $100bn figure to the BBC.",
      "He tells me, for his part, he enjoys giving his money away (and around $60 billion of his fortune has gone into the Foundation so far).",
      "When it comes to his day-to-day lifestyle, he doesn't actually notice the difference: \"I made no personal sacrifice. I didn't order less hamburgers or less movies.\" He can also, of course, still afford his private jet and his various huge houses.",
      "He plans to give away \"the vast majority\" of his fortune, but tells me he has talked \"a lot\" with his three children about what might be the right amount to leave them.",
      "Will they be poor after he's gone? I ask him. \"They will not,\" he replies with a quick smile, adding \"in absolute, they'll do well, in percentage terms it's not a gigantic number\".",
      "Gates is a maths guy and it shows. At Lakeside School in Seattle, in eighth grade, he competed in a four-state regional maths exam and did so well that, at 13, he was one of the best high school maths students of any age in the region.",
      "Maths terminology comes second nature to him. But to translate, if you're worth $160bn, which Bloomberg's Billionaires Index claims he is, even leaving your children a tiny percentage of your fortune still makes them very rich.",
      "I'm with one of only 15 people on the planet who are centibillionaires (worth more than $100bn), according to Bloomberg. We're in his childhood home in Seattle, a mid-century modern four-bedroom house set into a hill, and we're meeting because he's written a memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, focusing on his early life.",
      "I want to find out what shaped a challenging, obsessive child who didn't fit the norm into one of the tech pioneers of our age.",
      "He's brought along his sisters, Kristi and Libby, and all three excitedly tour the home where they grew up. They haven't been back in some years and the current owners have refurbished (fortunately, the Gates siblings seem to approve of the changes).",
      "But it's bringing back memories including, as they walk into the kitchen, of the now-long-gone intercom system between rooms beloved by their mother. She used it to \"sing to us in the morning\", Gates tells me, to get them out of their bedrooms for breakfast.",
      "Mary Gates also set their watches and clocks eight minutes fast so the family would work to her time. Her son often rebelled at her efforts to improve him, but now tells me \"the crucible of my ambition was warmed through that relationship\".",
      "He puts his competitive spirit down to his grandmother \"Gami\", who was often with the family in this house and who taught him to outsmart the competition early on with games of cards.",
      "I follow him down the wooden stairs as he heads off to find his old childhood bedroom in the basement. It's a neat guest room now, but young Bill spent hours, even days, in here \"thinking\", as his sisters put it.",
      "At one point, his mum was so fed up with the mess that she confiscated any item of clothing she found on the floor and charged her stubborn son 25 cents to buy it back. \"I started wearing fewer clothes,\" he says.",
      "By this time, he was hooked on coding and, with some tech-savvy school friends, had been given access to a local firm's one computer in return for reporting any problems. Obsessed with learning to program in those nascent days of the tech revolution, he would sneak out at night through his bedroom window without his parents knowing to get more computer time.",
      "\"Do you think you could do it now?\" I ask.",
      "He starts unwinding the catch and opens the window. \"It's not that hard,\" he says with a smile as he climbs up and out. \"It's not hard at all.\"",
      "There is a famous early clip of Gates in which a TV presenter asks him if it's true he can jump over a chair from a standing position. He does it right there in the studio. I'm in the Gates childhood bedroom for something that feels like \"a moment\". The guy's nearly 70. But he's still game.",
      "He seems at ease - and it isn't just because we're in a familiar environment. In the memoir, he's revealed publicly for the first time that he thinks if he were growing up today, he'd probably be diagnosed on the autism spectrum.",
      "The only time I met him before was in 2012. He barely looked me in the eye as we did a quick interview about his goal to protect children from life-threatening diseases. There was certainly no pre-interview small talk. I wondered after our interaction whether he was on the spectrum.",
      "The book lays it out: his ability to hyperfocus on subjects he was interested in; his obsessive nature; his lack of social awareness.",
      "He says at elementary school he turned in a 177-page report on Delaware, having written off for brochures about the state, even sending stamped addressed envelopes to local companies asking for their annual reports. He was 11.",
      "His sisters tell me they knew he was different. Kristi, who's older, says she felt protective of him. \"He was not a normal kid\u2026 he would sit in his room and chew pencils down to the lead,\" she said.",
      "They're obviously close. Libby, a therapist, tells me she wasn't surprised to hear he believes he is on the spectrum. \"The surprise was more his willingness to say 'this might be the case',\" she says.",
      "Gates says he hasn't had a formal diagnosis and doesn't plan to. \"The positive characteristics for my career have been more beneficial than the deficits have been a problem for me,\" he says.",
      "He thinks neurodiversity is \"certainly\" over-represented in Silicon Valley because \"learning something in great depth at a young age - that helps you in certain complex subjects\".",
      "Elon Musk has also said he is on the spectrum, referencing Asperger's syndrome. The Tesla, X and SpaceX billionaire is famously courting Donald Trump, as are the other modern-day tech bros, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos among other Silicon Valley attendees at Trump's inauguration.",
      "Gates tells me although \"you can be cynical\" about their motives, he too reached out to the president. They had a three-hour dinner on 27 December \"because he's making decisions about global health and how we help poor countries, which is a big focus of mine now\".",
      "I ask Gates, himself a target of some pretty wild conspiracy theories, what he thinks of the decision taken by Zuckerberg after Trump's election to dump fact-checking in the US on his sites. Gates tells me he's not \"that impressed\" by how governments or private companies are navigating the boundaries between free speech and truth.",
      "\"I don't personally know how you draw that line, but I'm worried that we're not handling that as well as we should,\" he says.",
      "He also thinks children should be protected from social media, telling me there's a \"good chance\" that banning under-16s, as Australia is doing, is \"a smart thing\".",
      "Gates tells me \"social networking, even more than video gaming, can absorb your time and make you worry about other people approving you\" so we have to be \"very careful how it gets used\".",
      "As for Trump's first pick for US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who claims he isn't anti-vaccination but has promoted debunked claims about vaccines, Gates makes short shrift. He tells me RFK Jr is \"misleading people\".",
      "The Bill Gates origin story isn't rags to riches. His dad was a lawyer, money wasn't tight, although the decision to send their son to private school to try to motivate him was \"a stretch, even on my father's salary\".",
      "If they hadn't, we might never have heard of Bill Gates.",
      "He first got access to an early mainframe computer via a teletype machine at the school, after the mothers held a jumble sale to raise the money. The teachers couldn't figure it out, but four students were on it day and night. \"We got to use computers when almost nobody else did,\" he says.",
      "Much later, he would set up Microsoft with one of those school friends, Paul Allen. Another, Kent Evans, Gates' best friend, would die tragically age 17 in a climbing accident. As we walk around Lakeside School, we pass the chapel where they held his funeral and where Gates remembers crying on the steps.",
      "Together, they'd had big plans. When they weren't on computers, they were reading biographies to work out what factors made people successful.",
      "Now Gates has written his own. His philosophy? \"Much of who you are was there from the start.\"",

      "Quite a lot of people, it turns out.",
      "Now, 25 years from its debut, The Sims is one of the best-selling video game series of all time, with an active community of superfans known as Simmers.",
      "The latest instalment, The Sims 4, has been translated into 18 languages and played by 85 million people worldwide, according to publisher Electronic Arts.",
      "The original game's open-ended nature helped it to become a hit and reach so-called \"casual gamers\" outside the medium's more dedicated audience.",
      "Players had the freedom to carefully craft a detailed domestic setting for their digital people, managing their love lives, daily routines, basic needs and hobbies in exacting detail.",
      "But it also allowed them to imagine various torments for their virtual pals. One of the most famous - stranding your Sim in a swimming pool without a ladder - remains a popular meme to this day.",
      "UK-based streamer Jesse, best known as Plumbella, says she became obsessed with the legendary trick when she first played the game at five years old.",
      "The Sims has been part of Jesse\u2019s life ever since, thanks, she says, to the community around it.",
      "Players can create modifications or \"mods\" that alter different elements from the way the game plays to a characters appearance.",
      "Extra height options, having multiple jobs and neurodivergent personality traits are among some of the popular fan-made add-ons.",
      "For dedicated fans, Jesse says, the longevity comes from building on each other's creations.",

      "\"It's really interesting to see the ways that people can come up with to use their game in an interesting way.\"",
      "The ability to express yourself in The Sims also made it a popular title among its many players from diverse communities.",
      "Even at its launch in 2000, The Sims included same-sex relationships at a time when choices around sexuality or identity in gaming were rare.",
      "Creator Mollie, who streams as TheEnglishSimmer, makes a lot of LGBT-themed content for her channel.",

      "\"But the difference between The Sims and other games is I can do something about it.\"",
      "Amira's Melanin Pack was a hit when it was released, and she's since worked with Maxis and Electronic Arts on officially adopting more skin tones into the game.",
      "\"For me that's a big part of why I've played the game for so long,\" she says.",
      "\"I can do what I want, I can make a Sim with any body type, complexion, hair, whatever I want to do, it's one of the most customisable games I have.\"",

      "It is rare that a video game series becomes so popular it inspires copycats - but it is rarer still that it's so unique it kicks off its own genre.",
      "But that's what happened with Dynasty Warriors, a series which pioneered the so-called \"1 vs 1,000\" gameplay, in which the player defeats thousands of enemies in each level.",
      "Throughout years of development - the series has been going since 1997 on the original PlayStation - hardware limitations meant at its best only a few hundred enemies could appear on-screen at any one time.",
      "But all that is now changing, with the power of modern consoles enabling as many as 10,000 opponents on-screen at once.",
      "In other words, the \"1 vs 1,000\" moniker is finally coming true.",
      "And with that new power comes a new game - after seven years in the wilderness, publisher Koei Tecmo is back with Dynasty Warriors: Origins.",
      "Throughout this period the series has faced a problem - despite selling 21 million copies throughout its history - Dynasty Warriors has always sold significantly better in Japan than in the West.",
      "\"It's something that we've been trying to get a lot of people overseas to play,\" the head of developer Omega Force, Tomohiko Sho, told the BBC.",
      "But times may be changing, as the release of Dynasty Warriors: Origins in January 2025 has seen encouraging sales.",
      "In the UK, it broke the top 10 of the retail sales charts, while online it was the top-selling game on PC retailer Steam - with just under 70,000 people playing the game at the same time on launch.",
      "There have been nine numbered entries in the series since it began in 1997, culminating in 2018's Dynasty Warriors 9 on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.",
      "But advances in hardware mean Mr Sho believes now is the time for a sequel.",
      "Though he did not call it a reboot, the team has ditched the numbered titles and simply called the game Dynasty Warriors: Origins - perhaps signalling that the studio believes this is a turning point for the franchise.",
      "It released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC in January 2025, becoming the first mainline entry in the series in seven years.",
      "Mr Sho told the BBC the team had been working on a sequel - which would have been called Dynasty Warriors 10 - but he felt it was simply too similar to previous games, which fans were \"starting to get a bit bored of\".",
      "Instead, the long-awaited game was scrapped in order to take advantage of the new hardware.",
      "DW10 cancelled",
      "The reason Dynasty Warriors: Origins seeks to break away from what came before is simple, Mr Sho said - it was a result of fan reaction to the last mainline game released in the series, 2018's Dynasty Warriors 9.",
      "\"Either you really liked it, or you didn't,\" he said.",
      "The unreleased sequel was too similar to what came before, he said, but by the time development was in full swing, a change in the games industry ultimately halted production.",
      "Within two days of each other in November 2020, Sony released the PlayStation 5 and Microsoft launched the Xbox Series X - consoles so powerful Mr Sho ceased development to focus on the new hardware.",
      "\"The current technology allows us to have many troops and army officers on the screen,\" he said.",
      "\"This is something I've been wanting to do since Dynasty Warriors 2 and 3.\"",
      "Those two games, which released on PlayStation 2 back in 2000 and 2001, could at most manage twenty or thirty enemies on-screen at once.",
      "The new hardware can manage a lot more - with PlayStation 5 Pro owners seeing an even bigger leap in performance.",
      "\"We're able to have many troops on-screen - not just thousands, but tens of thousands,\" Mr Sho said.",
      "\"With the current generation of consoles, we're able to do that.\"",
      "But all that power comes with a cost - no multiplayer, which has been a staple of the series since its PlayStation 2 days.",
      "\"I am very aware that it is seen as an iconic part of the series,\" he said.",
      "He felt multiplayer would result in a \"performance loss\", meaning fewer enemies on screen, so he decided against including it.",
      "But he said that may change if the game were given a sequel.",
      "\"If everyone really enjoys the game, then for the next game in the series, we will definitely have multiplayer,\" he said.",

      "In the interim years between the release of Dynasty Warriors 9 and Dynasty Warriors: Origins, the team has focussed on other things - namely spin-offs.",
      "These are versions of the game, within the 1 vs 1,000 genre, outside of the main series that typically feature different characters - much like how the film franchise Puss in Boots was a spin-off of Shrek.",
      "The company has found success in this area with games featuring characters from series such as Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda and Sega's Persona 5.",
      "Mr Sho said Dynasty Warriors: Origins was a shift in direction as it focused on performance - while spin-offs were about being true to the franchises involved.",
      "\"When the teams were approaching development, they weren't thinking about the hardware,\" he said.",
      "\"But more, with Hyrule Warriors and Fire Emblem Warriors being on the Switch, how would we be able to do that best as a Warriors game?\"",

      "\"I also actually like Sonic, just to let you know,\" he said.",

      "\"What we're seeing is that AI is now putting the online child abuse on steroids,\" Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.",
      "Cooper said AI was \"industrialising the scale\" of sexual abuse against children and said government measures \"may have to go further.\"",
      "Other laws set to be introduced include making it an offence to run websites where paedophiles can share child sexual abuse content or provide advice on how to groom children. That would be punishable by up to 10 years in prison.",
      "And the Border Force will be given powers to instruct individuals who they suspect of posing a sexual risk to children to unlock their digital devices for inspection when they attempt to enter the UK, as CSAM is often filmed abroad. Depending on the severity of the images, this will be punishable by up to three years in prison.",
      "Artificially generated CSAM involves images that are either partly or completely computer generated. Software can \"nudify\" real images and replace the face of one child with another, creating a realistic image.",
      "In some cases, the real-life voices of children are also used, meaning innocent survivors of abuse are being re-victimised.",

      "Cooper said: \"You have perpetrators who are using AI to help them better groom or blackmail teenagers and children, distorting images and using those to draw young people into further abuse, just the most horrific things taking place and also becoming more sadistic.\"",
      "She continued: \"This is an area where the technology doesn't stand still and our response cannot stand still to keep children safe.\"",

      "Prof Clare McGlynn, an expert in the legal regulation of pornography, sexual violence and online abuse, said the changes were \"welcome\" but that there were \"significant gaps\".",
      "The government should ban \"nudify\" apps and tackle the \"normalisation of sexual activity with young-looking girls on the mainstream porn sites\", she said, describing these videos as \"simulated child sexual abuse videos\".",
      "These videos \"involve adult actors but they look very young and are shown in children's bedrooms, with toys, pigtails, braces and other markers of childhood,\" she said. \"This material can be found with the most obvious search terms and legitimises and normalises child sexual abuse. Unlike in many other countries, this material remains lawful in the UK.\"",
      "The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) warns that more sexual abuse AI images of children are being produced, with them becoming more prevalent on the open web.",
      "The charity's latest data shows reports of AI-generated CSAM have risen 380% with 245 confirmed reports in 2024 compared with 51 in 2023. Each report can contain thousands of images.",
      "In research last year it found that over a one-month period, 3,512 AI child sexual abuse and exploitation images were discovered on one dark website. Compared with a month in the previous year, the number of the most severe category images (Category A) had risen by 10%.",
      "Experts say AI CSAM can often look incredibly realistic, making it difficult to tell the real from the fake.",
      "The interim chief executive of the IWF, Derek Ray-Hill, said: \"The availability of this AI content further fuels sexual violence against children.",
      "\"It emboldens and encourages abusers, and it makes real children less safe. There is certainly more to be done to prevent AI technology from being exploited, but we welcome [the] announcement, and believe these measures are a vital starting point.\"",

      "For example, between June 2022 and February 2023 antisemitic posts on X doubled, according to research by the Institute of Strategic Dialogue.",
      "More recently in the UK, Mr Musk's posts about British politics have stirred up controversy.",
      "In particular, his posts on the subject of grooming gangs put pressure on the government, which announced a review of the issue.",
      "\"There is no doubt that Musk's ownership of X is having an impact on public opinion in the UK,\" Luke Tryl from the research group More In Common tells BBC News.",
      "However, according to More In Common, only 16% of Brits believe his interventions are designed to achieve justice for victims, whereas 44% think he is doing it for attention, and his approval rating with the British public sits at -35.",
      "The changing tone of X and the controversy surrounding its owner have spurred some firms to leave the platform and others have pulled their advertising as well.",
      "At the end of 2023 firms including Apple, IBM and Disney paused advertisement on the platform.",
      "Others brands including Unilever and Mars were sued by Mr Musk, who accused them of unlawfully agreeing to boycott the site.",
      "\"It's broadly fair to say Twitter is becoming less relevant across the world,\" Mr Wilson says in the Pitch office in central London, with posters of clients ranging from charities, telecommunications, and sports leagues.",
      "\"It's been a very long time since clients came to us and say: 'Twitter's fun and exciting. We want to be in that space'.",
      "\"Unless you are targeting specific audiences, maybe certain political audiences or sports  - football is still big on Twitter - it's hard to see the value in it.\"",
      "Trump's election victory has prompted other organisations to leave X, with others considering their positions as Mr Musk's influence in the White House grows.",
      "Beginning in 2013, German football team FC St Pauli, which plays in Germany's top league, the Bundesliga, posted more than 60,000 times, racking up nearly 250,000 followers.",
      "But less than 10 days after Trump's return to the White House was confirmed, the club posted: \"You can find our statement about saying goodbye to X on BlueSky. Feel free to follow us there. We're out of here.\"",
      "\"We discussed the decision for a year. We were mostly posting content with counter speech to hate. We had a lot of content for diversity, anti-racism, and anti-sexism,\" club spokesperson, Patrick Gensing told the BBC.",
      "\"We have seen assaults on X, antisemitism, conspiracy theories,\" he says.",
      "The argument that such posts are justified by freedom of speech, does not convince him.",
      "\"We don't think racism is freedom of speech,\" says Mr Gensing.",
      "One of the most recent departures from X was by the UK arm of BMW. In late January it announced it was no longer posting on X and directed people to its posts on Facebook and Instagram.",
      "There's no definitive way to know how many brands are choosing to leave or reduce their posts on the platform.",
      "When approached, X did not respond to the points raised in this article. But last year Mr Musk claimed X had 600 million monthly active users, and said the platform maintains its \"purpose is to serve the public conversation\".",
      "Mr Musk \"has been clear that X is willing to make trade-offs to adopt a more open, less moderated approach compared to Twitter\", says Goran Calic, visiting scholar at Harvard Business School.",
      "But leaving X can have negative consequences for organisations and their relationships with customers.",
      "\"When users leave, the impact depends on who is leaving and why. A local authority posting news provides significant value to the network. If such an account leaves, it can hurt both the platform and its users,\" he tells BBC News.",
      "\"Users protesting by leaving should weigh the broader social implications of staying versus exiting.\"",
      "For some organisations who need to get their message out quickly, X still has value that other competitors simply can't offer.",
      "\"For us there is still that value [on being on X],\" says Andrew Cassidy, senior director of digital strategy and engagement at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA).",

      "\"Our focus is providing customer service to the largest number of riders that we possibly can,\" Mr Cassidy says.",
      "\"With the current landscape being what it is, X still feeds that need.\"",
      "It's \"unthinkable\", Mr Gensing explains, not to have a presence on social media in 2025.",
      "\"We have to view all the platforms critically, it's not only X. The companies behind them set up the rules of the game and they can change them.\"",

      "US President Donald Trump then agreed to temporarily pause tarrifs on goods imported from both countries after reaching separate agreements with them. The tarrifs on China, however, are slated to go into effect on Tuesday.",
      "So far Beijing has held its fire.",
      "In 2018, when Trump launched the first of many rounds of tariffs targeting Chinese imports, Beijing declared that it was \"not afraid of a trade war\". This time, it urged the US to talk and \"meet China halfway\". And reports suggest a call between Trump and Xi Jinping could take place this week.",
      "This isn't to say that the announcement will not sting. It will, especially  because the 10% levy adds to a slew of tariffs he imposed in his first term on tens of billions of dollars of goods.",
      "And the Chinese government's muted response is partly because it doesn't want to worry its population, when many are already concerned about the sluggish economy.",
      "But that economy is not as reliant on the US as it was back then. Beijing has strengthened its trade agreements across Africa, South America and South East Asia. It is now the largest trading partner of more than 120 countries.",
      "The additional 10% may not offer the leverage that Trump wants, says Chong Ja Ian from Carnegie China.",
      "\"China will think that it can probably endure 10% - hence, I think Beijing is playing it cool. Because if it's not that big a deal, there's no reason to pick a fight with the Trump administration unless there's a real benefit to Beijing.\"",

      "President Xi Jinping may also have another reason: he may see an opportunity here.",
      "Trump is sowing division in his own backyard, threatening to hit even the European Union (EU) with tariffs - all in his first month in office. His actions may have other US allies wondering what is in store for them.",

      "\"Trump's America-first policy will bring challenges and threats to almost all countries in the world,\" says Yun Sun, director of the China programme at the Stimson Centre.",
      "\"From the perspective of US-China strategic competition, a deterioration of US leadership and credibility will benefit China. it is unlikely to turn well for China on the bilateral level, but Beijing surely will try to make lemonade...\"",
      "As a leader of the world's second-largest economy, Xi has made no secret of his ambition for China to lead an alternative world order.",
      "Since the end of the Covid pandemic, he has travelled extensively, and he has supported major international institutions such as the World Bank and agreements such as the Paris climate accords.",
      "Chinese state media has portrayed this as embracing countries across the world and deepening diplomatic ties.",
      "Before that, when Trump halted US funding to the WHO in 2020, China pledged additional funds. Expectations are high that Beijing may step in to fill America's shoes again, following Washington's exit from the WHO.",

      "Turmoil as Trump and Musk take aim at top US aid agency",

Hundreds of foreign aid programmes delivered by USAID ground to a halt. Some have since restarted, but aid contractors describe ongoing chaos as the future of the agency hangs in the balance.",
      "John Delury, a historian of modern China and Professor at Yonsei University in Seoul, says Trump's 'America First' doctrine could further weaken Washington's position as a global leader.",

      "New alliances",
      "\"Whether it really confers Beijing a key advantage  - of that I'm a little less sure,\" Mr Chong says.",
      "\"Many US allies and partners, especially in the Pacific, have a reason to work with Beijing, but they also have reasons to be wary. That's why we've seen Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Australia move closer together, in part because of the apprehensions they harbour towards China.\"",
      "There is \"gathering momentum\" for a possible trilateral relationship among Australia, Japan and South Korea, motivated by \"the impact of a second Trump administration\", according to The Australian Institute of International Affairs.",
      "All three are concerned about China's assertiveness in the South China Sea, along with the Philippines. They are also worried about a possible war over the self-governed island of Taiwan - Beijing sees it as a breakaway province that will, eventually, be part of the country, and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this.",
      "Taiwan has long been one of the most contentious issues in US-China relations, with Beijing condemning any perceived support from Washington for Taipei.",
      "But it may be difficult for Washington to hit back at signs of Chinese aggression when Trump repeatedly threatens to annex Canada or buy Greenland.",
      "Most countries in the region have used a military alliance with Washington to balance their economic relationship with China.",
      "But now, wary of Beijing and usure of the US, they could create new Asian alliances, with neither of the world's biggest powers.",

      "Bright red lanterns currently swing over empty Beijing streets as most workers have left for their hometowns during the biggest holiday of the year.",
      "China's response has been far more muted than Canada or Mexico's. The commerce ministry announced plans to take legal action and use the World Trade Organisation to air its grievances.",
      "But this poses little threat to Washington. The WTO's dispute settlement system has been effectively shut down since 2019 when Donald Trump - in his first term then - blocked the appointment of judges to handle appeals.",
      "As the holiday draws to a close and party officials return to Beijing and to work \u2013 they have decisions to make.",
      "Officials have been encouraged in recent weeks by signs that the Trump administration may want to keep the relationship stable especially after the two leaders had what Mr Trump called \"a great phone call\" last month.",
      "For now, China is remaining calm perhaps in the hope of a doing a deal with Washington to avoid further tariffs and to keep the relationship between the world's two largest economies from spiralling out of control.",
      "But some believe this cannot last as both Republicans and Democrats have come to view China as the country's biggest foreign policy and economic threat.",
      "\"Mr Trump's unpredictability, his impulsiveness and recklessness will inevitably lead to significant shocks in the bilateral relationship,\" says Wu Xinbo, professor and director at the Centre for American Studies at Fudan University.",
      "\"Additionally, his team contains quite a few hawks, even extreme hawks on China. It is unavoidable that the bilateral relationship will face serious disruption over the next four years.\"",
      "China is certainly concerned about its relationship with the US and the harm a trade war could do to its slowing economy.",

    "story": [
      "Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has urged people on the island of Santorini to \"stay calm\" after an increase in seismic activity.",
      "His remarks come as schools were told to close on Monday and authorities advised against large gatherings in enclosed spaces across the island, a popular tourist destination known for its whitewashed buildings and blue-domed churches.",
      "More than 280 earthquakes were recorded across Greek islands in the past 48 hours, according to the University of Athens' Seismological Laboratory.",
      "Tremors of up to 4.9 in magnitude were recorded north-east of Santorini on Monday, while there have been quakes of 4.3 and 3.9 magnitude reported nearby in recent days.",
      "Speaking from EU talks in Brussels, the prime minister said the country is working to manage \"a very intense geological phenomenon\", adding that he has asked the authorities to provide a \"comprehensive presentation\" of the geological data, to ensure everyone knows the scale of this seismic event.",
      "Mitsotakis's remarks come as many people in Santorini spent Sunday night outdoors, amid fears of potential damage to buildings during the quakes.",
      "Some focal points of the tremors have been recorded at a depth of just 2km (1.2miles) below the surface.",
      "Some residents have chosen to leave the island while the seismic activity is ongoing, including Kostas Sakavaras, a tour guide who has lived there for 18 years, and his wife and children.",
      "\"We decided yesterday to take the ferry and come to the mainland,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"We stayed calm. It's not such a big deal. It was more like, the schools were closed. We considered it's a better choice to come to the mainland as a precaution.\"",
      "He said they were keeping in touch with friends and family who had remained, and that the tremors had been \"mild\".",
      "\"Nothing has been falling, or anything like that,\" he said, adding that the worst part had been the sound.",
      "\"That's the most scary part of it,\" said Mr Sakavaras, who plans to return home once schools reopen.",
      "Santorini is on what is known as the Hellenic Volcanic Arc - a chain of volcanic islands created by plate tectonics - but the last major eruption was in the 1950s.",
      "Greek authorities said that the recent minor earthquakes were related to tectonic plate movements instead of volcanic activity.",
      "The tremors are being caused by the Aegean sea plate subducting beneath the African plate, causing resistance and friction to build up along the fault line.",
      "When the plate shifts, energy is released in the form of an earthquake.",
      "Earthquakes are very common in this region, but authorities say activity in the Santorini caldera - the volcanic basin the island sits around - remains in decline.",
      "While the recent tremors are thought to be unlikely to be a precursor to a volcanic eruption, the possibility cannot be ruled out.",
      "The tremors recorded by geologists are considered minor, but authorities have recommended a number of preventative measures in addition to the school closures, including asking ships to avoid the ports of Ammoudi and Fira.",
      "Big cruise ships often anchor near the Old Port of Fira, with passengers being brought to shore on smaller boats.",
      "Schools were also told to close on the nearby islands of Anafi, Ios and Amorgos, and will remain so until 7 February.",
      "On Monday, a message from the emergency services was sent to the residents of Santorini, urging them to leave the areas of Ammoudi, Armeni and the Old Port of Fira due to landslides.",
      "According to the European Mediterranean Seismological Centre, a total of over 555 earthquakes have been recorded since January 28 in the area between Amorgos and Santorini.",
      "Kostas Papazachos, a professor of geophysics at Thessaloniki Aristotle University, told public broadcaster ERT that the precautionary measures were \"precisely to limit the impact of a stronger earthquake\", as quakes cannot be predicted.",
      "He added: \"When you have a sequence next to you that is so vivid, so intense, you have to be a bit careful, precisely because there is always the risk of something like that happening.\"",
      "Earthquakes are measured on the Moment Magnitude Scale (Mw) - instead of the better-known Richter scale, which is now considered less accurate. The number attributed to an earthquake represents a combination of the distance a fault line has moved and the force that moved it.",
      "A tremor of 2.5 or less usually cannot be felt, but can be detected by instruments. Quakes of up to five are felt and cause minor damage.",
      "Prof Papazachos said that were a minor earthquake to occur while people were gathered in large crowds, it could create panic that may lead to people being injured.",
      "The South Aegean Regional Fire Department has been placed on general alert and rescue teams as well as the regional commander have been dispatched to Santorini.",
      "Various airlines have added extra flights as people rush to leave the island, and more ferries have also been deployed. Hotel owners are reporting a series of cancellations in their bookings, as tourists are avoiding the island.",

      "At least 20 people, most of them women, have been killed in a car bomb attack in northern Syria, the country's presidency says.",
      "The Syria Civil Defence, also known as the White Helmets, said a car filled with explosives blew up on a main road in the southern outskirts of the city of Manbij as a flat-bed lorry carrying about 30 agricultural workers drove past.",
      "The agency had earlier put the death toll at 15, including 11 women and three girls. Another 15 women and girls were wounded, some of them critically.",
      "The presidency vowed to ensure that the perpetrators of what it described as a \"terrorist\" attack would face the \"most severe punishments\".",
      "There was no immediate claim from any armed groups for the bombing, which was the deadliest since rebel forces overthrow president Bashar al-Assad in December.",
      "The commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led alliance backed by the US which controls much of north-eastern Syria, condemned the attack as a \"criminal act\" that threatened the \"unity of the national fabric\".",
      "Earlier, his media chief alleged that such bombings were among the \"fundamental tactics\" used by Turkish-backed factions known as the Syrian National Army (SNA), which the SDF has been battling in the Manbij area over the past two months.",
      "The SNA did not comment on the allegation. However, the Turkey-based Syrian Islamic Council accused the SDF of being behind the blast.",
      "Monday's car bombing was the second such attack in the Manbij area in only three days.",
      "On Saturday, two children and a woman were among four people killed by an explosion on a street in the city centre, the Syria Civil Defence said.",

      "'Danger of IS resurgence has doubled'  - Syria's Kurds warn of group's comeback",
      "As the Assad regime collapsed the SNA launched an offensive to capture territory west of the River Euphrates which the SDF had held since driving out the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) in 2016.",
      "The SNA took control of Manbij on 9 December, after fighters from the SDF-affiliated Manbij Military Council withdrew. But since then, the SDF has tried to retake the territory by launching a counter-offensive.",
      "Turkey wants to push the SDF away from its border because it views the Kurdish militia that dominates the alliance, the People's Protection Units (YPG), as a terrorist organisation. It says the YPG is an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for decades.",
      "The car bombing came amid talks between Syria's transitional government and the SDF on the militia alliance's future.",
      "The commander of the SDF, Mazloum Abdi, met President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Damascus last week, and told the Associated Press news agency on Sunday that the two sides were negotiating with the help of Western mediators.",
      "\"Our vision of Syria is a decentralized, secular and civil country based on democracy that preserves the rights of all of its components,\" he said, referring to the country's many religious and ethnic groups.",
      "When asked whether he was prepared to dissolve the SDF, Abdi said that in principle it wanted to be part of Syria's defence ministry and part of the country's defence strategy, but that the details still had to be discussed, according to AP.",
      "Sharaa, whose Islamist group led the rebel offensive which ended Assad's 24-year rule, told Turkish TV last month that he wanted Syrian Kurdish groups to disarm.",
      "\"Preventing bloodshed and treating everyone equally is our top priority. Therefore, we believe all weapons must be under state control,\" he said."

      "Shein's re-entry to the Indian market comes with strict terms, which include saving all data within the country, India's Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said in December.",
      "In 2020 India banned Shein and dozens of other Chinese apps including TikTok.",
      "It said this was in response to data security concerns and it followed a spike in tensions with China after clashes between the two countries' armies in a disputed Himalayan border area.",
      "The app was launched in India on Friday night and has so far been downloaded by more than 10,000 people. It is offering fashionwear for as little as 199 rupees ($2.30; \u00a31.90).",
      "Shein is currently delivering to consumers only in the cities of Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru, but will soon offer services across India, according to a notification on the app.",
      "Over the last decade, Shein has gone from a little-known brand among older shoppers to one of the biggest fast fashion retailers globally. Today, it ships to customers in 150 countries across the world.",
      "Before the ban it became a big hit in India as it gave people a variety of options to buy trendy designs at an affordable price. The ban initially left a vacuum in the Indian market which was later filled by many local players.",

      "Warning: This story contains distressing details from the start",
      "A former surgeon who is accused of abusing hundreds of young patients, often while they were under anaesthetic, is set to go on trial this month in the largest child abuse trial in French history.",
      "Joel Le Scouarnec, 73, is accused of assaulting or raping 299 children \u2013 the majority former patients of his \u2013 between 1989 and 2014, mostly in Brittany.",
      "He has admitted to some charges, but not all.",
      "The trial in Vannes, north- west France, follows a painstaking police investigation lasting several years.",
      "It is likely to raise uncomfortable questions over whether Le Scouarnec was protected by his colleagues and the management of the hospitals that employed him, despite an FBI warning to the French authorities that he had been consulting child abuse websites, after which he was given only a suspended sentence.",
      "A staggering number of opportunities to stop the former surgeon from having contact with children appear to have been missed or rejected.",
      "Members of his own family also knew of Le Scouarnec's paedophilia but failed to stop him, it is claimed.",
      "\"It was the family's omert\u00e0 which meant his abuse was allowed to continue for decades,\" one lawyer involved in the case told the BBC.",
      "Le Scouarnec, once a respected small-town surgeon, has been in jail since 2017, when he was arrested on suspicion of raping his nieces, now in their 30s, as well as a six-year-old girl and a young patient. In 2020 he was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment.",
      "After his arrest, police searched his home and found child-sized sex dolls, more than 300,000 child abuse images, and thousands of pages of meticulously compiled diaries in which Le Scouarnec is alleged to have logged assaults he carried out on his young patients over 25 years.",
      "He has denied assaulting or raping children, arguing that his diaries merely detailed his \"fantasies\".",
      "In several instances, however, he had also written: \"I am a paedophile\".",
      "Le Scouarnec is facing more than 100 rape charges and more than 150 charges of sexual assault.",
      "Some of his former patients, who are all now adults, have said they remember the surgeon touching them under the guise of medical examinations, sometimes even when their parents or other doctors were in the room.",
      "But because a huge number of his alleged victims were under the effect of anaesthetics when it is claimed the assaults took place, they had no recollection of the events and were shocked to be contacted by police and told their names \u2013 alongside graphic descriptions of abuse \u2013 allegedly appeared in Le Scouarnec's diaries.",
      "Le Scouarnec felt \"all-powerful\" and liked the feeling of \"flirting with danger\" through \"calculated transgressions,\" French daily Le Monde quoted the court order against the former surgeon as saying.",
      "Some of the alleged victims have said the unsettling revelations helped them make sense of unexplained symptoms of trauma that had burdened them their whole lives.",
      "France's elite confronted by sexual abuse scandals",
      "French clergy abused 216,000 children since 1950",
      "'My father should die in prison', daughter of Dominique Pelicot tells BBC",
      "Lawyer Francesca Satta, who represents several alleged victims, told the BBC that among her clients are \"the families of two men who did remember, and who ended up taking their own lives.\"",
      "Olivia Mons of the France Victimes association spoke to many of the alleged victims and said several only had blurry recollections of events which they were never able to \"find the words to explain\".",
      "When the surgeon's case came to light, \"it provided them with the beginning of an explanation,\" Ms Mons said.",
      "But she added that most of the alleged victims were people who had no memories of being raped or assaulted, and who were living ordinary lives before police contacted them. \"Today, many of these people are understandably very shaken,\" Ms Mons said.",
      "One woman told French media that when police showed her an entry under her name in Le Scouarnec's diary, memories instantly flooded in. \"I had flashbacks of someone coming into my hospital room, lifting the bedsheets, saying he would check if everything had gone well,\" she said. \"He raped me.\"",
      "Margaux Castex, a lawyer for one of the alleged victims, told the BBC her client is \"traumatised that he ever gave his trust to a medical professional, and that's been hard to shake\".",
      "\"He wishes he had never been told what happened,\" Ms Castex said.",
      "Another woman called Marie, now a married mother in her mid-thirties, said that police came to her house and revealed that her name appeared in the diaries of a surgeon who was accused of child abuse.",
      "\"They read out what he had written about me and I wanted to read it back myself but it was impossible,\" she told outlet France Bleu. \"Can you imagine reading hardcore pornography and knowing that it is about you, as a child?\"",
      "Marie said she had seen mental health specialists for years because of \"issues\" she had with regards to men, and that doctors had wondered whether she had experienced childhood trauma.",
      "\"I have to believe that my memory protected me from that. But the [police] examination brought it all back to the surface - images, sensations, memories came back to me day by day,\" she said. \"Today, I feel this as if it had just happened.\"",
      "Marie added that when she was shown a photo of Le Scouarnec, \"everything came back to me... I remembered his icy gaze.\"",
      "She wondered how the surgeon had been able to commit his alleged crimes unnoticed for so long.",
      "It is a haunting question that is bound to be explored at length during the trial.",
      "'Institutional and judicial missteps'",
      "The first court proceedings heard claims that several members of Le Scouarnec's family had been aware since the mid-1980s of his disturbing behaviour towards children, but did not intervene.",
      "His ex-wife has denied knowing what her husband \u2013 and father of their three children \u2013 allegedly did until he was arrested.",
      "Le Scouarnec \u2013 a medical professional and a lover of opera and literature \u2013 had long been the pride of his middle-class family. He was a respected small town medical practitioner for many years, which may have afforded him a significant degree of protection in the workplace.",
      "\"A huge degree of dysfunction allowed Le Scouarnec to commit his deeds,\" lawyer Frederic Benoist told the BBC.",
      "Mr Benoist represents child protection advocacy group La Voix de L'Enfant (The Child's Voice), which is pressing to highlight what it calls the \"crucial institutional and judicial missteps\" which allowed Le Scouarnec to allegedly continue abusing children for decades.",
      "In the early 2000s, an FBI alert to the French authorities that Le Scouarnec had been accessing child abuse websites only resulted in a four-month suspended sentence with no obligation to follow medical or psychological treatment.",
      "Mr Benoist said prosecutors never shared this information with the medical authorities and there were no consequences for Le Scouarnec, who continued in his role as a surgeon, often operating on children and managing their aftercare.",
      "When a colleague \u2013 who already harboured suspicions against Le Scouarnec \u2013 read about the charges against him in the local press in 2006, he urged the regional medical association to take action.",
      "All but one doctor - who abstained - voted that Le Scouarnec had not violated the medical code of ethics, which states that doctors \"must in all circumstances be trustworthy and act with integrity and devotion to duty\". No sanctions were imposed.",
      "\"We therefore have proof that all these colleagues knew, and none of them did anything,\" Mr Benoist said. \"There were many circumstances which meant he could have been stopped; he wasn't, and the consequences are tragic.\"",
      "The BBC has approached both the regional medical association and prosecutors for comment.",
      "Le Scouarnec was eventually arrested when the six-year-old victim told her parents that he had assaulted her. By then, he was living like a recluse in a large derelict home, surrounded by child-sized dolls.",
      "Moment of reckoning",
      "Ms Driguez, the nieces' lawyer, sat opposite Le Scouarnec during the 2020 trial in the south-western town of Saintes. \"His answers were cold and calculated,\" she said. \"He is extremely clever, but showed no empathy whatsoever.\"",
      "The trial uncovered more allegations of child abuse within Le Scouarnec's family, Ms Driguez said, but the former surgeon never had any particular reaction and mostly looked at the floor.",

    "summary": "Canadians have begun booing the US anthem at sports games, signalling the depth of anger at steep tariffs issued by Trump.",
    "story": [
      "A few hours after President Donald Trump announced that he would impose steep tariffs on Canada, hockey fans in the capital Ottawa booed the Star-Spangled Banner during a National Hockey League game against a visiting US team.",
      "On Sunday, during a National Basketball Association game between the Toronto Raptors and the Los Angeles Clippers, it happened again, continuing throughout the song and almost drowning out the 15-year-old singer's arena performance.",
      "The vocal displeasure from usually respectful fans is a clear sign of Canadians' deep dismay at Trump's move to hit its nearest ally with punitive taxes, which threaten to spark an unprecedented trade war on the North American continent.",
      "The 25% tariffs imposed by Trump on all Canadian imports into the US - with a lower 10% levy on energy - are set to take effect on Tuesday.",
      "And they come as President Trump doubles down on his push - no longer dismissed as a joke - for Canada to join America and become the 51st state.",
      "Are you in Canada? Have you witnessed anything similar? Please share your experiences.",
      "Are you in Canada? Have you witnessed anything similar? Please share your experiences.",
      "While many economists project the tariffs will also drive up costs for Americans on everyday essentials, from gas to groceries, Canada is the more exposed trade partner. If they last for months, the country could tip into a painful economic recession.",
      "Anger is building - and with it, a desire to mount a fightback that has been echoed by political leaders in the country of 40 million.",
      "\"Many among us will be affected by this, and we will have some hard times. I ask you to be there for each other,\" said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a Saturday evening address. \"Now is the time to choose Canada.\"",
      "Some Canadians have already heeded the calls for solidarity. On social media, guides have circulated on how to avoid American-made products. One local grocery store in Toronto even began labelling its Canadian yogurt for shoppers, according to an image posted by Toronto doctor Iris Gorfinkel on X.",
      "Others have stated they will be cancelling travel plans to the US, or forgoing visiting there altogether.",
      "\"Yesterday, in response to Trump tariffs, we cancelled our family March break to the US,\" wrote Seth Klein, a Canadian author, on Bluesky on Sunday. \"Took a small hit on cancelled train tickets, but it needed to be done.\"",
      "In some Canadian provinces - namely Ontario, the largest by population - American booze will be pulled off the shelves indefinitely starting on Tuesday.",
      "This is in addition to a total of C$155bn ($105bn; \u00a386bn) of American goods that Canada has said it will tariff in retaliation, including vegetables, clothing, sports equipment, perfume and other items. Goods originating from Republican-led states, like Florida orange juice, are specifically being targeted.",
      "The US imports more of its oil from Canada than any other country, and Trudeau's government has signalled \"all options remain on the table\" for further retaliation.",
      "A 'destabilising' moment for Canada",
      "Trump's follow-through on his threat of steep tariffs - which were long speculated to be a negotiation tactic to get concessions on border security - have bewildered Canadians, who have enjoyed close economic, social and security ties to the US for decades.",
      "\"It's a shock,\" Michael Ignatieff, the former leader of Canada's Liberal Party, told the BBC.",
      "\"We're into a new world, in which the question on whether you can trust America becomes the fundamental question in foreign policy for every country.\"",
      "Pierre Poilievre, leader of Canada's opposition Conservative Party, called the tariffs on Sunday \"massive, unjust and unjustified.\"",
      "\"Canada is the United States' closest neighbour, greatest ally and best friend,\" he  said, noting that Canada fought alongside the US in two world wars, as well as in Korea and Afghanistan. \"There is no justification whatsoever for this treatment.\"",
      "Prime Minister Trudeau questioned in his Saturday address why the US would target Canada instead of looking to \"more challenging parts\" of the world.",
      "A portion of his speech was directly addressed to Americans, and he too, pointed to a history of shared bloodshed. \"We have fought, and died, alongside you,\" Trudeau said.",
      "Thomas Juneau, a professor at the University of Ottawa with a focus on national security, told the BBC that Trump's tariffs \"undoubtedly represent an earthquake in Canada-US relations.\"",
      "\"This is extremely destabilising for Canada,\" Prof Juneau said. \"As a country, we have massively benefited from our extremely close trade and security partnership with the US for decades.\"",
      "While the trade battle would likely force Canada to look for partners elsewhere, it ultimately can't escape geography, he said. It will remain reliant on the economic superpower next door.",
      "\"That is why Canada must absolutely now focus on salvaging the relationship as much as possible,\" Prof Juneau said.",
      "An unclear, costly fight ahead",
      "The big unknown remains how long the US will keep the tariffs in place, and what steps Canada could take to appease the Trump administration, which has said it expects action on cross-border fentanyl trafficking and illegal migration.",
      "TD Economics projects that the longer the tariffs remain in place, the worse the impact will be. Canada could enter a recession in five to six months, and its unemployment rate could hit more than 7%.",
      "Theo Argitis, managing director of the Ottawa-based public affairs firm Compass Rose Group, said the unknowns had left Canada no choice \"but to hit (Trump) back hard.\"",
      "\"At the end of the day, we don't even really know why he's doing this,\" Mr Argitis told the BBC.",
      "Trump says the flow of fentanyl, a highly potent and deadly drug, into the US from Canada and Mexico, is one key reason. US officials say the levies will remain in place \"until the crisis is alleviated.\"",
      "In response, the Canadian government has noted that less than 1% of fentanyl and illegal border crossings into the US come from Canada. It has offered to spend an additional C$1.3bn to secure the US-Canada border",
      "But Trump has also spoken publicly about his frustration with the trade deficit between Canada and the US, and more broadly his view that tariffs could be a source of revenue for Washington's coffers.",
      "On Sunday, he wrote on Truth Social that the US does not need Canadian products, and said the US pays \"hundreds of billions of dollars to subsidize Canada.\"",
      "\"Without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable country,\" Trump wrote, before repeating his view that Canada should instead become a US state.",
      "He has warned that the White House will enact harsher penalties on Canada should it choose to retaliate. For now, Canada has chosen to try and inflict some targeted pain on its more powerful neighbour, even if the economic scales are tipped against it.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 00:00:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The Microsoft co-founder says he enjoys giving away his fortune and it won't leave his kids poor.",
    "story": [
      "It's towards the end of our interview that Bill Gates reveals new numbers on how much his charitable Foundation has now spent in its efforts to combat preventable diseases and reduce poverty.",
      "\"I've given over 100 billion,\" he says, \"but I still have more to give.\"",
      "That's dollars, just to clarify, worth about \u00a380bn.",
      "It's roughly equivalent to the size of the Bulgarian economy or the cost of building the whole HS2 line.",
      "But to put it in context, it's also around the same as just one year of Tesla sales. (Tesla owner Elon Musk is now the richest man on the planet, a position Gates held for many years.)",
      "The co-founder of Microsoft and his fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett are combining their billions through the Gates Foundation he originally set up with his now ex-wife Melinda.",
      "Gates says philanthropy was instilled in him early on. His mother regularly told him \"with wealth came the responsibility to give it away\".",
      "His Foundation's 25th anniversary is in May, and Gates exclusively revealed the $100bn figure to the BBC.",
      "He tells me, for his part, he enjoys giving his money away (and around $60 billion of his fortune has gone into the Foundation so far).",
      "When it comes to his day-to-day lifestyle, he doesn't actually notice the difference: \"I made no personal sacrifice. I didn't order less hamburgers or less movies.\" He can also, of course, still afford his private jet and his various huge houses.",
      "He plans to give away \"the vast majority\" of his fortune, but tells me he has talked \"a lot\" with his three children about what might be the right amount to leave them.",
      "Will they be poor after he's gone? I ask him. \"They will not,\" he replies with a quick smile, adding \"in absolute, they'll do well, in percentage terms it's not a gigantic number\".",
      "Gates is a maths guy and it shows. At Lakeside School in Seattle, in eighth grade, he competed in a four-state regional maths exam and did so well that, at 13, he was one of the best high school maths students of any age in the region.",
      "Maths terminology comes second nature to him. But to translate, if you're worth $160bn, which Bloomberg's Billionaires Index claims he is, even leaving your children a tiny percentage of your fortune still makes them very rich.",
      "I'm with one of only 15 people on the planet who are centibillionaires (worth more than $100bn), according to Bloomberg. We're in his childhood home in Seattle, a mid-century modern four-bedroom house set into a hill, and we're meeting because he's written a memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, focusing on his early life.",
      "I want to find out what shaped a challenging, obsessive child who didn't fit the norm into one of the tech pioneers of our age.",
      "He's brought along his sisters, Kristi and Libby, and all three excitedly tour the home where they grew up. They haven't been back in some years and the current owners have refurbished (fortunately, the Gates siblings seem to approve of the changes).",
      "But it's bringing back memories including, as they walk into the kitchen, of the now-long-gone intercom system between rooms beloved by their mother. She used it to \"sing to us in the morning\", Gates tells me, to get them out of their bedrooms for breakfast.",
      "Mary Gates also set their watches and clocks eight minutes fast so the family would work to her time. Her son often rebelled at her efforts to improve him, but now tells me \"the crucible of my ambition was warmed through that relationship\".",
      "He puts his competitive spirit down to his grandmother \"Gami\", who was often with the family in this house and who taught him to outsmart the competition early on with games of cards.",
      "I follow him down the wooden stairs as he heads off to find his old childhood bedroom in the basement. It's a neat guest room now, but young Bill spent hours, even days, in here \"thinking\", as his sisters put it.",
      "At one point, his mum was so fed up with the mess that she confiscated any item of clothing she found on the floor and charged her stubborn son 25 cents to buy it back. \"I started wearing fewer clothes,\" he says.",
      "By this time, he was hooked on coding and, with some tech-savvy school friends, had been given access to a local firm's one computer in return for reporting any problems. Obsessed with learning to program in those nascent days of the tech revolution, he would sneak out at night through his bedroom window without his parents knowing to get more computer time.",
      "\"Do you think you could do it now?\" I ask.",
      "He starts unwinding the catch and opens the window. \"It's not that hard,\" he says with a smile as he climbs up and out. \"It's not hard at all.\"",
      "There is a famous early clip of Gates in which a TV presenter asks him if it's true he can jump over a chair from a standing position. He does it right there in the studio. I'm in the Gates childhood bedroom for something that feels like \"a moment\". The guy's nearly 70. But he's still game.",
      "He seems at ease - and it isn't just because we're in a familiar environment. In the memoir, he's revealed publicly for the first time that he thinks if he were growing up today, he'd probably be diagnosed on the autism spectrum.",
      "The only time I met him before was in 2012. He barely looked me in the eye as we did a quick interview about his goal to protect children from life-threatening diseases. There was certainly no pre-interview small talk. I wondered after our interaction whether he was on the spectrum.",
      "The book lays it out: his ability to hyperfocus on subjects he was interested in; his obsessive nature; his lack of social awareness.",
      "He says at elementary school he turned in a 177-page report on Delaware, having written off for brochures about the state, even sending stamped addressed envelopes to local companies asking for their annual reports. He was 11.",
      "His sisters tell me they knew he was different. Kristi, who's older, says she felt protective of him. \"He was not a normal kid\u2026 he would sit in his room and chew pencils down to the lead,\" she said.",
      "They're obviously close. Libby, a therapist, tells me she wasn't surprised to hear he believes he is on the spectrum. \"The surprise was more his willingness to say 'this might be the case',\" she says.",
      "Gates says he hasn't had a formal diagnosis and doesn't plan to. \"The positive characteristics for my career have been more beneficial than the deficits have been a problem for me,\" he says.",
      "He thinks neurodiversity is \"certainly\" over-represented in Silicon Valley because \"learning something in great depth at a young age - that helps you in certain complex subjects\".",
      "Elon Musk has also said he is on the spectrum, referencing Asperger's syndrome. The Tesla, X and SpaceX billionaire is famously courting Donald Trump, as are the other modern-day tech bros, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos among other Silicon Valley attendees at Trump's inauguration.",
      "Gates tells me although \"you can be cynical\" about their motives, he too reached out to the president. They had a three-hour dinner on 27 December \"because he's making decisions about global health and how we help poor countries, which is a big focus of mine now\".",
      "I ask Gates, himself a target of some pretty wild conspiracy theories, what he thinks of the decision taken by Zuckerberg after Trump's election to dump fact-checking in the US on his sites. Gates tells me he's not \"that impressed\" by how governments or private companies are navigating the boundaries between free speech and truth.",
      "\"I don't personally know how you draw that line, but I'm worried that we're not handling that as well as we should,\" he says.",
      "He also thinks children should be protected from social media, telling me there's a \"good chance\" that banning under-16s, as Australia is doing, is \"a smart thing\".",
      "Gates tells me \"social networking, even more than video gaming, can absorb your time and make you worry about other people approving you\" so we have to be \"very careful how it gets used\".",
      "As for Trump's first pick for US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who claims he isn't anti-vaccination but has promoted debunked claims about vaccines, Gates makes short shrift. He tells me RFK Jr is \"misleading people\".",
      "The Bill Gates origin story isn't rags to riches. His dad was a lawyer, money wasn't tight, although the decision to send their son to private school to try to motivate him was \"a stretch, even on my father's salary\".",
      "If they hadn't, we might never have heard of Bill Gates.",
      "He first got access to an early mainframe computer via a teletype machine at the school, after the mothers held a jumble sale to raise the money. The teachers couldn't figure it out, but four students were on it day and night. \"We got to use computers when almost nobody else did,\" he says.",
      "Much later, he would set up Microsoft with one of those school friends, Paul Allen. Another, Kent Evans, Gates' best friend, would die tragically age 17 in a climbing accident. As we walk around Lakeside School, we pass the chapel where they held his funeral and where Gates remembers crying on the steps.",
      "Together, they'd had big plans. When they weren't on computers, they were reading biographies to work out what factors made people successful.",
      "Now Gates has written his own. His philosophy? \"Much of who you are was there from the start.\"",

      "Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has urged people on the island of Santorini to \"stay calm\" after an increase in seismic activity.",
      "His remarks come as schools were told to close on Monday and authorities advised against large gatherings in enclosed spaces across the island, a popular tourist destination known for its whitewashed buildings and blue-domed churches.",
      "More than 280 earthquakes were recorded across Greek islands in the past 48 hours, according to the University of Athens' Seismological Laboratory.",
      "Tremors of up to 4.9 in magnitude were recorded north-east of Santorini on Monday, while there have been quakes of 4.3 and 3.9 magnitude reported nearby in recent days.",
      "Speaking from EU talks in Brussels, the prime minister said the country is working to manage \"a very intense geological phenomenon\", adding that he has asked the authorities to provide a \"comprehensive presentation\" of the geological data, to ensure everyone knows the scale of this seismic event.",
      "Mitsotakis's remarks come as many people in Santorini spent Sunday night outdoors, amid fears of potential damage to buildings during the quakes.",
      "Some focal points of the tremors have been recorded at a depth of just 2km (1.2miles) below the surface.",
      "Some residents have chosen to leave the island while the seismic activity is ongoing, including Kostas Sakavaras, a tour guide who has lived there for 18 years, and his wife and children.",
      "\"We decided yesterday to take the ferry and come to the mainland,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"We stayed calm. It's not such a big deal. It was more like, the schools were closed. We considered it's a better choice to come to the mainland as a precaution.\"",
      "He said they were keeping in touch with friends and family who had remained, and that the tremors had been \"mild\".",
      "\"Nothing has been falling, or anything like that,\" he said, adding that the worst part had been the sound.",
      "\"That's the most scary part of it,\" said Mr Sakavaras, who plans to return home once schools reopen.",
      "Santorini is on what is known as the Hellenic Volcanic Arc - a chain of volcanic islands created by plate tectonics - but the last major eruption was in the 1950s.",
      "Greek authorities said that the recent minor earthquakes were related to tectonic plate movements instead of volcanic activity.",
      "The tremors are being caused by the Aegean sea plate subducting beneath the African plate, causing resistance and friction to build up along the fault line.",
      "When the plate shifts, energy is released in the form of an earthquake.",
      "Earthquakes are very common in this region, but authorities say activity in the Santorini caldera - the volcanic basin the island sits around - remains in decline.",
      "While the recent tremors are thought to be unlikely to be a precursor to a volcanic eruption, the possibility cannot be ruled out.",
      "The tremors recorded by geologists are considered minor, but authorities have recommended a number of preventative measures in addition to the school closures, including asking ships to avoid the ports of Ammoudi and Fira.",
      "Big cruise ships often anchor near the Old Port of Fira, with passengers being brought to shore on smaller boats.",
      "Schools were also told to close on the nearby islands of Anafi, Ios and Amorgos, and will remain so until 7 February.",
      "On Monday, a message from the emergency services was sent to the residents of Santorini, urging them to leave the areas of Ammoudi, Armeni and the Old Port of Fira due to landslides.",
      "According to the European Mediterranean Seismological Centre, a total of over 555 earthquakes have been recorded since January 28 in the area between Amorgos and Santorini.",
      "Kostas Papazachos, a professor of geophysics at Thessaloniki Aristotle University, told public broadcaster ERT that the precautionary measures were \"precisely to limit the impact of a stronger earthquake\", as quakes cannot be predicted.",
      "He added: \"When you have a sequence next to you that is so vivid, so intense, you have to be a bit careful, precisely because there is always the risk of something like that happening.\"",
      "Earthquakes are measured on the Moment Magnitude Scale (Mw) - instead of the better-known Richter scale, which is now considered less accurate. The number attributed to an earthquake represents a combination of the distance a fault line has moved and the force that moved it.",
      "A tremor of 2.5 or less usually cannot be felt, but can be detected by instruments. Quakes of up to five are felt and cause minor damage.",
      "Prof Papazachos said that were a minor earthquake to occur while people were gathered in large crowds, it could create panic that may lead to people being injured.",
      "The South Aegean Regional Fire Department has been placed on general alert and rescue teams as well as the regional commander have been dispatched to Santorini.",
      "Various airlines have added extra flights as people rush to leave the island, and more ferries have also been deployed. Hotel owners are reporting a series of cancellations in their bookings, as tourists are avoiding the island.",

    "title": "The Sims at 25: How a virtual dollhouse took over the world",
    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 00:01:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Some people didn't expect it to last a year. Here's how the popular life simulator has stayed alive.",
    "story": [
      "The Sims was never supposed to be a hit.",
      "Back in the 1990s, when creator Will Wright pitched the game to his bosses, they weren't convinced by his idea of a \"virtual dollhouse\".",
      "A so-called life simulator where players design their own characters, give them personalities and tend to their needs.",
      "Who wants that?",
      "Quite a lot of people, it turns out.",
      "Now, 25 years from its debut, The Sims is one of the best-selling video game series of all time, with an active community of superfans known as Simmers.",
      "The latest instalment, The Sims 4, has been translated into 18 languages and played by 85 million people worldwide, according to publisher Electronic Arts.",
      "The original game's open-ended nature helped it to become a hit and reach so-called \"casual gamers\" outside the medium's more dedicated audience.",
      "Players had the freedom to carefully craft a detailed domestic setting for their digital people, managing their love lives, daily routines, basic needs and hobbies in exacting detail.",
      "But it also allowed them to imagine various torments for their virtual pals. One of the most famous - stranding your Sim in a swimming pool without a ladder - remains a popular meme to this day.",
      "UK-based streamer Jesse, best known as Plumbella, says she became obsessed with the legendary trick when she first played the game at five years old.",
      "The Sims has been part of Jesse\u2019s life ever since, thanks, she says, to the community around it.",
      "Players can create modifications or \"mods\" that alter different elements from the way the game plays to a characters appearance.",
      "Extra height options, having multiple jobs and neurodivergent personality traits are among some of the popular fan-made add-ons.",
      "For dedicated fans, Jesse says, the longevity comes from building on each other's creations.",
      "As she puts it: \"Take something and customise it and share it with other Simmers.",
      "\"It's really interesting to see the ways that people can come up with to use their game in an interesting way.\"",
      "The ability to express yourself in The Sims also made it a popular title among its many players from diverse communities.",
      "Even at its launch in 2000, The Sims included same-sex relationships at a time when choices around sexuality or identity in gaming were rare.",
      "Creator Mollie, who streams as TheEnglishSimmer, makes a lot of LGBT-themed content for her channel.",
      "She says developer Maxis has \"always been kind of a spearhead in the gaming industry when it comes to telling diverse stories and wanting to show that representation\".",
      "Mollie says The Sims has given her a platform to find others like her.",
      "\"That's been so wonderful that I have been able to tell my stories and connect with people and they can see themselves represented,\" she says.",
      "The Sims has come in for more criticism over the years for its racial representation.",
      "American content creator Amira, known as Xmiramira online, created a custom skin tone pack for The Sims 4 that's still used by many players today.",
      "\"I couldn't make Sims that either look similar to me or my family, friends. And that's the case in a lot of games,\" says Amira.",
      "\"But the difference between The Sims and other games is I can do something about it.\"",
      "Amira's Melanin Pack was a hit when it was released, and she's since worked with Maxis and Electronic Arts on officially adopting more skin tones into the game.",
      "\"For me that's a big part of why I've played the game for so long,\" she says.",
      "\"I can do what I want, I can make a Sim with any body type, complexion, hair, whatever I want to do, it's one of the most customisable games I have.\"",
      "Amira says she's noticed more and more games offering the ability to choose different skin tones, body types and hairstyles without the need for third-party add-ons.",
      "While The Sims is often seen as a leader when it comes to inclusivity in gaming, some people are uncomfortable with its approach.",
      "Zoe Delahunty-Light, a video producer at website Eurogamer, commends The Sims for making \"great strides\" with diversity and working with creators to build authentic representation into the game.",
      "But she does point out that much of the work was done first, for free, by modders.",
      "The official Lovestruck add-on, Zoe says, introduces polyamorous relationships to the game and costs \u00a330 ($37).",
      "\"So it can feel like it is squeezing as much money as it can out of people who desire representation the most, which is pretty audacious,\" she says.",
      "The game has also been criticised over a lack of inclusion for players with disabilities, both in their ability to modify its controls and see themselves on screen.",
      "\"The game still lacks the option to change key binds, which is a basic accessibility issue,\" says Zoe.",
      "Developer Maxis has previously said it's discussing the introduction of more accessibility features to the game.",
      "It has added certain features - such as visible hearing aids - to improve the representation of disability in the game.",
      "Press X to sniff: Can smelling a game make it more immersive?",
      "Assassin's Creed maker Ubisoft praised at gaming accessibility awards",
      "Cher Lloyd on making new music, Swagger Jagger and Liam Payne's unmatched talent",
      "As The Sims celebrates its anniversary, the new US government has introduced policies to scale back diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.",
      "Critics argue these schemes are discriminatory and used to push political agendas, while supporters argue that they work to combat inequalities.",
      "The tech industry has followed suit, with companies such as Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, scrapping its DEI efforts and also cutting moderation teams.",
      "There's a question over whether this could impact gaming, where companies are often criticised for failing to adequately tackle racial and gender-based harassment on their platforms.",
      "\"The bigger concern is that this will be seen as a green light for certain groups of toxic gamers to become more open about their own hateful views, making inclusive spaces more important than ever,\" says Zoe.",
      "Simmer Amira says it's especially important for a life simulation game such as The Sims to include as many people as possible.",
      "\"Everybody should be able to, for the most part, make themselves with little to no issue,\" she says.",
      "Jesse adds: \"A lot of people don't get to experience things that other cultures experience and it's a really great way to implement learning about it in everyday life.",
      "\"I think that goes a long way to acceptance as well.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 00:13:23 GMT",
    "summary": "The breakout star of the film has been winning awards as a stripper who marries the son of an oligarch.",
    "story": [
      "In many ways Anora feels like a fairy tale. Except that the film's title character - Ani to her friends - is a stripper and occasional sex worker. And her Prince Charming is the spoiled son of a Russian oligarch.",
      "When he spontaneously proposes, and they get married in Las Vegas, it seems all her dreams are coming true. But she quickly finds that a host of people strongly disapprove of the match.",
      "For Mikey Madison though, it is a dream of a part, where she gets to display everything from steely strength to delicate fragility.",
      "\"I recognised from the beginning that she's a very complicated character, very nuanced,\" agrees Mikey Madison.",
      "\"I always felt that she was someone who was very vulnerable on the inside. But is constantly covering it up with this hardness or an  aggression. But I do think that she's quite soft inside.",
      "\"I think that she's hopeful that this is her happily ever after, and I think that it's an opportunity and I like that she doesn't want to let go of them. And so she's going to fight to the end to try to save it.\"",
      "Both the film, and Madison's performance in particular, have been gaining huge amounts of awards momentum. It started when the movie premiered at Cannes.",
      "\"I have been working for almost a decade now, well trying to work. And that was my ultimate dream, to go to Cannes. And we had a film in the main competition, and then we won [the top prize, the Palme D'Or] and that was crazy in itself.\"",
      "She calls \"everything that has followed\" an \"absolutely wonderful, pleasant surprise\".",
      "\"Especially because I think I went into it feeling really proud of the film, and like we made something special to us. And the fact that the film is also special to other people is wonderful.",
      "\"It's a dream.\"",
      "Madison was relatively unknown before Anora. She had had small parts in the fifth instalment of the Scream horror franchise and in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon A Time in Hollywood.",
      "The writer and director of Anora Sean Baker had seen her on screen before, and wrote the part of Ani especially for her.",
      "\"She's so unique. Not only in her physicality, but there's something about her aura,\" says Baker. \"There's something.. she's actually quite subdued, even in real life. Her demeanour is, she's quite reserved.",
      "\"But then suddenly she can explode like no other other person I've ever seen, no other actor I've ever seen.",
      "\"And I was always looking forward to those moments shooting the film, knowing that a scene would call for that. You know, to see that you don't detect anything, and then suddenly just total eruption. It was incredible to watch.\"",
      "The contradictions in Ani, and the shifting genres of the movie were elements that Madison says she embraced strongly during the filming.",
      "\"As an actor sometimes I felt like I was shooting a very romantic film, and sometimes it was almost like a horror film, or a drama, or a slapstick comedy. To navigate through my character with all of these different genres was fun. It was a challenge, and I liked it!\"",
      "'Oscar talk'",
      "The 25-year-old has been nominated as best actress at every major awards ceremony, including the Golden Globes, the Batfas and the Oscars. And she is probably Demi Moore's main rival for best actress at the Academy Awards.",
      "Speaking before her Oscar nomination, she said it felt astonishing to be part of the awards conversation.",
      "\"I know that I'm incredibly overjoyed, honoured, and humbled that our film is being recognised in this way. But I'm just processing it.",
      "\"It's overwhelming and amazing, and all of the things,\" she says, giving every appearance of being overcome by the acclaim her performance has been gathering.",
      "Should Mikey Madison finish off a fairy tale few months by winning best actress at next month's ceremony, she'll be one of the youngest ever performers to win that academy award, beaten only by a handful of stars, including Jennifer Lawrence, Marlee Matlin, and Audrey Hepburn.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 23:00:30 GMT",
    "summary": "GBS is a rare disorder where the immune system attacks nerve cells, causing paralysis.",
    "story": [
      "Last month, a school teacher in the western Indian city of Pune found her six-year-old son upset about homework.",
      "\"I had erased some words and asked him to write them. I assumed he was angry and that's why he was not holding the pencil properly,\" she told the Indian Express newspaper.",
      "She never imagined his struggle to hold a pencil was the first sign of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS), a rare disorder where the immune system attacks nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and paralysis.",
      "Within days, the boy was in intensive care, unable to move his arms or legs. As his condition worsened, he lost the ability to swallow, speak, and eventually breathe, requiring ventilator support. He is now recovering.",
      "The boy is among around 160 reported cases of GBS since early January in Pune, an education and IT hub, ringed by industrial towns and villages. There have been five suspected deaths. Currently, 48 patients are in intensive  care, 21 on ventilator, and 38 have been discharged, according to official figures.",
      "GBS begins with tingling or numbness in the feet and hands, followed by muscle weakness and difficulty moving joints. Symptoms worsen over two to four weeks, typically starting in the arms and legs. The reported mortality rate varies between three and 13%, depending on severity and quality of health care support.",
      "The outbreak in Pune is being traced to a pathogen called campylobacter jejuni, a leading cause of foodborne infections, and the biggest driver of GBS worldwide. The link between the two was discovered in the 1990s in rural China, where the pathogen was common in chickens, and GBS outbreaks occurred every monsoon as children played in water contaminated by chicken or duck droppings.",
      "GBS is not entirely uncommon in India. Monojit Debnath and Madhu Nagappa, of  Bangalore-based  National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), studied 150 GBS patients over a five year period between 2014 and 2019.",
      "Their findings showed 79% of the patients had evidence of prior infections, with a third testing positive for campylobacter. Notably, co-infections were more common, occurring in 65%, suggesting a complex interplay of bacteria and viruses.",
      "More recently, outbreaks linked to the pathogen have been reported from all over the world. In the first seven months of 2023, Peru reported over 200 suspected cases and at least four deaths of GBS, prompting the government to declare a national health emergency and strengthen public health measures. Two-thirds of the cases were linked to campylobacter.",
      "In countries with good hygiene, fewer GBS cases are linked to campylobacter, with respiratory infections being a major contributor, say experts. There have been other triggers as well. In 2015 Brazil reported a cluster of GBS cases linked to the Zika virus. Vaccines can rarely trigger GBS, but one Covid vaccine was reportedly linked to a few hundred GBS cases in the UK in 2021.",
      "\"Campylobacter is endemic with hundreds of thousands of cases taking place all the time. It is always existing in the environment,\" Hugh Willison, a professor of neurology at University of Glasgow told me.",
      "Yet, it is not easy to develop GBS, scientists say.",
      "There's a specific strain of campylobacter, which has a sugar-coated outer layer, and in rare cases, its molecular structure matches the coating of human nerve cells.",
      "When the patient's immune system attacks the bacteria, it may end up targeting the nerves as well \u2013 a process called molecular mimicry \u2013 leading to GBS. However, a small fraction of campylobacter strains have this nerve-like coat.",
      "\"In Pune, a strain of campylobacter with this molecular feature is likely to be circulating, and a surge in infections with this strain consequently leads to a higher number of GBS cases,\" says Prof Willison.",
      "Most experts estimate that about one in 100 campylobacter strains carry the GBS risk, and one in 100 people infected with such a strain develop GBS, making the overall risk roughly one in 10,000.",
      "That creates what Prof Willison describes as an \"immunological Russian roulette\", triggering an \"acute neurological tsunami\" that surges through the peripheral nervous system. Once the immune response subsides, the attack wanes \u2013 but the body still needs time, medical care, and support to repair the damage.",
      "What makes things worse is that there is no cure for GBS.",
      "In GBS, the body produces antibodies against campylobacter, which then attack the nerves. Physicians use \"plasma exchange\", a process that filters blood to remove the harmful antibodies, along with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a therapeutic antibody derived from normal blood, to help reduce the severity of the disease.",
      "The other challenge is that there is no single test to diagnose GBS. The diagnosis, say physicians, is mainly based on clinical features. It presents itself as a form of paralysis which can be also caused by polio, viruses or rare neurological disease.",
      "\"The diagnosis is a constellation of clinical features. Misdiagnosis or no diagnosis or late diagnosis can happen easily,\" says Prof Willison.",
      "India's uneven public health system presents a challenge, as doctors in rural areas may struggle to diagnose GBS. One reason, possibly, why the World Health Organization (WHO) teams are in Pune, is collaborating with federal and state health workers to trace, test, and monitor cases, and analysing trends to support effective treatment.",
      "Authorities say they have surveilled more than 60,000 houses, picked up 160 water samples for tests, and asked people to drink boiled water and eat fresh and clean food, and not have \"stale food and partially cooked chicken or mutton\".",
      "While most cases of GBS around the world come from undercooked poultry, it can also spread through water, similar to cholera or salmonella, experts say.",
      "Contaminated water used for washing or preparing street food makes it easy for the bacteria to spread. Clearly, in Pune, a campylobacter strain with the distinctive molecular feature is circulating, affecting a large number of people.",
      "What is not clear is whether this has been due to large scale contamination of water supply or a lot of people consuming infected poultry. \"We appeal to people not to panic,\" says a health department advisory. But in the face of uncertainty, it is easier said than done.",

      "For days, she had nursed the gunshot wound without help. She told me she was eventually escorted to a public hospital by M23 fighters.",
      "The woman asked to be moved to a private hospital, where she is now receiving treatment, because she was not getting adequate attention from the overstretched doctors.",
      "But even at this second hospital, medics were overwhelmed as an increasing number of patients came through the doors.",
      "\"We have treated most of them because we had contingency plans,\" said a doctor, who did not want to be named for security reasons.",
      "He added: \"On Sunday when the fighting began, we received 315 patients and we treated them.\"",
      "But now, the hospital counts over 700 patients with various degrees of injury, the doctor told me.",

    "story": [
      "On a hill above Nuuk's cathedral stands a 7ft statue of the protestant missionary Hans Egede. He had reopened Greenland's link with Northern Europe in the early 1700s and laid the groundwork for the establishment of Denmark's proudest colonial possession.",
      "One day in the late 1970s, the bronze figure was suddenly covered in red paint.",
      "I remember that day well - I passed the statue every day on my mile long walk to school. I spent two years living on Greenland while my father taught geography at Nuuk's teacher training college.",
      "It was apparent not everyone among the Inuit majority was happy about the changes that Egede had brought to Greenland a quarter of a millennium earlier.",
      "The clinking of beer bottles in filled plastic bags carried home by the Inuit to their tiny apartments \u2013 much smaller, usually, than the ones we Danes lived in \u2013 was testimony to pervasive alcoholism, one of the ills that Denmark had brought to Greenland, amid a lot that was undeniably good: modern health, good education.",
      "But apart from the paint-covered statue, the dream of Greenland being independent from Denmark was only slowly beginning to manifest itself.",
      "At the Teacher Training College right next to my school, the closest Greenland got to having a radical student movement was developing - some young people at the college demanded to be taught in their native Greenland language.",
      "By the late 1970s, the capital was called Nuuk and no longer Godthaab, its official name for well over two centuries.",
      "Now, decades on, change is afoot once again, as Donald Trump has his eyes on gaining control of the country.",
      "Asked in January if he would rule out using military or economic force in order to take over the autonomous Danish territory or the Panama canal, he responded: \"No, I can't assure you on either of those two. But I can say this, we need them for economic security.\"",
      "Later on Air Force One he told reporters: \"I think we're going to have it,\" adding that the island's 57,000 residents \"want to be with us\".",
      "The question is, do they?",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has, meanwhile, insisted Greenland is not for sale. \"Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders,\" she said. \"It's the Greenlanders themselves who have to define their future.\"",
      "So, what do the island's inhabitants want that future to look like - and if it does not involve them being part of the kingdom of Denmark, then what is the alternative?",
      "Strained ties with the Danes",
      "One poll of Greenlanders suggested only 6% of Greenlanders want their country to become part of the US, with 9% undecided and 85% against. But despite this, Frederiksen knows that the question of what Greenlanders want is a delicate one.",
      "Traditionally, Danes have viewed themselves as the world's nicest imperialists ever since they started to colonise Greenland in the 1720s.",
      "This self-image has been eroded in recent years, however, by a string of revelations about past high-handedness in dealing with the island's population.",
      "In particular, there have been reports of serious wrongs committed against Greenlanders - not in the distant past, but within living memory.",
      "This included a controversial large-scale contraceptive campaign. A joint investigation by authorities in Denmark and Greenland is examining the fitting of intrauterine devices (coils) into women of child-bearing age on the island, often without their consent or even their knowledge.",
      "It has been reported this happened to almost half of all the island's women of child-bearing age between 1966 and 1970.",
      "Last December, Greenland's prime minister M\u00fate Egede described this as \"straightforward genocide, carried out by the Danish state against the Greenland population\".",
      "He made the remark while talking to the Danish Broadcasting Corporation in an interview that dealt generally with relations between Greenland and Denmark.",
      "Also, in the 1960s and 1970s hundreds of children from the island were taken from their mothers, often on dubious grounds, to be reared by foster parents in Denmark. In some cases, this happened without the consent of the biological mothers, and in other instances, they were not informed that their ties with their children would be cut completely.",
      "This left a raw emotional wound that often was not healed decades later. Some of the adopted Greenlandic children were later able to trace their biological parents, but many others were not.",
      "A small group demanded compensation from the Danish state in the summer of 2024. If they are successful, it could pave the way for a large number of similar claims by other adoptees.",
      "Iben Mondrup, a novelist who was born in Denmark and spent her childhood in Greenland, sees the recent events as a rude wake-up call for the Danes who have been accustomed to viewing themselves as a benign influence in Greenland.",
      "\"The entire relationship has been based on a narrative that Denmark was helping Greenland, without getting anything in return,\" she says.",
      "\"We have talked about Denmark as the motherland that took Greenland under its wing and taught it gradually to stand on its own feet. There has been a widespread use of educational metaphors.",
      "\"We Danes constantly return to the idea that Greenland owes us something, at least gratitude.\"",
      "'Greenland has now grown up'",
      "Opinion polls carried out in recent years indicate a fairly consistent pattern in which around two-thirds of Greenland's population say they want to be independent. A survey carried out in 2019 showed support of 67.7% for the move among adult Greenlanders.",
      "Jenseeraq Poulsen, director of Oceans North Kalaallit Nunaat, an environmental charity in Nuuk, says: \"As I see it, Greenland has now grown up, and our sense of self-worth and our self-confidence requires that we can start making our own decisions as adults on an equal footing with other nations.",
      "\"It's important for a country to not be in a straitjacket,\" Nunaat continues.",
      "\"We shouldn't have to ask for permission to do anything. You know the feeling [as a child] when you have to ask your parents something and they say you can't? That's what it's like.\"",
      "And yet the word \"independence\" may not fully capture the complexity of the challenges and choices that Greenland faces, according to Poulsen.",
      "He says he doesn't like the word \"since everyone is interdependent in the modern world\".",
      "He adds: \"Even Denmark, which is a sovereign state, is interdependent\u2026 I prefer the word statehood.\"",
      "Ingredients for independence",
      "Not a huge amount is known about the mechanics of how Trump proposes to acquire Greenland. When he first floated the idea in 2019 he said it would be \"essentially a large real-estate deal\".",
      "The extent to which Greenland would remain autonomous under US rule is unclear. So too is how its benefits system would work.",
      "After the proposal to buy the island, Trump has now doubled down on his rhetoric, apparently open to satisfying his territorial ambitions in the North Atlantic by military means.",
      "The visit by Donald Trump Jr and members of Trump's team added visual emphasis to the then president-elect's words but not everyone on Greenland was wowed.",
      "\"That makes us dig in our heels and say, 'Please control yourself,'\" says Janus Chemnitz Kleist, an IT manager for the Greenland government. \"Some people who might previously have had a positive attitude towards closer ties with the United States have started reconsidering.\"",
      "Aaja Chemnitz, a member of Danish parliament for the left-leaning party Inuit Ataqatigiit, has her own take on what needs to be done to pave the way for independence, in whatever form that may take.",
      "First, she argues that it is important to reverse what she describes as a mild brain drain out of Greenland. She says only 56% of young Greenlanders who are educated at universities and colleges in Denmark and other countries return upon graduation.",
      "\"That's not a very high number. It would be good if we could make it more attractive for them to return home and take up some of the positions that are important in Greenland society,\" she says.",
      "But in her view there is a broader economic issue too.",
      "\"Political and economic independence are interconnected,\" she says, \"and it's crucial that we cooperate with Denmark on the development of business in Greenland but also work with the Americans on the extraction of raw materials and the development of tourism.\"",
      "At present, the Greenland economy is heavily reliant on the so-called block grant, a subsidy paid by the Danish government that in 2024 amounted to the equivalent of around \u00a3480m a year.",
      "As this subsidy would likely disappear after independence, one of the most important challenges facing the Greenlanders is to find ways to replace it, explains Javier Arnaut, an economist at the University of Greenland in Nuuk.",
      "\"The economy is one of the main factors holding back the movement towards independence,\" he says. \"The economy is reliant on the Danish block grant, and if it disappeared, Greenland would have a large hole in the public budget that would need to be filled.",
      "\"The question is how. If the gap could be filled, for example, by increasing fiscal revenue through projects in mining with new partners, a clearer path towards economic independence could emerge.\"",
      "The welfare factor",
      "There is another question \u2013 not unimportant in a Nordic-style welfare state where a large part of the economy is under government control \u2013 of what would happen to all those health and social benefits that Greenland currently receives as a result of its relationship with Denmark.",
      "Currently, these benefits include access to treatment in Danish hospitals.",
      "Ask Greenlanders whether they want separation from Denmark, and most who say they do have a caveat - only if it does not cost them their welfare system.",
      "The question of what happens to the welfare system would be particularly acute in the event of a US takeover of Greenland given the American welfare state is not only smaller than those in the Nordic countries but of those in most other Western countries.",
      "But not everyone is convinced by suggestions that Greenland's cancer patients, for example, would suddenly have nowhere to go in case of independence. Pele Broberg, Greenland's former foreign minister and now chairman of the political party Naleraq, cites Iceland, which left the Danish kingdom in 1944 as an example.",
      "\"Iceland still sends medical patients to Denmark,\" he says. \"They still have students studying in Denmark, and vice versa. I have a hard time seeing what kind of obstacles Denmark would like to put up if we decide to leave the kingdom.",
      "\"It's rhetoric meant to scare us from having a discussion about independence,\" he argues.",
      "However, some Greenlanders believe that true independence may never be accomplished because of these very concerns. Mr Chemnitz Kleist argues: \"The kind of independence that you see in countries like Denmark or Belgium or Angola will never happen here.",
      "\"With such a small population, some of it not well educated, and with a complex welfare system which we would like to keep, we can never become independent in the way the word is usually understood.\"",
      "Trump's tactics and the case for the US",
      "All of these issues have been discussed for years, but they have suddenly attained a new sense of urgency with Trump's apparent bid for control of Greenland.",
      "But regardless of who sits in the White House, the question is whether Greenlanders would see any benefit in raising cooperation levels with the United States - and if so, to what extent?",
      "\"Greenland's national project is all about spreading out the island's dependence in order to have as many ties as possible with the outside world,\" says Ulrik Pram Gad, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies and an expert on the Arctic region.",
      "The search for Ukraine's missing - 'no one could have foreseen this nightmare'",
      "Friends reunited? Trump faces a very different Kim Jong Un this time",
      "How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate",
      "It is in this context that some Greenlanders are warming to the model of a \"free association\" with either Denmark or the United States \u2013 replicating a similar loose arrangement between the United States and certain islands in the Pacific.",
      "\"The problem is that Greenland feels swallowed up by Denmark,\" says Mr Pram Gad. \"It aims to feel less constrained and less dependent on just one country. Free association is not so much about 'association' and more about 'free'. It's about having one's own sovereignty.\"",
      "Donald Trump's threat to take over Greenland may have been unexpected but with the trip to Nuuk his team were well aware there was a thread to be pulled at, that his security concerns come at a time when many Greenlanders are considering their future.",
      "\"In recent years all these stories have emerged and placed the modernisation narrative in a different light. The whole idea that Denmark was pursuing an altruistic project in Greenland has been challenged,\" says Iben Mondrup.",
      "\"The project that the Greenlanders were told was for their own good was actually not good for them after all. This gives rise to all kinds of thoughts about the status of the Greenlanders inside the Danish kingdom. It adds fuel to the criticism that has developed in Greenland in recent years about the idea of a community with Denmark.\"",
      "Norway, Iceland and Canada",
      "But if it's not only Denmark and it's not only America, who else can Greenland turn to? Surveys suggest that a majority of the island's inhabitants would like to step up cooperation with Canada and Iceland. Mr Broberg, the party chairman, likes the idea, and he throws Norway into the equation as well.",
      "\"We have more in common with Norway and Iceland than we have with Denmark,\" he says. \"All three of us have a presence in the Arctic, unlike Denmark. The only reason I leave open the possibility of a free association with Denmark after independence is it may put some Greenlanders at ease because they are used to the relationship with Denmark.\"",
      "Still, the question is: Would Canada and Iceland want to take on the task of providing the social benefits that Greenlanders covet? The answer would almost certainly be no.",
      "In this way, the future presenting itself to the Greenlanders is both exhilaratingly open and at the same time depressingly narrow.",

    "title": "Dying with dignity: Breaking the taboo around 'living wills' in India",
    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 00:56:52 GMT",
    "summary": "A living will lets people choose the medical care they want to receive if they develop a terminal illness.",
    "story": [
      "In 2010, IP Yadev, a surgeon from the southern Indian state of Kerala, was confronted with one of the hardest decisions of his life.",
      "He had to decide between keeping his father - a terminal cancer patient - alive, and honouring his wish, expressed verbally, to stop all treatments and put an end to his suffering.",
      "Warning: This article contains some distressing details",
      "\"As a son, I felt it was my duty to do whatever I could to prolong my father's life. This made him unhappy and he ended up dying alone in an intensive-care unit. The doctor's last efforts to revive him using CPR crushed his ribs. It was a horrible death,\" Dr Yadev says.",
      "The experience, he says, deeply impacted him and helped him realise the importance of advance medical directives (AMDs), also known as living wills.",
      "A living will is a legal document that allows a person over 18 years to choose the medical care they would want to receive if they develop a terminal illness or condition with no hope of recovery and are unable to make decisions by themselves.",
      "For example, they could specify that they don't want to be put on life-support machines or insist that they want to be given adequate pain-relieving medication.",
      "In 2018, India's Supreme Court allowed people to draw up living wills and thereby choose passive euthanasia, where medical treatment can be withdrawn under strict guidelines to hasten a person's death. Active euthanasia - any act that intentionally helps a person kill themselves - is illegal in the country.",
      "But despite the legal go-ahead, the concept of living wills hasn't really taken off in India. Experts say that this has much to do with the way Indians talk, or rather, don't talk about death. Death is often considered to be a taboo subject and any mention of it is thought to bring bad luck.",
      "But there are now efforts underway to change this.",
      "In November, Dr Yadev and his team launched India's first programme - at the Government Medical College in Kerala's Kollam district - to educate people about living wills, offering information in person and over the phone. Volunteers also conduct awareness campaigns and distribute will templates.",
      "Creating a living will requires family members to have open and honest conversations about death. Despite some resistance, activists and institutions are taking steps to raise awareness, and there's a growing, though cautious, interest.",
      "Kerala leads the way in these conversations. Currently, it has the country's  best palliative care network, and organisations that offer end-of-life care have also started awareness campaigns around living wills.",
      "In March, around 30 people from the Pain and Palliative Care society in Thrissur city signed living wills. Dr E Divakaran, founder of the society, says that the gesture is aimed at make the idea more popular among people.",
      "\"Most people have never heard of the term so they have many questions, like whether such a directive can be misused or if they can make changes to their wills later on,\" Mr Yadev says, adding that most inquiries have come from people in their 50s and 60s.",
      "\"Right now, it's the educated, upper-middle class that's making use of the facility. But with grassroot awareness campaigns, we're expecting the demographic to widen,\" he says.",
      "According to the Supreme Court order, a person must draft the will, sign it in the presence of two witnesses, and have it attested by a notary or gazetted officer. A copy of the will must then be submitted to a state government-appointed custodian.",
      "While the guidelines exist on paper, many state governments are yet to set up mechanisms to implement them. This is what Dr Nikhil Datar, a gynaecologist from Mumbai city, realised when he made his living will two years ago as there was no custodian to whom he could submit it.",
      "So he went to court and it resulted in the Maharashtra government appointing about 400 officials across local bodies in the state to serve as custodians of living wills.",
      "In June, Goa state implemented the Supreme Court's orders around living wills and a high court judge became the first person in the state to register one.",
      "On Saturday, Karnataka state ordered district health officers to nominate people to serve on a key medical board required to certify living wills. [Two medical boards have to certify that a patient meets necessary criteria for the implementation of a living will before medical practitioners can act on it.]",
      "Mr Datar is also advocating for a centralised digital repository for living wills, accessible nationwide. He has also made his own will available for free on his website as a template. He believes a will helps prevent problems for both families and doctors when a patient is in a vegetative state and beyond recovery.",
      "\"Very often, family members don't want the person to endure more treatment but because they can't care for the patient at home, they keep them in the hospital. Doctors, bound by medical ethics, can't withhold treatment, so the patient ends up suffering with no way to express their wishes,\" Mr Datar says.",
      "Living wills aren't just about choosing passive euthanasia. Dr Yadev recalls a case where a person wanted his will to specify that he should be placed on life support if his condition ever required it.",
      "\"He explained that his only child was living abroad and that he didn't want to die until his son got to meet him,\" Mr Yadev says. \"You have the freedom to choose how you want to die. It is one of the greatest rights available to us, so why not exercise it?\" he says.",
      "Healthcare advocates say that conversations around palliative care are slowly growing in the country, giving an impetus to living wills.",
      "Dr Sushma Bhatnagar of Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences says the hospital is launching a department to educate patients about living wills. \"Ideally, doctors should discuss living wills with patients, but there's a communication gap,\" she says, adding that training doctors for these conversations can help ensure a person dies with dignity.",
      "\"Throughout our lives, our choices are coloured by our loved ones' wishes or by what society thinks is right,\" Mr Yadev says.",
      "\"At least in death, let us make choices that are in our interest and fully our own.\""

    "summary": "Retaliatory taxes against the US by other nations could lead global trade into uncharted territory.",
    "story": [
      "It was not a bluff, the tariffs are here - and this is just the opening salvo from the Oval Office.",
      "The world trading system has not been here before. A slide towards a wider trade conflict is very much on the cards, as President Trump prepares similar tariffs firstly against Europe, and then at a lower level universally.",
      "But what matters as much as the actions the US takes, is how the rest of the world responds.",
      "That, in turn, requires a judgement about what the president is actually trying to achieve.",
      "Trump regularly changes his rationale for tariffs - either to coerce diplomatic change, to deal with trade imbalances or to raise significant revenues.",
      "These policy objectives cannot all be achieved simultaneously.",
      "For example, learning from the experience of Trump's first term \"China deal\", Western diplomats have been scrambling to find lists of US goods they might buy more of, in order to give the White House some wins.",
      "Europe could say it is increasing its purchases of US shipments of liquefied natural gas, or arms, or specialised magnets for wind farms.",
      "It doesn't really matter if these trends were already in train, as long as the US president can be allowed to chalk up a \"win\".",
      "But is changing trade deficit numbers really the aim here?",
      "Officially, the rationale for Trump's move is punishment for the trade in the synthetic opioid fentanyl, but that is widely seen as a legal pretext for \"emergency\" action that would normally require a congressional decision.",
      "Canada has signalled it will take a robust approach to Trump, best articulated by the contender to be the country's next prime minister, Mark Carney.",
      "\"We will retaliate \u2026 dollar for dollar\" he told the BBC, ridiculing the fentanyl rationale and saying Canada would \"stand up to a bully\".",
      "This is significant whether or not Carney succeeds Justin Trudeau and ends up chairing the G7, which is the group of the world's seven largest so-called \"advanced\" economies.",
      "As a former governor of the Bank of England, Carney witnessed Trump on the world stage at G20 and G7 meetings first hand and has clearly concluded that the US leader only respects strength.",
      "He had a coded warning for any nation seeking to stay quiet and not catch the eye of the president: \"Good luck.\"",
      "In recent conversations I have had with European trade negotiators, they have stressed cooperation and partnership, as well as deals with the US. When asked, they avoided directly criticising even the extraordinary suggestion of using tariffs against Nato ally Denmark over the fate of Greenland.",
      "The real question here is whether the rest of the world, even tacitly, coordinates retaliatory tariffs on, for example, high profile political supporters of President Trump, such as Elon Musk, which is a typical feature of previous smaller disputes.",
      "Tesla, the electric vehicle maker led by Musk, last week warned on the impact of tit-for-tat tariffs.",
      "All of this would be aimed at making the rival courts around the Oval Office, and interests in Congress, assert their concerns about the impact on US factories' global exports.",
      "This is all before the impact on US domestic prices.",
      "This could also come, more circuitously, through the application of a planned carbon trade tax in various jurisdictions.",

      "Billionaire businessman Jared Isaacman has a big vision for the future of humanity.",
      "He set off on his first mission to space in 2021 \u2013 a private journey he paid an estimated $200m (\u00a3160m) for \u2013 and announced that he wanted space travel to be for the masses, not only for the 600 who have experienced it to date \u2013 most of them professional astronauts employed by Nasa and the wealthy.",
      "\"We want it to be 600,000,\" he told reporters.",
      "Later, he added: \"I drank the Kool-Aid in terms of the grand ambitions for humankind being a multi-planet species\u2026 I think that we all want to live in a Star Wars, Star Trek world where people are jumping in their spacecraft.\"",
      "Mr Isaacman, who made much of his $1.9bn (\u00a31.46bn) fortune from a payment processing company that he founded in 1999 aged 16, is said to have bankrolled the rest of the crew of four aboard the SpaceX craft in the 2021 mission, fuelled by a longstanding love of flying and fascination with space.",
      "Since then, there have been more adventures: last year he demonstrated Captain Kirk-like daring by travelling in an upgraded SpaceX capsule and performing the first commercial spacewalk.",
      "During the mission, he tested an experimental spacesuit and a new cost-saving protocol to exit and re-enter the spacecraft without using an airlock.",
      "The photograph of Mr Isaacman, silhouetted with the world at his feet, is now iconic \u2013 it demonstrated that this was not a playboy billionaire paying to act out Star Trek, but someone pushing the envelope of what was possible with current technology.",
      "And yet it is a more recent achievement that has drawn greater attention still \u2013 being nominated by Donald Trump in December to be the new head of Nasa.",
      "The question is why Trump chose him and what has he asked him to do \u2013 especially in the context that the President has appointed SpaceX owner Elon Musk to a government role to cut $2 trillion (\u00a31.6 trillion) off the Federal budget.",
      "The Nasa post is a presidential appointment, though it requires the confirmation of the US Senate. And if confirmed, Mr Isaacman's appointment will also raise broader questions about the future of humanity in space, given his vision for space travel for the masses. It also has significant implications for the future of the space agency, if Mr Isaacman's role leads to Nasa using the private sector even more than it does now.",
      "Brink of a second space age?",
      "In the past, the heads of Nasa have come from a variety of backgrounds: some, such as the previous incumbent Bill Nelson, have been former astronauts; others, such as Michael Griffin (in charge from 2005 to 2009) came from a government background, and before him Dan Goldin was an entrepreneur, striving to lower costs.",
      "Despite their disparate backgrounds, those who have led Nasa have all been company people, charged with defending the space agency and its values.",
      "And yet Mr Isaacman, along with Mr Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, is among a new wave of billionaires who have been challenging the old order in space.",
      "They have accelerated the pace of innovation and are aiming to dramatically reduce the cost of human space travel.",
      "On the day of his nomination in December, Mr Isaacman posted a statement on X that gave an early glimpse into his vision. \"This second space age has only just begun,\" he wrote.",
      "\"There will inevitably be a thriving space economy \u2013 one that will create opportunities for countless people to live and work in space\u2026 At Nasa, we will\u2026 usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilisation.\"",
      "Many presidents have talked about sending astronauts to the Moon since the end of the Apollo lunar landings of the 1960s and 70s, but Trump was the first to turn talk into action, authorising Nasa's Artemis programme to send humans back to the Moon during his first term. His record suggests that he is a big Nasa fan.",
      "But since then, two factors are likely to have changed his thinking: Nasa's rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), has been delayed and costs have spiralled; at the same time Mr Musk's SpaceX and Bezos's Blue Origin are developing reusable low-cost Moon rockets.",
      "That is a worrying backdrop for Nasa, according to Courtney Stadd of New York-based Beyond Earth Institute think tank.",
      "\"You have a government looking to slash,\" he said at a webinar hosted by Space News. \"If you are the new administrator, you are going in in that context, so you are going to have to look at everything that is a drain on your budget\u2026",
      "\"This next two years is going to be the equivalent of a tsunami and everything is on the table.\"",
      "Future of Nasa's moon rocket",
      "One of the biggest questions is what to do with the space agency's SLS Moon rocket. In 2021, Nasa's Office of Inspector General (OIG), which provides oversight of the space agency for Congress, reported that the cost was $4.1bn (\u00a33.3bn) for each and every launch.",
      "By contrast, SpaceX's equivalent rocket system, Starship, is estimated to cost around $100m (\u00a380m) per launch \u2013 and Musk has said he aims to bring the costs down further to $10m (\u00a38m) as he develops his system.",
      "Bezos's new Moon rocket, New Glenn, had its maiden test launch at the beginning of January. Blue Origin has not announced its cost per launch, but it is estimated currently to be around $68m (\u00a354.5m).",
      "Competition between the two billionaires is likely to speed up innovation and reduce costs further.",
      "Starship and New Glenn are projected to be cheaper because, unlike SLS, they are designed to be reusable. But \"that's only a part of the reason for the disparity in costs\", according to Dr Adam Baker, an expert on the space industry at Cranfield University.",
      "\"SpaceX is given a sum of money and contracted to deliver on time and on budget,\" he continues. \"They are driven by profit, and they want to minimise costs.",
      "\"A Nasa programme is not driven by profit; it is driven by the programme objectives and so those in charge don't think they need to track costs in the same way.",
      "\"There is a general acceptance that SLS has no future.\"",
      "Questions around spiralling costs",
      "The OIG could only come up with a best guess for the full cost of the Artemis programme in its review for Congress because, as it put it: \"Nasa lacks a comprehensive and accurate cost estimate that accounts for all programme costs.",
      "\"Instead, the Agency's plan presents a rough estimate that excludes $25bn (\u00a320bn) for key activities\".",
      "Nasa's project management of SLS is not an aberration \u2013 some would say it is typical. For example, the James Webb Space Telescope was given a $1bn (\u00a3800m) budget and a launch date of 2010 \u2013 but it cost ten times that amount and launched in 2021, earning it the nickname of \"the telescope that ate astronomy\".",
      "(Other important scientific programmes had to be scaled back, delayed or scrapped entirely to make way for the overruns.)",
      "It was a similar story of delays and budget overruns during the development of the Space Shuttle in the 1970s and the construction of the International Space Station in the 2000s.",
      "Nasa got away with it because it was responsible for arguably America's greatest moment when it sent the first astronauts to the Moon. The Apollo programme laid the foundations for America's technology businesses and ushered in a vibrant new era for the US.",
      "But the world has changed significantly since then, and Nasa has simply not kept up, according to Emeritus Prof John Logsdon, former director of the Space policy Institute at George Washington University. \"Changing the way the United States goes about its civilian space programme is long overdue.\"",
      "New light on the 'old way of doing things'",
      "The current model is to give so-called \"cost-plus\" contracts to big heritage aerospace companies, such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, which guarantee to pay the development costs and an agreed profit.",
      "The model gave the firms the financial reassurance they needed for ambitious projects such as the space shuttle, the SLS, and developing parts of the Saturn V rocket that took Apollo astronauts to the Moon, but these contracts provided no incentives to cut costs or increase efficiency. For example, there were no penalties for delays or cost overruns.",
      "Dr Simeon Barber at the Open University, who has worked with Nasa on robotic space missions, was originally sceptical that the new commercial companies would deliver. But he is now a convert to the new way of doing things.",
      "\"We were used to big projects falling behind schedule and going over budget. But the new companies have shone a light on the old way of doing things.\"",
      "Moves to change what some saw as an overly cosy relationship with the heritage space companies gained pace in 2009 when President Obama introduced fixed-price contracts to some private sector firms. The companies were given latitude to innovate to cut costs and increase their profits provided they delivered on schedule and on budget.",
      "Among those firms was the dynamic new start-up, SpaceX, which was awarded a contract to develop its reusable Falcon rockets and Dragon Space capsule to resupply the International Space Station with crew and cargo.",
      "The heritage space company Boeing was also given a similar contract in 2014 to develop its Starliner capsule to do the same job.",
      "SpaceX, with its riskier but faster development processes, began delivering to the ISS within four years of receiving its contract. By contrast, Boeing's Starliner, which had a series of delays due to technical problems and cost overruns, took 10 years \u2013 only to have more issues with some of its engines, which left astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams stranded on the space station.",
      "The ultimate humiliation is that they will be brought back to Earth by rival SpaceX's Dragon capsule.",
      "\"Starliner is an embarrassment for the traditional way of doing business,\" says Prof Logsdon. \"So, shaking up the system is very positive.\"",
      "On the brink of a big shakeup?",
      "Prof Logsdon expects big changes under Trump, Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman: scrapping programmes, closing Nasa centres and more contracting out to SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private sector firms. Mr Isaacman has called the SLS \"outrageously expensive\" and said that the major aerospace contractors are \"incentivised to be economically inefficient\".",
      "But changes like that are not going to be easy. Nasa's budget is controlled by Congress. Although President Trump's party controls both legislative houses, individual senators and congressmen on the committees that oversee Nasa are from states with jobs and industries dependent on Nasa's $25bn (\u00a320bn) annual budget.",
      "\"Party discipline takes second place where there is constituency money involved,\" says Prof Logsdon, a seasoned watcher of the horse trading that goes on with space politics in Congress.",
      "Although Nasa's projects have been expensive, they have shown us the wonders of the universe and shifted humanity's perception of ourselves and our place in the cosmos.",
      "The creation of the first reusable space shuttle, the construction of an orbiting space station, the images of distant worlds captured by its robotic spacecraft and the awe-inspiring photos from Hubble have all inspired generations and supercharged interest in science. As a result, senators and congressmen know that America and the world owe Nasa an unpayable debt.",
      "\"The old way of doing things gave us a lot of success, so you don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. There will be significant change, but not the radical change that Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman want to see,\" argues Prof Logsdon.",
      "\"There is a delicate balance between the interests of Nasa, Congress and the White House.\"",
      "Where that balance will fall will emerge in the coming months: some are speculating that the return-to-the-Moon programme might be scrapped altogether in favour of going straight to Mars, as President Trump alluded to during his inauguration, with the greatest proponent of that policy \u2013 Musk \u2013 seated nearby.",
      "Others fear cuts in Nasa's Earth Observation programmes, which monitor and model environmental changes from space, and include the impact of climate change; and some worry that the robotic scientific missions to other planets might be cut back to boost efforts for the human spaceflight programme.",
      "Where SpaceX fits in",
      "There is concern in some quarters about the close relationship between Mr Isaacman and Mr Musk. Mr Isaacman paid SpaceX for his two ventures into space. The company has already received $20bn (\u00a316bn) in contracts from government since 2008.",
      "But if SLS is scrapped, and SpaceX were to receive the lion's share of Nasa's Moon programme work, Mr Musk's firm stands to receive contracts that might be ten or even a hundred times greater, possibly at the expense of other private-sector players.",
      "And there are many innovative US start-up companies hoping to build parts for spacecraft and infrastructure in Nasa's return-to-the-Moon programme, including Texas-based Firefly, which has a spacecraft on its way to land on the Moon in March.",
      "But industry analysts say that the US government has a long tradition of breaking up monopolies so that they don't stifle innovation. And in any case, just because Mr Isaacman has worked with Mr Musk, it does not mean that any outcome is inevitable, argues Prof Logsdon.",
      "\"Isaacman is his own man,\" he adds. \"He is not a disciple of Elon Musk.\"",
      "Fatbergs turned into perfume - inside Britain's bizarre new industrial revolution",
      "Friends reunited? Trump faces a very different Kim Jong Un this time",
      "Future of space travel: Could robots really replace human astronauts?",
      "Ultimately, however, it has become painfully clear, even to Nasa's most ardent supporters, that it needs saving from itself. And the need for Nasa reform is not a partisan issue \u2013 Democrat and Republican presidents alike have set the wheels in motion.",
      "But the coincidental timing of the success of SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private-sector space firms with a new administration impatient to cut costs and energise the private sector means that Mr Isaacman has a unique opportunity to make some of the biggest changes to Nasa since its inception.",
      "\"Nasa truly is a crown jewel, and we aren't doing what we should be doing on behalf of the American people,\" argued former deputy head of Nasa Lori Garver during the Space News webinar. \"That is frustrating for all of us.\"",
      "Asked if a private sector billionaire was the right person to be entrusted with one of America's greatest national treasures, Ms Garver responded: \"Jared is a patriot, and he is doing this for public service.",
      "\"The truth of Jared agreeing has something to do with him willing to take on these hard things \u2013 and there are so many hard things\".",

    "story": [
      "There is a good chance that inside your mobile phone is a miniscule amount of a metal that started its journey buried in the earth of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, where a war is currently raging.",
      "It may even be directly connected to the M23 rebel group that made global headlines this week.",
      "The tantalum within your device weighs less than half of the average garden pea but is essential for the efficient functioning of a smartphone, and almost all other sophisticated electronic devices.",
      "The unique properties of this rare, blue-grey, lustrous metal \u2013 including being able to hold a high charge compared to its size, while operating in a range of temperatures - make it an ideal material for tiny capacitors, which temporarily store energy.",
      "It is also mined in Rwanda, Brazil and Nigeria but at least 40% - and maybe more \u2013 of the element's global supply comes from DR Congo and some of the key mining areas are now under the control of the M23.",
      "The current wave of fighting has been going on for months, but the rebels grabbed attention with Sunday's assault on the vital trading and transport hub of Goma. The city, bordering Rwanda, is a regional centre for the mining business",
      "What's the fighting in DR Congo all about?",
      "What's the fighting in DR Congo all about?",
      "Over the past year, the M23 has made rapid advances across the mineral-rich east of DR Congo, taking areas where coltan \u2013 the ore from which tantalum is extracted \u2013 is mined.",
      "Like scores of other armed groups operating in the area, the M23 began as an outfit defending the rights of an ethnic group perceived to be under threat. But as its territory has expanded, mining has become a crucial source of income, paying for fighters and weapons.",
      "Last April, it seized Rubaya, the town at the heart of the country's coltan industry.",
      "Mineral extraction in this region is not in the hands of multinational conglomerates - instead thousands of individuals toil in open pits that honeycomb the landscape, or underground, in extremely unsafe and unhealthy conditions.",
      "They are part of a complex, and yet informal, network that sees the rocks removed from the ground using shovels, brought to the surface, crushed, washed, taxed, sold and then exported to be further purified and eventually smelted.",
      "Once the M23 moved into Rubaya, the rebels established what a UN group of experts described as a \"state-like administration\", issuing permits to the diggers and traders and demanding an annual fee of $25 (\u00a320) and $250 respectively. The M23 doubled the diggers' wages to ensure they would carry on working.",
      "It runs the area as a monopoly making sure \u2013 through the threat of arrest and detention \u2013 that only its authorised traders are able to do business.",
      "The M23 also charges a levy of $7 on each kilogramme of coltan. The UN group of experts estimated that as a result the M23 earns about $800,000 a month from coltan taxation in Rubaya. That money is almost certainly then used to fund the rebellion.",
      "There is a question mark hanging over how the ore extracted from M23-controlled areas gets into the global supply chain.",
      "Neighbouring Rwanda, which is seen as backing the M23, is at the centre of the answer, the UN experts say.",
      "Theoretically, a certification scheme - known as the Innovative Tin Supply Chain Initiative (Itsci) - should mean that what goes into a phone handset and other electronics does not come from areas of conflict where it could be used to fund armed groups responsible for carrying out atrocities.",
      "The US' Dodd-Frank Act passed in 2010, and a similar piece of EU legislation, is aimed at ensuring that companies purchasing tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold \u2013 so-called \"conflict minerals\" \u2013 are not inadvertently funding violence.",
      "But Itsci has come under some criticism.",
      "Ken Matthysen, a security and resource management expert with independent research group Ipis, highlights that the dispersed nature of a lot of small-scale mines make it difficult for the local authorities to monitor exactly what is going on everywhere.",
      "Itsci tags should be put on bags at the mine itself, to prove the origin of the minerals inside, but often they get transported to a collection point where it becomes harder to trace where the ore actually came from, Mr Matthysen said.",
      "He added that there is also a possible issue with corruption.",
      "\"There is even an accusation of the state agents selling tags to traders, because they don't make a good living. So the traders then go around eastern DR Congo and they tag the bags themselves.\"",
      "Itsci did not respond to a BBC request for comment, but has in the past defended its record saying that the scheme has been subjected to a rigorous independent audit. It has also been praised for bringing \"prosperity for hundreds of thousands of small-scale miners\".",

      "The evidence that shows Rwanda is backing rebels in DR Congo",
      "In the case of Rubaya, Itsci suspended its operations there soon after the M23 entered the town.",
      "Nevertheless, the group has managed to continue exporting coltan.",
      "The UN experts map a circuitous route showing how it is transported to close to the Rwandan border. It is then transferred to \"heavy-duty trucks\" that needed the road to be widened in order to accommodate them.",
      "Rwanda has its own coltan mines but the experts say that the uncertified coltan is  mixed with Rwandan production leading to a \"significant contamination of supply chains\".",
      "The M23 was already involved in the coltan business before the capture of Rubaya -  setting up roadblocks and charging fees to cross them, according to Mr Matthysen.",
      "\"A lot of the trade of these minerals went through M23-controlled area towards Rwanda. So even then, Rwanda was profiting from the instability in eastern DR Congo and we saw the export volumes to Rwanda were already increasing,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Figures from the US Geological Survey show that Rwanda's coltan exports rose by 50% between 2022 and 2023. Mr Matthysen said this could not have all come from Rwanda.",
      "In a robust defence of Rwanda's position, government spokesperson Yolande Makolo reiterated to the BBC that there were minerals and refining capacity in her own country.",
      "\"It's very cynical to take an issue like what's happening in eastern DRC, where a persecuted community is fighting for its rights... and turning [it] into an issue of material benefit,\" she added.",
      "Rwandan President Paul Kagame has also dismissed the UN experts' reports, pouring scorn on their \"expertise\".",
      "Much of the east of DR Congo has been blighted by conflict for many years, raising questions about who has been benefitting and whether armed groups are profiting from what is dug out of the ground there.",
      "In order to highlight the issue and its connection to the smartphone industry, the Congolese government filed criminal complaints in France and Belgium at the end of last year against subsidiaries of the tech giant Apple, accusing it of using \"conflict minerals\".",
      "Apple has disputed the allegation and pointed out that since early 2024, because of the escalating conflict and the difficulties of certification, it stopped sourcing tantalum, among other metals, from both DR Congo and Rwanda.",
      "Other companies have not been so clear, which means that as the M23 seizes more territory those small bits of tantalum from the mines that they control could still make their way into the devices that we have come to rely on.",

      "Some of the children who were adopted within the church have told us they were then subjected to abuse and neglect in their adoptive families.",
      "The claims follow a BBC investigation last year into allegations of child sexual abuse spanning decades within the church, which is believed to have up to 100,000 members worldwide and is often referred to as The Truth or the Two by Twos. The FBI has since launched an investigation.",
      "Warning: this story contains details some may find distressing.",
      "Four women - who were all unmarried at the time - have told us they were given no option but to give up their babies. Three of them feared being cast out of the church and sent to hell if they refused.",

      "\"My fear of going to hell was so great that it forced me to make up my mind to give up the baby to this couple in the church,\" she told the BBC.",
      "Another says she wasn't allowed to see her baby daughter before the child was taken away forever.",
      "The BBC has also spoken to six people given up for adoption as babies between the 1960s and 1980s. One woman says she was physically and emotionally abused in her first adoptive family in the church, and sexually abused in the second.",
      "The adopted children - born all over the US - are referred to within the church as \"Baldwin Babies\" because the adoptions were overseen by Wally Baldwin, a doctor from the sect who died in 2004.",
      "Some of the women would stay at his home in Oregon during pregnancy, according to a minister who used to work with Dr Baldwin.",
      "The exact number of Baldwin Babies is unclear. The BBC has spoken to the late doctor's adopted son, Gary Baldwin, who said the original records were no longer available but he believed the number to be \"less than 200\".",
      "He said that \"inevitably\" mistakes were made by his father's vetting system but that his intentions were good. Others we spoke to also said they remembered Dr Baldwin fondly.",
      "Because The Truth has no official leader, the BBC instead contacted six of its most senior current officials - known as \"overseers\" - for comment. We received one response. The overseer told us any adoptions he was aware of had been done \"through legal channels\" and he had \"heard some beautiful stories\".",
      "One woman who was adopted recalled seeing hundreds of photos in an album Dr Baldwin would keep of the children whose adoptions he had organised in The Truth.",

      "At 18, Melanie became pregnant after falling \"madly in love\" with a boy from her school.",

      "Deb Adadjo, 54, was also unsure about giving up her baby, but felt too much pressure at the time to refuse the workers, who threatened to ban her from church meetings - which in The Truth meant you not only got thrown out of the church, but also ended up in hell.",

      "She was the archetypal Sixties rock chick; a pop star at 17; Mick Jagger's muse at 19; and by 24, a junkie on the streets. But Marianne Faithfull (Dec. 29, 1946-Jan. 30, 2025), who burst out of the '60s British Invasion with the hit \"As Tears Go By,\" launched a second act in the late 1970s. Her lithe voice, later weathered from surviving sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll, was brought forth in such albums as \"Broken English,\" \"Dangerous Acquaintances,\" and \"Easy Come, Easy Go.\"",
      "The daughter of an eccentric British professor and an Austrian baroness, Faithfull was just out of convent school, and was performing as a folk singer, when she was discovered at a party by the manager of the Rolling Stones. Jagger and Keith Richards wrote her breakthrough hit, \"As Tears Go By.\"",
      "Just as her career exploded, at 18, she married a London art dealer and had a baby. \"I was very overenthusiastically eager for life,\" she told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2009. \"I wanted to just bite into it and swallow it whole.\"",
      "She then left her marriage for Jagger. They became one of Swinging London's most photographed couples. Then, in February 1967, British police barged into a Rolling Stones party at Richards' home. The police found drugs, and Marianne naked in a fur rug. Though charges were later dropped, Faithfull's image was disgraced. She felt she'd let her parents down: \"I think that's the worst feeling in the world,\" she told Anthony Mason.",

She said, \"It's certainly not what I was dreaming of when I was eight or ten \u2013 I'm going to grow up and become a junkie and live on the street!\" she said. She would lose custody of her son, Nicholas, and the damage began to show in her singing voice. But in 1979, she pulled herself together to release a raw and daring comeback album, \"Broken English.\" \"I became myself,\" she said, \"and it was not a person people thought I was. It was more intelligent, stronger, ravaged in its own way, but very quite interesting.\"",
      "It would be several more years before she freed herself of addiction, and in 2008 recorded \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" with Sean Lennon, Rufus Wainwright, Nick Cave, Cat Power, and Keith Richards. She also returned to acting, in \"Paris, Je T'aime,\" \"Marie Antoinette,\" and \"Faces in the Crowd.\"",
      "Faithfull said she appreciated the long, hard road she'd traveled: \"I think I've been very unconscious for a long time, and only now have I begun to get it. As long as I got it before I croaked, I think that's the main thing.\""

    "summary": "The actor-writer-director's latest film, a poignant comic-drama costarring Kieran Culkin, earned him an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay. But Jesse Eisenberg finds it difficult to not feel miserable.",
    "story": [
      "We'll tell you up front: Actor-director Jesse Eisenberg, who says he can appreciate a good Jewish deli, is a different kind of movie star. We joined him last week at the legendary Canter's Deli in Los Angeles, and shared some chocolate babka, with a dill pickle chaser. \"This is the real test,\" Eisenberg said.",
      "It was a little unusual, but for Eisenberg, it'd already been a pretty unusual day. Just a few hours earlier, he received his second Oscar nomination, this time for best original screenplay.",
      "And he was mortified.",
      "I asked, \"Are you able to enjoy moments like this?\"",
      "\"No, I'm not really wired to enjoy praise,\" he replied. \"I don't know why. I think it just, like, I don't know, triggers some guilt response in my brain and I try to find something to be miserable about. But I'll tell you what I do love: I love actually doing my job. Like, I feel so lucky that I found something I like to do.\"",
      "At the moment, his job is to promote the film he wrote, directed and starred in, \"A Real Pain,\" co-starring Kieran Culkin. The film is about two cousins who travel to Poland to see their ancestral home, and visit the actual home of their late grandmother, who barely survived the Holocaust.",
      "The film started out as a buddy movie about a trip to Mongolia. As he was writing the script, Eisenberg got stuck, until inspiration literally popped up on his computer. \"I was, like, 30 pages into the script and something was missing,\" he said. \"I knew the script was not going well. And so, I'm, like, kind of, like, banging my head against the keyboard. And an ad pops up online for 'Auschwitz tours.' And then in parentheses, 'with lunch.' And I was like, 'Auschwitz tours (with lunch)?' That's, like, the strangest pairing of four words I've ever seen. And once I saw that, and once I read that brochure, I was like, 'Oh, that's the movie. That is so interesting,' because I was trying to deal with these two characters who are both kind of, like, in pain in their own ways.\"",
      "\"Dude, we are Jews on a train in Poland, ******* think about it. \u2026 Does no one else see the irony here? Like, eating fancy food and sitting up here, when 80 years ago we would've been herded into the backs of these ******* things like cattle?\"",
      "Watch a scene with Jesse Eisenberg and Kieran Culkin in \"A Real Pain\" [Warning: Graphic language]",
      "Eisenberg has had those same thoughts. He is himself of Polish lineage, and he has relatives who were victims of the Holocaust. \"I come from a family who survived the war; a lot of, you know, cousins, aunts, and uncles who didn't,\" he said. \"And yet, I walk around New York City, like, kind of miserable. Like, I'm not, like, a happy person. I'm not asking for pity or anything; I'm just recognizing objectively, like, I'm not a happy person. And yet, I come from people who survived through miracles. Intellectually, I think I should be waking up every morning kissing the dirt that I'm here by virtue of a thousand miracles. And instead, I walk around, I'm like, Oh my God. What am I gonna do today? Oh my God. I shouldn't drink a coffee 'cause then I'll peak at noon.",
      "\"And so, I'm constantly trying to reconcile my fortunate life with how I feel about things, and my forebears' very unfortunate lives and how they appreciated things. And that's what this movie is kind of focusing on.\"",
      "It seems he's been feeling that same kind of anxiety all of his life. Raised in New Jersey, Jesse Eisenberg was, by his own admission, a \"sad kid\" who was uncomfortable at school, and took refuge in acting. By 2010 he'd made a name for himself in Hollywood, with roles like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in \"The Social Network.\" The part earned him an Oscar nod, and the juice to branch out into writing and directing.",
      "But when COVID shut down the film industry in 2020, Eisenberg and his wife, Anna Strout, moved back to her native Indiana, and spent their days volunteering at her mom's domestic violence shelter in Bloomington. \"I was just volunteering every day at the shelter,\" he said. \"It sounds weird to say this, and I don't mean this for any kind of \u2013 it was, like, the happiest time of my life. I was painting walls and fixing garbage disposals. And I just loved it so much. I loved being able to, like, accomplish something where there was no, like, critique of it, you know what I mean?\"",
      "\"It makes total sense,\" I said. \"You fix the garbage disposal, the garbage disposal's fixed. End of it.\"",
      "\"Exactly.\"",
      "But of all the roles he's played, on-screen and off-, he says the confident illusionist in the \"Now You See Me\" franchise is the most challenging, because it's absolutely nothing like him. \"We just did the third 'Now You See Me,' and it's such a blast,\" he said. \"And it's such a challenge, because I'm doing something that's, like, the exact opposite of my psychology. It's the only time I ever walk away thinking, 'I did a good job today.' But that's because my character thinks that they're doing well. And yes, they're Hollywood movies, and they're really fun. But, like, for me, it's been a kind of like a therapy.\"",
      "\"Does that confidence linger at all past the shoots?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, normally it will linger through dinner,\" he replied. \"Once I get on set and I'm in those clothes, and I'm speaking in the way they've written for me \u2026 I stand up straighter. I'm, like, an inch taller. It's amazing. I can make eye contact with my father!\"",
      "You'd think the success of \"A Real Pain\" would give Eisenberg some swagger. His movie also snagged Culkin an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. But like the babka and pickles at Canter's, Eisenberg can't seem to enjoy the sweet without just a little bit of sour.",
      "I asked, \"Is there a part of you that finds this whole experience, with the way that 'A Real Pain' has been received, kind of unreal? That at some moment you're gonna wake up?\"",
      "\"Oh, yeah, I assume a piano is gonna fall on my head every day,\" Eisenberg said. \"Because I feel like, I am so lucky. And, like, the way my mind does equations is that this lucky thing must mean this horrible upcoming thing. And so, yes, I'm not walking under any air conditioners in New York City. I don't know how to think about it any other way. And that's really unfortunate, but true!\"",

      "De Passe is a giant in the music and entertainment industry \u2026 a trailblazing executive who moved Motown from Hitsville to Hollywood. She did it with raw talent and relentless determination.",
      "\"I had so many wonderful things to do,\" she said, \"and they were all hard, and they were all new \u2013 learning; making mistakes; getting my butt kicked; crying (tears of frustration, not sadness) \u2013 and little by little, I got my legs up under me.\"",
      "Born in Harlem and nurtured in the historic Black community of Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard, de Passe says a supportive family gave her the tools to succeed.",
      "I asked, \"What were the lessons you learned from them?\"",
      "\"I think more than lessons, it was values,\" she replied.",
      "By 19, she left college to book performers at the Cheetah Club in Manhattan. Her friend, Cindy Birdsong, had just joined The Supremes, and introduced de Passe to her boss, Motown founder Berry Gordy, who hired de Passe as his creative assistant.",
      "\"When he decided that I should come to the company, I asked for a contract,\" she recalled. \"He said, 'I don't do contracts.' And I was there for 21 years without one, on a handshake.\"",
      "Part of her job was to find new talent, and that's what she did, when de Passe first heard about a group of brothers from Gary, Indiana. They called themselves The Jackson 5.",
      "\"The hair on the back of my neck stood up. They were great,\" she said.",
      "\"The hair literally stood up?\"",
      "\"Yeah, the hair. This is my big barometer, back there, absolutely. When you feel something, it's not intellectual, at all. I said, 'Oh, my gosh, Mr. Gordy, I saw this great act.' He said, 'Great.' I said, 'Wait till you see these kids.' He said, 'Kids? I don't want any kid acts. Are you crazy?'\"",
      "She wasn't. And Motown introduced The Jackson 5 to the world.",
      "de Passe took them to the dentist, worked on their early dance moves, and even picked out their wardrobe. She found Michael Jackson's hat on 8th Street in Greenwich Village. \"It was iconic, but nobody knew it at the time,\" she said.",
      "In the 1970s, she was discovering and developing artists for Motown in L.A., signing The Commodores, De Barge, and Rick James. \"I feel like I'm lucky to be alive,\" she laughed. Why? \"Because Rick was bigger than life. He was a great consumer of drugs, and just a brilliant, brilliant artist.\"",
      "It is a notorious business, and difficult to navigate, especially back then, especially for her.",

      "\"I have had every 'ism' to deal with,\" said de Passe. \"Sexism, racism, pessimism, optimism, you know? And what I've found is that the moment you let yourself be defined by your 'isms' is when you've lost.\"",
      "de Passe always persevered. She was also a good persuader, convincing Diana Ross that the song \"I'm Coming Out\" would be a smash hit. Ross' first reaction, said de Passe, was, \"in very blatant terms, 'I hate these songs.' But I felt it would be [a hit]. Nobody knows. That's the thing about it. Nobody knows.\"",
      "\"But clearly you have really good sixth sense?\" I asked.",
      "\"I believe in what I believe in,\" de Passe replied. \"And some of it works and some of it doesn't. But I'm happy to say I have a good percentage.\"",
      "In 1982, de Passe was made president of Motown Productions. One of her first big projects was the TV special \"Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever.\" Nearly 50 million people watched Michael Jackson do the moonwalk. \"Oh, my God. and it was only six seconds,\" said de Passe. \"But the whole 'Billy Jean' of it all was just magic, I think, because nobody had ever seen anything like that before.\"",
      "de Passe also produced the landmark miniseries \"Lonesome Dove.\"",
      "I said, \"A lot of people would ask, 'What does Motown know about westerns?'\"",
      "\"Probably nothing; but I did,\" de Passe replied. \"I think the death of art is that you have to be gay to play gay. I think the death of art is that you have to be Black to direct or write a Black movie. The death of art is to not have the best person do what it is they are well-suited and passionate to do, regardless of all that other exterior stuff. And I am sick of it.\"",

    "summary": "The multimedia artist talks about his cinematic timepiece, a 24-hour film comprised of scenes from movies and TV that track the viewer's own experience of time, minute by minute, currently screening at New York's Museum of Modern Art.",
    "story": [
      "From time to time, you might notice a shot of a clock in a movie. In a film like \"Back to the Future,\" they're key to the plot; lightning strikes the clock tower at exactly 10:04 p.m. But often, clocks are just ticking away in the background, or not ticking at all, like the watch from \"Pulp Fiction,\" stopped at 11:46.",
      "Compile enough of these seemingly minute details, and minutes can turn into hours, spanning decades of moving-image history. That is the case with artist Christian Marclay's \"The Clock,\" a 24-hour film comprised entirely of clips from movies and television.",
      "\"It's not to create a trick or to make you forget about time,\" Marclay said. \"I want you to be totally conscious about it throughout.\"",
      "Currently on view at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, \"The Clock\" runs on a continuous loop, synced to the precise time of day. When the kids in \"The Breakfast Club\" are whistling at 11:31 a.m., it's 11:31 in real life. An hour later, \"Rain Man\" announces \"Oh, it's 12:31.\" Minute by minute, the footage functions as an actual clock.",
      "Stuart Comer, the chief curator of media and performance at MoMA, calls watching Maclay's mash-up an uncanny experience. \"[You're] watching some of your favorite movies and realizing that it's telling the time that you're living in right now,\" Comer said. \"It's eliminating that barrier between you and the world on-screen.",
      "\"The effort that it took with Christian and the team of researchers locating 'The Clock' footage and all of these different clips is somewhat superhuman,\" he said.",
      "When Marclay won best artist for \"The Clock\" at the 2011 Venice Biennale, it turned him into a contemporary art superstar. But the 70-year-old first made a name for himself decades earlier as part of New York's underground DJ scene. \"In those days, you would find records \u2026 people would put them in their trash,\" he said.",
      "Born to an American mother and Swiss father, Marclay was raised in Switzerland and moved to the U.S. to attend art school in the late 1970s. \"I kept putting aside my work as a visual artist, 'cause I lived in a tiny East Village apartment, and I didn't have a studio,\" he said. \"So, music at that time was convenient.\"",
      "It was, he admitted, easier to store records than canvases. \"But you need tolerant neighbors!\" he laughed.",
      "Marclay's music was experimental. He was an early pioneer of \"turntablism,\" invited to spin on the short-lived show \"Night Music.\" \"I would destroy the records in performance, but then I had all these incredible covers, such an interesting history of graphic design. And I started collaging with them.\"",
      "One of Marclay's early successes in the visual art world arrived via his Body Mix series, in which he physically stitched together album covers to create new forms.",
      "He's unspooled cassette tapes to make prints and pillows. He's cut up everything from Japanese manga to movie subtitles, stacking cinematic fragments nearly 20 feet tall. He said he felt more comfortable as a collagist: \"I'm more interested in working with what exists rather than [to], you know, invent or draw something,\" he said.",
      "In 1995, Marclay created \"Telephones,\" a masterful mashup of film phone conversations.",

      "Faithfull was born in Hampstead, London, in December 1946. She was a folk singer who, one day, met with the manager of the Rolling Stones at a party, which led to her recording \"As Tears Go By\" by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards in 1964. She was just 17 years old when she recorded the hit single.",

    "summary": "A New York doctor was indicted by a Louisiana grand jury for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in a state with one of the strictest abortion bans.",
    "story": [
      "BATON ROUGE, La.\u00a0\u2014 A New York doctor was indicted by a Louisiana grand jury on Friday for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in the Deep South state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the U.S.",
      "Grand jurors at the District Court for the Parish of West Baton Rouge issued an indictment against Dr. Margaret Carpenter; her company, Nightingale Medical, PC; and a third person. All three were charged with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony.",
      "Prosecutors in Louisiana say a mother ordered the pill online and gave it to her child.",
      "\"The young child was told by the mother that she had to take the pill or else, and the child took the pill,\" District Attorney Tony Clayton said.",
      "The case appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state, at least since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to have strict anti-abortion laws.",
      "\"To ship a pill from another state is equivalent to me of shipping fentanyl or any other type of drugs over here that end up in the mouths and stomachs of our minor kids,\" Clayton said.",
      "Carpenter was also sued by the Texas attorney general in December under similar allegations of sending pills to that state. That case did not involve criminal charges.",
      "CBS News New York reached out to Carpenter, but has not heard back yet.",
      "Testing New York's shield laws",
      "The indictment could be the first direct test of New York's shield laws, which are intended to protect prescribers who use telehealth to provide abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\"Earlier today, a New York doctor was indicted in Louisiana for using telemedicine to prescribe abortion medication to a patient. That's right: a doctor is being prosecuted for providing basic health care to her patient. We always knew that overturning Roe v. Wade wasn't the end of the road for anti-abortion politicians. That's why I worked with the Legislature to pass nation-leading laws to protect providers and patients. It's more critical than ever for states to step up and protect reproductive freedom \u2014 and I'll never back down from this fight,\" Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a prepared release.",
      "Hochul signed the bill protecting doctors from out-of-state lawsuits\u00a0in 2023.",
      "\"I will never under any circumstances turn this doctor over to the state of Louisiana under any extradition request,\" Hochul said in a video posted to social media. \"I will do everything I can to protect this doctor and allow her to continue the work that she's doing that is so essential.\"",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James, who would enforce the shield law, said in a statement:",
      "\"Abortion care is health care. The criminalization of abortion care is a direct and brazen attack on Americans' bodily autonomy and their right to reproductive freedom. This cowardly attempt out of Louisiana to weaponize the law against out-of-state providers is unjust and un-American. We will not allow bad actors to undermine our providers' ability to deliver critical care. Medication abortion is safe, effective, and necessary, and New York will ensure that it remains available to all Americans who need it.\"",
      "Legal experts say Carpenter may still face some hurdles.",
      "\"What happens when she tries to renew her medical license and she has a pending felony indictment in Louisiana? What happens to the doctor when she tries to fly somewhere and TSA says, hey, you have an active warrant?\" attorney Franz Borghardt said.",
      "Louisiana classifies abortion pills as \"controlled dangerous substances\"",
      "Pills have become the most common means of abortion in the U.S., accounting for nearly two-thirds of them by 2023. They're also at the center of political and legal action over abortion. In January, one judge let three states continue to challenge federal government approvals for how one of the drugs usually involved can be prescribed.",
      "The indictment comes just months after Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \"controlled dangerous substances.\" The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Under the legislation, if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years. The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "Since the fall of Roe v. Wade, Louisiana has had a near-total abortion ban, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.",
      "\"Make no mistake, since Roe v Wade was overturned, we've witnessed a disturbing pattern of interference with women's rights,\" the Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine, where Carpenter is one of the founders, said in a statement. \"It's no secret the United States has a history of violence and harassment against abortion providers, and this state-sponsored effort to prosecute a doctor providing safe and effective care should alarm everyone.\"",
      "Dr. Dara Kass, an emergency medicine physician in New York, said abortion bans are making it more dangerous for young girls and women.",
      "\"It's making it less safe to be pregnant, and it's increasing things like infant mortality and maternal mortality in states where abortions are restricted,\" she said.",

      "Some hospitals also said this week they are moving to suspend medications and procedures for youth seeking gender-affirming care, following an executive order signed on Tuesday by President Trump to curb procedures and prescriptions for gender transitions in minors.",

      "Washington \u2014 Federal officials on Thursday approved a new type of pain drug designed to eliminate the risks of addiction and overdose associated with opioid medications like Vicodin and OxyContin.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved Vertex Pharmaceuticals' pill, Journavx, for short-term pain that often follows surgery or injuries.",
      "It's the first new pharmaceutical approach to treating pain in more than 20 years, offering an alternative to both opioids and over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. But the medication's modest effectiveness and lengthy development process underscore the challenges of finding new ways to manage pain.",
      "Two studies in more than 870 patients with acute pain following foot and abdominal surgeries showed Vertex's drug provided more relief than a dummy pill but didn't outperform a common opioid-acetaminophen combination pill.",
      "\"It's not a slam dunk on effectiveness,\" said Michael Schuh of the Mayo Clinic, a pharmacist and pain medicine expert who wasn't involved in the research. \"But it is a slam dunk in that it's a very different pathway and mechanism of action, so I think that shows a lot of promise.\"",
      "Vertex began researching the drug in the 2000s, when drug overdoses were rocketing upward, principally driven by mass prescribing of opioid painkillers for common ailments like arthritis and back pain. Prescriptions have fallen sharply in the last decade and the current wave of the opioid epidemic is mainly due to illicit fentanyl, not pharmaceutical medicines.",
      "Opioids reduce pain by binding to receptors in the brain that receive nerve signals from different parts of the body. Those chemical interactions also give rise to opioids' addictive effects.",
      "Vertex's drug works differently, blocking proteins that trigger pain signals that are later sent to the brain.",
      "\"In trying to develop medicines that don't have the addictive risks of opioid medicines, a key factor is working to block pain signaling before it gets to the brain,\" Vertex's Dr. David Altshuler, told the Associated Press last year.",
      "Commonly reported side effects with the drug were nausea, constipation, itching, rash and headache.",
      "\"The new medication has side effect profiles that are inherently not only different, but don't involve the risk of substance abuse and other key side effects associated with opioids,\" said Dr. Charles Argoff of the Albany Medical Center, who consulted for Vertex on the drug's development.",
      "The initial concept to focus on pain-signaling proteins came out of research involving people with a rare hereditary condition that causes insensitivity to pain.",
      "Vertex has attracted interest from Wall Street for its ambitious drug pipeline that involves winning FDA approval for multiple drugs across several forms of chronic pain, which generally represents a bigger financial opportunity than acute pain.",
      "But the Boston drugmaker's share price plummeted in December when Vertex reported disappointing mid-stage results in a study of patients with chronic nerve pain affecting the lower back and legs. The drug didn't perform significantly better than placebo, the research found.",
      "\"We believe the data reflect a near worst-case scenario for this key pipeline program,\" biotechnology analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note to investors, adding that the results jeopardized estimates that Vertex's pipeline could be worth billions across multiple forms of pain.",
      "Still, Vertex executives said they plan to move forward with a new, late-stage study of the drug, theorizing that a different trial design could yield better results and pave the way for FDA approval in chronic pain.",

      "The average price of a dozen large, grade-A eggs was $4.15 in December 2024, up 14% from $3.65 in November, federal\u00a0data shows. That's a more than 60% increase from the $2.51 it cost a year ago and 160% more than the $1.41 consumers paid for the same carton in 2019, CBS News' price tracker\u00a0reveals.",
      "By comparison, the overall monthly rate of inflation for food in December was 2.5%, with the cost of food at home rising just 0.3%, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data.",
      "Like a souffl\u00e9, egg prices are rising to impressive heights right before our eyes. When will it end? Not anytime soon, according to the USDA, which\u00a0predicts\u00a0in a recent report that egg prices will shoot up another 20% this year.",
      "Behind rising egg prices and shortages is a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), known as H5N1, that killed 13.2 million commercial egg-laying hens in the month of December alone and continues to depopulate flocks into 2025, according to the USDA. Outbreaks of H5N1 were first detected in the U.S. in 2022 and are considered to be the main driver behind the years-long volatility in egg prices.",
      "H5N1, which has a high mortality rate among infected\u00a0poultry\u00a0and wild birds, is being watched closely by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a potential public health\u00a0threat. So far, the CDC has received one report of a person dying after being hospitalized with severe illness from the virus. Among cattle, the average mortality and culling rate is 2% or less, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. However, officials warn that H5N1 is lethal to cats",
      "For now, the virus remains mostly a thorn in the side of U.S. consumers\u00a0fed up with inflation.",
      "\"For about a year and a half now, the sort of frequency and severity of avian flu outbreaks in the poultry and egg supply chains in the U.S. have sort of just been on the rise in a big way,\" Ricky Volpe, a professor of agribusiness at Cal Poly State University, San Luis Obispo, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone is just sort of hoping that, 'OK, this will be the last one, then we'll get back to normal.' But we keep on not getting back to normal.\"",
      "More than 79.3 million U.S. chickens died in 2022 and 2023 as result of H5N1 infections and related culling, according to a January\u00a0report\u00a0from TD Cowen. In total, H5N1 is estimated to have led to the loss of nearly 139 million birds across the country, including Puerto Rico, according to the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.",
      "Devastating for farmers",
      "The bird flu outbreaks disrupting the nation's egg supplies are a dealing a serious blow to affected farmers. Anytime the virus is found, the entire flock must be slaughtered to help limit the virus' spread. Replenishing supplies is yet another challenge.",
      "\"It takes approximately 19-20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs in newly repopulated barns, and that is but one element of a lengthy recovery process,\" a spokesperson for the American Egg Board said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Bird flu is absolutely devastating to an egg farm. When an egg farm is impacted with HPAI, it must go through a comprehensive and lengthy process involving multiple steps and government approvals before it can begin to repopulate with new flocks and return to producing eggs. This process that can take nine months to more than a year,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "With massive egg farms routinely housing more than 1 million chickens, just a few infections can lead to a supply crunch.",
      "Other factors",
      "Another factor driving up egg prices: a persistent shortage of truck drivers in the U.S. \u2014 a mounting problem as more drivers retire. And with fewer drivers to transport eggs to retailers, wholesalers are forced to raise shipping costs.",
      "\"Refrigerated truck transportation is a major pain point in the food supply chain right now. There's a shortage of drivers, long-haul truck rates are up and eggs are of course very transportation-intensive,\" Volpe said. \"Even before we were dealing with avian flu, the trucks just weren't there to deliver eggs in a timely fashion.\"",
      "For consumers in Colorado, a state law requiring all eggs to be cage-free by January 2025, has added to the soaring price of eggs.",
      "As a partial solution to the nationwide problem, Volpe suggests that retailers source eggs locally wherever possible.",
      "\"[Local suppliers] are pretty well insulated from these systemic issues of avian flu or whatever, so supply is healthy. So it makes sense to augment supply whenever possible locally from local growers who are not facing these significant issues related to bird flu and transportation.\"",
      "Why are egg prices lower in some stores?",
      "Just as retailers use Thanksgiving Day turkey promotions to attract customers, some grocery stores around the country are offering lower egg prices to drive store traffic.",
      "\"You can go on social media and you'll see someone complaining about an $8 dozen of eggs and then someone else will chime in and go 'I just got it for $4.' Well, I absolutely guarantee you that was sold at a loss, and it was sort of a competitive effort to increase foot traffic,\" Volpe said. \"Maybe eggs are sold at a loss, but now you're going to buy your milk and your bread and vegetables, everything else, and those will have the normal profit margins.\"",
      "Translation: If you find a good deal on eggs at a store, you might still end up paying roughly the same cost for your entire basket of groceries as you would somewhere else.",
      "Response from White House",
      "\"There is a lot of reporting out there that is putting the onus on this White House for the increased cost of eggs,\" said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked at her first press briefing on Tuesday what President Trump is doing to address egg prices which have spiked since he took office earlier this month.",
      "\"As far as the egg shortage, what's also contributing to that is that the Biden admin and Department of Agriculture directed the mass killing of 100 million chickens,\" Leavitt, who made no mention of avian flu, said in her response.",
      "Leavitt went on to urge the Senate to move \"swiftly\" to confirm Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees \"including his nominee for the United States Department of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins ... who is leading the economic team here at the White House, on how we can address the egg shortage in this country.\"",
      "Correction:\u00a0This story has been revised because it mistakenly reported that it takes less than six weeks for commercial hens to produce eggs. This is incorrect. It takes 19 to 20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs, according to the American Egg Board. The trade group also notes that it can take more than a year for farms suffering a bird flu outbreak to secure the required government clearance to resume operations.",

      "President Trump on Saturday signed an executive order that imposes 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, while adding an additional 10% levy on goods from China. Canada responded hours later with retaliatory tariffs of its own, while Mexico said it was also planning to issue tariffs on the U.S. as well.",
      "China's commerce secretary said that China would challenge the tariffs through the World Trade Organization, according to Reuters, claiming that the move \"seriously violates\" WTO rules.",
      "However, Mr. Trump on Monday announced he would\u00a0pause the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for 30 days after both countries agreed to direct additional resources to their borders.",
      "The salvo, which Mr. Trump had threatened even before returning to power earlier this month, underlines his willingness to use trade policy even against some of the U.S.' largest economic allies. It also signals the president's first major turn away from his promise on the campaign trail to rapidly reduce everyday costs for Americans once in office.",
      "In a Truth Social post on Sunday morning, Mr. Trump acknowledged \"some pain\" could come with the new wave of tariffs but insisted his vision for the country \"will all be worth the price that must be paid.\"",
      "\"THIS WILL BE THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA! WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!),\" he wrote. \"BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID. WE ARE A COUNTRY THAT IS NOW BEING RUN WITH COMMON SENSE \u2014 AND THE RESULTS WILL BE SPECTACULAR!!!\"",
      "The tariffs\u00a0were slated to take effect at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. While the order imposes 25% tariffs on goods from Canada, \"energy resources\" such as oil and gas would only be hit with a 10% tariff.",
      "The order notes that should any of the three nations \"retaliate against the United States\" with \"import duties\" or \"similar measures,\" the president \"may increase or expand in scope the duties imposed under this order to ensure the efficacy of this action.\"",
      "According to the White House, the salvo is aimed at curbing the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S.; spurring a resurgence in domestic manufacturing; and raising federal revenue.",
      "In a\u00a0statement\u00a0posted to social media after the announcement, Mr. Trump said the order was issued through the\u00a0International Emergency Economic Powers Act\u00a0\"because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl.\"",
      "Trudeau announced in a news conference Saturday night that Canada would retaliate by placing 25% tariffs \"against $155 billion worth of American goods,\" with the first set of tariffs taking effect Tuesday.",
      "\"This will include immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods as of Tuesday, followed by further tariffs on $125 billion worth of American products in 21 days' time to allow Canadian companies and supply chains to seek to find alternatives,\" Trudeau said.",
      "And in a statement posted to social media, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she instructed her economic secretary to put together a response that included both retaliatory tariffs and other measures \"in defense of Mexico's interests.\"",
      "\"We categorically reject the defamatory claims made by the White House accusing the Government of Mexico of having alliances with criminal organizations, as well as any attempts to interfere in our territory,\" Sheinbaum wrote.",
      "John Murphy, senior vice president for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which bills itself as the world's largest business organization, slammed Mr. Trump's decision, writing in a statement that \"the imposition of tariffs under IEEPA is unprecedented, won't solve these problems, and will only raise prices for American families and upend supply chains.\"",
      "Murphy added that the Chamber \"will consult with our members, including main street businesses across the country impacted by this move, to determine next steps to prevent economic harm to Americans.\"",
      "Three trade associations for the distilled spirits industry \u2014 Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S., the Chamber of the Tequila Industry, and Spirits Canada \u2014 said in a joint statement that they were \"deeply concerned that U.S. tariffs on imported spirits from Canada and Mexico will significantly harm all three countries and lead to a cycle of retaliatory tariffs that negatively impacts our shared industry.\"",
      "Bob Hemesath, an Iowa farmer and board chairman of Farmers for Free Trade, an agriculture group that advocates for more open trade, said in a statement that Canada, Mexico and China are \"indispensable markets for the livelihood of the American ag economy,\" and \"placing tariffs on the three largest export markets for American farmers and ranchers, particularly for an extended period of time, would have severe consequences.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson praised the order, writing on social media that Mr. Trump is \"holding Mexico, Canada, and China accountable for their role in the flow of illegal aliens and illicit drugs across our borders. These countries are now on notice to work quickly to stop the madness. This is long overdue.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the move in a series of social media posts, one of which read: \"You're worried about grocery prices. Don's raising prices with his tariffs.\"",
      "Experts warn that the impact of the tariffs could affect the economies of Canada, Mexico and China \u2014 the nation's three biggest trading partners \u2014 as well as the U.S. itself. Canada's economy could shrink by 3.6%, while Mexico could take a 2% hit, according to Cornell University economics professor Wendong Zhang.",
      "At the same time, inflation in the U.S. could rise by as much as 1 percentage point, pushing it as high as 4% on an annual basis, or double the Federal Reserve's goal for a 2% annual rate, Capital Economics said in a Jan. 28 research note.",
      "\"We have stressed that steep tariff increases against U.S. trading partners could create a stagflationary shock \u2014 a negative economic hit combined with an inflationary impulse \u2014 while also triggering financial market volatility,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco in a Jan. 31 report.",
      "Daco added, \"These tariffs against Mexico, Canada and China would mark the first major wave of trade levies in Trump's new term, with effects rippling far beyond those economies, as other nations brace for potential targeting and U.S. businesses navigate supply chain disruptions and retaliation risks.\"",
      "American consumers have been bracing for the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, telling pollsters that they expected to see higher prices if the president followed through on his plans to enact them. Those expectations may have prompted some consumers to purchase goods before Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, economists say.",
      "\"The mere prospect of tariffs appears to be influencing the behavior of consumers and businesses,\" analysts with Oxford Economics in a research note. \"Imports surged in December, likely an attempt to front-run any tariffs, while consumers may be bringing forward spending in anticipation of tariff-related price hikes.\"",
      "U.S. consumers could see higher prices\u00a0for produce and agricultural products imported from Canada and Mexico, including beef from the former and avocados and strawberries from the latter. Automobiles could see an average price increase of $3,000 each due to the tariffs, given the huge volume of cars now being built in Canada and Mexico, according to TD Economics.",

      "President Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada starting Saturday, as well as an additional 10% tariff on imports from China. However, Mr. Trump on Monday said he was pausing the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for 30 days after both countries agreed to direct additional resources to their borders.",
      "While Mr. Trump describes tariffs as import duties that are paid by foreign countries, they are in fact paid directly to the federal government by U.S. businesses,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Tax Foundation, a tax-focused think tank. Rather than swallowing the costs, corporations typically hike their prices for those imported goods to recoup all or some of the expense.",
      "Who pays the cost?",
      "\"If there is a significant increase in tariffs ... those costs will likely be passed onto U.S. consumers and businesses,\" Brian Peck, executive director of University of Southern California's Center for Transnational Law and Business, told CBS Los Angeles.",
      "\"From Canada, we import oil, lumber, wood and cement,\" he added. \"Over 20% of the agriculture products we bring into the U.S. come from Mexico.\"",
      "One unknown is whether the Trump administration will carve out some exceptions, such as for oil and gas products. Canada provides about 20% of the oil used in the U.S., which means that a 25% tariff on Canadian imports could add 30 to 40 cents a gallon at the pump within days of the new duties taking effect, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has said.",
      "As painful as higher costs might be to U.S. consumers, the biggest impacts would likely be felt by the Canadian and Mexican economies, according to Wendong Zhang, assistant professor of applied economics and policy at Cornell University. A 25% tariff could cause Canada and Mexico to lose 3.6% and 2% of real GDP,\u00a0 respectively, versus a decline of 0.3% for the U.S., Zhang estimated.",
      "Here's what could get pricier for American shoppers if the Trump administration's tariffs take effect.",
      "Avocados, beef and other foods",
      "Inflation-pinched consumers may face a surge in prices for fruits, vegetables and nuts imported from Mexico, including avocados \u2014 just in time for the Super Bowl on Feb. 9.",
      "The U.S. imported more than $45 billion in agricultural products from Mexico in 2023, including fresh strawberries, raspberries, tomatoes and beef, according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The U.S. also imports Mexican beer, tequila and other drinks and spirits.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. imported about $40 billion of Canadian agricultural products that same year, including beef, pork, grains, potatoes and canola oil, the USDA notes.",
      "A 25% tariff could push prices up for all those products.",
      "\"Grocery stores operate on really tiny margins,\" said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute. \"They can't eat the tariffs ... especially when you talk about things like avocados that basically all of them \u2014 90% \u2014 come from Mexico. You're talking about guacamole tariffs right before the Super Bowl.\"",
      "Cars",
      "American consumers are increasingly buying cars that are either built in Canada or Mexico or that use parts imported from those nations. The U.S. imported $69 billion of cars and light trucks from Mexico in 2023, and another $37 billion from Canada, according to S&P Global Mobility.",
      "On top of that, about $78 billion in auto parts stemmed from Mexico and $20 billion from Canada. For instance, the engines used in Ford's F-series pickup trucks come from Canada.",
      "Because U.S. importers are expected to roll any added tariff costs into vehicle sticker prices, the average U.S. automobile price could jump by about $3,000, TD Economics estimates. That would come at a time when the average new car already sells for $50,000 and the average used car for $26,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.",
      "Lumber",
      "About one-third of softwood lumber used in the U.S. is imported from Canada each year, according to Rajan Parajuli, an associate professor of forest economics and policy at North Carolina State University.",
      "Tacking a 25% tariff on Canadian lumber could cause a \"supply shock,\" the Forest Resources Association, a trade group, wrote in a December blog post. \"Regarding lumber, the U.S. still needs Canadian supplies to meet its domestic consumption demand,\" the group said.",
      "Still, the slow U.S. housing market, dampened by mortgage rates that remain close to 7%, could make it hard for companies to pass on the new tariffs through higher lumber prices, some economists said.",
      "\"Lumber prices are expected to rise, although a slower U.S. housing recovery, burdened by higher prices, will limit the extent to which exporters will be able to pass on price increases,\" Oxford Economics noted in a Jan. 31 research note.",

      "Although tariffs are a bane to most economists, they are a widely used as a tool for regulating international trade and for shielding domestic industries from foreign competition. At the simplest level, tariffs are taxes placed on goods made overseas that are imported into the country. Notably, foreign companies aren't responsible for paying the duties. Instead, U.S. businesses directly pay the tariffs on their imported goods to the federal government, according to the Tax Foundation, a tax-focused think tank.",

At the same time, tariff proponents like Mr. Trump argue that such levies can help protect manufacturers here at home.

Canada responded hours later with retaliatory tariffs of its own, while Mexico said it was also planning to issue tariffs on the U.S. as well.",
      "However, Mr. Trump on Monday wrote on his Truth Social app that he is\u00a0pausing U.S. tariffs\u00a0targeting imports from Mexico for a month after the country's president agreed to send 10,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to combat the flow of fentanyl and migrants.",
      "Mr. Trump has also floated the possibility of additional tariffs, such as an across-the-board duty of 10% on all goods imported into the U.S. Here's what to know about tariffs.",
      "What exactly are tariffs?",
      "Tariffs are duties paid on goods imported into the U.S..",
      "The most common type are ad valorem tariffs (Latin for \"according to the value, which represent a fixed percentage tax on the value of the imports. These are the tariffs Mr. Trump imposed as a 25% import tax on goods shipped from Mexico or Canada, such as avocados or lumber.",
      "There are also \"specific\" tariffs, which are levied as a fixed charge per unit, such as if the U.S. were to propose a $1 tariff on each imported Mexican avocado.",
      "Another such type of levy are \"tariff-rate quotas,\" which are taxes triggered by reaching a specific import threshold. For instance, this type of quota was used by the first Trump administration in 2018 on\u00a0washing machines, when the first 1.2 million imported units faced a 20% duty, while units above that number were taxed at a 50% rate, according to the Coalition for a Prosperous America, which advocates for more restrictive trade policies.",
      "Who pays for tariffs?",
      "Companies that import the goods from abroad pay the tariffs to their own nation. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection collects tariffs from importers \u2014 say, Walmart or Target \u2014 and then deposits the money into the General Fund of the United States.",
      "Mr. Trump has\u00a0claimed\u00a0that foreign countries pay the duties. As part of his campaign, he vowed that tariffs would help raise \"trillions and trillions of dollars\" from foreign governments.",
      "In fact, American consumers would likely bear the brunt of the cost, as big U.S. importers are likely to pass on the tariffs they pay to the customs department to consumers, economists say. In some cases, foreign manufacturers may also choose to lower their prices to offset the impact of those tariffs in order to maintain their sales. And some U.S. businesses could absorb some of the tariff costs to avoid driving away consumers and potentially losing market share to competitors.",
      "If Mr. Trump enacts all the tariffs he's vowed to levy on imports, the typical U.S. consumer could face up to $2,400 in increased costs for every year the tariffs remain in force, according to an estimate from financial services firm ING.",
      "Could tariffs boost inflation?",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs would sharply push the current effective U.S. tariff rate from 2.4% to 31%. That would be a historic high and surpass those seen under President McKinley in the 1890s, when U.S. trade policies were far more protectionist, and during the 1930s under the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, according to Capital Economics.",
      "As a result, inflation would likely jump, rising from an annual rate of about 2.9% currently to as high as 4%, or about double the Federal Reserve's 2% target, Capital Economics noted. That would put inflation back to its mid-2023 levels, when the Fed was keeping interest rates near a two-decade as it tried bring inflation under control.",
      "\"[I]mposing any of these suggested tariffs would generate a rebound in consumer price inflation this year, taking it further above target and making it harder for the Fed to resume loosening monetary policy,\" Capital Economics said in a Jan. 28 report.",
      "Why does Trump support tariffs?",
      "President Trump cites tariffs as a way to accomplish several policy goals, including raising more money to fund the government and protecting domestic industries.",
      "Both he and his allies, including his new Treasury Secretary,\u00a0Scott Bessent,\u00a0contend that tariffs enacted during the first Trump administration didn't boost inflation. But those tariffs, which applied to only some Chinese imports, \"were too small to matter\" and so didn't have an inflationary impact, Capital Economics said in its research note.",
      "Mr. Trump has also cited the need to boost U.S. manufacturing, saying in an October interview at the Economic Club of Chicago, \"No. 1 is for protection of the companies that we have here, and the new companies that will move in because we're going to have thousands of companies coming into this country.\"",
      "The data to support that claim is mixed. The tariffs Mr. Trump imposed in 2018-19 achieved that goal to some extent, with the Brookings Institution\u00a0noting\u00a0that jobs in a few industries may have rebounded, such as adding 1,800 new U.S. jobs at Whirlpool and other washing machine manufacturers.",
      "Overall, the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs fell slightly during Trump's first term, from about 12.4 million to 12.2 million workers. A range of factors could account for that decline, such as the impact of the pandemic and broader economic issues facing manufacturing.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 11:41:50 -0500",
    "summary": "Norway is inching incredibly close to its goal of selling only zero-emission new vehicles, but advocates say incentives must be kept in place.",
    "story": [
      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014 Almost 96% of new cars registered in Norway in January were electric, an unparalleled proportion in the world and close to the country's goal of selling only zero-emission vehicles as of this year. A total of 9,343 new cars were sold in January, of which 8,954 were all-electric, the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) said.",
      "Of the 50 most-sold models, only two were non-electric, the first of which came in 33rd place, the OFV said.",
      "By comparison, the share of electric cars sold in Europe was just 13.6% in the full-year 2024 \u2014 a decline for the first time since 2020, according to the car manufacturers' lobby ACEA. Even that far out-paces EV sales in the U.S., where, according to MotorTrend data from last year, only about 6% of new vehicles sold were electric.",
      "With President Trump now in office after vows to reduce incentives on EV sales brought in under his predecessor, a continued downward trend in U.S. uptake is entirely possible.",
      "\"We've never seen this before... If the rest of the year continues like this, we will very soon be close to the 2025 goal,\" OFV director Oyvind Solberg Thorsen said in a statement. \"But if we want to cross the finish line with 100 percent electric cars, it will be necessary to maintain the incentives that make it profitable to choose an electric car over other models.\"",
      "Despite being a major oil and gas producer, Norway aims for all new cars sold to be \"zero emission\" starting in 2025, which is 10 years ahead of the goal set by the European Union, of which Norway is not a member.",
      "In contrast to Brussels' plans, Oslo has not banned the sale of cars with internal combustion engines, having instead opted for a system of generous tax breaks that have made them competitive against heavily taxed internal combustion cars.",
      "They have also benefitted from toll exemptions, free parking in public car parks, and the use of public transport traffic lanes.",
      "How Norway has driven the EV transition",
      "While some tax breaks and incentives have been rolled back over the years, electric cars have become commonplace on Norwegian roads.",
      "\"It was a decision primarily motivated by climate and environment considerations,\" Frode Hvattum, a 50-year-old father of three who owns two EVs, told AFP.",
      "\"Another reason was of course the benefits that come with them,\" he said, describing himself as a \"climate enthusiast.\"",
      "In his upscale neighborhood of Baerum in suburban Oslo, the streets are full of Teslas, Audis and Volkswagens. Competitively priced Chinese brands are increasingly appearing too.",
      "Many homes have a garage with an EV charger, in addition to Norway's vast national network of superfast charging stations that keep the nation rolling.",
      "That was a precondition for Hvattum, who, like many Norwegians, travels frequently by car to his chalet in the mountains several hours from Oslo.",
      "\"It's less complicated now that the network is so well-developed. You don't have to plan your trip as much as before,\" he said, adding that he uses the 15-20 minute charging breaks needed to make it up to the mountains to shop for food.",
      "Even if EV sales fail to meet the 100% mark this year, experts say that Norway can be seen as having met its goal.",
      "\"We should finish the year at between 95 and 100%, and probably even in the high end of this range,\" Christina Bu, head of the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association, told AFP.",
      "A new tax increase on internal combustion cars and rechargeable hybrids \u2014 which are cleaner but still run partially on gas or diesel \u2014 on April 1 should help.",
      "In January, diesel cars \u2014 still common in much of Europe \u2014\u00a0accounted for just 1.5% of new cars registered in Norway, and gasoline cars just 0.4%, according to the OFV.",
      "\"Political leaders can't rest on their laurels,\" Bu warned. \"They have to maintain the advantages, such as the toll discounts, so the transition to EVs spreads on the second-hand market.\"",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Canadian sports fans, angry at President Trump's unilateral imposition of 25% tariffs on virtually everything imported from Canada, reacted icily to the Star-Spangled Banner as it was sung at hockey and basketball games over the weekend. Many booed the U.S. national anthem in an uncharacteristic show of frustration after more than 150 years of peaceful, friendly relations along the vast border separating the neighbors.",
      "The reaction was representative of hurt feelings both north and south of the U.S. mainland's borders on Monday. Top officials in Canada and Mexico, which both faced 25% tariffs\u00a0with the stroke of Mr. Trump's pen on Saturday, were expected to hold conversations with the White House on the way forward in a new trade war that Mr. Trump had threatened for months. Both countries vowed to respond with their own trade measures.",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum announced in a brief statement Monday on social media that, after a phone call with Mr. Trump, the tariffs imposed on her country were \"on pause for one month from now.\" She said Mr. Trump had agreed to put the measures on hold after she committed to reinforcing Mexico's border with the U.S. \"with 10,000 members of the National Guard to prevent drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States.\"",
      "Mr. Trump confirmed the pause in his own social media post, saying the newly deployed Mexican forces \"will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our Country.\"",
      "Sheinbaum said Mr. Trump had \"committed to working to prevent the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico.\"",
      "China was also hit by a new raft of tariffs and has warned that it, too, will respond in kind. America's major allies and trade partners in Europe, meanwhile, have been warned by Mr. Trump that the European Union is next on his list, while the United Kingdom appears to have a chance to negotiate a trade deal, but will find itself torn between its next-door neighbors and its storied \"special relationship\" with the U.S. if it hopes to dodge the same fate.",
      "Canada is the biggest export market for products coming from 36 U.S. states, according to the Reuters news agency, while Mexico is broadly considered the U.S.' largest trading partner overall.",
      "Below is a look at some of the reaction from the countries now facing new U.S. tariffs, which will come into effect on Tuesday, and those which might still be hoping to avoid them.",
      "Canada:",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government had no choice but to strike back with 25% tariffs of its own on more than $150 billion worth of U.S.-made imports.",
      "\"First, I want to speak directly to Americans, our closest friends and neighbors,\" said Trudeau. \"This is a choice that, yes, will harm Canadians, but beyond that, it will have real consequences for you, the American people.\"",
      "\"Like the American tariffs, our response will also be far reaching and include everyday items such as American beer, wine and bourbon. Fruits and fruit juices including orange juice, along with vegetables, perfume, clothing and shoes. It will include major consumer products like household appliances, furniture and sports equipment, and materials like lumber and plastics, along with much, much more.\"",
      "\"Now is the time to choose products made right here in Canada,\" Trudeau added to his own constituents in a post on social media. \"Check the labels. Let's do our part. Wherever we can, choose Canada.\"",
      "The first round of Canada's tariffs will kick in at the stroke of midnight on Monday evening \u2013 on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods. In 21 days, the remainder of the tariffs, covering an additional $125 billion worth of products, will kick in unless some new agreement is reached between the countries. The delay, said Trudeau, was aimed at giving Canadian companies time to seek supply chain options to soften the financial blow.",
      "Speaking to ABC News on Sunday, Canada's Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman said many people in her country \"just don't understand where this is coming from... and probably, there's a little bit of hurt.\"",
      "Mexico:",
      "Canada's government is now looking south of the U.S. border, hoping to band together and increase trade ties with Mexico to help both nations absorb the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs. The two countries have agreed \"to enhance the strong bilateral relations\" they share and officials have had extensive bilateral meetings with their counterparts.",
      "President Sheinbaum, who haD already mocked Mr.Trump's move to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, said on social media before the pause was announced that countermeasures against the U.S. tariffs would soon be implemented.",
      "\"I've instructed my economy minister to implement the plan B we've been working on, which includes tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico's interests,\" Sheinbaum said, without specifying which U.S. goods her government might target, or whether she would seek to match the 25% retaliatory tariffs set to be imposed by Canada.",
      "Mexican goods exported to the U.S. are wide-ranging, and include vehicles and other auto industry components, crude oil, natural gas, avocados, tomatoes, pork and cheese.",
      "China:",
      "For Beijing, it was deja-vu. During Mr. Trump's first term, he slapped 25% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, then 10% on an additional $300 billion worth of imports, which meant virtually everything Chinese was tariffed.",
      "China's Ministry of Commerce released a statement over the weekend saying Beijing was \"strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposes\" the new 10% tariffs, that the U.S.'s \"unilateral increase in tariffs seriously violates WTO rules,\" and that China \"will file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization and take corresponding countermeasures,\" which implies Beijing will impose 10% retaliatory tariffs on select U.S.-made goods.",
      "Analysts say China better prepared than ever for trade war with U.S.",
      "Analysts say China better prepared than ever for trade war with U.S.",
      "In a Sunday statement, the Chinese Foreign Ministry didn't drop any hints as to what measures might be coming, but it said called \"on the United States to correct its wrongdoings, maintain the hard-won positive dynamics in the counternarcotics cooperation, and promote a steady, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relationship.\"",
      "The ministry said the U.S. should \"view and solve its own fentanyl issue in an objective and rational way,\" rather than \"threatening other countries with arbitrary tariff hikes.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he was imposing the new 10% tariff on Chinese goods in part due to what he considers Beijing's failure to stem the flow of fentanyl and chemicals used to make the drug.",
      "The foreign ministry in Beijing said China was \"one of the world's toughest countries on counternarcotics, both in terms of policy and its implementation.\"",
      "The European Union:",
      "Mr. Trump said over the weekend that tariffs on the European Union were coming, but he did not say when or how steep they would be.",
      "\"It will definitely happen with the European Union. I can tell you that because they've really taken advantage of us,\" the U.S. president told reporters Sunday. \"They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products. They take almost nothing and we take everything from them.\"",
      "European leaders were meeting Monday in Brussels, where they were discussing how to collectively address the threat.",
      "\"We were listening carefully to those words, and of course we are preparing also on our side,\" EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Monday in Brussels, adding a warning that \"there are no winners in trade wars.\"",
      "If the Trump administration \"starts a trade war [with Europe], then the one laughing on the side is China,\" said Kallas. \"We are very interlinked.\"",
      "Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the leader of Europe's biggest economy, Germany, said the EU was strong enough to take the blow and respond to any U.S. tariffs, but added that \"the goal should be that things result in cooperation\" within Europe.",
      "For a quick fact check on Mr. Trump's criticism: He's not wrong about the lop-sided trade relationship between the U.S. and its close allies across the Atlantic. Through November 2024, the EU ran a trade deficit of $78 billion with the U.S., according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and reports indicate that's on track to be a new record.",
      "The question many economic analysts and politicians across the world will keep asking, however, is whether huge tariffs taxing that trade are likely to help balance the books.",
      "The United Kingdom:",
      "Speaking to reporters early on Monday, Mr. Trump said \"the U.K. is out of line but\u2026 I think that one can be worked out,\" suggesting his administration was at least willing to negotiate with London over a new bilateral trade deal.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Sunday that he had spoken with Mr. Trump and stressed that he wants \"a strong trading relationship\" with the U.S., but the U.K. leader, five years after the \"Brexit\" withdrawal from the European Union, may now find himself caught between the formidable trade forces of the EU on his doorstep and Washington.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs on the EU and his looming, if tempered threat to hit Britain with the same will complicate Starmer's nascent efforts to \"reset\" U.K. trade ties with the EU. He's at the helm of the U.K.'s first Labour Party government in a decade and a half, and it was the former Conservative leadership that ushered in Brexit and soured the long-standing close ties with Europe.",
      "Starmer has moved cautiously as he sets out to mend fences with the EU, wary of riling up conservative voters who supported Brexit and who, to some degree, now support populist politicians such as the Trump-aligned, anti-immigration leader of the Reform U.K. party, Nigel Farage.",
      "The prime minister has ruled out rejoining the EU customs union or its single currency market, and he's so far resisted pressure from the continent to ease post-Brexit restrictions on U.K. and EU citizens living and working on either side of the border, at least for young people.",
      "But he still needs to get U.K.-EU trade moving again, and the extent to which he chooses to keep the bloc next door at arm's length, or to try to reinstate the close trade ties of before Brexit, could directly impact his chances of nailing down a favorable new trade agreement with Washington.",
      "Speaking Monday, a spokesperson for Starmer's government called the U.K.'s trade relationship with the U.S. \"fair and balanced,\" calling Washington \"an indispensable ally and one of our closest trading partners.\"",

      "In Bill Gates' new autobiography, \"Source Code: My Beginnings\" (published February 4 by Knopf), the computer pioneer and philanthropist writes of his formative years, and the experiences that led him to the then-burgeoning world of computers.",

      "All these years later it still amazes me how so many disparate things had to come together for me to use a computer in 1968. Beyond the leap of faith made by those teachers and parents who got us the terminal, and beyond the stroke of luck that people were now sharing computers over phone lines, completing this miracle was the decision by two Dartmouth professors to create the BASIC programming language. Just four years old at the time, the \"Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code\" was made to help students in nontechnical fields get started with computer programming. One of its attributes was that it used commands, such as GOTO, IF, THEN, and RUN, that made sense to humans. BASIC is what hooked me and made me want to come back.",
      "On the wall next to the terminal, a teacher had tacked up a half sheet of paper with the most rudimentary directions to get started, including how to sign in and which keys to press when something went wrong. It also warned ominously that typing \u00a0\"'PRINT' WITHOUT A STATEMENT NUMBER MAY CAUSE LOSS OF CONTROL.\"",
      "The page included a sample program written in BASIC telling the computer how to add two numbers.",
      "Ready . . .",
      "10 INPUT X,Y",
      "20 LET A=X+Y",
      "30 PRINT A",
      "40 END",
      "That was probably the first computer program I ever typed in. The elegance of the four lines of code appealed to my sense of order. Its instantaneous answer was like a jolt of electricity. From there, I wrote the first computer program of my own\u2014a game of tic-tac-toe. Getting it to work forced me to think through for the first time the most basic elements of the game's rules. Immediately, I learned that the computer was a dumb machine that I had to tell every single step it should take, under every single circumstance that could occur. When I wrote imprecise code, the computer couldn't infer or guess what I meant. I made a lot of errors trying to figure that out. When I finally got it right, the sense of accomplishment far outstripped the result. A game of tic-tac-toe is so simple, even kids learn it quickly. But it felt like a triumph to get a machine to do it.",
      "I loved how the computer forced me to think. It was completely unforgiving in the face of mental sloppiness. It demanded that I be logically consistent and pay attention to details. One misplaced comma or semicolon and the thing wouldn't work.",
      "It reminded me of solving mathematical proofs. Programming doesn't require math skills (beyond the basics), but it does demand the same kind of rigorous, logical approach to problem-solving, breaking problems down into smaller, more manageable parts. And like solving a problem in algebra, there are different ways to write programs that work\u2014some more elegant and efficient than others\u2014but infinite ways to make a program that fails. And mine failed all the time. Only after persevering, forcing myself to think smart, could I coax a program to run flawlessly.",
      "Another early program I wrote was a lunar lander game. The problem: safely touch down a lunar lander on the moon without crashing and before you run out of fuel. From that I had to break the problem down into steps. I had to solve how the game player moved the lander left and right, up and down, how much fuel it had, how fast it burned. I also had to describe what it looked like and how to display the ship in dashes and asterisks on the screen.",
      "Not long after Lakeside installed the terminal, Mr. Stocklin wrote a program that contained an infinite loop, meaning it ran continuously before someone eventually stopped it\u2014but not before it burned through over a hundred dollars of our precious rummage-sale budget. I'm not sure he showed his face again in that room. It was a lesson to all of us.",
      "To avoid racking up charges, I'd write out as much of my program as I could with pen and paper before elbowing into my place at the machine. With the machine offline to avoid time charges, I'd type it in and the program would print on a roll of inch-wide paper tape. That was step one. Then I'd dial the phone\u2014the rotary dial on the side of the terminal\u2014and wait for the buzz of the modem to confirm that I'd connected. I'd then feed my tape in, and chug-chug-chug, the program would input at a blistering ten characters per second. Finally, I'd type \"RUN.\" Typically there was a gaggle of other kids waiting for the computer, so if my program didn't work, I'd have to log off and find a spot to sort through where I went wrong, then wait my turn to get back on the teletype.",
      "This feedback loop was addictive. The feeling of getting better and better was a rush. Writing programs flowed from a combination of skills that came easy to me: logical thinking and an ability to focus intensely for long periods. Programming also stoked the persistent need I had to prove myself.",
      "The atmosphere of that computer room was a (mostly) healthy mix of cooperation and competition. We were a mosh pit of teenage boys all trying to outdo one another. A gap of only two or three years isn't much in the grand scheme of things but feels like a lot when you're thirteen, small for your age, with some indeterminate time until your growth spurt. Kent and I were among the youngest kids in that group. The assumed superiority of some of the older kids bothered us.",
      "I was an eighth-grader confident in my brain power and convinced that my intensity meant I could do anything the older guys could do\u2014if not better, then at least faster. I was determined to not let anyone get anything on me. Kent also hated being put-upon by someone else. Maybe even more than me.",
      "A sophomore named Paul Allen picked this up immediately, and he exploited it beautifully. \"Bill, you think you're so smart, you figure this thing out.\" Those are some of the first words said to me by the person who I would go on to cofound Microsoft with years later.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has fired the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Rohit Chopra, in the latest purge of a Biden Administrator holdover.",
      "Chopra was one of the more important regulators from the previous Democratic administration who was still on the job since Mr. Trump took office on Jan. 20. In a letter to the president shared on social media, Chopra said it was an \"extraordinary privilege\" to serve as director of the CFPB.",
      "\"With so much power concentrated in the hands of a few, agencies like the CFPB have never been more critical,\" he wrote. \"I'm proud that the CFPB has done so much to restore the rule of law.\"",
      "Chopra was notified of his firing via an email from the White House, a person familiar with the notice who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly told the Associated Press.",
      "During his term, Mr. Trump had picked Chopra as a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "An ally of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Chopra then was\u00a0tapped by former President Joe Biden\u00a0to lead the consumer agency that he helped launch after the 2008-09 financial crisis. He served as its deputy director, sounding the alarm about skyrocketing levels of student loan debt.",
      "Warren, one of Mr. Trump's favorite targets, said in a statement that the CFPB under Chopra held \"Wall Street accountable for cheating hard-working families\" and prevented \"the de-banking of Americans across the country, including consumers locked out of the financial system due to overdraft fees, religious organizations, and conservatives.\"",
      "Under the law, Chopra was to serve a five-year term, which meant he could have stayed on as the CFPB director. But he had publicly stated that he would leave his post if the new president asked.",
      "\"I hope that the CFBP will continue to be a pillar of restoring and advancing economic liberty in America, and I wish you good luck in serving our great country,\" Chopra said in his letter to Mr. Trump.",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 17:15:59 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump will enact 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada starting Saturday, as well as a 10% tariff on China.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump will enact 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 1, as well as a 10% tariff on imports from China, according to White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt.",
      "\"The president will be implementing tomorrow 25% tariffs on Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canada and a 10% tariff on China, for the illegal fentanyl they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country, which has killed tens of millions of Americans,\" Leavitt said at a White House briefing on Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump has said he's\u00a0targeting Canada and Mexico\u00a0\u2014 the nation's biggest trading partners \u2014 along with China, with tariffs to compel them to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S. The president has also said tariffs will generate money for the federal government, although the import duties are paid by U.S. importers. Companies such as Walmart, Target and other U.S. importers typically pass tariff-related costs onto American consumers.",
      "Asked whether Mr. Trump's new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China would include any exemptions, Leavitt said she didn't have information about that issue.",
      "Mr. Trump's goals include narrowing the trade surplus between those nations and the U.S. The U.S. trade deficit with Canada has surged from $31 billion in 2019 to $72 billion in 2023, largely reflecting growing American imports of Canadian energy. Over that same period, the gap with Mexico has grown from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion as the U.S. curtails imports from China and brings more electronic items, shoes and other products from south of the border.",
      "Experts warn that steep new tariffs on imports could cause U.S. economic growth to slow and inflation to flare, noting that companies in the U.S. are likely to pass on the added costs to consumers. A sustained burst of inflation, in turn, could also deter the Federal Reserve from pushing down borrowing costs, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "Even the prospect of higher import duties is influencing spending by consumers and businesses, according to Oxford Economics. Analysts with the investment adviser note that U.S. imports surged in December, a sign Americans are buying appliances, furniture and other goods now to get ahead of possible price increases.",
      "Retaliation risks",
      "A volley of new U.S. tariffs is likely to invite swift retaliation. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday that his country is prepared to fire back if Mr. Trump proceeds with his plan, but he did not give details.",
      "\"We're ready with a response, a purposeful, forceful but reasonable, immediate response,\" he said. \"It's not what we want, but if he moves forward, we will also act.\"",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that Mexico has conferred with Trump's team since before he returned to the White House, but she emphasized that Mexico has a \"Plan A, Plan B, Plan C for what the United States government decides.\"",
      "\"Now it is very important that the Mexican people know that we are always going to defend the dignity of our people, we are always going to defend the respect of our sovereignty and a dialogue between equals, as we have always said, without subordination,\" she said.",
      "The ultimate economic damage from the U.S. tariffs would hinge on how long they are in place, Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator, told the Associated Press.",
      "If it's just a few days, \"that's one thing. If they are in place for weeks onto months, we're going to see supply chain disruptions, higher costs for U.S. manufacturers, leading to higher prices for U.S. consumers,\" said Cutler, now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \"It could have macroeconomic impacts. It could affect the stock market. Then internationally it could lead to more tension with our trading partners and make it harder for us to work with them.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 15:44:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's pick to head the Department of Health and Human Services, faces scrutiny for fees he may earn from lawsuits against Merck.",
    "story": [
      "As Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s confirmation hearings to serve as the nation's top health official play out on Capitol Hill, President Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services is facing scrutiny not only for his anti-vaccine views, but whether he profits from them.",
      "If confirmed, Kennedy would wield control over federal vaccine policy and the regulation of drugmakers, even as he stands to potentially profit from vaccine-related litigation.",
      "How Kennedy made money from lawsuits",
      "Kennedy for years has earned referral fees from Wisner Baum, a Los Angeles personal injury law firm that is currently suing Merck, alleging the pharmaceutical giant failed to properly warn the public about risks from its vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV), Gardasil, according to financial disclosure documents filed by Kennedy with the Office of Government Ethics.",
      "Wisner Baum is representing a plaintiff in a trial against Merck and other lawsuits are in the works in North Carolina.",
      "\"An overwhelming body of scientific evidence, including more than 30 years of research and development along with real world evidence generated by Merck and by independent investigators, continues to support the safety and efficacy profiles of our HPV vaccines,\" Rahway, New Jersey-based Merck said Tuesday in a\u00a0statement on the litigation. \"The plaintiff's allegations have no merit, and we remain committed to vigorously defending against these claims in the upcoming trial.\"",
      "In a congressional hearing on Wednesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, repeatedly asked Kennedy if he would agree to forgo payments stemming from litigation against drugmakers after disclosing in Ethics Office filings that he might collect legal fees for referring potential plaintiffs in Wisner Baum's suits against Merck over its HPV vaccine, which is to prevent cervical cancer.",
      "Kennedy has made about $2.5 million since 2022 in his work with the law firm, including $850,000 last year, public records show. Kennedy, himself a longtime personal injury lawyer, could earn even more if the litigation against Merck prevails given that he is opting to keep his stake in the pending court case, according to ethics documents filed before his confirmation hearings.",
      "Kennedy has a consulting arrangement to refer cases to Wisner Baum, which is pursuing cases related to the HPV vaccine Gardasil. If Kennedy is confirmed, he said he would resign from that arrangement.",
      "\"I am entitled to receive 10% of fees awarded in contingency fee cases referred to the firm,\" Kennedy stated in his ethics pledge. According to the document, Kennedy will retain an interest in cases that do not involve the U.S. as a party and in which the U.S. does not have a \"direct and substantial interest.\"",
      "At the same time, Kennedy vowed to divest his rights to payment in contingency fee cases in which the U.S. is a party or has a direct or large interest to a \"non-dependent, adult family member.\"",
      "Financial conflict of interest?",
      "Kennedy's plan to continue collecting contingency fees while serving as Health and Human Services secretary raises questions as a matter of ethics and policy, according to Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, \"It's very unusual for a cabinet secretary to retain an interest in contingency fee litigation,\" Clark told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's troubling.\"",
      "For example, if Kennedy stands to financially gain in lawsuits against Merck or other drugmakers, his impartiality as HHS secretary could face scrutiny if the companies faced a federal enforcement action or submitted a drug for government approval, Clark added.",
      "Wisner Baum said it hasn't paid Kennedy for his work linked to the firm's suits against Merck, which is just getting started in California.",
      "The firm \"has only compensated Mr. Kennedy for Monsanto Roundup-induced non-Hodgkins lymphoma cases, Woolsey Fire cases and Paradise/Camp Fire cases. All of these cases alleged corporate wrongdoing that caused life-changing harm to victims,\" Wisner Baum said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"We are currently in trial in the first Gardasil case in Los Angeles. We hope, like in Roundup, soundbites take a backseat to truth, take a backseat to actual evidence, and a jury returns a verdict sending the same message multiple juries did in Roundup \u2014 consumers deserve to know the truth, and politics has nothing to do with it,\" said Wisner Baum's managing partner, R. Brent Wisner, alluding to long-running ligation against Monsanto, now owned by Germany's Bayner, over a weedkiller alleged to cause cancer.",
      "Kennedy also made another $326,056 in salary and benefits from the Children's Health Defense, which he founded and formerly chaired, according to his ethics filings. The nonprofit has filed dozens of state and federal lawsuits challenging vaccine and public health mandates. Its targets include the federal agencies that Kennedy would run at HHS.",
      "During the hearing, Warren pointed to several changes Kennedy could make that might enrich him in connection with such lawsuits if he is approved as health secretary. That includes appointing anti-vaccine advocates to vaccine advisory panels, removing vaccines from recommendations or changing the way the vaccine injury compensation program works.",
      "Kennedy would not commit to Warren's request to forgo contingency fees while serving as HHS secretary. However, in written responses\u00a0to Warren on Friday, Kennedy agreed to amend his ethics agreement, a document that should be \"thoroughly reviewed\" before the Senate moves forward on Kennedy's nominatioin, the senator's office stated.",
      "\"It would be insufficient for RFK Jr. to only divest his interest in the Gardasil case while leaving the window open to profit from other anti-vax lawsuits, including future cases he could bring after leaving office,\" Warren said in a statement on Friday.",
      "A spokesperson for Kennedy did not respond to a phone message requesting comment. Representatives for the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "MAHA trademark pending",
      "During Wednesday's hearing, Sen. Mike Crapo, a Republican of Idaho, asked Kennedy if there was \"anything that you are aware of in your background that might present a conflict of interest within the duties of the office to which you have been nominated?\"",
      "Kennedy replied \"No, Mr. Chairman.\"",
      "As part of the confirmation proceedings, Kennedy in December disclosed earning $100,000 from variations of his slogan, \"Make America Healthy Again\" and its abbreviation \u2014 MAHA \u2014 on stickers, hats and hoodies. Kennedy had in recent months applied for trademark protection for the phrase, setting the stage for marketing supplements, vitamins, essential oils and cryptocurrency, according to documents filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.",
      "Kennedy has since transferred ownership of the trademark application to a limited liability company managed by Del Gibtree, a longtime anti-vaccine activist.",

      "Leavitt's confirmation of the tariffs comes after Trump on Thursday reiterated his earlier threat this month that he could announce 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1, telling reporters from the Oval Office that the duties \"may or may not rise with time.\" He had previously warned China could face a 10% tariff.",
      "Economists have warned that stiff tariffs\u00a0could reawaken U.S. inflation on a range of consumer goods and slow economic growth. Here's what experts have to say.",
      "Why is Trump threatening to hit countries with tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump has threatened tariffs against multiple nations for a range of reasons. He said he is specifically\u00a0targeting Canada, Mexico\u00a0\u2014 the U.S.' biggest trading partners \u2014 along with China, with tariffs to compel them to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S., as well as to narrow their trade surplus with the U.S.",

Over that same period, the gap with Mexico has grown from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion as the U.S. curtails imports from China and brings more electronic items, shoes and other products from south of the border.",
      "Before Mr. Trump returned to power, he also had threatened tariffs of up to\u00a060% on Chinese goods\u00a0imported into the U.S., a measure experts say is intended to advance American interests in negotiating better trade terms with Beijing, as well as throttle the illegal entry of fentanyl into the country.",
      "In a show of how his administration uses tariff threats to pressure countries on other issues, Mr. Trump last week proposed potential 25% levies against Colombia unless it agreed to receive deportations of unauthorized immigrants. Colombia ultimately agreed to receive the immigrants,\u00a0and the tariffs were withheld.",
      "Colombia's about-face suggests that Canada and Mexico could also reach agreement with the U.S. and avert a painful trade war. To that end, Howard Lutnick, Mr. Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, said at his confirmation hearing Wednesday that Canada and Mexico could avoid tariffs by closing their borders to fentanyl.",
      "\"As far as I know, they are acting swiftly, and if they execute it, there will be no tariff,\" Lutnick told senators.",
      "Even so, Mr. Trump's brandishing of potential tariffs \u2014 even if they are never imposed \u2014 highlights his willingness to use tough trade measures to punish even the country's closest allies unless they make concessions.",
      "\"As we have previously noted, trade policy will be transactional over the next four years with protectionist measures used to extort trade, immigration and other political concessions,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said in a research note.",
      "What exactly is Trump planning?",
      "Along with targeting Canada and Mexico, the Trump administration has floated the possibility of a blanket tariff on a range of countries in Asia, South America, Europe and other regions.",
      "\"I think we have to proceed on the assumption that some kinds of tariffs are going to be imposed on the United States' major trading partners,\" Brett House, professor of economics at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"In the end, there is a lot that gets announced by the president on social media that does not come to pass. I don't take it as bluffing, so much as a storm of possibilities, and it's hard to tell which bit of that storm is going to be pursued most aggressively, and most immediately.\"",
      "What's clear, by contrast, is that the new administration is picking up where Mr. Trump left off in his first term in using trade policy as an instrument of both economic and foreign policy. That is likely to lead to a period of uncertainty and volatility, said John Lash, group vice president of product strategy at supply-chain software firm E2open.",
      "\"A lot of alternatives are still possible,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch in an interview. \"We don't know, but game theory would suggest the president would implement tariffs in some form against Mexico and Canada \u2014 not blanket tariffs, but on a select number of imports from both nations... because otherwise his bluff is going to be called.\"",
      "On how soon any tariffs could take effect, Daco notes that Mr. Trump could move quickly by claiming authority under a 1977 law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.",
      "\"When he said he'll impose tariffs on Feb. 1, it is still an open question as to what means would be used. Do you want to implement tariffs immediately, as threatened against Colombia over the weekend, or are you threatening with a deadline to obtain concessions?\" Daco said.",
      "Would the U.S. face retaliation?",
      "Almost certainly, economists say. If Trump officials move ahead with tariffs on its northern neighbor, \"We anticipate Canada would then respond in kind by also implementing a 25% across-the-board tariff on U.S. imports,\" Satyam Panday, chief U.S. and Canada economist with S&P Global Ratings, said in an email.",
      "Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, previously vowed to remove U.S.-made alcoholic beverages from stores in the Canadian province, according to the Associated Press. Canada is the world's second-largest market for America's distilled spirits, behind European Union.",
      "Elijah Oliveros-Rosen, chief emerging markets economist at S&P Global Ratings, predicted Mexico also would fire back with targeted tariffs. \"In the case of Mexico, we think it's very unlikely the government would place tariffs on U.S.-manufactured imports, given most are intermediate goods eventually exported to the U.S. Therefore, we expect the Mexican government could impose tariffs on agricultural and food imports, but not manufacturing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said that strengthening the U.S.' stance on trade issues will help protect American workers and lead to a resurgence of domestic manufacturing. Yet such policies could come at the cost of damaging critical relationships with other nations around the world, said Douglas Irwin, a U.S. trade policy expert and professor of economics at Dartmouth College.",
      "What is the risk to American consumers?",
      "Irwin and other economists say tariffs are all but certain to lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers. That's because companies that end up on the hook typically pass added costs along to consumers in order to protect their bottom lines.",
      "\"The notion this administration has been adhering to is somewhat surprising \u2014 the idea that if you implement gradual tariffs over time, such as in 5% increments, that these are less inflationary,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This idea is misguided, because if you have incremental price increases month after month, if anything that leads to higher inflation expectations. It leads to higher inflation on a month-to-month basis.\"",
      "If Mr. Trump's tariffs are implemented in full, including a universal 10% tax on all goods, consumer price inflation could rise to between 3% and 4%, according to an analysis this week from Capital Economics. To be sure, analysts with the investment advisory firm expect Mr. Trump to stop short of imposing a blanket tariff and instead pick his targets.",
      "Matthew Holmes, chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, suggested that a volley of tariffs between the countries would also impact U.S. consumers.",
      "\"From higher costs at the pumps, grocery stores and online checkout, tariffs cascade through the economy and end up hurting consumers and businesses on both sides of the border. This is a lose-lose,\" he said in an email.",

They are also pulling back on efforts to include hiring and promoting women, minorities, LGBTQ+ people and veterans.",
      "Activists held a press conference at Target headquarters in downtown Minneapolis Thursday morning.",

In the past, Target was known for its diversity initiatives and reputation for supporting diverse communities,\" said civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong. \"Now Target has shown its true face by deciding to roll back its focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion by putting profits and politics over people.\"",
      "Armstrong encouraged Minnesotans to start boycotting Target stores indefinitely starting Saturday, Feb. 1.",

      "Speakers at Thursday's event made two requests: for employees to speak up and for shoppers to shop elsewhere.",

    "summary": "Federal officials approved a new type of pain drug designed to eliminate the risks of addiction and overdose associated with opioid\u200b medications like Vicodin and OxyContin.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Federal officials on Thursday approved a new type of pain drug designed to eliminate the risks of addiction and overdose associated with opioid medications like Vicodin and OxyContin.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved Vertex Pharmaceuticals' pill, Journavx, for short-term pain that often follows surgery or injuries.",
      "It's the first new pharmaceutical approach to treating pain in more than 20 years, offering an alternative to both opioids and over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. But the medication's modest effectiveness and lengthy development process underscore the challenges of finding new ways to manage pain.",
      "Two studies in more than 870 patients with acute pain following foot and abdominal surgeries showed Vertex's drug provided more relief than a dummy pill but didn't outperform a common opioid-acetaminophen combination pill.",
      "\"It's not a slam dunk on effectiveness,\" said Michael Schuh of the Mayo Clinic, a pharmacist and pain medicine expert who wasn't involved in the research. \"But it is a slam dunk in that it's a very different pathway and mechanism of action, so I think that shows a lot of promise.\"",
      "Vertex began researching the drug in the 2000s, when drug overdoses were rocketing upward, principally driven by mass prescribing of opioid painkillers for common ailments like arthritis and back pain. Prescriptions have fallen sharply in the last decade and the current wave of the opioid epidemic is mainly due to illicit fentanyl, not pharmaceutical medicines.",
      "Opioids reduce pain by binding to receptors in the brain that receive nerve signals from different parts of the body. Those chemical interactions also give rise to opioids' addictive effects.",
      "Vertex's drug works differently, blocking proteins that trigger pain signals that are later sent to the brain.",
      "\"In trying to develop medicines that don't have the addictive risks of opioid medicines, a key factor is working to block pain signaling before it gets to the brain,\" Vertex's Dr. David Altshuler, told the Associated Press last year.",
      "Commonly reported side effects with the drug were nausea, constipation, itching, rash and headache.",
      "\"The new medication has side effect profiles that are inherently not only different, but don't involve the risk of substance abuse and other key side effects associated with opioids,\" said Dr. Charles Argoff of the Albany Medical Center, who consulted for Vertex on the drug's development.",
      "The initial concept to focus on pain-signaling proteins came out of research involving people with a rare hereditary condition that causes insensitivity to pain.",
      "Vertex has attracted interest from Wall Street for its ambitious drug pipeline that involves winning FDA approval for multiple drugs across several forms of chronic pain, which generally represents a bigger financial opportunity than acute pain.",
      "But the Boston drugmaker's share price plummeted in December when Vertex reported disappointing mid-stage results in a study of patients with chronic nerve pain affecting the lower back and legs. The drug didn't perform significantly better than placebo, the research found.",
      "\"We believe the data reflect a near worst-case scenario for this key pipeline program,\" biotechnology analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note to investors, adding that the results jeopardized estimates that Vertex's pipeline could be worth billions across multiple forms of pain.",
      "Still, Vertex executives said they plan to move forward with a new, late-stage study of the drug, theorizing that a different trial design could yield better results and pave the way for FDA approval in chronic pain.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 12:48:00 -0500",
    "summary": "With tax season underway, here's what you need to know about tracking your tax refund and your new 2025 tax brackets.",
    "story": [
      "Tax season is now underway, with the IRS accepting returns for all taxpayers as of Jan. 27. That's prompting many people to turn to the \"Where's my refund?\" app from the tax agency to track when they'll get their check.",
      "Americans are expected to file about 140 million returns before the April 15 deadline. Last year, about two-thirds of taxpayers got a refund, with the average check at about $3,100,\u00a0according\u00a0to IRS data.",
      "A household's tax refund may represent their biggest check for the entire year, with many consumers planning to use the money for debt repayment, emergency savings or a big purchase. To be sure, while a large refund may feel like a financial windfall, it actually represents income that taxpayers have overpaid to the IRS throughout the year.",
      "That's why some financial experts describe refund checks as tax-free loans to the U.S. government. Yet other experts note that tax refunds can act as a form of forced savings that a household might not otherwise be able to accomplish, allowing those taxpayers to reap the benefit in their annual refund.",
      "Whatever the case might be, tracking your refund can be done through the IRS' \"Where's my refund\" app, which the agency has sought to improve over the last few years. Here's what to know.",
      "How does \"Where's my refund?\" work?",
      "The IRS operates the \"Where's my refund?\" service on its website, but taxpayers can also use a mobile app called IRS2Go\u00a0on their phones or other devices. Both services will provide information about your 2024 return about 24 hours after you e-file, the IRS says.",
      "However, people who file paper returns will need to wait about 4 weeks for their information to appear on \"Where's my refund?\" or the IRS2Go app.",
      "Both services require taxpayers to enter information to be able to track their refunds:",
      "Either your Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification numberFiling status, such as single filer or married filing jointly\u00a0The exact whole dollar amount of your expected refund from your original 2024 tax return",
      "Either your Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification number",
      "Filing status, such as single filer or married filing jointly",
      "The exact whole dollar amount of your expected refund from your original 2024 tax return",
      "The IRS tracking services will then show you information on whether the agency has received your tax return, if the refund has been approved and when the money is scheduled to land in your account.",
      "When will I get my tax refund?",
      "That depends on whether you've file electronically or sent in a paper tax return, as well as if the IRS identifies any problems with your return.",
      "People who e-filed their returns typically receive their refunds in less than 21 days. In other words, a taxpayer who filed their 1040 on Jan. 27 could receive their payment by Feb. 17, if all goes smoothly.",
      "However, the IRS opened its Free File service on Jan. 10, which is a program offered through tax software companies for taxpayers with adjusted gross income of $84,000 or less in 2024. Those using Free File could be on tap to receive their refunds by Jan. 31.",
      "What can delay your tax refund?",
      "Filing a paper return can delay your refund because it requires IRS employees to process them, which takes more time than e-filed returns, which are largely handled by computers.",
      "Claiming either the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) can also slow down a tax refund. That's because, by law, the IRS can't issue refunds for returns that have claimed those tax credits before mid-February.",
      "\"The IRS expects most EITC/ACTC-related refunds to be available in taxpayer bank accounts or on debit cards by March 3 if they chose direct deposit and there are no other issues with their tax return,\" the agency said on Monday.",
      "Some issues can also trip up tax refunds, such as if there are math errors on your return, missing or incorrect Social Security numbers or misspelled names, according to the IRS. While these might be innocent mistakes, it can cause the IRS to flag your return and delay your refund.",
      "What's my new 2025 tax bracket?",
      "The IRS has set new tax brackets for 2025, but that won't impact the return you'll file by April 15, since that 1040 reflects your 2024 income and taxes.",
      "Each year, the IRS adjusts its tax brackets and dozens of other provisions to account for inflation. The idea is to shield taxpayers from \"bracket creep\" \u2014 when workers are pushed into higher tax bands due to the impact of cost-of-living adjustments aimed at offsetting inflation \u2014 without a change in their standard of living.",
      "This year's tax brackets are adjusted 2.8% higher from 2024, representing the smallest jump in several years. Because inflation jumped during the pandemic, the bracket adjustments reached 7% in 2023\u00a0and\u00a05.4% in 2024.",

      "On Wednesday, the Fed left its benchmark interest rate unchanged after making three cuts since September. With the economy rolling along, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters, \"we do not need to be in a hurry'' to make more cuts. The Fed is also cautious because progress against inflation has stalled in recent months after falling from four-decade highs hit in mid-2022.",
      "The European Central Bank cut its benchmark rate by a quarter point Thursday, underlining the contrast between more robust growth in the U.S. economy and stagnation in Europe, which recorded zero growth at the end of last year.",
      "The U.S. economic outlook has become more cloudy, however. Trump has promised to cut taxes and ease regulations on business, which could speed GDP growth. But his plan to impose big taxes on imports and to deport millions of immigrants working in the United States illegally could mean slower growth and higher prices.",
      "Trump said last week that he would lower oil prices and then \"demand'' lower interest rates \u2013 a topic he said he'd take up with Powell. But the Fed chair deflected questions about Trump's comments Wednesday and said he'd had no contact with the president.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 16:33:51 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve opted to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged in its first policy meeting since President Trump's inauguration.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it will leave its benchmark rate unchanged, hitting the brakes on lowering borrowing costs for individuals and businesses after a flurry of rate cuts starting last fall.",
      "The Fed said it will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The decision comes after the central bank trimmed rates three times starting in September 2024, which has pushed down the federal funds rate \u2014 the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 by one percentage point.",
      "The pause, the Fed's first rate decision since President Trump returned to office on Jan. 20, comes as economists predict the central bank is likely to take a wait-and-see approach to the president's economic policies, given that some, such as higher tariffs, could prove inflationary.",
      "The Fed's decision to keep rates steady reflects stubborn U.S. inflation, which remains close to 3% on an annual basis. That has fueled concerns that additional rate cuts could reignite price increases, making it more difficult to get to the Fed's 2% target. Notably, the Fed removed a line from its December statement expressing its belief that inflation \"has made progress\" toward its goal. Yet Powell struck a more dovish tone in a press conference to discuss the Fed's decision.",
      "\"Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well-anchored, as reflected in a broad, broad range of surveys of households, businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets,\" he said.",
      "Powell also described the economy as \"in quite a good place,\" citing growing GDP, solid job gains and a low unemployment rate, as well as signs of inflationary pressures easing. \"We don't need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,\" he added.",
      "\"Pressing the pause button,\" noted Lindsay Rosner, head of multisector fixed-income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"[T]he FOMC will want to see further progress in the inflation data to deliver the next rate cut highlighted by the fact they removed the reference on inflation making progress.\"",

      "In the meantime, inflation-weary consumers won't get much relief from still-high borrowing costs, especially if the Fed holds off on additional rate cuts later in 2025, as many economists and Wall Street analysts forecast. With the Fed hitting the pause button, it's unlikely that consumers will see lower borrowing costs on credit cards or other forms of debt, even as more households struggle to pay their bills.",
      "\"[L]ower- and middle-income households are facing mounting pressure, as evidenced by an increase in credit card and auto loan delinquencies,\" Joe Gaffoglio, CEO of Mutual of America Capital Management, said in an email.",
      "When will the Fed cut rates?",
      "The Fed may hold off on cutting rates until its May 7 meeting, according to economists polled by financial-data firm FactSet. That means the central bank is expected to hold rates steady at its next meeting on March 19.",
      "\"If the Fed doesn't resume cutting in the next few months, however, we suspect the window will have closed,\" Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics said in a report. \"While markets are still pricing in second half rate cuts, our view is that a flurry of tariffs will put a stop to that, as inflation rebounds to 3%.\"",
      "Asked about the possible impact of Mr. Trump's economic plans, Powell demurred, noting that while the Fed is monitoring the new administration's policies, it's too early for the central bank to make an assessment of their possible impact. Mr. Trump has vowed to enact a broad tariff of 10% on all imports, as well as to imposed\u00a025% tariffs on Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1.",
      "\"We need to let those policies be articulated before we can even begin to make that a plausible assessment of what their implications for the economy will be,\" he said. \"We don't know what's going to be tariffed, we don't know for how long or how much, what countries, we don't know about retaliation.\"",
      "Asked by CBS News' Richard Escobedo about economic uncertainty created by Mr. Trump's plan to deport undocumented immigrants, Powell responded that the administration's efforts are not yet showing up in economic data.",
      "\"Businesses that are dependent on immigrant labor are saying that it's suddenly gotten harder to get people,\" the Fed chair said. \"But again, you don't see that in the aggregate data, but yes, you hear it anecdotally.\"",
      "While inflation has subsided from a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022, it\u00a0rose 2.9% in December on a year-over-year basis due to higher prices on gasoline, which rose 4.4% from the prior month, as well as food and housing.",
      "In its statement, the Fed described the labor market as \"solid,\" with an unemployment rate that has \"stabilized at a low level in recent months.\" Even so, the Fed is closely monitoring the labor market for signs of weakness, with the central bank pointing to a rise in the jobless rate last fall as one reason why it opted to cut rates at the time.",
      "\"The Fed will keep their options open in case a sudden weakening materializes in the months to come\" in the labor market, noted Bankrate chief financial analyst Greg McBride in an email.",
      "As for when the next rate cut might come, it's unclear from the Fed's statement, he added.",
      "\"They gave no indication in their post-meeting statement that a resumption of rate cuts is likely at the next meeting in March,\" McBride said. \"It will take a run of good inflation data to get us there, whenever that may be.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 14:59:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump executive order that reclassifies career civil servants risks politicizing thousands of government jobs, critics say.",
    "story": [
      "From meat inspectors to border patrol officers, many Americans who work for the federal government could soon see their jobs reclassified into at-will positions, meaning they can be dismissed for nearly any reason.",
      "In a related development, the White House expects up to 10% of federal employees to quit in September in a program meant to\u00a0end work-from-home practices, senior administration officials told CBS News.",
      "Depending on future court rulings and how effective the Trump administration proves to be in overriding existing federal regulations, an executive order signed by President Trump revives a policy from his first administration known as Schedule F. The Jan. 20\u00a0directive\u00a0creates a new employment classification for many career civil servants, effectively stripping them of job protections.",
      "Likely to impact tens of thousands of civil servants, and potentially more, the order defines policymaking positions to include mundane tasks such as viewing and circulating proposed government regulations.",
      "\"We think this order affects at least 50,000 people who are currently protected, but the number could be much bigger,\" Nick Bednar, a University of Minnesota Law School associate professor, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Some scholars think it could reach into the hundreds of thousands. At the end of the first term, when the Trump administration sought to reclassify positions, it included executive assistants, toxicologists and scientists \u2014 it's not clear who this doesn't reach.\"",
      "\"Individuals in these policymaking positions don't have the same due process protections as other employees. They can be more easily removed,\" Bednar added. \"There are 2.8 million civilian employees in the federal government. Most, or the vast majority, enjoy some kind of protection from removal.\"",
      "For now, it remains unclear how far the Trump administration plans to go in implementing the order, said Steve Lenkart, executive director of the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE-IAM), a union representing 100,000 government workers.",
      "\"Technically, if you're a maintenance person pushing a broom on the floor, you are executing a policy,\" said Lenkart in offering an example of how virtually any government worker could be defined as being engaged in work that falls under Schedule F.",
      "\"President Trump has the executive power to make decisions to implement a government that reflects the will of the American people,\" Harrison Fields, principal deputy press secretary at the White House, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"If an individual in the administration is working on policy, then they should align with President Trump's mission of putting America first.\"",
      "Hit to morale?",
      "President Trump is not unique in looking to have a stronger hand over the federal workforce, according to Bednar.",
      "\"A common strategy of presidents is trying to politicize federal employment positions so they have greater control over executive branch hiring and firing,\" said Bednar, who lists Dwight Eisenhower and Jimmy Carter among previous presidents who have sought to exert such influence. Still, he noted \"we haven't seen something that tries to reach this deep into the career staff.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump's Schedule F plan and other administration orders aimed a reshaping the federal workplace are being challenged in court, the Trump administration may succeed in its goal of downsizing government, regardless of whether it wins on the legal front, Bednar said.",
      "\"Even if the lawsuits slow down this process, there are many civil servants who might leave government fearing continuing to work in the Trump administration \u2014 employee moral is really affected,\" he said. \"They want a smaller government, and they view this as an opportunity to pursue that.\"",
      "Bednar also cautions that a smaller government workforce could hinder some Trump administration policy goals, including fewer agents to patrol U.S. borders and reduced staffing in immigration courts, adding to the current backlog.",
      "The case for and against Schedule F",
      "Mr. Trump originally implemented the Schedule F policy in 2020 as his first term was nearing an end, but it was repealed after former President Joe Biden took office. Mr. Trump said last week that the revived order is necessary to ensure that federal workers in roles that affect government policy remain accountable to the public.",
      "\"In recent years ... there have been numerous and well-documented cases of career federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership,\" Mr. Trump's order states. \"Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service, beginning with positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character.\"",
      "But critics of Schedule F argue it undermines the traditional principles behind civil service, which emphasize hiring based on professional qualifications. Should Schedule F survive legal challenges, they say, millions of government workers hired based on merit could be fired at will, including if they are deemed insufficiently loyal to Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Is this really about making government more efficient and smaller, or targeting regulatory and law enforcement people?\" asked Lenkart, who noted that the number of workers employed in the executive branch has remained roughly the same for more than 70 years even as the nation's population has doubled.",
      "Unions representing public workers have blasted Schedule F. The policy is among a slew of executive orders \"designed to intimidate and attack nonpartisan civil servants under the guise of increasing efficiency,\" Randy Erwin, national president of the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0last week. \"However, these orders will do the exact opposite.\"",
      "Members of the 100-year-old NFFE are employed\u00a0by\u00a0dozens of federal agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration and Social Security Administration.",
      "On Wednesday, the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) filed suit against the Trump administration, saying it was exceeding its authority in rolling back protections for workers.",
      "\"We can stop the efforts to fire hundreds of thousands of experienced, hard-working Americans who have dedicated their careers to serving their country and prevent these career civil servants from being replaced with unqualified political flunkies loyal to the president, but not the law or Constitution,\" AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in a statement.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union also filed a suit to block Schedule F, calling it \"contrary to congressional intent.\" The\u00a0complaint, filed Jan. 20 in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, argues that Mr. Trump's order reinstating Schedule F \"wrongly applies employment rules for political appointees to career staff, deprives federal employees of due process rights that they were promised when they were hired, and ignores Office of Personnel Management regulations.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 12:17:52 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has said he will \"demand\" lower interest rates, raising questions about his ability to influence the Federal Reserve.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump had a message last week for the Federal Reserve while at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland: He plans to \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\"",
      "Mr. Trump may be in for disappointment. The Federal Reserve widely expected to keep its benchmark rate steady when it announces its latest interest rate decision today at 2 p.m. Eastern Time. Economists aren't penciling in a 2025 reduction until at least May, according to economists polled by financial data service FactSet.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has over the years steadfastly defended the central bank's independence. Most recently, he underlined at a New York Times event in December that insulating the Fed from political influence is \"for the benefit of all Americans,\" allowing it to make decisions based on economic data rather than at the behest of elected officials. The Fed's independence allows it to pursue its dual mandate \u2014 to keep inflation low and the labor market at full employment \u2014 without political pressure, economists concur.",
      "\"We know monetary policy needs to be enacted with a democratic mandate underpinning it, with a day-to-day remove from politics,\" Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Interest rates may need to be raised but it may be inconvenient for political interests, and [the central bank] may need to move quickly to lower rates\" in case of an economic downturn.",
      "While the Fed is an independent agency, it is accountable to Congress and the public, with its chair and other officials testifying before Congress regularly. Its dual mandate was also established by Congress, as well as its structure of staggered appointments for Fed officials, designed to make the agency less vulnerable to pressures \"that could lead to undesirable outcomes,\" according to the Fed.",
      "What happens when a central bank isn't independent?",
      "Those \"undesirable outcomes\" can be seen in nations where central bankers are more vulnerable to political influence, economists say.",
      "That's because interest rates remain the most potent weapon that a central bank can wield against surging inflation \u2014 a tool that the Federal Reserve turned to in 2022 to tame the hottest U.S. inflation in 40 years. But elected officials sometimes decide that higher borrowing costs are politically inconvenient, because they make it more expensive for businesses to expand or for consumers to make purchases.",
      "In cases where a central bank isn't independent, officials may succeed in pressuring a central bank to keep a lid on rates.",
      "Experts point to Turkey as an example of what can occur when political interests dictate a central bank's monetary policies. Since 2010, its central bank has increasingly come under pressure from President Erdo\u011fan to keep its interest rates low, even as inflation surged during the pandemic, according to the non-partisan Centre for Economic Policy Research.",
      "Instead of hiking rates as Turkey's inflation rate topped 80% in October 2022 on an annual basis, the nation's central bank cut its benchmark rate several times in 2022 and 2023. While the bank reversed course and hiked rates starting in mid-2023, inflation there has proved tough to tame, with prices rising by 44% in December 2024.",
      "By comparison, the highest U.S. inflation rate during the post-pandemic period was in June 2022, when inflation hit 9.1% on an annual basis in June 2022. In the face of the Fed's rate hikes, inflation has cooled since then, deflating to 2.9% on an annual basis last month.",
      "\"The Fed has done really well \u2014 they have raised the rates enough to try to slowly squeeze inflation out of the market,\" noted Erasmus Kersting, a professor of economics at Villanova University. The Fed has \"done all that while avoiding a recession \u2014 that is a delicate needle to thread.\"",
      "Could Mr. Trump influence the Fed?",
      "Questions about Mr. Trump's ability to influence the Federal Reserve or shake up its leadership are intensifying amid the president's statements about his desire for lower interest rates. During his 2024 election campaign, Mr. Trump had insisted that as president he should have a \"say\" in the Fed's interest rate policies.",
      "\"I think that, in my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman,\" Mr. Trump said in August.",
      "For his part, Powell said last year that he would not resign\u00a0even if asked to do so by Mr. Trump, adding that under the law presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "However, Mr. Trump has recently fired several government officials in ways that critics say violate the law, such as his administration's firing of more than a dozen federal inspectors general on Friday. Federal law requires the White House to give Congress a full month of warning and case-specific details before firing a federal inspector general.",
      "Removing Powell wouldn't necessarily change the Fed's monetary policy decisions, given that rates are set by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Seven members are from the Fed's Board of Governors; four are assigned from the 11 Reserve Bank presidents, who each serve one-year terms on a rotating basis; and one FOMC member is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Interfering with the Fed could have consequences, both legally and for the stock market, experts said.",
      "\"Should any president attempt to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve without cause other than doing the job they were appointed and confirmed to do, I expect there to be swift legal challenges,\" noted Tim Stretton at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government watchdog. \"I suspect the market would also react negatively. Markets like stability, and this level of unprecedented interference in the Federal Reserve would be anything but stable.\"",
      "Asked what advice he would give Mr. Trump about dealing with the Fed, Columbia Business School's House said, \"Stop talking.\"",
      "He added, \"Let the Fed conduct its business consistent with its mandate, and it'll be more likely to get interest rates down.\"",

The agency provides humanitarian assistance abroad, particularly to countries recovering from disaster and trying to escape poverty. In fiscal year 2023, USAID managed more than $40 billion in appropriations, the Congressional Research Service said, a figure that is less than 1% of the federal budget.",

      "The move by DOGE, a Trump administration task force assigned to find ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and slash federal regulations, means it could have wide leeway to access important taxpayer data, among other things. Advocacy groups on Monday filed a lawsuit against the Treasury Department, calling the data sharing illegal.",
      "\"The scale of the intrusion into individuals' privacy is massive and unprecedented,\" said those in the\u00a0complaint filed by several plaintiffs including the Public Citizen Litigation Group, the Alliance for Retired Americans and the Service Employees International Union. \"People who must share information with the federal government should not be forced to share information with Elon Musk or his 'DOGE.'

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Monday paused his plans to implement steep tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for at least a month after talks with the leaders of both countries, who vowed to step up efforts to combat the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders with the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social\u00a0in the morning that he and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum \"agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one month period.\" The pause, he said, will allow \"negotiations headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent, and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, and high-level Representatives of Mexico.\"",
      "The president wrote that he had a \"very friendly conversation\" with Sheinbaum in which she \"agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States.\"",
      "\"These soldiers will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our Country,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "At the White House later in the day, Mr. Trump told reporters that the call \"went very well, in the sense that they're very strong now on the border.\"",
      "Sheinbaum unveiled the details of the deal in an earlier post on X, saying that the U.S. is \"committed to working to prevent the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico\" and that \"our teams will begin working today on two fronts: security and trade.\" She wrote in Spanish that Mexico \"will immediately reinforce the northern border with 10,000 members of the National Guard to prevent drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States, particularly fentanyl.\"",
      "In the afternoon, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a statement saying Mr. Trump is pausing tariffs on Canadian imports for at least 30 days, following a pair of phone calls between the two leaders. In return, Trudeau said Canada is implementing a $1.3 billion plan to protect the border. Mr. Trump soon confirmed the deal.",
      "\"I am very pleased with this initial outcome, and the Tariffs announced on Saturday will be paused for a 30 day period to see whether or not a final Economic deal with Canada can be structured,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"FAIRNESS FOR ALL!\"",
      "On Saturday, Mr. Trump signed orders\u00a0imposing a 25% tariff on imports\u00a0from Mexico and Canada, as well as a 10% levy on goods from China, beginning at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday. U.S. markets\u00a0tumbled in early trading\u00a0Monday morning amid fears that the tariffs could drive up prices for consumer goods. Mexico and Canada had both\u00a0said\u00a0they would issue retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports, raising fears of a trade war that could stifle economic activity between the U.S. and its neighbors.",
      "Before Mr. Trump announced the pause on Monday, Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House's National Economic Council, told CNBC that there were \"positive conversations that have happened over the weekend, and there are positive conversations that are going to happen between the leaders of these countries, you know, over the next hours.\"",

      "FBI supervisors across the country have received questionnaires to distribute to certain agents in their field offices containing questions about the agents' possible work on Jan 6. Capitol riot cases, according to two sources familiar with the matter.",
      "A source familiar with the matter told CBS News the questionnaires are being sent to more than 1,000 FBI agents and non-agent support personnel in field offices across the country, as well as FBI headquarters in Washington, D.C.",
      "The questions, obtained by CBS News, ask what role the respondent may have played in any cases, such as acting as an agent, providing management support or collecting online data. The survey also asks if the respondent made any arrests, conducted interviews, participated in search warrants, testified in court or appeared before a grand jury.",
      "The questionnaires are to be completed and submitted by supervisors by Tuesday afternoon.",
      "The questionnaire comes days after Washington, D.C.'s top prosecutor, Acting U.S. Attorney Edward Martin, was directed to fire prosecutors who were assigned to investigate the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, according to a memo obtained by CBS News. A separate memo from acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordered that all FBI agents who were assigned to the Jan. 6 insurrection cases undergo review.",
      "Bove on Friday ordered the acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll to compile a list of all current and former FBI employees who were assigned \"at any time\" to the Jan. 6 Capitol attack investigation for review \"to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary,\" according to a memo reviewed by CBS News.",
      "In a note to members regarding the questionnaire, the FBI Agents Association said,\u00a0\"We understand that this feels like agents and employees are being targeted, despite repeated assurances that 'all FBI employees will be protected against political retribution,'\" although it was not immediately clear who had provided such assurances. \"Employees carrying out their duties to investigate allegations of criminal activity with integrity and within the rule of law should never be treated as those who have engaged in actual misconduct,\" the note added.",
      "In a letter addressed to Bove, who previously served as a private defense attorney for Mr. Trump, attorneys representing some of the FBI employees have threatened legal action against the Justice Department over any forthcoming employment actions against FBI workers who followed \"procedures, norms and law\" in their investigations.",
      "The attorneys wrote that the termination of FBI employees over their involvement in investigating Jan. 6 rioters and President Trump's classified documents case, \"appear to be in violation of the due process rights of those to be unlawfully discharged.\"",
      "\"Moreover, if information about these individuals is made publicly available, it also threatens the safety of dedicated career public servants and potentially of their innocent family members. The continuation of this course of action is a direct assault on the national security of American citizens you have sworn to faithfully and unselfishly serve,\" the letter read.",
      "James Dennehy, assistant director in charge of the New York FBI office, said in a memo to 1,200 agents and support personnel on Friday, \"Today we find ourselves in the middle of a battle of our own as good people are being walked out of the FBI and others are being targeted because they did their jobs in accordance with the law and FBI policy.\"",
      "He noted that some may be contemplating resigning as part of the \"deferred resignation\" offers from the Trump administration.",
      "\"As part of what is being offered to you right now, my only ask of you is that you do the homework, gather all the information, and talk it through with your loved ones before you make an informed decision.\"",
      "He called Driscoll and acting FBI Deputy Director Robert Kissane \"total warriors\" and concluded the memo saying, \"I mourn the forced retirements of the [executive assistant directors] and fired field office heads, all of whom are extraordinary individuals who have dedicated decades of their lives to this joint just to be robbed of their title and profession but not their dignity.\"",

    "summary": "A group of nonprofits challenged the Trump administration's freeze on federal assistance.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Monday ordered the Trump administration to temporarily stop its freeze on federal assistance, allowing aid to continue flowing to nonprofit organizations and other entities after the funding was targeted by the White House budget office last week.",
      "U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan of the federal district court in Washington, D.C., formally granted the request from a coalition of nonprofits that had challenged the directive from the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB. She said the administration's actions \"run roughshod over a 'bulwark of the Constitution' by interfering with Congress's appropriation of funds.\"",
      "Issued nearly one week ago, the OMB memo directed all agencies to temporarily pause all federal assistance that may be implicated by certain executive orders issued by President Trump in his first days in office.",
      "While OMB acting Director Matthew Vaeth rescinded the memo after it led to widespread confusion as to which entities would be affected by the funding freeze, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the pause on federal assistance would remain in place and just the memo was being revoked.",
      "In a 30-page opinion granting the challengers' request to block the funding freeze, AliKhan wrote that a review of the programs that should or should not receive federal dollars \"could be conducted without depriving millions of Americans access to vital resources.\"",
      "She notes that the administration's memo potentially covered up to $3 trillion in financial assistance, a \"breathtakingly large sum of money to suspend practically overnight.\"",
      "\"Rather than taking a measured approach to identify purportedly wasteful spending, defendants cut the fuel supply to a vast, complicated, nationwide machine \u2014 seemingly without any consideration for the consequences of that decision,\" AliKhan, who was nominated for her current seat by former President Biden in 2023, wrote.",
      "The judge also cited Leavitt's statements, writing that \"OMB and the various agencies it communicates with appear committed to restricting federal funding.\"",
      "\"By rescinding the memorandum that announced the freeze, but 'NOT . . . the federal funding freeze; itself, it appears that OMB sought to overcome a judicially imposed obstacle without actually ceasing the challenged conduct. The court can think of few things more disingenuous,\" she wrote, quoting a social media post from the White House press secretary.",
      "The initial memo from Vaeth brought on legal challenges from the nonprofit groups in Washington and from 22 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia, which was filed in Rhode Island. The federal judge overseeing the states' case temporarily blocked the Trump administration from freezing federal assistance Friday after concluding that OMB's actions were likely unlawful.",
      "AliKhan's decision came just before an earlier order that temporarily halted the freeze and maintained the status quo was set to expire at 5 p.m. Monday. She held a hearing earlier in the day to consider the request from the nonprofits to issue a temporary restraining order and suggested then that she would grant their motion.",
      "AliKhan had warned that the harm to groups that receive federal assistance could be \"catastrophic.\"",
      "The White House budget office's directive targeting federal assistance is one of several measures taken by the new Trump administration that have upended the federal government. Mr. Trump has pledged to shrink the federal workforce and spending and tapped billionaire Elon Musk to oversee those efforts through the Department of Government Efficiency, which the president established on his first day back in the White House.",
      "Since then, the Trump administration paused new funding for nearly all foreign aid and has targeted the U.S. Agency for International Development for a potential reorganization.",
      "The moves from the Trump administration pausing the flow of federal assistance have left organizations in the U.S. and abroad reeling. Domestically, groups that provide meals to the elderly and school-aged children, universities and small businesses were left scrambling to determine whether they would lose access to funding that has already been approved by Congress. Overseas, humanitarian and development groups that receive assistance from the State Department or USAID were forced to furlough workers.",

    "summary": "Trump may have distanced himself from Project 2025 on the campaign trail, but many of his policies align with those included in the initiative's policy guide.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 As Project 2025 became a major talking point for Democrats in making the case for why voters should deny President Trump a second term in the White House last year, Mr. Trump repeatedly distanced himself from the initiative spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, saying during the campaign that he had \"nothing to do with Project 2025,\" had not read it and didn't intend to read it.",
      "But as Mr. Trump has begun implementing aspects of his second-term agenda through a flurry of executive orders and directives, many of the plans he has rolled out so far closely align with those detailed in Project 2025's playbook, which lays out ways to overhaul the executive branch.",
      "Overseen by the Heritage Foundation, Project 2025 was a multi-pronged initiative that was designed to provide a roadmap for the next Republican president, now Mr. Trump. On the campaign trail, the president called some of the proposals detailed in its more than 900-page book \"abysmal\" and said he knew nothing about it.",
      "But the authors of some of the policy book's chapters served in the first administration and will be serving in his second. Russ Vought, Mr. Trump's pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget, is expected to be confirmed by the Senate soon, and John Ratcliffe is in place as CIA director.",
      "Paul Dans, who served as the director of Project 2025 but left his post in July, said of Mr. Trump's actions so far that they were a testament not only to the initiative's efforts, but also the readiness of the conservative movement in preparing for the next administration.",
      "\"They're home runs,\" he said of the president's plans. \"They are in many cases more than we could have even dared hope for.\"",
      "Some of Mr. Trump's actions taken in his first days in office reinstate measures he put in place during his first term that were revoked by President Biden. But in other instances, Mr. Trump's executive actions echo the policies outlined in the pages of Project 2025's policy blueprint.",
      "Redirecting federal aid under FEMA to the states",
      "After trips to western North Carolina and Southern California last week, Mr. Trump established a review council to advise him on the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, \"to capably and impartially address disasters occurring within the United States.\" The council will also advise the president on recommended changes related to FEMA, his order states.",
      "Western North Carolina was devastated by Hurricane Helene last fall, and parts of Southern California were destroyed by deadly wildfires that hit the area earlier this month.",
      "Mr. Trump's action comes after he suggested that he could \"get rid\" of FEMA and leave disaster response management to the states.",
      "\"That's what states are for, to take care of problems,\" he said last week.",
      "Project 2025's sweeping book of policy proposals calls for \"reforming FEMA emergency spending to shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities instead of the federal government.\"",
      "It also urges Congress to change the cost-sharing arrangement so the federal government covers 25% of the costs for small disasters and up to 75% for \"truly catastrophic disasters.\" Currently, for Public Assistance, which provides financial and direct assistance to state and local governments for disaster response and recovery work, FEMA covers a minimum of 75% of costs, and the president can increase the federal cost-share at his discretion, according to a 2023 report from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "The recommendation follows a warning from Project 2025's authors that FEMA is \"overtasked, overcompensates for the lack of state and local preparedness and response, and is regularly in deep debt.\" Additionally, it states that since passage of the Stafford Act in 1988, which gave the president powers to \"alleviate the suffering and damage\" caused by disasters, the number of declared federal disasters has risen drastically as costs were shifted from state and local governments to the federal government.",
      "Project 2025's book also calls on Congress to end preparedness grants for states and localities.",
      "\"DHS should not be in the business of handing out federal tax dollars: These grants should be terminated,\" it states.",
      "Ending diversity, equity and inclusion practices",
      "The president frequently rails against diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, practices, and he signed an executive order on the day he returned to the White House ending all DEI programs within the federal government.",
      "Mr. Trump claimed in his order that DEI policies can violate federal civil rights laws and shut out Americans \"who deserve a shot at the American dream\" because of their race or sex.",
      "Project 2025's policy book calls for the next conservative president to delete a variety of terms, including DEI, abortion and gender equality \"from every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists.\"",
      "It also calls for the \"DEI apparatus\" at a variety of agencies to be dismantled.",
      "Targeting PBS and National Public Radio",
      "Brendan Carr, head of the Federal Communications Commission, informed the heads of National Public Radio and PBS in a letter Thursday that the agency had opened an investigation into the airing of their programming across their roughly 1,500 broadcast member stations, according to the New York Times.",
      "Those stations are licensed by the FCC to operate, but are limited to operating as noncommercial educational broadcast stations. These stations, or NCEs, are exempt from licensing fees and operate on a specific \"reserved\" frequency band. Federal law prohibits these noncommercial educational broadcast stations from commercial advertisements.",
      "In his letter, Carr wrote that he is \"concerned that NPR and PBS broadcasts could be violating federal law by airing commercials. In particular, it is possible that NPR and PBS member stations are broadcasting underwriting announcements that cross the line into prohibited commercial advertisements.\"",
      "Carr also said that he also does not see a reason for Congress to continue approving federal dollars for NPR and PBS \"given the changes in the media marketplace.\"",
      "Carr authored the section of Project 2025's policy book that deals with the FCC, but another portion of the blueprint urges Congress to defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides grants to NPR and PBS.",
      "According to Project 2025, \"stripping public funding would, of course, mean that NPR, PBS, Pacifica Radio, and the other leftist broadcasters would be shorn of the presumption that they act in the public interest and receive the privileges that often accompany so acting.\" The outlets should therefore no longer be qualified as noncommercial educational broadcast stations, according to the book.",
      "\"NPR and PBS stations are in reality no longer noncommercial, as they run ads in everything but name for their sponsors,\" the blueprint states. \"They are also noneducational. The next president should instruct the FCC to exclude the stations affiliated with PBS and NPR from the NCE denomination and the privileges that come with it.\"",
      "Whether Carr ultimately decides to take that step as a result of his investigation remains to be seen.",
      "Freezing federal assistance",
      "One of Mr. Trump's first actions as president was to establish the Department of Government Efficiency, an entity that is housed within the executive branch and run by billionaire Elon Musk. The body aims to cut regulations and spending and restructure federal agencies.",
      "On the heels of that move, the White House's Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, issued a two-page memo late Monday that ordered a freeze on grant, loan or federal assistance programs implicated by Mr. Trump's executive orders, which would allow his administration \"time to review agency programs and determine the best uses of the funding for those programs consistent with the law and the president's priorities.\"",
      "\"The use of federal resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve,\" OMB acting Director Matthew Vaeth said in the memo.",
      "The memo sparked widespread confusion and prompted concerns about whether programs providing meals for the elderly, pre-school funding for low-income children and medical research would be impacted by the order.",
      "On Wednesday, the White House said it was rescinding the memo but maintaining the funding pause \"to end any confusion\" created by a federal court order temporarily pausing implementation of the freeze.",
      "Mr. Trump's pick for director of OMB, Russ Vought, authored the section of Project 2025's policy book covering the Executive Office of the President, which includes the agency he has been tapped to lead.",
      "In it, he likens the budget office to an air-traffic control system for the president \"with the ability and charge to ensure that all policy initiatives are flying in sync and with the authority to let planes take off and, at times, ground planes that are flying off course.\"",
      "The memo may be aimed at sparking a legal challenge to the Impoundment Control Act, a 1974 law that limits the president's ability to unilaterally freeze certain funds appropriated by Congress, and in most cases requires the president instead to ask Congress to rescind spending legislation",
      "Vought said during his confirmation hearing last week that Mr. Trump believes the law is unconstitutional, and he agrees with that assessment.",
      "In Project 2025's policy blueprint, Vought also wrote the director of OMB must have \"sufficient visibility into the deep caverns of agency decision-making,\" and can achieve this by ensuring political appointees on his staff sign off on apportionments of funding authorized by Congress.",
      "Vought cited a 1870 law known as the Anti-Deficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending federal dollars in advance and requires funding be doled out in installments.",
      "\"This process, whereby agencies come to OMB for allotments of appropriated funding, is essential to the effective financial stewardship of taxpayer dollars,\" he wrote. \"OMB can then direct on behalf of a president the amount, duration, and purpose of any apportioned funding to ensure against waste, fraud, and abuse and ensure consistency with the president's agenda and applicable laws.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's pick to lead OMB has advocated for the White House to take aggressive steps to cut federal spending. He wrote the director should not be afraid to wield apportionments \"on behalf of the president's agenda\" and be willing to \"defend the power against attacks from Congress.\"",
      "During Vought's first stint as OMB director, the agency withheld roughly $214 million in security assistance to Ukraine. The Government Accountability Office later found the budget office had violated the Impoundment Control Act when it withheld the aid, and the House launched impeachment proceedings that accused the president of conditioning the assistance to Ukraine on its president announcing investigations that would benefit him politically.",
      "Mr. Trump was impeached by the House but acquitted by the Senate.",
      "Restricting gender-affirming care for minors",
      "Mr. Trump issued an executive order on Tuesday that bars the use of federal funds for gender-affirming care \u2014 puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical procedures \u2014 for people under the age of 19.",
      "Called \"Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,\" the order directs certain executive agencies to take steps to ensure medical institutions that receive federal grants \"end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\"",
      "It also instructs the secretary of defense to take regulatory action to exclude gender-affirming care for minors from insurance coverage provided by TRICARE, the Defense Department's health care program, and federal employee health benefit programs.",
      "Mr. Trump's order directs the head of the Department of Health and Human Services to withdraw March 2022 guidance on gender-affirming care.",
      "Project 2025's chapter on the Department of Health and Human Services calls for its Office of Civil Rights to \"remove all guidance issued under the Biden administration concerning sexual orientation and gender identity,\" including the March 2022 document.",
      "The book generally criticizes gender-affirming care as causing \"irreversible physical and mental harm to those who receive them\" and argues there is a lack of evidence surrounding it.",
      "Revoking security clearances for the former intelligence officials who signed a letter on Hunter Biden's laptop",
      "Mr. Trump took executive action to start the process of revoking the security clearances of dozens of former intelligence officials who signed a letter in 2020 claiming emails found on a laptop owned by Hunter Biden bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign.",
      "Project 2025 also proposed stripping former intelligence officials of security clearances, in a section on the intelligence community authored by Dustin Carmack, who worked at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "\"The president should immediately revoke the security clearances of any former directors, deputy directors, or other senior intelligence officials who discuss their work in the press or on social media without prior clearance from the current director,\" he wrote.",
      "Stripping civil servants of employment protections",
      "Among the slew of actions Mr. Trump took on his first day back in the White House was to reinstate an executive order issued during his first term that created \"Schedule F in the Excepted Service.\" The order creates a new employment category for many career civil servants, effectively stripping them of employment protections.",
      "The order states that in recent years, \"there have been numerous and well-documented cases of career federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership.\"",
      "\"Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service, beginning with positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character,\" Mr. Trump's order reads.",
      "The order makes some minor changes to the president's prior measure from October 2020. But it notably adds a section that states that while employees in these new \"Schedule Policy/Career Positions,\" are not required to personally or politically support the current president or his policies, they are \"required to faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability, consistent with their constitutional oath and the vesting of executive authority solely in the president.\"",
      "Failure to do so is grounds for termination of employment, Mr. Trump's executive order states.",
      "Project 2025 repeatedly calls for Mr. Trump's Schedule F proposal to be reinstated.",
      "Reinstating service members who refused COVID-19 Vaccines",
      "The president earlier this week issued an order directing the secretaries of Defense or Homeland Security to reinstate all service members, both active-duty and reserve, who were discharged after refusing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. His order also states they should be reverted to their former rank and receive full back pay, benefits, bonus payments or compensation.",
      "The Project 2025 blueprint's section on the Defense Department, authored by Chris Miller, calls for the next administration to \"reinstate servicemembers to active duty who were discharged for not receiving the COVID vaccine, restore their appropriate rank, and provide back pay.\"",
      "Miller served as acting defense secretary in the final weeks of Mr. Trump's first term. His chief of staff, Kash Patel, has been tapped by the president to lead the FBI.",
      "Transgender military ban",
      "During his first four years in the White House, Mr. Trump prohibited transgender people from serving in the military. President Biden repealed that ban, but the president earlier this week issued an order that effectively bars transgender people from serving in the armed forces and withdraws his predecessor's order.",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order states that \"expressing a false 'gender identity' divergent from an individual's sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\"",
      "Identifying as transgender, it continues, \"conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life.\"",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States Government to establish high standards for troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity. This policy is inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria,\" the president's order states. \"This policy is also inconsistent with shifting pronoun usage or use of pronouns that inaccurately reflect an individual's sex.\"",
      "Project 2025 calls for a reversal of policies \"that allow transgender individuals to serve in the military. Gender dysphoria is incompatible with the demands of military service.\"",
      "A hiring freeze",
      "On his first day in the White House, Mr. Trump issued a memorandum freezing hiring of federal civilian employees. Positions that were vacant as of his inauguration at noon on Jan. 20 should also not be filled, he said.",
      "The order was part of his plans to reduce the size of the federal workforce, also a recommendation made in the Project 2025 policy roadmap.",
      "The book, though, warns that while \"reducing the number of federal employees seems an obvious way to reduce the overall expense of the civil service,\" prior attempts to do by presidents of both parties \"did not lead to permanent and substantive reductions in the number of nondefense federal employees.\"",
      "Instead, Project 2025 suggests a \"freeze on all top career-position hiring to prevent 'burrowing-in' by outgoing political appointees.\"",
      "Withdrawing from World Health Organization",
      "Mr. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the World Health Organization in 2020 due to what his first administration said was a mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Biden reversed that decision when he took office, and Mr. Trump rolled back that move on his first day back in the White House.",
      "His latest order directed the secretary of state to inform the secretary-general of the United States and World Health Organization leadership of the U.S. decision to withdraw from the group.",
      "Project 2025, too, criticized the World Health Organization of its handling of the pandemic.",
      "\"The manifest failure and corruption of the World Health Organization (WHO) during the COVID-19 pandemic is an example of the danger that international organizations pose to U.S. citizens and interests,\" its book states.",
      "It said that when institutions act contrary to U.S. interests, the government \"must be prepared to take appropriate steps in response, up to and including withdrawal.\"",
      "Sending active-duty troops to the southern border",
      "Immigration was the topic of several executive actions taken by Mr. Trump on the first day of his presidency, including one order that assigns troops \"the mission to seal the borders and maintain the sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of the United States.\"",
      "The chapter of Project 2025's blueprint that covers the Department of Homeland Security was authored by Ken Cuccinelli, who served in the first Trump administration, and it, too, sees a role for the Defense Department in securing the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "The Pentagon, Cucinelli writes, should \"explicitly acknowledge and adjust personnel and priorities to participate actively in the defense, including using military personnel and hardware to prevent illegal crossings between ports of entry and channel all cross-border traffic to legal ports of entry.\"",
      "A section on the Justice Department urges the next administration to \"take a creative and aggressive approach\" to tackling criminal organizations at the southern border.",
      "\"This could include use of active-duty military personnel and National Guardsmen to assist in arrest operations along the border \u2014 something that has not yet been done,\" Project 2025's chapter on the Justice Department states.",
      "Limiting refugee admissions",
      "As of Monday, entry into the U.S. by refugees under the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program was suspended in accordance with an order by Mr. Trump on Jan. 20.",
      "His directive also orders the secretary of Homeland Security to suspend decisions on applications for refugee status.",
      "Mr. Trump has claimed that during the Biden administration, the U.S. has been \"inundated\" with high levels of migration, including through the Refugee Admissions Program.",
      "Project 2025, too, blames the Biden administration for overseeing what it says was a \"collapse\" of U.S. border security and immigration enforcement.",
      "To address this \"crisis,\" Project 2025 calls for \"rightsizing refugee admissions.\"",
      "\"The federal government's obligation to shift national security\u2013essential screening and vetting resources to the forged border crisis will necessitate an indefinite curtailment of the number of USRAP refugee admissions,\" its chapter on the State Department reads.",

      "The Trump administration's targeting of USAID comes as the president has vowed to cut the size of the federal government and tasked Musk with leading the effort to do so through his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has notified Congress that he is eyeing a potential reorganization, which could include merging it with the State Department.",
      "But critics of Mr. Trump's actions warn that the sweeping moves, which come just two weeks after he returned to office, threaten to put the nation at risk and undermine its credibility around the world. Lawmakers have also warned that any attempt to change the structure of USAID, an independent agency, would require action by Congress.",
      "\"If the United States is going to prevail in great power competition, we cannot afford to take a timeout from USAID programs that have long served to advance U.S. foreign policy goals,\" the top Democrats on the House and Senate Foreign Affairs Committees said in a letter last week to Jason Gray, who was then serving as acting USAID administrator. \"America needs to be active, and we must lead through our example.\"",
      "What is USAID?",
      "The U.S. Agency for International Development is the federal government's lead agency for international and development assistance. Established in 1961 when President John F.

      "The aid the organization provides is aimed at furthering numerous goals, including strengthening democracy, protecting human rights, improving global health and advancing food security, the page said.",
      "USAID has more than 10,000 people in its workforce, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, and most of those employees \u2014 roughly two-thirds \u2014 are serving overseas. The agency has more than 60 country and regional missions.",
      "The agency is funded by taxpayer dollars authorized by Congress and reports to the secretary of state.",
      "According to an archived version of its website, USAID money has been used to provide nearly 9,000 ventilators to 43 countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, fund more than 150 local organizations to implement interventions for HIV and to launch the Countering Chinese Influence Fund. USAID said the fund will invest $300 million in programs to advance national security goals across several areas \"to build more resilient partners that are able to withstand pressure from the [Chinese Community Party] and other malign actors.\"",
      "USAID was created at the height of the Cold War as part of a recognition by Kennedy and his successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, of humanitarian aid as a form of diplomacy. With the agency outlasting the Cold War and new threats to U.S. interests emerging, Democrats in Congress have warned that Mr. Trump's gutting of USAID threatens the nation's ability to compete with China and Russia.",
      "What is the USAID budget?",
      "In fiscal year 2023, USAID managed more than $40 billion in appropriations, the Congressional Research Service said, a figure that is less than 1% of the federal budget.",
      "Most of that funding went to governance programs, followed by the humanitarian and health sectors, according to the report. The countries that received the most money in fiscal year 2023 were Ukraine, Ethiopia and Jordan.",
      "While the health sector received the most funding in the early 1990s, humanitarian assistance became the highest-funded area in fiscal year 2022 because of increases in aid following \"natural and human-induced humanitarian crises,\" according to the Congressional Research Service. Governance took the top spot for fiscal year 2023, though, because of U.S. support for Ukraine's government amid the country's war with Russia.",
      "The money approved for USAID by Congress is spent through the agency's \"implementing partners,\" which include private contractors, nonprofit organizations, foreign governments and international groups.",
      "What is going on with USAID now?",
      "The agency has come under significant scrutiny by Musk and DOGE, which Mr. Trump has tasked with shrinking the size of the federal government.",
      "Musk has repeatedly criticized USAID on X, the social media platform he owns, calling it a \"criminal organization\" that should \"die.\" He said early Monday that he had spoken with Mr. Trump about USAID and claimed the president agrees \"we should shut it down.\"",
      "\"USAID is a ball of worms. There is no apple and when there is no apple, you've just got to basically get rid of the whole thing,\" Musk said, adding the agency is \"beyond repair.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, meanwhile, told reporters Saturday that the agency has \"been run by a bunch of radical lunatics.\"",
      "There has been a flurry of activity targeting USAID and its employees over the past few days. Roughly 60 senior staff were placed on administrative leave last week and hundreds of contractors had their employment furloughed or terminated, sources told CBS News.",
      "Then, on Saturday, USAID's website went dark, and two top security officials with the humanitarian aid agency were placed on administrative leave after they refused to let personnel from DOGE access classified information in restricted areas, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Katie Miller, who works for DOGE, said on X that \"no classified material was accessed without proper security clearances.\"",
      "Matt Hopson, who was tapped by Mr. Trump to serve as USAID chief of staff, resigned Sunday, two staffers told CBS News. Agency staff were told USAID's headquarters in Washington, D.C., would be closed to them Monday, according to a notice they received.",
      "The turmoil at USAID is set against the backdrop of the Trump administration's 90-day freeze on foreign assistance, which has roiled programs worldwide and forced layoffs and furloughs. The order directed all U.S. diplomatic and consular posts to immediately issue \"stop-work\" orders for existing foreign assistance awards, pending review by the secretary.",
      "But the secretary of state later issued a waiver that applies to \"life-saving humanitarian assistance,\" defined as \"life-saving medicine, medical services, food, shelter, and subsistence assistance, as well as supplies and reasonable administrative costs as necessary to deliver such assistance.\"",
      "What will happen to USAID?",
      "House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast, a Republican from Florida, told \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that USAID would likely be \"rolled more closely\" under Rubio. He lamented that a fraction of what the agency spends goes to aid.",
      "\"I would be absolutely for, if that's the path we go down, removing USAID as a separate department\" and moving parts of it to the State Department, Mast said.",
      "A day later, three U.S. officials told CBS News that USAID would remain a humanitarian aid entity, but would be merged into the State Department with cuts to its funding and workforce. The Trump administration is expected to announce the changes in the coming days. Rubio has been named acting administrator of USAID, and he told Congress in a letter obtained by CBS News that he authorized Peter Marocco, director of Foreign Assistance at the State Department, to perform the duties of deputy administrator.",
      "The State Department said in a statement that Rubio has \"notified Congress that a review of USAID's foreign assistance activities is underway with an eye towards potential reorganization.\"",
      "Dr. Atul Gawande, former USAID Global Health Director, told Fox News the move to target the agency is \"dangerous for the United States and humanity.\"",
      "\"These are people shutting down an agency and having no clue the work that is being done. I'm a surgeon. I led Global Health at USAID, and I can tell you, this is where these are programs touching hundreds of millions of people around the world on a budget that's half the budget of the hospital where I do surgery,\" Gawande said.",
      "In a series of posts on X, Gawande said a pause on foreign assistance \"does serious damage to the world and the US.\" He also posted a list of examples on how this can impact global health, including stopping work on a deadly Marburg outbreak in Tanzania, a wide outbreak of a mpox variant killing children in west Africa and stopping critical work to eradicate polio.",
      "Some impacts hit even closer to home, as this also \"stops monitoring of bird flu in 49 countries, a disease which already killed an American on home soil,\" he wrote.",
      "\"Make no mistake \u2014 these essential, lifesaving activities are being halted right now. Consequences aren't in some distant future. They are immediate,\" he concluded his thread.",
      "The Trump administration will not be the first to attempt to oversee a reorganization of USAID. A similar effort was made by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright during the Clinton administration under a two-year plan that would keep USAID as a separate agency but bring it under the secretary of state's direct authority.",
      "In 1998, Congress passed the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, which established USAID as an independent agency and clarified that its administrator \"shall report to and be under the direct authority and foreign policy guidance of the secretary of state.\"",
      "By the end of Bill Clinton's presidency, USAID's workforce had dropped from 11,500 employees to less than 8,000, and the number of countries with agency programs was cut from 120 to 70, according to the book \"State vs Defense: The Battle to Define America's Empire\" by journalist Stephen Glain.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The American Civil Liberties Union on Monday filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging President Trump's move to close down the American asylum system, saying it violates legal obligations the U.S. has to offer refuge to migrants fleeing persecution.",
      "The lawsuit marks the first legal challenge against an executive action taken by Mr. Trump on his first day back at the White House that has allowed U.S. border officials to summarily deport migrants, without allowing them to request asylum.",
      "In that order, Mr. Trump invoked a muscular presidential power that allows officials to bar the entry of foreigners whose entry is determined to be \"detrimental\" to the U.S. He justified the sweeping move by accusing migrants of staging an \"invasion\" of the U.S. and posing a risk to the country's national security, public safety and public health.",
      "It's one of a flurry of actions the president has taken to launch his long-promised immigration crackdown. They include instructing the American military to aid in border enforcement, directing deportation officers to ramp up immigration arrests across the U.S. and suspending legal migration channels for foreigners, including Ukrainians and others from countries in turmoil.",
      "Though other American presidents, including former President Joe Biden, have sharply restricted asylum to try to curb illegal crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border, Mr. Trump's order is unprecedented, in its scope and legal rationale.",
      "By concluding that the country is facing an \"invasion\" of migrants, Mr. Trump effectively paused U.S. asylum law, which has required American immigration officials to at least interview people who say they fear being persecuted if deported.",
      "In its lawsuit, the ACLU asked the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to block officials from enforcing Mr. Trump's decree, which the civil rights organization said seeks to \"unilaterally override the protections Congress has afforded those fleeing danger.\"",
      "\"This proclamation is an unprecedented attempt to eliminate the entire asylum system created by Congress to protect desperate people fleeing grave persecution,\" said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney overseeing Monday's lawsuit.",
      "Following record levels of illegal crossings at the southern border during his first years in office, Biden enacted his own asylum crackdown in June 2024, invoking the same authority known as 212(f) that Mr. Trump is currently citing to shut down asylum processing.",
      "While it was also challenged by the ACLU, Biden's order was not as far-reaching as Trump's asylum ban and it contained some exemptions, including for migrants who were able to get an appointment through a government phone app to enter the U.S. at a legal border entry point. That app was shut down immediately after Mr. Trump took office.",
      "Biden's asylum restriction also allowed asylum officers to interview migrants who said they were scared of being harmed if deported from the U.S.",
      "While Mr. Trump has continued to describe the southern border as in \"crisis\" and facing an \"invasion,\" illegal crossings there have been at the lowest level in years. They first began to drop sharply early last year after Mexico increased efforts to interdict migrants and fell further following Biden's move to limit asylum.",
      "In January, which included over two weeks under Biden, Border Patrol recorded nearly 30,000 apprehensions of migrants crossing the southern border illegally, the lowest level since May 2020, a year that saw a dramatic reduction in migration due to COVID-era travel restrictions, according to unpublished government data obtained by CBS News.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Monday took the first steps toward his administration creating a government-owned investment fund, tasking the heads of the Treasury Department and Commerce Department with beginning the process to create an American sovereign wealth fund.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order that charges Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Howard Lutnick, Mr. Trump's nominee to lead the Commerce Department, with beginning a process \"that will hopefully result in the creation of an American sovereign wealth fund,\" announced Will Scharf, Mr. Trump's staff secretary.",
      "\"We're going to create a lot of wealth for the fund, and I think it's about time this country had a sovereign wealth fund,\" the president told reporters in the Oval Office Monday, calling the news \"very exciting.\"",
      "The president said the U.S. may somehow put TikTok in the sovereign wealth fund. A law that took effect in January was meant to ban the app in the U.S. unless its Chinese parent company sold it, but Mr. Trump has delayed enforcement of the law, keeping it alive for now.",
      "Bessent said the creation of the fund will \"monetize the asset side of the U.S. balance sheet for the American people.\" He said the sovereign wealth fund will be up and running within 12 months, putting U.S. assets to work for Americans. The treasury secretary said the Trump administration will study best practices around the world to develop the fund.",
      "Sovereign wealth funds generally use a nation's reserves and invest the funds to generate returns, which can be used to address deficits, pay down debts or bolster savings. It's unclear what types of safeguards would be placed around a U.S.-owned investment fund to ensure it has transparent reporting obligations and that the investments aren't benefiting political allies.",
      "Other countries that have a sovereign wealth fund include China, Singapore, New Zealand, Norway and Saudi Arabia, among others.",
      "Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the Government Pension Fund of Norway, is the largest in the world, with assets valued at $1.7 trillion, a substantial figure for a country of 5.5 million people. The Norwegian government is only permitted to spend a small part of the fund each year, but the total amounts to nearly 20% of its annual budget.",

    "story": [
      "Following the deadly wildfires in Los Angeles in January, President Trump ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to release billions of gallons of water from two reservoirs in California's Central Valley, more than 100 miles away from the fire zones.",
      "Mr. Trump had claimed that California withheld water supplies that could have made a difference in fighting the flames. California Gov. Gavin Newsom and other officials disputed those claims.",
      "Now, the water released from dams at Lake Kaweah and Lake Success is rushing into a dry lakebed in the Central Valley, where experts say it can't flow to Southern California and will likely go to waste.",
      "\"There is absolutely no connection between this water and the water needed for firefighting in L.A.,\" said Peter Gleick, a climate and hydrology expert. \"There's no physical connection. There's no way to move the water from where it is to the Los Angeles basin.\"",
      "Gleick, who co-founded the Pacific Institute, a research center in Oakland, says the move ignores the reality of water management in California.",
      "\"The farmers in the basin own the water and that water is stored in these dams in the winter, during the rainy season, so that farmers can use it in the very hot, long, dry summer season,\" he explained.",
      "From the perspective of the farmers, he said, the water is \"assumed to be lost.\"",
      "California Sen. Adam Schiff, a Democrat, said the release of the water also presented a risk of flooding.",
      "\"I think even the water managers got only a short bit of notice to say, 'Please don't. You can't do that. That's way too much water,'\" he said. \"And frankly, had they not talked the Army Corps off the ledge, there would've been serious flooding. It would have been an even bigger problem.\"",
      "Schiff criticized Mr. Trump's order as \"stupid and ridiculous and dangerous and wasteful.\"",

      "Matt Hopson, who was recently appointed USAID chief of staff by Mr. Trump, resigned Sunday, according to two current USAID staffers. There was no mass email about it. The staffers said it happened after his involvement, alongside the two other security staffers, in blocking DOGE officials from getting access over the weekend.",
      "Vice President JD Vance is in charge of figuring out next steps for USAID reform, per one person familiar with Trump's decision. A spokesperson for Vance declined to comment.",

      "Republican Rep. Brian Mast, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which provides oversight of the State Department, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that USAID is \"likely going to be rolled more closely under Secretary Rubio.\" USAID already reports to the Secretary of State but the Trump administration is looking at ways to combine it or fold it into the State Department.",
      "On Monday, USAID employees were instructed to stay out of headquarters, and staffers who came by the agency's annex to get their belongings found that turnstiles had been turned off and they were escorted from the building.",
      "Mast did not detail what specific changes will be made but indicated that he intends to initiate changes via Congress as well. USAID was established in 1961 by an act of Congress.",
      "\"I would be absolutely for, if that's the path we go down, removing USAID as a separate department, and having it fall under whether the other parts of the United States, Department of State, because of its failure,\" Mast claimed on \"Face the Nation.\"",
      "CBS previously reported that the person heading up the efforts to reshape USAID is Pete Marocco, a former deputy assistant secretary of African Affairs at the Pentagon. Marocco is now serving in a senior directing role in the State Department's Foreign Assistance Office, which oversees foreign assistance programs administered by the State Department and USAID.",
      "Freezing foreign aid was a Trump campaign promise to only support efforts that serve America's national security interest and to cut costs. However, foreign aid makes up just 1% of the federal budget.",
      "U.S. foreign aid agencies almost never directly implement aid programs, choosing to partner with non-governmental organizations, public international organizations, and sometimes foreign governments to carry them out. The Trump administration's 90-day freeze on almost all foreign aid means that these contractors are not being paid for work already in progress.",
      "With no indication that the aid freeze will be lifted soon, contractors are furloughing and/or terminating employees en masse.",

      "Some top officials in the Trump administration view USAID, created by President John F. Kennedy to counter Cold War geopolitics, as an agency that has become overly influenced by left-wing and \"woke\" politics. They had privately voiced concerns that it hasn't had enough oversight, including from Congress.",
      "Some in the administration, including Musk, have argued that Trump should shut USAID down altogether. On Sunday, Musk posted on his social media platform X: \"USAID is a criminal organization. Time for it to die.\"",

      "USAID website goes dark, multiple aid agencies say they are hobbled by funding freeze",
      "The USAID website went offline on Saturday, and remained inaccessible on Sunday. Dozens of employees in the legislative and public affairs offices at the agency suddenly lost system and email access on Saturday night, three sources told CBS News.",
      "Trump officials want to look into ways to streamline programs with a footprint in more than one government agency. USAID also contracts with multiple non-profits to implement programs.",
      "As the Trump administration weighs restructuring USAID, the humanitarian aid program that does everything from funding polio and malaria eradication efforts overseas to emergency response to natural disasters, and removing old U.S. bombs from battlefields, aid organizations told CBS News that they are already preparing to lay off thousands of U.S. based aid workers this week.",
      "Multiple aid organizations told CBS News that they are hobbled by Trump's funding freeze as contractors front money for projects and then apply for reimbursement from the U.S. government. As a result, the stop work order issued by Secretary of State Marco Rubio triggered financial crises at these international organizations who are also unable to receive backpay for work already performed, multiple aid organizations told CBS news.",
      "Tom Hart, President and CEO of InterAction told CBS News that even after Rubio issued waivers to some organizations, the changes have not resulted in a flow of funds.",
      "\"The current reality is life-saving medications expiring on shelves while children fall ill. Food aid rotting in warehouses while families go hungry. This isn't just a humanitarian catastrophe\u2014it's an unconscionable waste of taxpayer resources that undermines America's investments in global stability and human dignity.\"",

In El Salvador, the Skills for Employment project helps some 12,000 Salvadorans get jobs so they don't migrate to the U.S. In Honduras, Effective Justice combats organizedf crime networks. In Colombia, the Venezuelan response ensures migrants do not migrate illegally to the U.S.",
      "Concerns over PEPFAR",
      "Another program, PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, received a waiver to resume specific types of operations within their broad portfolio of AIDS relief and HIV services, three sources confirmed this weekend to CBS News. Health officials indicated\u00a0 that they are still waiting to see how narrowly the services will be defined including the question of whether it will include preventative treatments. Former aid officials shared concerns that global health programs are not yet turned back on, including those aimed at preventing malaria and tuberculosis.",
      "\"This is not a pause, it is a demolition,\" Atul Gawande, former USAID Global Health Director, told CBS News. \"You cannot pause a flight in midair, that's what they're trying to do.\"",
      "The Trump administration has stipulated the review is to last 90 days but the stop work order from Rubio immediately ceased operations for many organizations. Since the freeze is taking place while the review is being conducted, it has caused an immediate disruption with real world impact such as disruption of anti-viral medication to HIV positive individuals, including children.",
      "\"There was a release of that hold that was put, that was authorized, but it shouldn't be the case that the American people fund HIV and AIDS drugs for 20 million people across Africa, where many of these countries are working very directly with our adversaries, like China,\" Mast told \"Face the Nation,\" confirming portions of PEPFAR had resumed. But he referred to it as a \"grift\" and raised questions about its fate.",
      "\"That is an example of them taking us for granted,\" Mast said. \"We need to be asking the question, should they be weaning off of this, should we be paying for these very expensive HIV and AIDS drugs?\"",
      "But these efforts have been deemed in U.S. national security interests by multiple presidents, and a type of \"soft power\" that wins goodwill for the U.S. in the competition for influence against adversaries. It is now China, but during the Cold War when the established the prime competition was the Soviet Union, USAID efforts were effective in Eastern Europe and elsewhere.",
      "CBS News reported last week\u00a0that roughly 450 contractors were terminated from the Bureau for Global Health, which is responsible for overseeing the implementation of PEPFAR. More federal employees in the Global Health bureau have since been placed on administrative leave, raising concerns about how these programs will be implemented, despite the foreign assistance waiver for HIV/AIDS programs.",

Many booed the U.S. national anthem in an uncharacteristic show of frustration after more than 150 years of peaceful, friendly relations along the vast border separating the neighbors.",
      "The reaction was representative of hurt feelings both north and south of the U.S. mainland's borders on Monday. Top officials in Canada and Mexico, which both faced 25% tariffs\u00a0with the stroke of Mr. Trump's pen on Saturday, were expected to hold conversations with the White House on the way forward in a new trade war that Mr. Trump had threatened for months. Both countries vowed to respond with their own trade measures.",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum announced in a brief statement Monday on social media that, after a phone call with Mr. Trump, the tariffs imposed on her country were \"on pause for one month from now.\" She said Mr. Trump had agreed to put the measures on hold after she committed to reinforcing Mexico's border with the U.S. \"with 10,000 members of the National Guard to prevent drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States.\"",
      "Mr. Trump confirmed the pause in his own social media post, saying the newly deployed Mexican forces \"will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our Country.\"",
      "Sheinbaum said Mr. Trump had \"committed to working to prevent the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico.\"",
      "China was also hit by a new raft of tariffs and has warned that it, too, will respond in kind. America's major allies and trade partners in Europe, meanwhile, have been warned by Mr. Trump that the European Union is next on his list, while the United Kingdom appears to have a chance to negotiate a trade deal, but will find itself torn between its next-door neighbors and its storied \"special relationship\" with the U.S. if it hopes to dodge the same fate.",
      "Canada is the biggest export market for products coming from 36 U.S. states, according to the Reuters news agency, while Mexico is broadly considered the U.S.' largest trading partner overall.",

      "Canada:",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government had no choice but to strike back with 25% tariffs of its own on more than $150 billion worth of U.S.-made imports.",
      "\"First, I want to speak directly to Americans, our closest friends and neighbors,\" said Trudeau. \"This is a choice that, yes, will harm Canadians, but beyond that, it will have real consequences for you, the American people.\"",
      "\"Like the American tariffs, our response will also be far reaching and include everyday items such as American beer, wine and bourbon. Fruits and fruit juices including orange juice, along with vegetables, perfume, clothing and shoes. It will include major consumer products like household appliances, furniture and sports equipment, and materials like lumber and plastics, along with much, much more.\"",
      "\"Now is the time to choose products made right here in Canada,\" Trudeau added to his own constituents in a post on social media. \"Check the labels. Let's do our part. Wherever we can, choose Canada.\"",
      "The first round of Canada's tariffs will kick in at the stroke of midnight on Monday evening \u2013 on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods. In 21 days, the remainder of the tariffs, covering an additional $125 billion worth of products, will kick in unless some new agreement is reached between the countries. The delay, said Trudeau, was aimed at giving Canadian companies time to seek supply chain options to soften the financial blow.",
      "Speaking to ABC News on Sunday, Canada's Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman said many people in her country \"just don't understand where this is coming from... and probably, there's a little bit of hurt.\"",
      "Mexico:",
      "Canada's government is now looking south of the U.S. border, hoping to band together and increase trade ties with Mexico to help both nations absorb the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs. The two countries have agreed \"to enhance the strong bilateral relations\" they share and officials have had extensive bilateral meetings with their counterparts.",
      "President Sheinbaum, who haD already mocked Mr.Trump's move to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, said on social media before the pause was announced that countermeasures against the U.S. tariffs would soon be implemented.",
      "\"I've instructed my economy minister to implement the plan B we've been working on, which includes tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico's interests,\" Sheinbaum said, without specifying which U.S. goods her government might target, or whether she would seek to match the 25% retaliatory tariffs set to be imposed by Canada.",
      "Mexican goods exported to the U.S. are wide-ranging, and include vehicles and other auto industry components, crude oil, natural gas, avocados, tomatoes, pork and cheese.",
      "China:",
      "For Beijing, it was deja-vu. During Mr. Trump's first term, he slapped 25% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, then 10% on an additional $300 billion worth of imports, which meant virtually everything Chinese was tariffed.",
      "China's Ministry of Commerce released a statement over the weekend saying Beijing was \"strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposes\" the new 10% tariffs, that the U.S.'s \"unilateral increase in tariffs seriously violates WTO rules,\" and that China \"will file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization and take corresponding countermeasures,\" which implies Beijing will impose 10% retaliatory tariffs on select U.S.-made goods.",
      "Analysts say China better prepared than ever for trade war with U.S.",
      "Analysts say China better prepared than ever for trade war with U.S.",
      "In a Sunday statement, the Chinese Foreign Ministry didn't drop any hints as to what measures might be coming, but it said called \"on the United States to correct its wrongdoings, maintain the hard-won positive dynamics in the counternarcotics cooperation, and promote a steady, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relationship.\"",
      "The ministry said the U.S. should \"view and solve its own fentanyl issue in an objective and rational way,\" rather than \"threatening other countries with arbitrary tariff hikes.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he was imposing the new 10% tariff on Chinese goods in part due to what he considers Beijing's failure to stem the flow of fentanyl and chemicals used to make the drug.",
      "The foreign ministry in Beijing said China was \"one of the world's toughest countries on counternarcotics, both in terms of policy and its implementation.\"",
      "The European Union:",
      "Mr. Trump said over the weekend that tariffs on the European Union were coming, but he did not say when or how steep they would be.",
      "\"It will definitely happen with the European Union. I can tell you that because they've really taken advantage of us,\" the U.S. president told reporters Sunday. \"They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products. They take almost nothing and we take everything from them.\"",
      "European leaders were meeting Monday in Brussels, where they were discussing how to collectively address the threat.",
      "\"We were listening carefully to those words, and of course we are preparing also on our side,\" EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Monday in Brussels, adding a warning that \"there are no winners in trade wars.\"",
      "If the Trump administration \"starts a trade war [with Europe], then the one laughing on the side is China,\" said Kallas. \"We are very interlinked.\"",
      "Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the leader of Europe's biggest economy, Germany, said the EU was strong enough to take the blow and respond to any U.S. tariffs, but added that \"the goal should be that things result in cooperation\" within Europe.",
      "For a quick fact check on Mr. Trump's criticism: He's not wrong about the lop-sided trade relationship between the U.S. and its close allies across the Atlantic. Through November 2024, the EU ran a trade deficit of $78 billion with the U.S., according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and reports indicate that's on track to be a new record.",
      "The question many economic analysts and politicians across the world will keep asking, however, is whether huge tariffs taxing that trade are likely to help balance the books.",
      "The United Kingdom:",
      "Speaking to reporters early on Monday, Mr. Trump said \"the U.K. is out of line but\u2026 I think that one can be worked out,\" suggesting his administration was at least willing to negotiate with London over a new bilateral trade deal.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Sunday that he had spoken with Mr. Trump and stressed that he wants \"a strong trading relationship\" with the U.S., but the U.K. leader, five years after the \"Brexit\" withdrawal from the European Union, may now find himself caught between the formidable trade forces of the EU on his doorstep and Washington.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs on the EU and his looming, if tempered threat to hit Britain with the same will complicate Starmer's nascent efforts to \"reset\" U.K. trade ties with the EU. He's at the helm of the U.K.'s first Labour Party government in a decade and a half, and it was the former Conservative leadership that ushered in Brexit and soured the long-standing close ties with Europe.",
      "Starmer has moved cautiously as he sets out to mend fences with the EU, wary of riling up conservative voters who supported Brexit and who, to some degree, now support populist politicians such as the Trump-aligned, anti-immigration leader of the Reform U.K. party, Nigel Farage.",
      "The prime minister has ruled out rejoining the EU customs union or its single currency market, and he's so far resisted pressure from the continent to ease post-Brexit restrictions on U.K. and EU citizens living and working on either side of the border, at least for young people.",
      "But he still needs to get U.K.-EU trade moving again, and the extent to which he chooses to keep the bloc next door at arm's length, or to try to reinstate the close trade ties of before Brexit, could directly impact his chances of nailing down a favorable new trade agreement with Washington.",
      "Speaking Monday, a spokesperson for Starmer's government called the U.K.'s trade relationship with the U.S. \"fair and balanced,\" calling Washington \"an indispensable ally and one of our closest trading partners.\"",

      "Rubio, the first Latino secretary of state, made the trip in part to reiterate President Trump's concern that China has too much influence over the Panama Canal, and needs control of the waterway for economic security, though Mulino has refuted the claim. Rubio toured the canal on Sunday and doubled down on the administration's plan to make immediate changes, according to his office spokesperson, Tammy Bruce.",
      "\"Secretary Rubio also emphasized the importance of collaborative efforts to end the hemisphere's illegal migration crisis and thanked President Mulino for his support of a joint repatriation program, which has reduced illegal migration through the Darien Gap,\" Bruce said in a statement.",
      "Speaking at the U.S. embassy, the secretary of state said that Panama is very important to the U.S. and thanked all the staff that serve the embassy.",
      "The Panama Canal serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. And although the U.S. led the construction of the major waterway that around 40% of the world's cargo ship traffic now moves through, its control was given to Panama in 1999.",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Feb 2025 18:14:50 -0500",
    "summary": "The Temporary Protected Status designation has been used by Republican and Democratic administrations to grant temporary immigration protections to migrants.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is terminating an immigration program that currently protects hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants in the U.S. from deportation, paving the way for many of them to lose their legal status this spring, according to a government notice obtained by CBS News.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem this weekend revoked one of two Temporary Protected Status designations for Venezuela, which the U.S. government had previously determined was too dangerous to allow Venezuelans to return to their homeland safely.",
      "Created in 1990, TPS has been used by Republican and Democratic administrations to grant temporary immigration protections to migrants from nations beset by war, environmental disasters or other emergencies that make it dangerous to send deportees there. The policy shields beneficiaries from deportation and makes them eligible for work permits but it does not give them permanent legal status.",
      "The Venezuela TPS program is by far the biggest of its kind, protecting more than 600,000 migrants from deportation, government statistics show.",
      "The move by the Trump administration will mean that an estimated 350,000 Venezuelans\u00a0covered under a 2023 TPS designation will lose their work permits and deportation protections two months after Noem's decision is officially published. Venezuelans enrolled in TPS under an earlier 2021 designation will continue to have that status through September, though those protections could also be phased out.",
      "Those whose TPS protections lapse and lack another immigration status will lose their ability to work in the U.S. legally and become vulnerable to being detained and deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has dramatically increased arrests across the country under President Trump. On Saturday, Mr. Trump said the Venezuelan government had agreed to accept migrant deportees from the U.S., after rejecting American deportation flights for years.",
      "The efforts to scale back TPS, first reported by The New York Times,\u00a0echo a broader crackdown by Mr. Trump on illegal immigration and humanitarian programs that allowed some migrants to come or stay in the U.S. legally. Administration officials have also drafted plans to revoke the legal status of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who arrived in the U.S. under a sponsorship process established by the Biden administration.",
      "Venezuelan migrants were first granted TPS in 2021 by the Biden administration, which cited the deteriorating economic and political conditions in Venezuela under the authoritarian rule of President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "Nearly 8 million people have left Venezuela as part of the largest exodus recorded in the Western Hemisphere, according to the United Nations. While millions of Venezuelans have settled in other South American countries like Colombia, hundreds of thousands traveled to the U.S. southern border during former President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "While Noem acknowledged in her decision that some conditions in Venezuela cited by the Biden administration \"continue,\" she determined it was \"contrary to the national interest\" to continue the TPS program. She cited challenges some communities in the U.S. have faced in absorbing migrants in recent years and the arrival of members of the Venezuelan prison gang, Tren de Aragua.",
      "Noem also suggested policies like TPS encourage illegal immigration, saying extensions of the policy could amount to \"pull factors\" that attract people to the U.S. border.",
      "Biden extended TPS protections to a record number of people, offering them to hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Ukraine and other countries in turmoil. It also reversed the first Trump administration's attempts to terminate TPS programs for several countries, including El Salvador.",
      "Trump officials and many Republican lawmakers believe the TPS policy has been abused and improperly extended too often, despite the program's temporary nature. In one of his first executive orders, Mr. Trump instructed his administration to ensure TPS is \"limited in scope.\"",
      "Still, a handful of Republican lawmakers had urged Mr. Trump to protect Venezuelans from deportation. In a letter Friday, Florida GOP Congressman Carlos Gimenez called on the Trump administration to offer Venezuelan TPS holders a \"solution,\" saying that most are law-abiding migrants \"seeking freedom.\"",

      "Sanders, who caucuses with Democrats, is the ranking member on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee and also sits on the Senate Finance Committee, which Kennedy appeared before last week. The Finance Committee announced Sunday that it will vote on whether to advance RFK's nomination Tuesday.",
      "The Vermont independent outlined where he thinks Kennedy is right, pointing to his comments about the nation being unhealthy, about life expectancy relative to other wealthy countries and issues with the food industry. But he stressed that Kennedy \"continues to believe that autism is caused by vaccines,\" and was not aligned with him on issues like universal healthcare and targeting the pharmaceutical industry to lower prescription drug prices.",
      "Sanders also argued that \"the conspiracy theories\" that Kennedy has entertained are \"not unlike what we're hearing all over the Trump administration.\"",
      "The comments come after Kennedy was grilled on his vaccine stance, among other things, during the hearings last week, as his advancement out of committee \u2014 and confirmation by the Senate more broadly \u2014 remains in question.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said he's been \"struggling\" with Kennedy's nomination due to concerns he may undermine faith in vaccines. And without support from Democrats and independents on the committee, Cassidy's opposition could tank a favorable recommendation for Kennedy. In a floor vote before the full Senate, Republicans can lose just three votes to confirm Kennedy without support across the aisle.",
      "Though Kennedy, 71, dropped out of the presidential race to endorse President Trump in August, he previously sought the Democratic nomination and has close ties to the party as the as the nephew of President John F. Kennedy and the son of Robert F. Kennedy.",
      "Sanders, asked whether he would help Republicans to confirm Kennedy, said he will make his decision in the days ahead, noting that although he's voted for some of Mr. Trump's nominees, though he's voted against most.",

      "Asteroid samples fetched by NASA hold not only the pristine building blocks for life but also the salty remains of an ancient water world, scientists reported Wednesday.",
      "The findings provide the strongest evidence yet that asteroids may have planted the seeds of life on Earth and that these ingredients were mingling with water almost right from the start.",
      "\"That's the kind of environment that could have been essential to the steps that lead from elements to life,\" said the Smithsonian Institution's Tim McCoy, one of the lead study authors.",
      "NASA's Osiris-Rex spacecraft returned 122 grams (4 ounces) of dust and pebbles from the near-Earth asteroid Bennu, delivering the sample canister to the Utah desert in 2023 before swooping off after another space rock. It remains the biggest cosmic haul from beyond the moon. The two previous asteroid sample missions, by Japan, yielded considerably less material.",
      "Small amounts of Bennu's precious black grains \u2014 leftovers from the solar system's formation 4.5 billion years ago \u2014 were doled out to the two separate research teams whose studies appeared in the journals Nature and Nature Astronomy. But it was more than enough to tease out the sodium-rich minerals and confirm the presence of amino acids, nitrogen in the form of ammonia and even parts of the genetic code.",
      "Some if not all of the delicate salts found at Bennu \u2014 similar to what's in the dry lakebeds of California's Mojave Desert and Africa's Sahara \u2014 would be stripped away if present in falling meteorites.",
      "\"This discovery was only possible by analyzing samples that were collected directly from the asteroid then carefully preserved back on Earth,\" the Institute of Science Tokyo's Yasuhito Sekine, who was not involved in the studies, said in an accompanying editorial.",
      "Combining the ingredients of life with an environment of sodium-rich salt water, or brines, \"that's really the pathway to life,\" said McCoy, the National Museum of Natural History's curator of meteorites. \"These processes probably occurred much earlier and were much more widespread than we had thought before.\"",
      "NASA's Daniel Glavin said one of the biggest surprises was the relatively high abundance of nitrogen, including ammonia. While all of the organic molecules found in the Bennu samples have been identified before in meteorites, Glavin said the ones from Bennu are valid \u2014 \"real extraterrestrial organic material formed in space and not a result of contamination from Earth.\"",
      "Bennu \u2014 a rubble pile just one-third of a mile (one-half of a kilometer) across \u2014 was originally part of a much larger asteroid that got clobbered by other space rocks. The latest results suggest this parent body had an extensive underground network of lakes or even oceans, and that the water evaporated away, leaving behind the salty clues.",
      "Sixty labs around the world are analyzing bits of Bennu as part of initial studies, said the University of Arizona's Dante Lauretta, the mission's chief scientist who took part in both studies.",
      "Most of the $1 billion mission's cache has been set aside for future analysis. Scientists stress more testing is needed to better understand the Bennu samples, as well as more asteroid and comet sample returns. China plans to launch an asteroid sample return mission this year.",

    "story": [
      "Starliner astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore took a stroll outside the International Space Station on Thursday, marking their 239th day in orbit by carrying out a task originally planned for a spacewalk last summer. In the process, Williams became the world's most experienced female spacewalker, logging more than 62 hours outside the lab over nine excursions across multiple missions.",
      "Her latest outing began at 7:43 a.m. EST when she and Wilmore switched their spacesuits to battery power and headed out to retrieve a faulty S-band antenna assembly mounted on an external storage platform. Two earlier attempts to retrieve the unit were unsuccessful.",
      "The device wasn't designed for spacewalk retrieval and it took Williams and Wilmore longer than had been planned to get the job done. But thanks to improvisation and muscle power, the third time was the charm.",
      "\"The team has just been incredible,\" Williams radioed from the Quest airlock when the five-hour 26-minute EVA came to an end. \"I know we were not the first, we weren't even the second crew to do this, but somehow, with all of their great work, we were able to get it done.\"",
      "Added Wilmore: \"This is probably the most involved spacewalk that probably every discipline in the ISS program was sweating as much as Suni and I were. Fantastic job, coming up with the next plan, and the next plan, and the next plan. And it worked! So, outstanding.\"",
      "After the antenna retrieval, Wilmore collected swabs from nearby vents to help researchers determine if any microbial life from inside the station had managed to make it outside and survive in the space environment. A third task, prepping a spare robot arm joint for possible use if arm repairs are ever needed, was deferred to a future spacewalk.",
      "Going into Thursday's spacewalk, or EVA, Williams had logged 56 hours and 40 minutes outside the station during eight previous outings while Wilmore had chalked up 25 hours and 35 minutes of EVA time during four excursions.",
      "With her latest spacewalk, Williams moved past retired astronaut Peggy Whitson's mark of 60 hours and 21 minutes of spacewalk time to become the world's most experienced female spacewalker, moving up to number four overall.",
      "Stuck aboard the station since last June because of NASA concerns about the safety of their Starliner capsule, Williams and Wilmore are now planning to return to Earth around the end of March aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ship that carried two other station fliers \u2014 Crew 9 commander Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov \u2014 to the lab last September.",
      "That Crew Dragon was launched with two empty seats specifically to carry Williams and Wilmore back to Earth at the end of the Crew 9 mission, originally planned for late February. But an extra month was tacked on later to give SpaceX more time to complete pre-flight checks of the Crew 10 Dragon, which will be making its maiden flight.",
      "President Trump earlier this week blamed their long stay in space on the Biden administration and said that he'd asked SpaceX owner Elon Musk to bring Williams and Wilmore back home as soon as possible.",
      "But the astronauts are not stranded. Their ride home has been docked to the station since last September and could bring them back to Earth in short order if NASA so ordered.",
      "But that would cause major disruptions to U.S. research aboard the lab because only a single NASA astronaut \u2014 Don Pettit \u2014 would remain aboard the station with two Russian crewmates until the Crew 10 fliers arrive around the end of March.",

Beyond the leap of faith made by those teachers and parents who got us the terminal, and beyond the stroke of luck that people were now sharing computers over phone lines, completing this miracle was the decision by two Dartmouth professors to create the BASIC programming language. Just four years old at the time, the \"Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code\" was made to help students in nontechnical fields get started with computer programming. One of its attributes was that it used commands, such as GOTO, IF, THEN, and RUN, that made sense to humans. BASIC is what hooked me and made me want to come back.",
      "On the wall next to the terminal, a teacher had tacked up a half sheet of paper with the most rudimentary directions to get started, including how to sign in and which keys to press when something went wrong. It also warned ominously that typing \u00a0\"'PRINT' WITHOUT A STATEMENT NUMBER MAY CAUSE LOSS OF CONTROL.\"",

      "That was probably the first computer program I ever typed in. The elegance of the four lines of code appealed to my sense of order. Its instantaneous answer was like a jolt of electricity. From there, I wrote the first computer program of my own\u2014a game of tic-tac-toe. Getting it to work forced me to think through for the first time the most basic elements of the game's rules. Immediately, I learned that the computer was a dumb machine that I had to tell every single step it should take, under every single circumstance that could occur. When I wrote imprecise code, the computer couldn't infer or guess what I meant. I made a lot of errors trying to figure that out. When I finally got it right, the sense of accomplishment far outstripped the result. A game of tic-tac-toe is so simple, even kids learn it quickly. But it felt like a triumph to get a machine to do it.",
      "I loved how the computer forced me to think. It was completely unforgiving in the face of mental sloppiness. It demanded that I be logically consistent and pay attention to details. One misplaced comma or semicolon and the thing wouldn't work.",
      "It reminded me of solving mathematical proofs. Programming doesn't require math skills (beyond the basics), but it does demand the same kind of rigorous, logical approach to problem-solving, breaking problems down into smaller, more manageable parts. And like solving a problem in algebra, there are different ways to write programs that work\u2014some more elegant and efficient than others\u2014but infinite ways to make a program that fails. And mine failed all the time. Only after persevering, forcing myself to think smart, could I coax a program to run flawlessly.",
      "Another early program I wrote was a lunar lander game. The problem: safely touch down a lunar lander on the moon without crashing and before you run out of fuel. From that I had to break the problem down into steps. I had to solve how the game player moved the lander left and right, up and down, how much fuel it had, how fast it burned. I also had to describe what it looked like and how to display the ship in dashes and asterisks on the screen.",
      "Not long after Lakeside installed the terminal, Mr. Stocklin wrote a program that contained an infinite loop, meaning it ran continuously before someone eventually stopped it\u2014but not before it burned through over a hundred dollars of our precious rummage-sale budget. I'm not sure he showed his face again in that room. It was a lesson to all of us.",
      "To avoid racking up charges, I'd write out as much of my program as I could with pen and paper before elbowing into my place at the machine. With the machine offline to avoid time charges, I'd type it in and the program would print on a roll of inch-wide paper tape. That was step one. Then I'd dial the phone\u2014the rotary dial on the side of the terminal\u2014and wait for the buzz of the modem to confirm that I'd connected. I'd then feed my tape in, and chug-chug-chug, the program would input at a blistering ten characters per second. Finally, I'd type \"RUN.\" Typically there was a gaggle of other kids waiting for the computer, so if my program didn't work, I'd have to log off and find a spot to sort through where I went wrong, then wait my turn to get back on the teletype.",
      "This feedback loop was addictive. The feeling of getting better and better was a rush. Writing programs flowed from a combination of skills that came easy to me: logical thinking and an ability to focus intensely for long periods.

Kent and I were among the youngest kids in that group. The assumed superiority of some of the older kids bothered us.",

      "The Wall Street Journal\u00a0first reported the settlement.",
      "The lawsuit stemmed from Meta's suspension of his accounts after the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Facebook (which is now Meta) initially suspended and then announced in June 2021 that it would ban Mr. Trump from its platform for at least two years, after finding that his posts on Jan. 6 had stoked violence and posed a risk to public safety. Twitter, now named X and owned by Elon Musk, also barred Mr. Trump from its social media site for the same reason.",

      "In complaints filed with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Mr. Trump had asked the court to overturn Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects social media companies from liability for content posted on their platforms, and restore his accounts on the two social media sites, as well as his channel on YouTube. He also asked the courts to prevent Twitter, Facebook and YouTube from \"exercising censorship, editorial control or prior restraint in its many forms\" over the posts and uploads of the presidents.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 09:03:31 -0500",
    "summary": "Lawmakers and experts say China's DeepSeek AI app could expose U.S. users to risks and promote censorship.",
    "story": [
      "As Chinese AI application DeepSeek attracts hordes of American users, Trump administration officials, lawmakers and cybersecurity experts are expressing concern that the technology could pose a threat to U.S. national security.",
      "DeepSeek's introduction in the U.S. on Monday saw it quickly become the most downloaded free application in the country on Apple's app store. The rollout also rocked Wall Street as investors struggled to compute the sudden appearance of a low-cost, open-source generative AI tool able to compete with leading artificial intelligence apps such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Shares of Nvidia, the U.S. manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, plummeted 17%, chopping roughly $600 billion off its market value \u2014 a record single-day drop for a U.S. stock.",
      "That explosive debut was branded a \"wake-up call\" by President Trump on Monday. Addressing reporters on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the National Security Council (NSC) would examine the potential national security implications around DeepSeek's launch, noting that the administration would seek to \"ensure American AI dominance.\"",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "Some lawmakers also weighed in with concerns about the application's access to U.S. users.",
      "\"The U.S. cannot allow Chinese Communist Party models such as DeepSeek to risk our national security and leverage our technology to advance their AI ambitions,\" Rep. John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said Tuesday in a statement shared on social media. \"We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek's AI infrastructure.\"",
      "The spotlight on DeepSeek comes amid rising tensions over trade, technology and other issues between the two superpowers. The U.S. has already imposed significant export controls on China in an effort to rein in Beijing's production of semiconductors used in developing advanced AI, with the most recent curbs coming in\u00a0December.",
      "\"At the President's direction, the NSC and others in the U.S. government work in many ways to address concerns involving AI, China and data security,\" agency spokesperson Brian Hughes told CBS News in an email. \"As the President has underscored, U.S. policy is to ensure that the United States leads the world in AI.\"",
      "Security threat for users",
      "While the calls from Moolenaar could be the first inkling of a possible congressional crackdown, Ross Burley \u2014 a co-founder of the nonprofit Centre for Information Resilience \u2014 warned that DeepSeek's emergence in the U.S. raises data security and privacy issues for users. Chinese law grants Beijing broad authority to access data from companies based in China.",
      "\"More and more people will use it, and that will open the door to more and more personal data just being given away to the [Chinese Communist Party] and being sent basically to mainland China to be able to inform them of their activities,\" Burley told CBS News.",
      "\"What they'll use it for is behavior change campaigns, disinformation campaigns, for really targeted messaging as to what Western audiences like, what they do,\" he added.",
      "DeepSeek, which is based in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, notes in its privacy policy that the personal information it collects from users is held \"on secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Under that\u00a0policy, the company says it collects information including users' \"device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, and system language.\" DeepSeek also collects \"service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs,\" according to the company.",
      "A key difference from TikTok",
      "The fact that DeepSeek's servers are based in mainland China differentiates it from TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform that Congress had sought to ban on national security grounds before President Trump signed an executive order last week directing the Justice Department to not enforce the law for a period of 75 days.",
      "In an effort to mitigate U.S. regulatory concerns, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in 2022 moved all of its U.S. data to infrastructure owned by American software maker Oracle.",
      "The legislation banning TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April \u2014 grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on tech platforms owned by countries regarded as U.S. adversaries.",
      "Under that law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content; has more than 1 million monthly active users; is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country; and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "But DeepSeek may be seen as less of a threat given that, unlike TikTok, it is an open-source large language model, according to Matt Sheehan, a China fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\"[A] lot of these open-source apps, open-source models, you can actually sort of use them directly on other platforms. Perplexity is a major U.S. AI company, and they're currently using a version of DeepSeek that you can use that doesn't have the data privacy or security threats,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Advancing censorship?",
      "One issue that DeepSeek users face outside of China: censorship. For example, a CBS News analysis of the application found that DeepSeek did not return any results for a prompt seeking information bout the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre in Beijing.",
      "Burley of the Centre for Information Resilience thinks such suppression of information on an app being downloaded by millions of users will pressure policymakers to act.",
      "\"I think it's incumbent on Western governments \u2014 the U.K., Canada, the U.S. \u2014 to look and see if it is wise for the Apple store and the Android store to host this large language model when it is so clearly being curated to push Chinese narratives and censorship,\" he said.",

The memo was walked back days later and the ordered freeze has been halted by a federal court, but some programs appear to still be in limbo.",
      "\"You're talking about 20 million people in the global HIV program, that has reduced HIV around the world, they are going without medication that keeps them alive, Gawande said. \"You're talking about disease outbreaks that are not being stopped, like bird flu, where monitoring has been turned off in 40 countries.\"",
      "\"There is a great deal of harm being done, and this change to take away the independent status is just a nail in the coffin after a purge of personnel that this may have decimated the agency,\" Gawande said.",

      "The Trump administration is expected to announce details in the coming days about the disruption to the USAID, a 60-year-old organization that provides humanitarian aid to more than 100 countries. The agency provides humanitarian assistance abroad, particularly to countries recovering from disaster and trying to escape poverty. In fiscal year 2023, USAID managed more than $40 billion in appropriations, the Congressional Research Service said, a figure that is less than 1% of the federal budget.",
      "Mr. Trump has vowed to cut the size of the federal government, and USAID has been a recent target of his and Musk's, who is tasked with leading the newly created\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency. Lawmakers, however, have warned that any attempt to change USAID's structure and funding would require an act of Congress.",
      "Gawande said it's \"dangerous for the country to denigrate\" the agency, saying it's the country's \"largest civilian operational capacity for advancing\" the work of the U.S. abroad.",
      "\"We're talking about world-class expertise. For example, the Malaria program. Two-thirds have been fired, and the activity shutdown includes one of the global experts in Malaria for us. How does that make us safer? How does that make us stronger,\" Gawande said.",
      "\"Every administration goes through an overhaul that says they want to change policy, they want to change some direction, but you don't decimate and demolish the institution in the process,\" Gawande said. \"There was no need to close down all of its functions, which is harming people.\"",

      "Scarlett Pavlovich on Monday filed the lawsuits in federal court in Wisconsin, where Gaiman lives, and in Massachusetts and New York for Palmer.",
      "Pavlovich alleges in the lawsuits that she was homeless and living on a beach when she met Palmer in Auckland, New Zealand, in 2020. Pavlovich was 22 years old at the time.",
      "According to the lawsuits, Palmer invited Pavlovich to the couple's home on Waiheke Island. Pavlovich began running errands for the couple, babysitting their son and helping with chores, but the lawsuit stated that she was \"generally not paid for these tasks\" although the ferry from Auckland to Waiheke cost between $40 to $59 NZD.",
      "Palmer first asked Pavlovich to babysit in February 2022 and Gaiman allegedly sexually assaulted her the night they met, according to the lawsuits that also said the couple were separated at the time.",
      "The assaults continued but she kept working for the couple because she was broke and homeless and Gaiman had told her he would help her writing career, Pavlovich alleged.",
      "When she told Palmer about the assaults, Palmer told her that more than a dozen women had told her in the past that Gaiman had sexually abused them, according to the lawsuits. The lawsuit alleged that Gaiman agreed to provide compensation, for hundreds of thousands of dollars in some cases, to the women he allegedly victimized over the years.",
      "The assaults didn't stop until Pavlovich told Palmer she was going to kill herself, the lawsuits said. She left the family and became homeless again, although the documents say Gaiman eventually paid her for her work caring for the couple's child and helped cover her rent for a few months.",
      "Palmer knew of Gaiman's sexual desires and presented Pavlovich to him knowing he would assault her, according to the lawsuits. Pavlovich alleges Gaiman and Palmer violated federal human trafficking prohibitions and seeks at least $7 million in damages.",
      "Pavlovich publicly identified herself earlier this year in an interview with New York Magazine, which detailed eight women's allegations of assault, abuse and coercion.",
      "After the New York Magazine article was published, Gaiman\u00a0released a statement\u00a0in January denying he had ever engaged in non-consensual sex. The allegations of four of the women were previously broadcast in July in a Tortoise Media podcast.",
      "\"I'm far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever,\" Gaiman posted on the social media platform Tumblr.",
      "Representatives for Gaiman and Palmer did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday and online court records did not list attorneys representing them in the suits. Pavlovich's attorneys stated in the filings that Gaiman, author of such bestsellers as \"Coraline\" and \"The Sandman\" series, is a resident of Menomonie, Wisconsin. But they're unsure if Palmer resides in Massachusetts or New York.",
      "Pavlovich told New York Magazine that she filed a police report in January 2023 accusing Gaiman of sexual assault. Police have not confirmed whether Gaiman was ever under investigation.",
      "Gaiman has worked with numerous publishers over the years. Two of them, HarperCollins and W.W. Norton, have said they have no plans to release his books in the future. Others, including Bloomsbury, have so far declined comment.",
      "Dark Horse Comics announced in January that it would no longer release its illustrated series based on Gaiman's novel, \"Anansi Boys.\" The seventh of eight editions was released earlier that month.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Monday paused his plans to implement steep tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for at least a month after talks with the leaders of both countries, who vowed to step up efforts to combat the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders with the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social\u00a0in the morning that he and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum \"agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one month period.\" The pause, he said, will allow \"negotiations headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent, and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, and high-level Representatives of Mexico.\"",
      "The president wrote that he had a \"very friendly conversation\" with Sheinbaum in which she \"agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States.\"",
      "\"These soldiers will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our Country,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "At the White House later in the day, Mr. Trump told reporters that the call \"went very well, in the sense that they're very strong now on the border.\"",
      "Sheinbaum unveiled the details of the deal in an earlier post on X, saying that the U.S. is \"committed to working to prevent the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico\" and that \"our teams will begin working today on two fronts: security and trade.\" She wrote in Spanish that Mexico \"will immediately reinforce the northern border with 10,000 members of the National Guard to prevent drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States, particularly fentanyl.\"",
      "In the afternoon, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a statement saying Mr. Trump is pausing tariffs on Canadian imports for at least 30 days, following a pair of phone calls between the two leaders. In return, Trudeau said Canada is implementing a $1.3 billion plan to protect the border. Mr. Trump soon confirmed the deal.",
      "\"I am very pleased with this initial outcome, and the Tariffs announced on Saturday will be paused for a 30 day period to see whether or not a final Economic deal with Canada can be structured,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"FAIRNESS FOR ALL!\"",
      "On Saturday, Mr. Trump signed orders\u00a0imposing a 25% tariff on imports\u00a0from Mexico and Canada, as well as a 10% levy on goods from China, beginning at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday. U.S. markets\u00a0tumbled in early trading\u00a0Monday morning amid fears that the tariffs could drive up prices for consumer goods. Mexico and Canada had both\u00a0said\u00a0they would issue retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports, raising fears of a trade war that could stifle economic activity between the U.S. and its neighbors.",
      "Before Mr. Trump announced the pause on Monday, Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House's National Economic Council, told CNBC that there were \"positive conversations that have happened over the weekend, and there are positive conversations that are going to happen between the leaders of these countries, you know, over the next hours.\"",
      "\"President Trump will then see what people have to offer and then make the call,\" Hassett said.",

      "Major League Baseball on Monday announced that it stands by the decision to fire umpire Pat Hoberg following an investigation into his involvement with a sports betting account.",
      "The league fired Hoberg in May 2024 after it found the umpire was sharing a legal sports gambling account with his friend, who is a professional poker player. The friend wasn't identified by name, but the account was used to bet on baseball, which violates MLB policy, according to the league's statement.",
      "Hoberg appealed the termination and called on a third-party investigation.",
      "After another review that found no evidence that Hoberg directly or indirectly placed any bets on baseball, nor any evidence of game manipulation, MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred Jr. said he stood by the decision to fire the umpire because Hoberg failed to \"maintain the integrity of the game of baseball.\"",
      "Although there was no evidence Hoberg bet on baseball, his friend did so 141 times between 2021 and 2023, including eight bets on five games that Hoberg umpired or was responsible for replay reviews, investigators said.",
      "Hoberg and the friend also deleted their Telegram messages that detailed bets and the ledger, investigators found. Hoberg claimed he was \"embarrassed by the frequency and volume\" of his betting activity, which included bets on football, basketball hockey and golf.",
      "It was the umpire's \"poor judgment\" in sharing the gambling account with someone who did bet on baseball, as well as his deletion of messages, that warranted termination, Manfred Jr. said.",
      "Hoberg, who had been an MLB umpire since 2014, according to Retrosheet, said he takes full responsibility for the errors in judgment.",
      "\"Those errors will always be a source of shame and embarrassment to me,\" Hoberg said in a statement through the Major League Umpires Association, adding that he has never bet on baseball and he never provided any information to anyone for the purpose of betting on baseball.",
      "\"I apologize to Major League Baseball and the entire baseball community for my mistakes. I vow to learn from them and to be a better version of myself moving forward,\" he said.",
      "Hoberg will be able to apply for reinstatement as an umpire after the start of spring training in 2026, in accordance with league policy.",

      "The department's acting assistant secretary for civil rights, Craig Trainor, accused the Biden administration of failing to hold institutions responsible for tolerating \"widespread antisemitic harassment and the illegal encampments that paralyzed campus life last year.\"",

      "At\u00a0Berkeley, as has been the case at a number of universities, protesters have demanded the university divest from Israel and an end to the war in Gaza.",

At the end of last year's term, the NYPD disbanded an encampment on the quad and dozens of student protesters were arrested. Columbia would end up canceling its graduation ceremony.",

      "Wright, CEO of Denver-based Liberty Energy, has been one of the industry's loudest voices against efforts to fight climate change.

      "Mr. Trump's energy wishes are likely to run into real-world limits, including the fact that U.S. oil production is already at record levels. The federal government cannot force companies to drill for more oil, and production increases could lower prices and reduce profits.",

      "Wright, 60, has been chair\u00a0and CEO of Liberty Energy since 2011 and has no prior experience in government. He grew up in Colorado, earned an undergraduate degree at MIT and did graduate work in electrical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley and MIT.

    "summary": "A group of nonprofits challenged the Trump administration's freeze on federal assistance.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Monday ordered the Trump administration to temporarily stop its freeze on federal assistance, allowing aid to continue flowing to nonprofit organizations and other entities after the funding was targeted by the White House budget office last week.",
      "U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan of the federal district court in Washington, D.C., formally granted the request from a coalition of nonprofits that had challenged the directive from the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB. She said the administration's actions \"run roughshod over a 'bulwark of the Constitution' by interfering with Congress's appropriation of funds.\"",
      "Issued nearly one week ago, the OMB memo directed all agencies to temporarily pause all federal assistance that may be implicated by certain executive orders issued by President Trump in his first days in office.",
      "While OMB acting Director Matthew Vaeth rescinded the memo after it led to widespread confusion as to which entities would be affected by the funding freeze, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the pause on federal assistance would remain in place and just the memo was being revoked.",
      "In a 30-page opinion granting the challengers' request to block the funding freeze, AliKhan wrote that a review of the programs that should or should not receive federal dollars \"could be conducted without depriving millions of Americans access to vital resources.\"",
      "She notes that the administration's memo potentially covered up to $3 trillion in financial assistance, a \"breathtakingly large sum of money to suspend practically overnight.\"",
      "\"Rather than taking a measured approach to identify purportedly wasteful spending, defendants cut the fuel supply to a vast, complicated, nationwide machine \u2014 seemingly without any consideration for the consequences of that decision,\" AliKhan, who was nominated for her current seat by former President Biden in 2023, wrote.",
      "The judge also cited Leavitt's statements, writing that \"OMB and the various agencies it communicates with appear committed to restricting federal funding.\"",
      "\"By rescinding the memorandum that announced the freeze, but 'NOT . . . the federal funding freeze; itself, it appears that OMB sought to overcome a judicially imposed obstacle without actually ceasing the challenged conduct. The court can think of few things more disingenuous,\" she wrote, quoting a social media post from the White House press secretary.",
      "The initial memo from Vaeth brought on legal challenges from the nonprofit groups in Washington and from 22 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia, which was filed in Rhode Island. The federal judge overseeing the states' case temporarily blocked the Trump administration from freezing federal assistance Friday after concluding that OMB's actions were likely unlawful.",
      "AliKhan's decision came just before an earlier order that temporarily halted the freeze and maintained the status quo was set to expire at 5 p.m. Monday. She held a hearing earlier in the day to consider the request from the nonprofits to issue a temporary restraining order and suggested then that she would grant their motion.",
      "AliKhan had warned that the harm to groups that receive federal assistance could be \"catastrophic.\"",
      "The White House budget office's directive targeting federal assistance is one of several measures taken by the new Trump administration that have upended the federal government. Mr. Trump has pledged to shrink the federal workforce and spending and tapped billionaire Elon Musk to oversee those efforts through the Department of Government Efficiency, which the president established on his first day back in the White House.",
      "Since then, the Trump administration paused new funding for nearly all foreign aid and has targeted the U.S. Agency for International Development for a potential reorganization.",
      "The moves from the Trump administration pausing the flow of federal assistance have left organizations in the U.S. and abroad reeling. Domestically, groups that provide meals to the elderly and school-aged children, universities and small businesses were left scrambling to determine whether they would lose access to funding that has already been approved by Congress. Overseas, humanitarian and development groups that receive assistance from the State Department or USAID were forced to furlough workers.",

On the campaign trail, the president called some of the proposals detailed in its more than 900-page book \"abysmal\" and said he knew nothing about it.",
      "But the authors of some of the policy book's chapters served in the first administration and will be serving in his second. Russ Vought, Mr. Trump's pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget, is expected to be confirmed by the Senate soon, and John Ratcliffe is in place as CIA director.",
      "Paul Dans, who served as the director of Project 2025 but left his post in July, said of Mr. Trump's actions so far that they were a testament not only to the initiative's efforts, but also the readiness of the conservative movement in preparing for the next administration.",
      "\"They're home runs,\" he said of the president's plans. \"They are in many cases more than we could have even dared hope for.\"",
      "Some of Mr. Trump's actions taken in his first days in office reinstate measures he put in place during his first term that were revoked by President Biden. But in other instances, Mr. Trump's executive actions echo the policies outlined in the pages of Project 2025's policy blueprint.",
      "Redirecting federal aid under FEMA to the states",
      "After trips to western North Carolina and Southern California last week, Mr. Trump established a review council to advise him on the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, \"to capably and impartially address disasters occurring within the United States.\" The council will also advise the president on recommended changes related to FEMA, his order states.",
      "Western North Carolina was devastated by Hurricane Helene last fall, and parts of Southern California were destroyed by deadly wildfires that hit the area earlier this month.",
      "Mr. Trump's action comes after he suggested that he could \"get rid\" of FEMA and leave disaster response management to the states.",
      "\"That's what states are for, to take care of problems,\" he said last week.",
      "Project 2025's sweeping book of policy proposals calls for \"reforming FEMA emergency spending to shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities instead of the federal government.\"",
      "It also urges Congress to change the cost-sharing arrangement so the federal government covers 25% of the costs for small disasters and up to 75% for \"truly catastrophic disasters.\" Currently, for Public Assistance, which provides financial and direct assistance to state and local governments for disaster response and recovery work, FEMA covers a minimum of 75% of costs, and the president can increase the federal cost-share at his discretion, according to a 2023 report from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "The recommendation follows a warning from Project 2025's authors that FEMA is \"overtasked, overcompensates for the lack of state and local preparedness and response, and is regularly in deep debt.\" Additionally, it states that since passage of the Stafford Act in 1988, which gave the president powers to \"alleviate the suffering and damage\" caused by disasters, the number of declared federal disasters has risen drastically as costs were shifted from state and local governments to the federal government.",
      "Project 2025's book also calls on Congress to end preparedness grants for states and localities.",
      "\"DHS should not be in the business of handing out federal tax dollars: These grants should be terminated,\" it states.",
      "Ending diversity, equity and inclusion practices",
      "The president frequently rails against diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, practices, and he signed an executive order on the day he returned to the White House ending all DEI programs within the federal government.",
      "Mr. Trump claimed in his order that DEI policies can violate federal civil rights laws and shut out Americans \"who deserve a shot at the American dream\" because of their race or sex.",
      "Project 2025's policy book calls for the next conservative president to delete a variety of terms, including DEI, abortion and gender equality \"from every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists.\"",
      "It also calls for the \"DEI apparatus\" at a variety of agencies to be dismantled.",
      "Targeting PBS and National Public Radio",
      "Brendan Carr, head of the Federal Communications Commission, informed the heads of National Public Radio and PBS in a letter Thursday that the agency had opened an investigation into the airing of their programming across their roughly 1,500 broadcast member stations, according to the New York Times.",
      "Those stations are licensed by the FCC to operate, but are limited to operating as noncommercial educational broadcast stations. These stations, or NCEs, are exempt from licensing fees and operate on a specific \"reserved\" frequency band. Federal law prohibits these noncommercial educational broadcast stations from commercial advertisements.",
      "In his letter, Carr wrote that he is \"concerned that NPR and PBS broadcasts could be violating federal law by airing commercials. In particular, it is possible that NPR and PBS member stations are broadcasting underwriting announcements that cross the line into prohibited commercial advertisements.\"",
      "Carr also said that he also does not see a reason for Congress to continue approving federal dollars for NPR and PBS \"given the changes in the media marketplace.\"",
      "Carr authored the section of Project 2025's policy book that deals with the FCC, but another portion of the blueprint urges Congress to defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides grants to NPR and PBS.",
      "According to Project 2025, \"stripping public funding would, of course, mean that NPR, PBS, Pacifica Radio, and the other leftist broadcasters would be shorn of the presumption that they act in the public interest and receive the privileges that often accompany so acting.\" The outlets should therefore no longer be qualified as noncommercial educational broadcast stations, according to the book.",
      "\"NPR and PBS stations are in reality no longer noncommercial, as they run ads in everything but name for their sponsors,\" the blueprint states. \"They are also noneducational. The next president should instruct the FCC to exclude the stations affiliated with PBS and NPR from the NCE denomination and the privileges that come with it.\"",
      "Whether Carr ultimately decides to take that step as a result of his investigation remains to be seen.",
      "Freezing federal assistance",
      "One of Mr. Trump's first actions as president was to establish the Department of Government Efficiency, an entity that is housed within the executive branch and run by billionaire Elon Musk. The body aims to cut regulations and spending and restructure federal agencies.",
      "On the heels of that move, the White House's Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, issued a two-page memo late Monday that ordered a freeze on grant, loan or federal assistance programs implicated by Mr. Trump's executive orders, which would allow his administration \"time to review agency programs and determine the best uses of the funding for those programs consistent with the law and the president's priorities.\"",
      "\"The use of federal resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve,\" OMB acting Director Matthew Vaeth said in the memo.",
      "The memo sparked widespread confusion and prompted concerns about whether programs providing meals for the elderly, pre-school funding for low-income children and medical research would be impacted by the order.",
      "On Wednesday, the White House said it was rescinding the memo but maintaining the funding pause \"to end any confusion\" created by a federal court order temporarily pausing implementation of the freeze.",
      "Mr. Trump's pick for director of OMB, Russ Vought, authored the section of Project 2025's policy book covering the Executive Office of the President, which includes the agency he has been tapped to lead.",
      "In it, he likens the budget office to an air-traffic control system for the president \"with the ability and charge to ensure that all policy initiatives are flying in sync and with the authority to let planes take off and, at times, ground planes that are flying off course.\"",
      "The memo may be aimed at sparking a legal challenge to the Impoundment Control Act, a 1974 law that limits the president's ability to unilaterally freeze certain funds appropriated by Congress, and in most cases requires the president instead to ask Congress to rescind spending legislation",
      "Vought said during his confirmation hearing last week that Mr. Trump believes the law is unconstitutional, and he agrees with that assessment.",
      "In Project 2025's policy blueprint, Vought also wrote the director of OMB must have \"sufficient visibility into the deep caverns of agency decision-making,\" and can achieve this by ensuring political appointees on his staff sign off on apportionments of funding authorized by Congress.",
      "Vought cited a 1870 law known as the Anti-Deficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending federal dollars in advance and requires funding be doled out in installments.",
      "\"This process, whereby agencies come to OMB for allotments of appropriated funding, is essential to the effective financial stewardship of taxpayer dollars,\" he wrote. \"OMB can then direct on behalf of a president the amount, duration, and purpose of any apportioned funding to ensure against waste, fraud, and abuse and ensure consistency with the president's agenda and applicable laws.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's pick to lead OMB has advocated for the White House to take aggressive steps to cut federal spending. He wrote the director should not be afraid to wield apportionments \"on behalf of the president's agenda\" and be willing to \"defend the power against attacks from Congress.\"",
      "During Vought's first stint as OMB director, the agency withheld roughly $214 million in security assistance to Ukraine. The Government Accountability Office later found the budget office had violated the Impoundment Control Act when it withheld the aid, and the House launched impeachment proceedings that accused the president of conditioning the assistance to Ukraine on its president announcing investigations that would benefit him politically.",
      "Mr. Trump was impeached by the House but acquitted by the Senate.",
      "Restricting gender-affirming care for minors",
      "Mr. Trump issued an executive order on Tuesday that bars the use of federal funds for gender-affirming care \u2014 puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical procedures \u2014 for people under the age of 19.",
      "Called \"Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,\" the order directs certain executive agencies to take steps to ensure medical institutions that receive federal grants \"end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\"",
      "It also instructs the secretary of defense to take regulatory action to exclude gender-affirming care for minors from insurance coverage provided by TRICARE, the Defense Department's health care program, and federal employee health benefit programs.",
      "Mr. Trump's order directs the head of the Department of Health and Human Services to withdraw March 2022 guidance on gender-affirming care.",
      "Project 2025's chapter on the Department of Health and Human Services calls for its Office of Civil Rights to \"remove all guidance issued under the Biden administration concerning sexual orientation and gender identity,\" including the March 2022 document.",
      "The book generally criticizes gender-affirming care as causing \"irreversible physical and mental harm to those who receive them\" and argues there is a lack of evidence surrounding it.",
      "Revoking security clearances for the former intelligence officials who signed a letter on Hunter Biden's laptop",
      "Mr. Trump took executive action to start the process of revoking the security clearances of dozens of former intelligence officials who signed a letter in 2020 claiming emails found on a laptop owned by Hunter Biden bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign.",
      "Project 2025 also proposed stripping former intelligence officials of security clearances, in a section on the intelligence community authored by Dustin Carmack, who worked at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "\"The president should immediately revoke the security clearances of any former directors, deputy directors, or other senior intelligence officials who discuss their work in the press or on social media without prior clearance from the current director,\" he wrote.",
      "Stripping civil servants of employment protections",
      "Among the slew of actions Mr. Trump took on his first day back in the White House was to reinstate an executive order issued during his first term that created \"Schedule F in the Excepted Service.\" The order creates a new employment category for many career civil servants, effectively stripping them of employment protections.",
      "The order states that in recent years, \"there have been numerous and well-documented cases of career federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership.\"",
      "\"Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service, beginning with positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character,\" Mr. Trump's order reads.",
      "The order makes some minor changes to the president's prior measure from October 2020. But it notably adds a section that states that while employees in these new \"Schedule Policy/Career Positions,\" are not required to personally or politically support the current president or his policies, they are \"required to faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability, consistent with their constitutional oath and the vesting of executive authority solely in the president.\"",
      "Failure to do so is grounds for termination of employment, Mr. Trump's executive order states.",
      "Project 2025 repeatedly calls for Mr. Trump's Schedule F proposal to be reinstated.",
      "Reinstating service members who refused COVID-19 Vaccines",
      "The president earlier this week issued an order directing the secretaries of Defense or Homeland Security to reinstate all service members, both active-duty and reserve, who were discharged after refusing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. His order also states they should be reverted to their former rank and receive full back pay, benefits, bonus payments or compensation.",
      "The Project 2025 blueprint's section on the Defense Department, authored by Chris Miller, calls for the next administration to \"reinstate servicemembers to active duty who were discharged for not receiving the COVID vaccine, restore their appropriate rank, and provide back pay.\"",
      "Miller served as acting defense secretary in the final weeks of Mr. Trump's first term. His chief of staff, Kash Patel, has been tapped by the president to lead the FBI.",
      "Transgender military ban",
      "During his first four years in the White House, Mr. Trump prohibited transgender people from serving in the military. President Biden repealed that ban, but the president earlier this week issued an order that effectively bars transgender people from serving in the armed forces and withdraws his predecessor's order.",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order states that \"expressing a false 'gender identity' divergent from an individual's sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\"",
      "Identifying as transgender, it continues, \"conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life.\"",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States Government to establish high standards for troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity. This policy is inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria,\" the president's order states. \"This policy is also inconsistent with shifting pronoun usage or use of pronouns that inaccurately reflect an individual's sex.\"",
      "Project 2025 calls for a reversal of policies \"that allow transgender individuals to serve in the military. Gender dysphoria is incompatible with the demands of military service.\"",
      "A hiring freeze",
      "On his first day in the White House, Mr. Trump issued a memorandum freezing hiring of federal civilian employees. Positions that were vacant as of his inauguration at noon on Jan. 20 should also not be filled, he said.",
      "The order was part of his plans to reduce the size of the federal workforce, also a recommendation made in the Project 2025 policy roadmap.",
      "The book, though, warns that while \"reducing the number of federal employees seems an obvious way to reduce the overall expense of the civil service,\" prior attempts to do by presidents of both parties \"did not lead to permanent and substantive reductions in the number of nondefense federal employees.\"",
      "Instead, Project 2025 suggests a \"freeze on all top career-position hiring to prevent 'burrowing-in' by outgoing political appointees.\"",
      "Withdrawing from World Health Organization",
      "Mr. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the World Health Organization in 2020 due to what his first administration said was a mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Biden reversed that decision when he took office, and Mr. Trump rolled back that move on his first day back in the White House.",
      "His latest order directed the secretary of state to inform the secretary-general of the United States and World Health Organization leadership of the U.S. decision to withdraw from the group.",
      "Project 2025, too, criticized the World Health Organization of its handling of the pandemic.",
      "\"The manifest failure and corruption of the World Health Organization (WHO) during the COVID-19 pandemic is an example of the danger that international organizations pose to U.S. citizens and interests,\" its book states.",
      "It said that when institutions act contrary to U.S. interests, the government \"must be prepared to take appropriate steps in response, up to and including withdrawal.\"",
      "Sending active-duty troops to the southern border",
      "Immigration was the topic of several executive actions taken by Mr. Trump on the first day of his presidency, including one order that assigns troops \"the mission to seal the borders and maintain the sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of the United States.\"",
      "The chapter of Project 2025's blueprint that covers the Department of Homeland Security was authored by Ken Cuccinelli, who served in the first Trump administration, and it, too, sees a role for the Defense Department in securing the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "The Pentagon, Cucinelli writes, should \"explicitly acknowledge and adjust personnel and priorities to participate actively in the defense, including using military personnel and hardware to prevent illegal crossings between ports of entry and channel all cross-border traffic to legal ports of entry.\"",
      "A section on the Justice Department urges the next administration to \"take a creative and aggressive approach\" to tackling criminal organizations at the southern border.",
      "\"This could include use of active-duty military personnel and National Guardsmen to assist in arrest operations along the border \u2014 something that has not yet been done,\" Project 2025's chapter on the Justice Department states.",
      "Limiting refugee admissions",
      "As of Monday, entry into the U.S. by refugees under the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program was suspended in accordance with an order by Mr. Trump on Jan. 20.",
      "His directive also orders the secretary of Homeland Security to suspend decisions on applications for refugee status.",
      "Mr. Trump has claimed that during the Biden administration, the U.S. has been \"inundated\" with high levels of migration, including through the Refugee Admissions Program.",
      "Project 2025, too, blames the Biden administration for overseeing what it says was a \"collapse\" of U.S. border security and immigration enforcement.",
      "To address this \"crisis,\" Project 2025 calls for \"rightsizing refugee admissions.\"",
      "\"The federal government's obligation to shift national security\u2013essential screening and vetting resources to the forged border crisis will necessitate an indefinite curtailment of the number of USRAP refugee admissions,\" its chapter on the State Department reads.",
      "The policy book calls for the State Department bureau that administers the Refugee Admissions Program to shift resources to challenges \"until the crisis can be contained and refugee-focused screening and vetting capacity can reasonably be restored.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump and billionaire Elon Musk have set their sights on the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, overseeing a disruption of the more than 60-year-old organization that provides humanitarian aid to more than 100 countries.",
      "The Trump administration's targeting of USAID comes as the president has vowed to cut the size of the federal government and tasked Musk with leading the effort to do so through his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has notified Congress that he is eyeing a potential reorganization, which could include merging it with the State Department.",
      "But critics of Mr. Trump's actions warn that the sweeping moves, which come just two weeks after he returned to office, threaten to put the nation at risk and undermine its credibility around the world. Lawmakers have also warned that any attempt to change the structure of USAID, an independent agency, would require action by Congress.",
      "\"If the United States is going to prevail in great power competition, we cannot afford to take a timeout from USAID programs that have long served to advance U.S. foreign policy goals,\" the top Democrats on the House and Senate Foreign Affairs Committees said in a letter last week to Jason Gray, who was then serving as acting USAID administrator. \"America needs to be active, and we must lead through our example.\"",
      "What is USAID?",
      "The U.S. Agency for International Development is the federal government's lead agency for international and development assistance. Established in 1961 when President John F. Kennedy signed the Foreign Assistance Act, USAID \"works to end extreme global poverty and enable resilient, democratic societies to realize their potential,\" according to an archived webpage from the agency.",
      "The aid the organization provides is aimed at furthering numerous goals, including strengthening democracy, protecting human rights, improving global health and advancing food security, the page said.",
      "USAID has more than 10,000 people in its workforce, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, and most of those employees \u2014 roughly two-thirds \u2014 are serving overseas. The agency has more than 60 country and regional missions.",
      "The agency is funded by taxpayer dollars authorized by Congress and reports to the secretary of state.",
      "According to an archived version of its website, USAID money has been used to provide nearly 9,000 ventilators to 43 countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, fund more than 150 local organizations to implement interventions for HIV and to launch the Countering Chinese Influence Fund. USAID said the fund will invest $300 million in programs to advance national security goals across several areas \"to build more resilient partners that are able to withstand pressure from the [Chinese Community Party] and other malign actors.\"",
      "USAID was created at the height of the Cold War as part of a recognition by Kennedy and his successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, of humanitarian aid as a form of diplomacy. With the agency outlasting the Cold War and new threats to U.S. interests emerging, Democrats in Congress have warned that Mr. Trump's gutting of USAID threatens the nation's ability to compete with China and Russia.",
      "What is the USAID budget?",
      "In fiscal year 2023, USAID managed more than $40 billion in appropriations, the Congressional Research Service said, a figure that is less than 1% of the federal budget.",
      "Most of that funding went to governance programs, followed by the humanitarian and health sectors, according to the report. The countries that received the most money in fiscal year 2023 were Ukraine, Ethiopia and Jordan.",
      "While the health sector received the most funding in the early 1990s, humanitarian assistance became the highest-funded area in fiscal year 2022 because of increases in aid following \"natural and human-induced humanitarian crises,\" according to the Congressional Research Service. Governance took the top spot for fiscal year 2023, though, because of U.S. support for Ukraine's government amid the country's war with Russia.",
      "The money approved for USAID by Congress is spent through the agency's \"implementing partners,\" which include private contractors, nonprofit organizations, foreign governments and international groups.",
      "What is going on with USAID now?",
      "The agency has come under significant scrutiny by Musk and DOGE, which Mr. Trump has tasked with shrinking the size of the federal government.",
      "Musk has repeatedly criticized USAID on X, the social media platform he owns, calling it a \"criminal organization\" that should \"die.\" He said early Monday that he had spoken with Mr. Trump about USAID and claimed the president agrees \"we should shut it down.\"",
      "\"USAID is a ball of worms. There is no apple and when there is no apple, you've just got to basically get rid of the whole thing,\" Musk said, adding the agency is \"beyond repair.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, meanwhile, told reporters Saturday that the agency has \"been run by a bunch of radical lunatics.\"",
      "There has been a flurry of activity targeting USAID and its employees over the past few days. Roughly 60 senior staff were placed on administrative leave last week and hundreds of contractors had their employment furloughed or terminated, sources told CBS News.",
      "Then, on Saturday, USAID's website went dark, and two top security officials with the humanitarian aid agency were placed on administrative leave after they refused to let personnel from DOGE access classified information in restricted areas, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Katie Miller, who works for DOGE, said on X that \"no classified material was accessed without proper security clearances.\"",
      "Matt Hopson, who was tapped by Mr. Trump to serve as USAID chief of staff, resigned Sunday, two staffers told CBS News. Agency staff were told USAID's headquarters in Washington, D.C., would be closed to them Monday, according to a notice they received.",
      "The turmoil at USAID is set against the backdrop of the Trump administration's 90-day freeze on foreign assistance, which has roiled programs worldwide and forced layoffs and furloughs. The order directed all U.S. diplomatic and consular posts to immediately issue \"stop-work\" orders for existing foreign assistance awards, pending review by the secretary.",
      "But the secretary of state later issued a waiver that applies to \"life-saving humanitarian assistance,\" defined as \"life-saving medicine, medical services, food, shelter, and subsistence assistance, as well as supplies and reasonable administrative costs as necessary to deliver such assistance.\"",
      "What will happen to USAID?",
      "House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast, a Republican from Florida, told \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that USAID would likely be \"rolled more closely\" under Rubio. He lamented that a fraction of what the agency spends goes to aid.",
      "\"I would be absolutely for, if that's the path we go down, removing USAID as a separate department\" and moving parts of it to the State Department, Mast said.",
      "A day later, three U.S. officials told CBS News that USAID would remain a humanitarian aid entity, but would be merged into the State Department with cuts to its funding and workforce. The Trump administration is expected to announce the changes in the coming days. Rubio has been named acting administrator of USAID, and he told Congress in a letter obtained by CBS News that he authorized Peter Marocco, director of Foreign Assistance at the State Department, to perform the duties of deputy administrator.",
      "The State Department said in a statement that Rubio has \"notified Congress that a review of USAID's foreign assistance activities is underway with an eye towards potential reorganization.\"",
      "Dr. Atul Gawande, former USAID Global Health Director, told Fox News the move to target the agency is \"dangerous for the United States and humanity.\"",
      "\"These are people shutting down an agency and having no clue the work that is being done. I'm a surgeon. I led Global Health at USAID, and I can tell you, this is where these are programs touching hundreds of millions of people around the world on a budget that's half the budget of the hospital where I do surgery,\" Gawande said.",
      "In a series of posts on X, Gawande said a pause on foreign assistance \"does serious damage to the world and the US.\" He also posted a list of examples on how this can impact global health, including stopping work on a deadly Marburg outbreak in Tanzania, a wide outbreak of a mpox variant killing children in west Africa and stopping critical work to eradicate polio.",
      "Some impacts hit even closer to home, as this also \"stops monitoring of bird flu in 49 countries, a disease which already killed an American on home soil,\" he wrote.",
      "\"Make no mistake \u2014 these essential, lifesaving activities are being halted right now. Consequences aren't in some distant future. They are immediate,\" he concluded his thread.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The American Civil Liberties Union on Monday filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging President Trump's move to close down the American asylum system, saying it violates legal obligations the U.S. has to offer refuge to migrants fleeing persecution.",
      "The lawsuit marks the first legal challenge against an executive action taken by Mr. Trump on his first day back at the White House that has allowed U.S. border officials to summarily deport migrants, without allowing them to request asylum.",
      "In that order, Mr. Trump invoked a muscular presidential power that allows officials to bar the entry of foreigners whose entry is determined to be \"detrimental\" to the U.S. He justified the sweeping move by accusing migrants of staging an \"invasion\" of the U.S. and posing a risk to the country's national security, public safety and public health.",
      "It's one of a flurry of actions the president has taken to launch his long-promised immigration crackdown. They include instructing the American military to aid in border enforcement, directing deportation officers to ramp up immigration arrests across the U.S. and suspending legal migration channels for foreigners, including Ukrainians and others from countries in turmoil.",
      "Though other American presidents, including former President Joe Biden, have sharply restricted asylum to try to curb illegal crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border, Mr. Trump's order is unprecedented, in its scope and legal rationale.",
      "By concluding that the country is facing an \"invasion\" of migrants, Mr. Trump effectively paused U.S. asylum law, which has required American immigration officials to at least interview people who say they fear being persecuted if deported.",
      "In its lawsuit, the ACLU asked the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to block officials from enforcing Mr. Trump's decree, which the civil rights organization said seeks to \"unilaterally override the protections Congress has afforded those fleeing danger.\"",
      "\"This proclamation is an unprecedented attempt to eliminate the entire asylum system created by Congress to protect desperate people fleeing grave persecution,\" said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney overseeing Monday's lawsuit.",
      "Following record levels of illegal crossings at the southern border during his first years in office, Biden enacted his own asylum crackdown in June 2024, invoking the same authority known as 212(f) that Mr. Trump is currently citing to shut down asylum processing.",
      "While it was also challenged by the ACLU, Biden's order was not as far-reaching as Trump's asylum ban and it contained some exemptions, including for migrants who were able to get an appointment through a government phone app to enter the U.S. at a legal border entry point. That app was shut down immediately after Mr. Trump took office.",
      "Biden's asylum restriction also allowed asylum officers to interview migrants who said they were scared of being harmed if deported from the U.S.",
      "While Mr. Trump has continued to describe the southern border as in \"crisis\" and facing an \"invasion,\" illegal crossings there have been at the lowest level in years. They first began to drop sharply early last year after Mexico increased efforts to interdict migrants and fell further following Biden's move to limit asylum.",
      "In January, which included over two weeks under Biden, Border Patrol recorded nearly 30,000 apprehensions of migrants crossing the southern border illegally, the lowest level since May 2020, a year that saw a dramatic reduction in migration due to COVID-era travel restrictions, according to unpublished government data obtained by CBS News.",

      "A: Any government shutdown could potentially affect an employee's pay regardless of whether he or she has accepted the deferred resignation offer.

    "story": [
      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014 Almost 96% of new cars registered in Norway in January were electric, an unparalleled proportion in the world and close to the country's goal of selling only zero-emission vehicles as of this year. A total of 9,343 new cars were sold in January, of which 8,954 were all-electric, the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) said.",
      "Of the 50 most-sold models, only two were non-electric, the first of which came in 33rd place, the OFV said.",
      "By comparison, the share of electric cars sold in Europe was just 13.6% in the full-year 2024 \u2014 a decline for the first time since 2020, according to the car manufacturers' lobby ACEA. Even that far out-paces EV sales in the U.S., where, according to MotorTrend data from last year, only about 6% of new vehicles sold were electric.",
      "With President Trump now in office after vows to reduce incentives on EV sales brought in under his predecessor, a continued downward trend in U.S. uptake is entirely possible.",
      "\"We've never seen this before... If the rest of the year continues like this, we will very soon be close to the 2025 goal,\" OFV director Oyvind Solberg Thorsen said in a statement. \"But if we want to cross the finish line with 100 percent electric cars, it will be necessary to maintain the incentives that make it profitable to choose an electric car over other models.\"",
      "Despite being a major oil and gas producer, Norway aims for all new cars sold to be \"zero emission\" starting in 2025, which is 10 years ahead of the goal set by the European Union, of which Norway is not a member.",
      "In contrast to Brussels' plans, Oslo has not banned the sale of cars with internal combustion engines, having instead opted for a system of generous tax breaks that have made them competitive against heavily taxed internal combustion cars.",
      "They have also benefitted from toll exemptions, free parking in public car parks, and the use of public transport traffic lanes.",
      "How Norway has driven the EV transition",
      "While some tax breaks and incentives have been rolled back over the years, electric cars have become commonplace on Norwegian roads.",
      "\"It was a decision primarily motivated by climate and environment considerations,\" Frode Hvattum, a 50-year-old father of three who owns two EVs, told AFP.",
      "\"Another reason was of course the benefits that come with them,\" he said, describing himself as a \"climate enthusiast.\"",
      "In his upscale neighborhood of Baerum in suburban Oslo, the streets are full of Teslas, Audis and Volkswagens. Competitively priced Chinese brands are increasingly appearing too.",
      "Many homes have a garage with an EV charger, in addition to Norway's vast national network of superfast charging stations that keep the nation rolling.",
      "That was a precondition for Hvattum, who, like many Norwegians, travels frequently by car to his chalet in the mountains several hours from Oslo.",
      "\"It's less complicated now that the network is so well-developed. You don't have to plan your trip as much as before,\" he said, adding that he uses the 15-20 minute charging breaks needed to make it up to the mountains to shop for food.",
      "Even if EV sales fail to meet the 100% mark this year, experts say that Norway can be seen as having met its goal.",
      "\"We should finish the year at between 95 and 100%, and probably even in the high end of this range,\" Christina Bu, head of the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association, told AFP.",
      "A new tax increase on internal combustion cars and rechargeable hybrids \u2014 which are cleaner but still run partially on gas or diesel \u2014 on April 1 should help.",

      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum angrily rejected an accusation by the United States Saturday that her government has an alliance with drug cartels, and vowed to retaliate against Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs.",
      "Tensions between the closely connected neighbors soared after the White House said Trump would slap 25% tariffs on Mexican as well as Canadian goods because of illegal immigration and drug smuggling. However,\u00a0 Mr. Trump announced Monday he is pausing U.S. tariffs targeting imports from Mexico for a month after Sheinbaum agreed to send 10,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to combat the flow of fentanyl.",
      "\"Mexico will reinforce the northern border with 10,000 members of the National Guard immediately, to stop drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States, in particular fentanyl,\" Sheinbaum posted on social media. \"The United States commits to work to stop the trafficking of high powered weapons to Mexico.\"",

      "Ebrard called Trump's tariffs a \"flagrant violation\" of the United States' free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada.",

      "\"If there is such an alliance anywhere, it is in the U.S. gun shops that sell high-powered weapons to these criminal groups,\" she added.",
      "\"If the United States government and its agencies wanted to address the serious consumption of fentanyl in their country, they can combat the sale of narcotics on the streets of their main cities, which they don't do, and the money laundering generated by this illegal activity that has done so much harm to their population,\" Sheinbaum said.",
      "Although U.S. politicians and analysts have previously alleged Mexican government collaboration with cartels, it is the first time that a formal accusation has been made, retired Mexican diplomat Agustin Gutierrez Canet said.",
      "\"It's really unprecedented that the U.S. government has now formally linked the Mexican government to drug trafficking in an official document,\" he told AFP.",
      "\"Trump uses this rhetoric to pressure but it should never be taken lightly,\" he added.",

Many booed the U.S. national anthem in an uncharacteristic show of frustration after more than 150 years of peaceful, friendly relations along the vast border separating the neighbors.",

      "\"First, I want to speak directly to Americans, our closest friends and neighbors,\" said Trudeau. \"This is a choice that, yes, will harm Canadians, but beyond that, it will have real consequences for you, the American people.\"",
      "\"Like the American tariffs, our response will also be far reaching and include everyday items such as American beer, wine and bourbon. Fruits and fruit juices including orange juice, along with vegetables, perfume, clothing and shoes. It will include major consumer products like household appliances, furniture and sports equipment, and materials like lumber and plastics, along with much, much more.\"",
      "\"Now is the time to choose products made right here in Canada,\" Trudeau added to his own constituents in a post on social media. \"Check the labels. Let's do our part. Wherever we can, choose Canada.\"",
      "The first round of Canada's tariffs will kick in at the stroke of midnight on Monday evening \u2013 on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods. In 21 days, the remainder of the tariffs, covering an additional $125 billion worth of products, will kick in unless some new agreement is reached between the countries. The delay, said Trudeau, was aimed at giving Canadian companies time to seek supply chain options to soften the financial blow.",
      "Speaking to ABC News on Sunday, Canada's Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman said many people in her country \"just don't understand where this is coming from... and probably, there's a little bit of hurt.\"",
      "Mexico:",
      "Canada's government is now looking south of the U.S. border, hoping to band together and increase trade ties with Mexico to help both nations absorb the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs. The two countries have agreed \"to enhance the strong bilateral relations\" they share and officials have had extensive bilateral meetings with their counterparts.",
      "President Sheinbaum, who haD already mocked Mr.Trump's move to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, said on social media before the pause was announced that countermeasures against the U.S. tariffs would soon be implemented.",
      "\"I've instructed my economy minister to implement the plan B we've been working on, which includes tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico's interests,\" Sheinbaum said, without specifying which U.S. goods her government might target, or whether she would seek to match the 25% retaliatory tariffs set to be imposed by Canada.",
      "Mexican goods exported to the U.S. are wide-ranging, and include vehicles and other auto industry components, crude oil, natural gas, avocados, tomatoes, pork and cheese.",
      "China:",
      "For Beijing, it was deja-vu. During Mr. Trump's first term, he slapped 25% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, then 10% on an additional $300 billion worth of imports, which meant virtually everything Chinese was tariffed.",
      "China's Ministry of Commerce released a statement over the weekend saying Beijing was \"strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposes\" the new 10% tariffs, that the U.S.'s \"unilateral increase in tariffs seriously violates WTO rules,\" and that China \"will file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization and take corresponding countermeasures,\" which implies Beijing will impose 10% retaliatory tariffs on select U.S.-made goods.",
      "Analysts say China better prepared than ever for trade war with U.S.",
      "Analysts say China better prepared than ever for trade war with U.S.",
      "In a Sunday statement, the Chinese Foreign Ministry didn't drop any hints as to what measures might be coming, but it said called \"on the United States to correct its wrongdoings, maintain the hard-won positive dynamics in the counternarcotics cooperation, and promote a steady, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relationship.\"",
      "The ministry said the U.S. should \"view and solve its own fentanyl issue in an objective and rational way,\" rather than \"threatening other countries with arbitrary tariff hikes.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he was imposing the new 10% tariff on Chinese goods in part due to what he considers Beijing's failure to stem the flow of fentanyl and chemicals used to make the drug.",
      "The foreign ministry in Beijing said China was \"one of the world's toughest countries on counternarcotics, both in terms of policy and its implementation.\"",
      "The European Union:",
      "Mr. Trump said over the weekend that tariffs on the European Union were coming, but he did not say when or how steep they would be.",
      "\"It will definitely happen with the European Union. I can tell you that because they've really taken advantage of us,\" the U.S. president told reporters Sunday. \"They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products. They take almost nothing and we take everything from them.\"",

      "\"We were listening carefully to those words, and of course we are preparing also on our side,\" EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Monday in Brussels, adding a warning that \"there are no winners in trade wars.\"",
      "If the Trump administration \"starts a trade war [with Europe], then the one laughing on the side is China,\" said Kallas. \"We are very interlinked.\"",
      "Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the leader of Europe's biggest economy, Germany, said the EU was strong enough to take the blow and respond to any U.S. tariffs, but added that \"the goal should be that things result in cooperation\" within Europe.",
      "For a quick fact check on Mr. Trump's criticism: He's not wrong about the lop-sided trade relationship between the U.S. and its close allies across the Atlantic. Through November 2024, the EU ran a trade deficit of $78 billion with the U.S., according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and reports indicate that's on track to be a new record.",
      "The question many economic analysts and politicians across the world will keep asking, however, is whether huge tariffs taxing that trade are likely to help balance the books.",
      "The United Kingdom:",
      "Speaking to reporters early on Monday, Mr. Trump said \"the U.K. is out of line but\u2026 I think that one can be worked out,\" suggesting his administration was at least willing to negotiate with London over a new bilateral trade deal.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Sunday that he had spoken with Mr. Trump and stressed that he wants \"a strong trading relationship\" with the U.S., but the U.K. leader, five years after the \"Brexit\" withdrawal from the European Union, may now find himself caught between the formidable trade forces of the EU on his doorstep and Washington.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs on the EU and his looming, if tempered threat to hit Britain with the same will complicate Starmer's nascent efforts to \"reset\" U.K. trade ties with the EU. He's at the helm of the U.K.'s first Labour Party government in a decade and a half, and it was the former Conservative leadership that ushered in Brexit and soured the long-standing close ties with Europe.",
      "Starmer has moved cautiously as he sets out to mend fences with the EU, wary of riling up conservative voters who supported Brexit and who, to some degree, now support populist politicians such as the Trump-aligned, anti-immigration leader of the Reform U.K. party, Nigel Farage.",
      "The prime minister has ruled out rejoining the EU customs union or its single currency market, and he's so far resisted pressure from the continent to ease post-Brexit restrictions on U.K. and EU citizens living and working on either side of the border, at least for young people.",
      "But he still needs to get U.K.-EU trade moving again, and the extent to which he chooses to keep the bloc next door at arm's length, or to try to reinstate the close trade ties of before Brexit, could directly impact his chances of nailing down a favorable new trade agreement with Washington.",
      "Speaking Monday, a spokesperson for Starmer's government called the U.K.'s trade relationship with the U.S. \"fair and balanced,\" calling Washington \"an indispensable ally and one of our closest trading partners.\"",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino Sunday amid his first overseas trip, as the Trump administration makes a push for control of the Panama Canal.",
      "Rubio, the first Latino secretary of state, made the trip in part to reiterate President Trump's concern that China has too much influence over the Panama Canal, and needs control of the waterway for economic security, though Mulino has refuted the claim. Rubio toured the canal on Sunday and doubled down on the administration's plan to make immediate changes, according to his office spokesperson, Tammy Bruce.",
      "\"Secretary Rubio also emphasized the importance of collaborative efforts to end the hemisphere's illegal migration crisis and thanked President Mulino for his support of a joint repatriation program, which has reduced illegal migration through the Darien Gap,\" Bruce said in a statement.",
      "Speaking at the U.S. embassy, the secretary of state said that Panama is very important to the U.S. and thanked all the staff that serve the embassy.",
      "The Panama Canal serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. And although the U.S. led the construction of the major waterway that around 40% of the world's cargo ship traffic now moves through, its control was given to Panama in 1999.",
      "In the meeting, Rubio told the Panamanian leader that Mr. Trump has determined that China's influence on the Panama Canal is \"a threat to the canal and represents a violation of the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal,\" a spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Meanwhile, President Trump on Saturday signed an executive order that imposes 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, which come after months of threatening to do so as he seeks to leverage trade policy even against some of the U.S.' largest economic allies.",
      "Mr. Trump acknowledged Sunday that there may be \"some pain\" with the tariffs in a social media post. But he argued that \"it will all be worth the price that must be paid.\"",
      "The tariffs come in part to curb the flow of undocumented immigrants, as well as illicit drugs, into the U.S. And Rubio's first overseas visit to Central America and the Caribbean, of which Panama is the initial stop, also comes as the Trump administration seeks cooperation on its immigration policy from nearby countries, like Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic.",
      "Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, criticized the president's move on Sunday, saying in an appearance on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the tariffs are \"going to end up costing consumers,\" with increased prices on goods from avocados and beer to cars and trucks.",

      "A series of earthquakes near the\u00a0Greek island of Santorini\u00a0have led authorities to shut down schools, dispatch rescue teams with sniffer dogs and send instructions to residents including a request to drain their swimming pools.",
      "Even though earthquake experts say the more than 200 tremors that have hit the area since early Friday are not related to the volcano in Santorini, which once produced one of the biggest eruptions in human history, locals are on edge.",
      "The strongest earthquake recorded was magnitude 4.6 at 3:55 p.m. Sunday, at a depth of 14 kilometers (9 miles), the Athens Geodynamic Institute said. A few tremors of over magnitude 4 and dozens of magnitude 3 have followed. There were no reports of damage or casualties.",
      "Earthquake experts and officials from the Ministry of Climate Crisis and Civil Protection and the fire service have been meeting daily and decided to close schools on Monday on the island of Santorini as well as nearby Amorgos, Anafi and Ios.",

      "Island residents have been advised to avoid large open-air events and to move about the islands mindful of rockfalls. All four islands have steep cliffs and, in the case of Santorini, a large part of the main town is built on a cliffside.",
      "Experts said it was impossible to predict whether the seismic activity could lead to a stronger tremor, but added that the area could potentially produce a 6-magnitude quake.",
      "Mild earthquakes have also been recorded in Santorini's volcano caldera, which is mostly undersea, since September. The strongest one with magnitude 3.8 occurred on Jan. 25. Since then, seismic activity inside the volcano has subsided, experts say.",
      "The Santorini volcano eruption at about 1600 B.C. devastated the island, buried a town, and caused massive earthquakes and flooding that impacted the island of Crete and as far as Egypt. Experts estimate that up to 41.3 cubic kilometers (9.8 cubic miles) of rocks were ejected and 9-meter (29-foot) tsunamis hit Crete.",
      "In the 1990s, the Santorini volcano was designated one of 16 volcanoes around the world that need to be monitored because of past massive eruptions and proximity to dense population areas.",

    "summary": "Mediators begin the daunting work of brokering the next phase of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas this week.",
    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is on his way to the United States for a pivotal meeting with President Trump during which they are expected to discuss \"victory over Hamas\" and expanding diplomatic relations with Arab countries.",
      "The meeting Tuesday at the White House will be Mr. Trump's first with a foreign leader since returning to office on Jan. 20. It comes as the fragile truce between Israel and Hamas in Gaza holds and mediators begin the daunting work of brokering the next phase of the agreement.",
      "Hamas, which has quickly reasserted its control over Gaza since the ceasefire took hold last month, \u00a0is expected to free a total of 33 Israeli hostages during the first, six-week phase of the ceasefire and hostage release deal, which took effect on Jan. 19. After the release on Saturday, 18 have been freed so far.",
      "The militant group has said it will not release the hostages slated to go free in the second phase without an end to the war and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.",
      "In a statement released ahead of his departure on Sunday, Netanyahu said he and Mr. Trump would discuss \"victory over Hamas, achieving the release of all our hostages and dealing with the Iranian terror axis in all its components,\" referring to Iran's alliance of militant groups across the region, including Hamas.",
      "He said that that by working together, they could \"strengthen security, broaden the circle of peace and achieve a remarkable era of peace through strength.\"",
      "Netanyahu also said it was \"telling\" that he was the first foreign leader to be meeting with Mr. Trump since his return to the White House.",
      "\"I think it's a testimony to the strength of the Israeli-American alliance,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu is under mounting pressure from far-right governing partners to resume the war after the first phase ends in early March. He has said Israel is still committed to victory over Hamas and the return of all the hostages captured in the militants' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war.",
      "It's unclear where Mr. Trump stands.",
      "He has been a staunch supporter of Israel but has also pledged to end wars in the Middle East and took credit for helping to broker the ceasefire agreement.",
      "The deal has halted the fighting and led to the release of 18 hostages who had been held for over 15 months, as well as hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.",
      "An Israeli airstrike on a vehicle in central Gaza wounded five people on Sunday, including a child who was in critical condition, according to Al-Awda Hospital, which received the casualties. The Israeli military said it fired upon the vehicle because it was bypassing a checkpoint while heading north in violation of the ceasefire agreement. The military said it remains committed to the deal.",
      "The war began when thousands of Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostages. Over 100 hostages were freed during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023, eight have been rescued alive and dozens of bodies have been recovered by Israeli forces.",
      "Israel's air and ground war has killed over 47,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Hamas-run health authorities who do not say how many of the dead were fighters.",
      "Negotiations on the second phase, in which the war would end and the remaining 60 or so hostages would be returned, are set to begin Monday. If the United States, Qatar and Egypt are unable to broker an agreement between Israel and Hamas, the war could resume in early March.",
      "Aspirations for a bigger deal",
      "Mr. Trump's Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, joined the yearlong ceasefire negotiations in their final weeks last month and helped push the agreement over the finish line. He met with Netanyahu in Israel last week and the two were expected to formally begin talks on the second phase in Washington on Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump, who brokered normalization agreements between Israel and four Arab countries in his first term, is believed to be seeking a wider and potentially historic agreement in which Israel would forge ties with Saudi Arabia.",
      "But the kingdom, which resisted similar entreaties from the Biden administration, has said it would only agree to such a deal if the war ends and there is a credible pathway to a Palestinian state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.",
      "Netanyahu's government is opposed to Palestinian statehood, and a key partner, far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, has threatened to leave the governing coalition if the war is not resumed next month. That would raise the likelihood of early elections in which Netanyahu could be voted out.",

    "story": [
      "A pregnant woman believed to have lived over a thousand years ago in Ecuador's coastal region may have been part of ritual sacrifice or punishment, according to archaeologists who excavated her remains in 2022.",
      "In a study published last month by Cambridge University Press on behalf of the\u00a0Society for American Archaeology, experts detailed their analysis of the remains of the young woman, dubbed Burial 10, which dated between AD 771 and AD 953. She was approximately 17 to 20 years old at the time of her death, and her hands and left leg were removed at or near the time of her death, researchers said.",
      "Archaeologists found that her burial is significant because she was pregnant at the time. The young woman's remains showed a cranial fracture and cut marks on her hand bones, which led them to hypothesize that she may have been sacrificed.",
      "\"Perimortem trauma, including a cranial fracture and cutmarks on hand bones, perimortem removal of the hands and left leg, and other body manipulation suggest she was sacrificed, a rare event for coastal Ecuadorian peoples,\" researchers wrote.",
      "Although human sacrifice in coastal Ecuador is rare, the positioning of the body and missing limbs suggest possible ritual significance, the study said.",
      "Her eyes were covered with two ark clam shells. There was a large green clay stone nearby and several ceramic fragments on her forehead, according to the study. Crescent-shaped spondylus mascaras, or mollusk shells, were found around the body.",
      "She was also buried with spondylus pendants and beads, known as chaquira, from various cultural traditions and periods.",
      "The woman is believed to be part of the Mante\u00f1o people, who lived along the Ecuadorian coast and survived by agriculture and seafaring, but the eye coverings were not consistent with typical Mante\u00f1o burials, researchers said. The green stone represented a link between death and fertility for Valdivian burials, a different group of coastal people which predated the Mante\u00f1o by nearly 2,000 years, according to experts. Mascaras were also typically linked to practices of Valdivians.",
      "\"To accumulate so many artifacts required purposeful collection and curation before inclusion in this burial,\" the study said. \"Interpretation of this burial must ultimately consider these repeated emphases and ties to the past to understand the reasons for this enigmatic burial.\"",
      "The burial also included a burnt offering placed in the thoracic cavity, researchers said. However, such rituals have been found to occur later between AD 991-1025, which would indicate that the woman's grave was revisited and possibly used for other rituals.",

      "\"But Trump may want to think twice before he eliminates the department as it has important clubs to promote his agenda,\" Epstein said. \"The department is the principal enforcement agency to protect women's sports, prevent discrimination through DEI quotas for favored groups, stop harboring antisemitism, and to address the rather blatant intellectually intolerant, partisan, anti Western ideological factories they have become. To do that, Trump might be well advised to keep the department of education and its core enforcement functions while scaling down its size.\"",

      "Rubio blasted USAID for being \"completely unresponsive\" telling Fox \"they don\u2019t consider that they work for the U.S., they just think they\u2019re a global entity and that their master is the globe and not the United States, and that\u2019s not what the statute says, and that\u2019s not sustainable.\"",

If they did, they'd be out there competing with us in these places. But my point is this, even if they did that, why would we fund things that are against our national interests or don't further our national interests, whether China is there or not? If China wants to waste our money on something that's against their China, their national interests, go ahead and do it. We're not going to do it.\"",
      "Monday evening, the group and labor union that represents U.S. foreign service workers, released a statement opposing the Trump administration's actions regarding USAID. \"The American Foreign Service Association (AFSA) strongly objects to the administration\u2019s decision to dismantle the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). This will undermine U.S. national security, may subvert Congressional authority, and demonstrates a lack of respect for the dedication of the development professionals who serve America\u2019s interests abroad.\"",

      "Amid scrutiny over Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s pledge to transfer his financial interest in vaccine lawsuits to his family, legal experts have criticized the move but note that Kennedy's approach is not significantly different from actions taken by other public officials in the past.",
      "During Kennedy's confirmation hearings last week, the potential next secretary of Health and Human Services was probed over his financial stake in personal-injury lawsuits tied to vaccines, in particular his ties to a suit against pharmaceutical company Merck and its Gardasil cervical cancer vaccine. While Kennedy would not initially commit to letting go of his stake against Merck, he reversed course in a written response to lawmakers' questions following a hearing, noting he would amend his pledge and \"will divest my interest in any such litigation via an assignment to my non-dependent, adult son.\"",
      "While some legal experts have argued the move does not go far enough to quash potential conflicts for Kennedy, others say this approach is akin to that taken by several other public officials who have found themselves in a similar situation. Meanwhile, one legal expert suggested to Fox News Digital that the pass from Kennedy to his son \"is more than sufficient to meet any ethical concerns.\"",

      "\"That may comply with ordinary conflict of interest issues,\" Jim Copland, director of legal policy at the Manhattan Institute, said. \"I just don't think the head of the Department of Health and Human Services has any business being involved in any way with litigation against Merck.\"",
      "Fellow Manhattan Institute legal expert Ilya Shapiro said he is unsure whether Kennedy's move will suffice in avoiding any real conflict, but added that he did recognize \"it's not unusual in light of past examples.\"",
      "Both Democrats and Republicans have used family to shield themselves from ethics complaints related to their personal business dealings, with former President Joe Biden being a recent and notable example after a multi-year probe into his family business dealings that found both his son and brother were engaged in risky business relationships with foreign entities, such as China. Biden has repeatedly denied his involvement in those business dealings.",

In response to questions from reporters about whether she agreed with efforts to ban federal lawmakers' spouses from trading in stocks, Pelosi replied that \"they should be able to participate in that.\"",
      "Other notable figures who have used their families to shield their personal business dealings include President Donald Trump, who handed over control of his Trump Organization business empire to his sons, and the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein, whose investor husband, Richard Blum, managed investments through his firm Blum Capital Partners that often intersected with his wife's work while she was in Congress.",

      "\"It is my opinion that RFK, Jr.\u2019s plan to pass on any financial stake in possible vaccine injuries to his son is more than sufficient to meet any ethical concerns,\" Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital. \"This is particularly true because of the limitations imposed by federal law on any claims made against vaccine manufacturers that severely limit possible compensation for anyone claiming a vaccine was somehow defective.\"",
      "Spakovsky posited that the federal government's National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, which prohibits civil litigation against drugmakers and instead directs the federal government to administer any vaccine-injury payments, serves to buffer the impact Kennedy could potentially have on vaccine-related injury payments.",
      "\"RFK would have no authority whatsoever [over this program],\" he said. \"The point is that all of this is so disconnected from RFK, Jr.\u2019s potential Cabinet position if he is confirmed, that anyone who says this is a \u2018serious\u2019 ethics problem is wrong.\"",
      "Activists attend a press conference on Supreme Court ethics reform outside the Capitol on May 2, 2023.",
      "Copland, who agreed with Spakovsky that the vaccine compensation program diminishes much of Kennedy's advantage, said RFK Jr. could still benefit in an indirect manner.",
      "\"I think it's a more concerning conflict of interest than just saying, \u2018Oh, you own a lot of equity interest in some company that may incidentally benefit you know,\u2019\" Copland said. \"I mean, if you had a Defense Department secretary who was a CEO of a major military contractor, and then he passes that off to his son, I think you'd still have a concern about that due to the obvious conflict of interest there, which is different than a sort of ordinary, 'Oh, I own a company, and it's going to, incidentally, benefit from the government.'\"",
      "RFK JR SPENT WEEKEND TALKING TO KEY SENATOR WHO COULD MAKE OR BREAK HIS CONFIRMATION",
      "Fox News legal analyst Andy McCarthy was more critical of Kennedy's decision to pass off his financial interests to his son, noting that the fact he is \"struggling to come up with a scheme to retain his stake, rather than doing the obvious right thing by abandoning it, underscores that this is a real conflict of interest.\"",
      "\"The comparison to family asset transfers in other contexts is inapposite and, in any event, misses the point,\" McCarthy said. \"Whatever one thinks of President Trump\u2019s arrangements regarding his family business, voters knew about that business and elected him anyway \u2013 and the president is not in a position to recuse himself from executive decision-making based on conflicts of interest. By contrast, Kennedy wasn\u2019t elected by anyone.\"",

    "summary": "A new scam using Elon Musk&apos;s name is making the rounds, promoting &quot;energy-saving&quot; devices and falsely linking the Tesla and SpaceX leader to the products.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says cybercriminals are exploiting iMessage phishing protection, tricking users to reactivate links.",
      "Elon Musk, known for leading companies like Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and xAI and buying and rebranding Twitter as X, often finds his name linked to innovation and futuristic ideas. But his reputation also makes him a prime target for scammers.",
      "In the past, fraudsters have used Musk\u2019s name in cryptocurrency schemes. Now, a new scam is making the rounds. This time, scammers are promoting bogus \"energy-saving\" devices, falsely associating Musk with these products to gain credibility. These devices, which don\u2019t work as advertised, are being marketed as revolutionary solutions, duping people into spending money on what is essentially a scam.",
      "We received this email from Rick in Wilkesboro, North Carolina: \"I\u2019ve been receiving emails offering an energy-saving device developed by Elon Musk. It claims the device can reduce energy bills by 50%. I never attempted to contact anyone associated with Elon Musk, nor have I done any internet searches for such a device. Are these emails legit or another attempt by scammers hoping I click on their links?\"",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "Rick, it sounds like those emails are likely scams. There have been numerous reports of scammers using Elon Musk's name to promote fake energy-saving devices. These scams often claim that the device can drastically reduce energy bills, but there is no evidence that Elon Musk or any of his companies are involved in such products.",
      "Let's dive into how this scam works and share some ways you can stay safe.",
      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does Elon Musk's energy-saving scam work?",
      "The Elon Musk energy-saving scam works by using flashy online ads, unsolicited emails and other deceptive tactics to lure victims. Scammers promote so-called \"revolutionary\" devices through social media, pop-ups, emails and even search engine ads, claiming the products are backed by Musk.",
      "These ads often include fake customer reviews, exaggerated claims of slashing electricity bills by 50% or more and time-limited discounts to create urgency. Names of devices advertised in these scams include the Power Pro Save, Heunwa Power Save, Stop Watt, Miracle Watt, True Watt, Real Watt, Watt Rescue, Esaver Watt, Pro Power Save, Voltmod and more.",
      "Clicking on these ads leads you to sales websites designed to look legitimate. They feature fake logos, doctored before-and-after photos and bogus celebrity endorsements to build trust. The sites throw around pseudo-scientific jargon like \"stabilizing electrical currents\" or \"rebalancing loads\" to sound convincing. They also use tactics like showing inflated \"regular\" prices crossed out to make the current offer seem like a huge bargain.",
      "If you look closely, though, the red flags are clear. These sites lack basic details like a company address, contact number or business registration information. Instead, they push you to place an order through an online form, demanding full payment upfront via credit card or PayPal.",
      "After paying, customers might receive a cheap, non-functional plastic device, or sometimes nothing at all. These devices don\u2019t reduce electricity usage. They might even waste more power. But by the time you realize it, the scammers have already pocketed your money.",
      "Elon Musk scam email ads (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DON\u2019T CLICK THAT LINK! HOW TO SPOT AND PREVENT PHISHING ATTACKS IN YOUR INBOX",
      "The truth about energy-saving devices",
      "Over the years, plenty of power-saving scams have promised to cut down or even eliminate your electricity bill by simply plugging in their devices. The reality is that there\u2019s no device you can plug in that will actually reduce your electricity usage or lower your household bill.",
      "These products often claim to \"stabilize voltage\" or \"reduce power waste.\" While voltage stabilization can be useful in industrial settings, it doesn\u2019t make much difference for typical home appliances. Most household appliances are already designed to run efficiently without the issues these devices claim to fix.",
      "If you\u2019re serious about saving on electricity, focus on\u00a0practical solutions like upgrading to energy-efficient appliances, using smart home devices or adjusting your energy usage schedule.",

      "Red flags to watch out for",
      "Too good to be true: Claims of reducing energy bills by 50% or more are often exaggerated and unrealistic.",
      "Unsolicited emails: Receiving emails out of the blue, especially when you haven't shown interest in such products, is a common tactic used by scammers.",
      "Use of celebrity names: Scammers frequently use well-known names like Elon Musk to lend credibility to their schemes.",
      "Suspicious links: Be cautious of clicking on links in unsolicited emails. They can lead to phishing sites designed to steal your personal information. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "10 ways to stay safe from such scams",
      "1. Verify the email: Phishing emails are a common tool scammers use to trick people into buying fake products or giving away personal information. These emails often look like they\u2019re from legitimate sources, but they contain links that lead to fraudulent websites or prompt you to download malicious attachments. Always check the sender's email address and look for signs of a fake message, like poor grammar or urgent calls to action.",
      "2. Verify claims: If you're curious about a product, do some research from reputable sources before taking any action.",
      "3. Do not click links: Avoid clicking on any links or downloading attachments from these emails. Instead, hover over the link to see its true destination. This can help you identify if it leads to a legitimate site or a malicious one.",
      "4. Have strong antivirus software actively running on your devices: Ensure you have reliable antivirus software installed on your devices. Antivirus software helps protect your devices from malware, viruses and other security threats. Regularly update the software to ensure it can detect and remove the latest threats. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Examine the website carefully: Scammers often create websites that look professional, but they\u2019re easy to spot with a few simple checks. Look for missing or suspicious information, like the absence of a business address, phone number or business registration details. If there are fake testimonials or celebrity endorsements, that\u2019s a red flag.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "6. Don\u2019t fall for \"too good to be true\" deals:\u00a0Scammers rely on offering deals that seem too good to pass up, like massive discounts or a \"limited time offer.\" If an ad claims you can save 50% or more on a product, be skeptical. Real, quality products usually don\u2019t come with such extreme savings, and high-tech devices like those promoted by scammers rarely live up to the hype. If it feels like too good a deal, it probably is.",
      "7. Watch out for unusual payment methods: One of the easiest ways to spot a scam is by how the scammers ask you to pay. If a website asks for payment upfront via credit card or PayPal with no option to verify or ship the product first, it's a major red flag. Scammers take your money upfront and have no intention of sending you anything of value. Stick to reputable payment methods that offer buyer protection and avoid sites that ask for payment without proper verification.",
      "8. Mark spam email as junk or spam: Most email providers have a\u00a0feature that allows you to flag spam emails and move them to a separate folder. This can help you filter out spam emails from your inbox and also improve the spam detection of your email provider.",
      "9. Do not share your email address publicly or with unknown sources: This can reduce the chances of your email address being collected by spammers. You can also use a disposable email or email alias for signing up for online services that you do not trust or need.",
      "10. Use a personal data removal service:\u00a0Scammers can obtain your information from various online sources, including data brokers, people search sites and public records. Using a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to access your personal information. This proactive step can be crucial in preventing identity theft and minimizing the chances of falling victim to scams.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "YOUR EMAIL DIDN'T EXPIRE, IT'S JUST ANOTHER SNEAKY SCAM",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Impersonation scams are a common way scammers steal your money. They often use well-known names like Elon Musk or big companies like Microsoft and Walmart to make you trust them, then trick you into giving away your financial details. To stay safe, avoid unsolicited emails or texts that promote products or offers. If you need to buy something, stick to trusted sellers like Amazon, Best Buy or other reputable platforms. Always double-check the legitimacy of any offer before making a purchase, especially if it comes from an unfamiliar source.",

      "Apple\u2019s closed ecosystem and strict App Store policies limit the risk of malware, and its centralized software updates ensure better security. In contrast, Android\u2019s openness allows users to install apps from various sources, and updates are often rolled out at different times, making it more vulnerable to attacks.",
      "However, iPhones aren\u2019t immune to security flaws. Hackers occasionally find ways to exploit them, as seen in Apple\u2019s latest advisory. The company recently discovered that a vulnerability in iOS had been exploited for over a year.

The vulnerability is a \"zero-day\" flaw, meaning criminals may have already exploited it, according to the latest security advisory from the company. Zero-day flaws like this are especially dangerous because they are exploited before developers can issue fixes. Apple confirmed this marks its first zero-day patch of 2025. The vulnerability affects iPhones dating back to 2018\u2019s XS model, as well as newer iPads, Macs, and even the Vision Pro headset.",
      "The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-24085, resides in Apple\u2019s Core Media framework, a software layer responsible for processing multimedia files. A \"use after free\" memory corruption error enabled hackers to manipulate the system into executing unstable code, granting them elevated privileges to bypass security protocols. Apple\u2019s advisory suggests hackers weaponized the flaw through malicious apps disguised as legitimate media players. These apps likely abused the Core Media framework by triggering corrupted files, enabling attackers to infiltrate devices.",
      "The attacks reportedly targeted iOS versions predating 17.2, released in December 2023, meaning the vulnerability may have been active since late 2022. Security experts speculate that hackers focused on high-value individuals \u2014 such as activists, executives or journalists \u2014 to avoid detection. The prolonged stealth of the campaign underscores the challenges of identifying sophisticated, narrowly tailored exploits.",
      "This underscores the critical need for you to update your devices to iOS 17.2 or later, as these versions include essential fixes to safeguard against this actively exploited vulnerability.",

      "1. Keep your iPhone updated:\u00a0I can\u2019t say this enough.\u00a0Updating your iPhone regularly is one of the most effective ways to protect it from security threats. Apple frequently releases updates that fix vulnerabilities, including critical zero-day flaws.",
      "2. Download apps only from the App Store: To minimize the risk of installing malware, only download apps from the official App Store. Apple\u2019s strict app review process helps prevent malicious apps from being published, but some threats can still slip through. Always verify app details, check reviews and be cautious about app permissions before installation.",
      "3. Enable lockdown mode for extra protection: For those of you who may be at higher risk, such as journalists or executives,\u00a0Lockdown Mode provides an additional layer of security. This feature limits certain device functionalities to prevent sophisticated cyberattacks. It can be turned on via\u00a0Settings >\u00a0Privacy & Security >\u00a0Lockdown Mode and is especially useful for those concerned about targeted threats.",
      "4. Enable message filtering: Use your device's built-in filtering options to sort messages from unknown senders. This feature allows you to automatically sort messages from unknown senders, easily filter unread messages\u00a0and manage your message inbox more efficiently. Here are steps:",
      "Open\u00a0Settings.Scroll down and click\u00a0Apps.\u00a0Tap\u00a0Messages.Turn on\u00a0Filter Unknown Senders",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Stay cautious of phishing attacks and install strong antivirus software:\u00a0Phishing remains one of the most common tactics used by hackers. Be cautious when receiving unsolicited messages or emails on your iPhone, especially those with suspicious links or attachments. Always verify the sender before opening anything. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Review your security and privacy settings: Regularly reviewing your iPhone\u2019s security settings can help you maintain strong protection. You should also review app permissions in\u00a0Settings > Privacy & Security to restrict access to sensitive data, such as location or contacts. Enable\u00a0Face ID or Touch ID for secure access and turn on two-factor authentication (2FA) for Apple ID and other accounts.\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message or authentication app, in addition to your password. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if your password is compromised.",
      "7. Invest in personal data removal services: By reducing your online footprint, you make it harder for cybercriminals to obtain your contact information, potentially preventing them from sending you deceptive phishing texts and emails in the first place. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "This iOS vulnerability is a serious reminder of the importance of staying up to date with software updates. If you\u2019re using an iPhone from 2018 or later, make sure you\u2019ve updated to iOS 17.2 or later as soon as possible. Hackers exploited a hidden flaw for over a year, using fake media apps to gain access to devices. While Apple has now patched the issue, the fact that it remained undetected for so long is concerning.",

      "Hackers leverage the trust in Google's services to carry out their attacks. Victims receive seemingly authentic meeting invites via Google Calendar. Upon clicking links within these invites, they are taken to fake web pages that prompt them to input personal data. Once compromised, this information can be used for\u00a0identity theft, financial fraud and unauthorized access to other accounts. Security experts warn that attackers are now using AI to craft highly convincing fake invitations, making it even harder to spot the fraud. Reacting to the findings from Check Point, a spokesperson for Google said:",

      "The defense minster said Greece\u2019s tense relations with Turkey have made its defensive posture in NATO unique because it has forced Athens to be on top of its defense spending, an issue that has once again become a top matter of discussion in the NATO alliance due to Trump\u2019s push to have all nations meet a 5% GDP spending limit, up from 2%.",
      "The latest NATO spending figures released in June 2024 show Greece was the fifth-highest spender on defense in the alliance, spending more than 3% of its GPD, while Turkey came in 18th and spent just over 2% of its GDP on defense.",

Businessmen in North Kivu, are blunt: Rwanda and Uganda charge less in customs duties than Kinshasa extracts in taxes. Kinshasa cries wolf because Kigali outcompetes them. If Kinshasa wanted businessmen to turn to them, try lowering taxes and building plants to turn raw materials into something with higher sale value.\"",

Matt Gaetz\u2019s bid for attorney general, Senate Republicans have also been overwhelmingly deferential in supporting Trump\u2019s nominees amid pressure from his allies to get on board with picks like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. More controversial nominations are ahead, like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s for health and human services secretary and Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s for director of national intelligence.",
      "USAID under attack",
      "Musk said Monday that the government efficiency department Trump put him in charge of was \u201cshutting down USAID,\u201d and agency employees were told that they would not be allowed to enter their Washington headquarters and should work from home. Later in the day, Trump suggested USAID had been engaged in \u201cfraud\u201d and said he had appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio as its acting administrator.",
      "Rubio notified Congress that \u201ca review of USAID\u2019s foreign assistance activities is underway with an eye towards potential reorganization,\u201d the State Department said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been 20 or 30 years where people tried to reform it, and it refuses to reform. It refuses to cooperate,\u201d Rubio said of USAID during a visit to El Salvador on Monday. \u201cWhen we were in Congress, we couldn\u2019t even get answers to basic questions about programs. ... That\u2019s not going to continue.\u201d",
      "Asked by NBC News whether Trump could unilaterally dismantle USAID without congressional action, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., refused to criticize Trump and echoed Rubio\u2019s frustrations that the agency has not shared information about how it is spending tax dollars.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a lot more about finding out how the dollars are being spent, where they\u2019re going and whether or not they\u2019re consistent with the administration and our country\u2019s priorities when it comes to our national interests,\u201d Thune said.",
      "At the end of his first week in office, Trump fired 18 independent inspectors general, who were tasked with investigating instances of fraud, waste and abuse within federal agencies. Democrats and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said Trump\u2019s move violated a law Grassley helped write that requires the president to give 30 days\u2019 notice to Congress before he removed an inspector general and say why.",
      "Still, Grassley was largely deferential to Trump.",
      "\u201cThere may be good reason the IGs were fired. We need to know that if so,\u201d he said at the time.",
      "Last week, Republicans appeared to be caught off-guard after the Trump White House tried to unilaterally pause all federal loans and grants \u2014 previously approved by Congress \u2014 so it could review that the money was not funding initiatives it opposed. GOP leaders rallied behind the planned funding freeze, with House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., an institutionalist and 22-year congressional veteran, saying he had \u201cno problem\u201d with Trump\u2019s actions and others calling it perfectly \u201clegal.\u201d",
      "Hours later, after Trump rescinded the order that froze grants and loans and sparked confusion across the country, Republicans applauded the move. A federal judge also temporarily blocked Trump\u2019s freeze last week, though U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan said Monday that some forms of federal aid still appear to be frozen.",
      "Democrats make a stand",
      "With majorities in the House and the Senate, Republicans could use committees to launch investigations and subpoena Trump officials for records and testimony. But for now, that is not likely to happen. Congressional Republicans are working closely with Trump to pass his agenda on expanding energy production, boosting border security and cutting taxes.",
      "So it has fallen to Democrats in the minority to find ways to try to stop him.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in a letter Monday that Democrats will announce legislation \u201cto prevent unlawful access\u201d to the Treasury payment system \u201cthat contains highly confidential and personal information related to Social Security and Medicare recipients, taxpayers, households, nonprofits, businesses and federal contractors.\u201d The measure could test GOP willingness to put a check on Trump\u2019s move.",
      "Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., called on Democrats to \u201cfight back\u201d against Trump and Musk, urging them to vote no on all future nominees. And Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, which oversees USAID and the State Department, threatened Monday to place a \u201cblanket hold\u201d and stall all of Trump\u2019s State Department nominees in response to his attacks on USAID.",
      "\u201cDismantling USAID is illegal and makes us less safe. USAID was created by federal law and is funded by Congress. Donald Trump and Elon Musk can\u2019t just wish it away with a stroke of a pen \u2014 they need to pass a law,\u201d Schatz said in a statement.",
      "Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a moderate, warned that if Trump has \u201cgravely wounded\u201d USAID and that if he succeeds at unilaterally abolishing it, then a future president could also ignore appropriations laws.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s some disagreement about USAID,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the much more fundamental fight is over whether an agreement in appropriations that is a law will be respected and can hold.\u201d",
      "Earlier Monday, a group of House and Senate Democrats was blocked from entering USAID\u2019s headquarters at the Ronald Reagan Building. Outside, they showed support for USAID workers and decried Musk\u2019s push to hollow out the agency.",
      "\u201cWe are going to fight in every way we can, in the courts, in public opinion, with the bully pulpit, in the halls of Congress and here at AID itself,\u201d said Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia, the new top Democrat on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, who represents thousands of federal workers.",
      "Overhauling USAID is \u201ca matter for Congress to deal with \u2014 not an unelected billionaire oligarch named Elon Musk,\u201d Connolly said."

      "WASHINGTON\u2014 Elon Musk is serving in the Trump administration as a \"special government employee,\" according to a White House official.",
      "It\u2019s a designation that means Musk, the tech tycoon and fierce Trump ally whom President Donald Trump has launched on a cost-cutting mission across the federal government, is working as neither a volunteer nor a full-time employee.\u00a0Special government employees are asked to abide by conflict-of-interest requirements and ethics policies that are typically less onerous than they are for federal employees. As temporary positions, they bypass some of the disclosure obligations required of full-time roles.",
      "A person familiar with the role said that such employees can work up to 130 days in a calendar year and that the days can be split up (i.e., Musk can work half a day and it will count as only half a day).",
      "Trump named Musk to lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which was formed after Trump renamed the U.S. Digital Service as the U.S. DOGE Service and established DOGE within the Executive Office of the President by executive order on his first day in office.",
      "The executive order to reorganize the U.S. Digital Service gave DOGE a mandate to \u201cmaximize governmental efficiency and productivity,\u201d and DOGE team members can include agency personnel or newly hired temporary staff members who, like Musk, are designated as special government employees.",
      "Musk\u2019s SpaceX has won billions in government contracts with the federal government, which critics have said is a potential conflict of interest.",
      "According to a report by the Congressional Research Service, special government employees are limited in how many days they can work each year, amounting to not \u201cmore than 130 days during any period of 365 days.\u201d",
      "Trump said Monday that Musk's DOGE wouldn\u2019t act without the White House's approval and that Musk won\u2019t always get his way.",

    "summary": "Finding an online community of fellow Black travelers that had an insatiable curiosity about the world \u201cwas such a breath of fresh air,\u201d said traveler Patricka Hogue.",
    "story": [
      "Patricka Hogue\u2019s friends were already calling her \u201cthe nomad.\u201d While she had visited dozens of countries (at the latest count, at least 60), by 2012 she yearned for a community of Black fellow travelers she could share her traveling experiences with.",
      "That was when she stumbled upon the Nomadness Travel Tribe, a Facebook group, now with 37,000 members.",
      "\u201cI literally found my tribe,\u201d she said.",
      "Hogue and thousands of other Black travelers have built communities \u2014\u00a0online and off \u2014\u00a0centered on globetrotting. While they share restaurant recommendations and envy-inducing photos, many members say the groups have instilled lasting friendships and led to marriages. In the worst cases, the groups have sprung to action in times of crisis. At its core, the groups encourage more Black people to experience the world \u2014\u00a0only 49% of Black Americans have traveled abroad, compared with 75% of white Americans, according to 2021 data from the Pew Research Center.",
      "Nomadness Travel Tribe\u2019s founder, Evita Robinson, who has traveled to about 40 countries, said she launched the group in 2011 with only 100 members to fulfill her own need to find a Black traveling community \u2014 and it grew fast. Beyond connecting as an online community for travelers, members of Nomadness and others often coordinate smaller group trips outside their online communities.",
      "\u201cIt was beautiful to kind of see these folks, particularly millennial Black and brown travelers, kind of come together in a home online and then adventure into something that lived offline,\u201d said Robinson, who is 40 and lives in Newark, New Jersey.",
      "A cultural awakening",
      "Hogue said joining has had \u201csuch a huge impact on my life.\u201d",
      "After having temporarily lived in South Korea, Hogue returned to her home city, New Orleans, in 2013 and felt \u201clike such a fish out of water\u201d after years of traveling. Since she joined Nomadness, she has traveled with members on five group trips, including a trip to India in March 2015, one of her favorites. Members were given custom saris, visited the Taj Mahal and attended Holi, a Hindu festival celebrating love and rebirth.",
      "\u201cFinding this online community of fellow travelers and people that also had, like, almost an insatiable curiosity about the world, it was such a breath of fresh air,\u201d said Hogue, 43. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like I was that strange.\u201d",
      "Robinson said she launched Nomadness to help break down racial, socioeconomic and religious barriers to global travel. Before social media, international travel was seen strictly as a luxury, she said, and many Black people grew up with sentiments such as \u201cBlack people don\u2019t go there.\u201d But the emergence of companies like Lyft and Airbnb has made travel accessible for more people, she said.",
      "One way Robinson makes her trips accessible to travelers is by offering payment plans. Nomadness trips on average cost between $2,000 to $3,500, before flights.",
      "Hogue\u2019s 2015 trip to India with Nomadness cost her $410, which included accommodations, meals and several activities, she said. Hogue said the organization\u2019s affordable prices allowed her to visit places like Bali, Costa Rica and South Africa.",
      "In the Nomadness group, members share flight delays and trip recommendation requests. They also post photos of food and excursions and even updates about the new countries they\u2019re living in. Members also ask one another for advice about what countries are safe to travel to; right now members are favoring Japan, Portugal and South Africa.",
      "In 2016, Reggie Cummings, a member of the National Brotherhood of Skiers, went on a skiing trip in Japan. While the group expected no more than 12 people, about 180 showed up, which resulted in \u201cliterally the best week of my life,\u201d said Cummings, who is from Atlanta. Shortly afterward, he started \u201cThe Black Travel Movement,\u201d which now has over 539,000 members on Facebook.",
      "\u201cThe platform was created so that we can both tell our story and hear stories from other cultures,\u201d Cummings said. His latest post in the Black Travel Movement group is a check-in for members who are traveling to Havana with the organization. Other members of the group often share photos of their favorite international travel destinations and request restaurant recommendations for trips within the United States.",
      "Trips with the Black Travel Movement range from $2,500 to $4,500, depending on the destination, Cummings said. Some popular places include Ghana, whose \u201cYear of Return\u201d in 2019 commemorated 400 years since the first group of African slaves arrived in Virginia. The yearlong program encouraged many African Americans to visit; it was so popular that some travelers moved to Ghana.",
      "In terms of excursions, Robinson said, \u201cit\u2019s all about cultural immersion\u201d for Black travelers, especially those traveling to Africa. Visitors dine at local restaurants and shop at local stores, all of which helps support the local community.",
      "\u201cI think this is why Africa is poppin\u2019, because people are realizing \u2026 it\u2019s not all safaris out here the way that we\u2019ve been pitched our entire lives,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThere\u2019s parties. There\u2019s arts. There\u2019s collective. There\u2019s ways to give back and volunteer. All of that is in the scope of interest of us as travelers.\u201d",
      "The power of community",
      "Nomadness members have experienced their fair share of unexpected challenges abroad. But when bad things happen, \u201cwe show up when s--t hits the fan, literally,\u201d Robinson said.",
      "In 2015 a group of Nomadness members visiting a region outside Panama City were involved in a van accident. Multiple people were injured, and two members died. Within four days, Nomadness members had raised tens of thousands of dollars to help pay for hospital bills of the injured members and help others get back to the United States.",
      "The community \u201ccame together unlike anything I\u2019d ever seen,\u201d Robinson said. While the trip wasn\u2019t officially hosted by Nomadness, Robinson flew to Panama with two other members because \u201cthese were our people and they needed our help.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe show up for one another,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just some social thing you\u2019ve seen on social media. We are tangible in real life.\u201d",
      "Tushunda Wright, 42, a community engagement lead for Nomadness, said: \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how many times we\u2019ve saved each other during difficult times. Not just dealing with racism, but also, you know, whether somebody lost a passport [or] got robbed.\u201d",
      "For the last five years, the annual Nomadness Fest has played host to as many as 600 travelers of color, discussing a variety of topics, including LGBTQ travel representation and accessibility. Two major focuses of the group this year are storytelling and data aggregation for travelers of color.",
      "\u201cNomadness has been the root of so many friendships, relationships, marriages, businesses,\u201d Hogue said. That, she added, is the epitome of Black joy."

      "\u201cEveryone will agree this is a halftime show like none other in Super Bowl halftime history,\u201d Jesse Collins, the executive producer of the show, told NBC News. \u201cThe creative concept is really something brilliant, spectacular and special.

      "\u201cWhat we bring to the table is not just booking the show; it\u2019s also understanding the environment that we\u2019re going into and understanding what\u2019s going on now,\u201d Perez says. \u201cUnderstanding the pulse of culture at the moment when the show is going to happen and doing that with precision is what I think we\u2019ve been able to master.\u201d",
      "Planning for a Super Bowl halftime typically begins immediately after the previous one, which means Roc Nation has been in meetings for Sunday\u2019s show since last February. During the week of the game, preparation will reach a fever pitch.",
      "Lamar will have at least three days on the field to rehearse before Sunday, and on those days the performers will run through the entire set multiple times. The halftime show is unique in terms of timing and staging \u2014 Lamar has exactly eight minutes to get on the field and six minutes to get off, without damaging the surface where the game is supposed to take place. (Simply getting the stage on and off the field takes more than 100 people, Collins said.)",
      "As for what to expect during the show itself, everyone is predictably tight-lipped. Perez said that whether or not other artists will be involved is entirely up to Lamar, though she said there will be \u201ca few surprises that we haven\u2019t seen in the past.\u201d",
      "\u201cKendrick is one of the most creative, incredible artists of our lifetime, and ... he is not going to disappoint,\u201d she said when she was asked directly what fans should be excited for.",
      "Collins said: \u201cRoc Nation, Jay, Kendrick and his whole team, we\u2019ve all really busted our ass to figure out something different. And I think people are going to be blown away.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "In the final months before Democratic-turned-independent former Sen. Kyrsten Sinema retired, her campaign organization spent big in the desert \u2014 not just the desert of Arizona, the state she represented in Congress for more than a decade, but in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Of the almost $700,000 Sinema\u2019s campaign reported spending in the final three months of 2024, about one-tenth was spent on \u201clodging,\u201d including more than $20,000 at the swanky Le M\u00e9ridien in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Another $756 went to a limited liability company linked to Marriott operating in the country, according to her campaign finance filing. The filing shows Sinema's campaign spent $4,000 more on car services to two foreign companies, one in London and one in Paris, although it\u2019s unclear where the services were incurred.",
      "Sinema\u2019s campaign also spent almost $19,000 at the Edition Hotel in New York City, mostly around Election Day, according to the filing, as well as thousands more at other luxury hotels in the mountain resort towns of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and Park City, Utah; the St. Regis in San Francisco; the Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas; and a Ritz-Carlton without a location specified.",
      "Her campaign filing also showed more than $15,000 spent on airfare over that period, without providing more information about the destinations.\u00a0It's unclear whether Sinema took the trips associated with the spending or whether someone else in her political operation did.",
      "The hotel and airline payments weren't Sinema\u2019s largest expenditure category: That was security spending, during a time when politicians have faced a steady stream of threats. New data U.S. Capitol Police released Monday found an increase in statements and threats against members of Congress and their families over the last year, and Sinema's committee reported spending about $140,000 on security services (including travel), all paid to a security firm based in Sinema\u2019s Arizona. She spent $81,000 more on travel expense reimbursements to the same firm.",
      "The hotel and airline payments stand out because no other senator who retired at the end of 2024 spent nearly as much as Sinema did in the final three months of last year. Former Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., spent about $210,000 over the same period \u2014 but most of that ($150,000) was in transfers to the Senate Democratic campaign arm and in membership fees to the U.S. Former Members of Congress Association ($25,000).",
      "Former Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., who resigned last summer after his corruption and bribery conviction, spent more than Sinema over the final three months of 2024, almost $800,000. The vast majority of that, $650,000, was on \u201clegal services.\u201d",
      "Sinema has attracted criticism and scrutiny for her campaign spending in the past, including for other foreign travel, which does appear occasionally in federal campaign finance filings but is relatively rare.",
      "The Federal Election Commission says campaign funds \u201cmay be used to pay ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in connection with one\u2019s duties as a federal officeholder\u201d as officials wind down committees around leaving office. Retiring politicians can also donate their campaign cash to other political organization or nonprofit groups.",
      "But politicians can\u2019t use campaign funds for personal use, which the FEC defines as an expense that \u201cwould exist even in the absence of the candidacy or even if the officeholder were not in office.\u201d",
      "Sinema\u2019s campaign also incurred expenses related to ending her time in Washington, including closing down her offices and refunding some contributions. She ended the year with almost $4.3 million left in her campaign bank account.",
      "Sinema's campaign at the email address listed on its FEC reports couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. Two former Sinema staffers didn\u2019t reply to a request for comment, and Sinema's personal website has been taken offline.",
      "Her campaign raised just $2.52 over the final three months of 2024 \u2014 a tax credit sent over by the online payroll and human resources platform Gusto. Even so, the filing shows she spent big on payments for fundraising and event consulting \u2014 including about $100,000 to a firm run in part by one of her top fundraisers. (It is possible those payments were for services incurred before the filing period.)",
      "The Sinema campaign spent $11,000 on meals related to meetings, including at a handful of well-known Washington eateries, according to the filing. One $2,000 payment went to the Salt Line, a popular seafood restaurant near the Washington waterfront. Another $15,000 went to event catering, including almost $800 at an Arizona winery where Sinema had interned.",
      "The campaign also spent about $10,000 on car services (including $2,700 to Uber), more than $6,000 on automobile insurance and $1,600 at singer Taylor Swift\u2019s official gift store for \u201cevent gifts.\u201d"

As of Friday, three days after AliKhan initially blocked the funding freeze, rural health centers, scientific research labs, child care facilities and other organizations still had not received their expected funds, according to the declarations.",
      "The board president of a West Virginia nonprofit group that helps people with disabilities remain in their homes said in a declaration filed Sunday that it has been waiting for federal funds to be deposited into its account since Wednesday but had not yet received the funds as of Sunday night.",
      "\u201cI am desperate to bring attention to our situation,\u201d the board president wrote in the declaration. \u201cI cannot believe anyone would NOT want to help an 86-year-old woman get to her dialysis sessions, or a family with Autism and Intellectual Disability get help to live on their own instead of being committed to an institution.\u201d",
      "The declaration noted that in the past, \"drawdown requests typically were deposited to our account immediately.\"",
      "Now, it continued, the \"Center had enough money to meet payroll on Friday, January 31, and to cover outstanding bills. But we did not have enough money on hand to cover another two-week pay period at full staffing. Thus, on Friday, January 31, the Board of Directors voted to lay off three of our five employees and drastically reduce services to our customers. This presented a dire situation for our customers, who have immediate needs.\"",
      "The president and CEO of the National Counsel of Nonprofits filed a declaration with the court Friday outlining her concerns about the freeze.",
      "\u201cI have heard from a significant number of our nonprofit members that they are still unable to access their disbursements, even after this Court entered its administrative stay, and after OMB purported to rescind its Memo M-25-13,\u201d Diane Yentel wrote in the filing. \u201cI have heard it from enough that I am concerned the challenges may still be widespread.\u201d",
      "In another declaration, the CEO of a rural health center wrote: \u201cI don\u2019t care about the political fight surrounding the OMB Memo. I just want to help my Health Center\u2019s staff care for our patients. But unless our federal funding is restored, we will not be able to provide that care.\u201d",

The two also discussed migration and sanctions. A Venezuelan official said it was willing to restart legal cooperation to extradite Tren de Aragua gang members back to Venezuela.",
      "While President Trump said on TruthSocial on Friday that Venezuela had agreed to take back people who are deported, the Venezuelan government has not confirmed this.",
      "Legally ending, but facing challenges",
      "The Homeland Security secretary has the authority to end TPS, said Elizabeth Taufa, senior policy attorney and strategist for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center. But she said there is need for continuity between administrations because people rely on the decisions to plan their lives. Many of these Venezuelans were told in January they had 18 more months and now find they only have about two months before they lose TPS status, she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of whiplash for the same government to say in January things haven\u2019t improved in Venezuela, we have to extend TPS and then two weeks later, to say, actually things are absolutely fine in Venezuela,\u201d Taufa said.",
      "Ferro, from South Florida, said her group is planning litigation. Trump targeted TPS in his first term and court battles ensued, with an appeals court ruling in 2020 that he could end TPS. Many TPS holders have been living in fear since Trump\u2019s re-election.",
      "Rafael Struve, communications director for Bienvenido, a conservative Latino group that helped elect Republicans, said the TPS curtailment \u201chas me at a crossroads, trying to understand the concerns of both sides.\u201d",
      "Struve, who was born in the U.S. to Venezuelan parents, said he still has family in the country and his family has been affected by the country\u2019s political and economic crises.",
      "\u201cI, like many Venezuelans, was very supportive of President Trump. I very much believed he would take a firmer stance on the Maduro regime,\u201d he said.",
      "But he said he was confused by a DHS statement in a memo that the agency, along with the State Department, had concluded that \u201cthere are notable improvements in several areas such as the economy, public health, and crime.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s very, very debatable. Based on what I am hearing from folks who live there right now, the situation has not improved economically. If that were true, many people would go back and would not be leaving. Venezuela continues to have the largest exodus of any other country on planet Earth.\u201d",
      "Trump has had heavy support in the Venezuelan community, in part because of his tough stand against Maduro in his previous term. But the increased post-pandemic arrivals of Venezuelans seeking asylum have caused a split in the community, with some moving, along with other Americans, to a more hawkish view on immigration.",
      "Hours before leaving office at the end of his first term, Trump granted a different form of protection to Venezuelans, Deferred Enforced Departure, for 18 months. That expired in July 2022, and those eligible were able to apply for TPS.",
      "The presence of members of Tren de Aragua in the U.S. has also helped instill some wariness toward newer arrivals.",
      "In 2023, as shelters in major cities overfilled and strained resources in places like New York City, President Biden responded by granting Temporary Protected Status to all Venezuelans who had lived in the U.S. since July 2023. That allowed them to be able to work sooner than they would if they followed the asylum process.",
      "The Venezuelans affected by the latest curtailment of TPS by the Department of Homeland Security affects those who became eligible for it in 2023. Their protection was due to end this April, but Biden extended it through fall 2026. Trump's DHS published a notice in the Federal Register on Monday that said the TPS would end in April, as originally scheduled.",
      "Last week, the administration also cut short the TPS of Venezuelans who had received it in 2021 and had gotten an extension until fall 2026. Trump is ending their TPS in September.",
      "A limited number of people with TPS can pursue separate immigration paths to obtaining a green card, such as by applying for asylum, marrying a U.S. citizen or being sponsored by an employer or family member.",
      "Struve said that while he understands that Trump has a mandate on immigration, he\u2019s hoping that more consideration is given to perspectives from Latin America policy experts.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing this bifurcation of perspective on what to do with the Venezuela situation, with folks in the wing of Kristi Noem and Homeland Security wanting to attack it from immigration standpoint, but the fact of the matter is the best policy to turn off the spigot is making sure that Maduro is gone.\u201d",

    "summary": "The suit accuses the school of violating plaintiffs' free speech rights and argues that it \u201cabused its authority to ban people from public property.\u201d",
    "story": [
      "LANSING, Mich. \u2014 Jonathan Zou, a second-year student at the University of Michigan, was among the thousands of students who joined pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses nationwide this past year. Although the campus protests have subsided, the repercussions for students like Zou remain.",
      "Since his arrest by university police last Oct. 7 after using a megaphone during a pro-Palestinian march, Zou has been banned from all University of Michigan campuses, except for attending class or seeking medical care.",
      "Zou is one of five individuals facing similar bans who the American Civil Liberties Union is representing in a lawsuit that accuses the University of Michigan of violating their right to free speech. The lawsuit, filed Monday by the ACLU in federal court, also argues that the university \u201cabused its authority to ban people from public property.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe university says it appreciates this history of activism, but it will arrest students, ban students, surveil students and repress them through legal or school disciplinary means,\u201d Zou said in an interview before the lawsuit was filed.",
      "In response to a request for comment, a University of Michigan spokesperson said the university has not been served with the lawsuit and has no comment at this time.",
      "Pro-Palestinian demonstrations swept college campuses last spring, with activists setting up tent encampments and, in some cases, escalating their\u00a0protests further.\u00a0Thousands were arrested; while many had their cases dismissed, others remain in legal limbo as they pursue their education.",
      "On Wednesday, President Donald Trump\u00a0signed an executive order\u00a0calling for aggressive action to fight antisemitism on college campuses and promising to prosecute offenders and revoke visas for international students found to be what he called \u201cHamas sympathizers.\u201d",
      "Michigan has been\u00a0deeply affected\u00a0by tensions over the Israel-Hamas war, with metro Detroit home to the nation\u2019s largest Arab American community and a significant Jewish population. These dynamics have sparked unrest on University of Michigan campuses, resulting in police clashes with protesters and demonstrators\u00a0targeting university\u00a0regents for\u00a0protests.",
      "Last week, the University of Michigan\u00a0suspended\u00a0a pro-Palestinian group for two years and pulled its funding after accusing the group of violating the university\u2019s standards of conduct.",
      "The ACLU\u2019s lawsuit was brought on behalf of Zou and one other current student, two recent graduates and an Ann Arbor community member. According to the lawsuit, the individuals were each issued trespass bans after being accused of misconduct during protests but never formally charged for it.",
      "Zou was participating in a march on the University of Michigan\u2019s Ann Arbor campus on the\u00a0one-year anniversary\u00a0of Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and another 250 were taken hostage. The 2023 attack\u00a0sparked a war\u00a0that has devastated the Hamas-ruled Gaza strip.",
      "Zou was arrested after using a megaphone during the march, but never formally charged.",
      "The trespass bans have upended individuals \u201cdaily lives, disrupted their education and work, and are blocking their ability to speak and protest freely on the University\u2019s vast campus,\u201d according to the lawsuit. The individuals are asking the federal court to lift their bans and prevent the university from issuing broad trespassing bans in the future.",
      "A ceasefire\u00a0took effect last month between Hamas and Israel, leading to\u00a0hostage-for-prisoner swaps\u00a0and\u00a0a flood of aid\u00a0into the Gaza Strip after a 15-month ground war marked by devastation, hunger and mass displacement in the territory. Looming large is the possibility that fighting will resume if the ceasefire breaks down after the six-week first phase."

    "story": [
      "The impacts of Donald Trump\u2019s long-promised pledge to use tariffs as a political cudgel started to come into focus Monday, even as the president cut last-minute deals with some of the country\u2019s closest allies allowing him to back down from his initial threats.",
      "On Saturday, Trump announced that he would slap broad 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, both U.S. allies, and 10% tariffs on China, a political foe. The move was expected, but it still sparked fears about the rising costs of goods across the U.S. economy.",
      "That concern is particularly potent because Trump campaigned heavily on lowering costs and easing inflation. If they are fully implemented, Trump's tariff proposals would affect American households' purchasing power by $1,000 to $1,200 annually, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University.",
      "The first domino to fall came early Monday, when Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced a deal had been reached to delay tariffs on her country by one month, in return for Mexico\u2019s agreeing to beef up its presence at the border with the United States with 10,000 members of its national guard.",
      "It was an effort to placate the Trump administration, which at times has been inconsistent with its messaging about the rationale for tariffs but has consistently said curbing the flow of drug trafficking into the United States is a main focus.",
      "Trump officials quickly took a victory lap after the announcement, even as several steps to avoid a potential heated trade war remain.",
      "\u201cSo for literally three days, I heard the far left in this country say that these tariffs would make Americans' life worse,\u201d Vice President JD Vance said at an event in Ohio in response to a question from NBC News. \u201cAnd what actually happened is the Mexican government was so afraid of the tariffs that they actually are taking their border enforcement and their anti-cartel activity more seriously.",
      "\u201cThat is not a pathway to making Americans worse off,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s a pathway to making Americans better off.\u201d",
      "Trump posted on Truth Social that he had a \u201cvery friendly conversation\u201d with Sheinbaum, a quick shift in tone. Over the weekend, she rejected what she called \u201cslander\u201d from Trump for suggesting her government had an alliance with drug traffickers.",
      "The past few days have shown one thing: Trump's tariff threats were not necessarily hollow campaign rhetoric.",
      "\u201cOne thing that is different is that leaders need to realize that Trump is serious,\u201d Heritage Foundation research fellow EJ Antoni said. \u201cIf they just think it\u2019s all bluster or campaign promises, nothing will really change, right? They have to know he is serious.\u201d",
      "Antoni predicted continued \u201cde-escalation\u201d as Trump\u2019s threats start to be interpreted as real, because of the size of the U.S. economy and the disproportionate trade relationships with Canada and Mexico. The two allies are America's largest trading partners, but international trade accounts for a much larger percentage of their overall economies.",
      "\u201cHe economically holds all the cards\u201d he said. \u201cHe has now made clear this is serious and happening. You can either get on the train, get off the tracks or get run over.\u201d",
      "At times, inconsistent rhetoric has come from the Trump administration about the motivation for tariffs. Trump economic adviser Peter Navarro told reporters in Washington on Monday that the fight is not a trade war but \"a drug war,\" echoing comments of other advisers.",
      "Trump himself, though, has repeatedly said he is concerned that the targets of the tariffs bully the United States and that the tariffs can be a weapon to end that perceived mistreatment.",
      "For example, hours after the Mexico deal was announced, Trump continued to antagonize Canada, claiming the only thing it could do to avoid tariffs is become the 51st state \u2014 which Canada has repeatedly said it would not do.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019d like to see ... Canada become our 51st state,\u201d Trump said in an Oval Office meeting with reporters when he was asked what Canada could do to end the pending trade war. \u201cWe give them protection, military protection. We don\u2019t need them to build our cars \u2014 I\u2019d rather see Detroit or South Carolina ... or any one of our states build the cars.\u201d",
      "Trump spoke shortly before he was scheduled to have his second call of the day with outgoing Canadian Prime Minster Justin Trudeau. Unlike from Mexico, little fentanyl comes across the U.S.-Canadian border. Trudeau told reporters Saturday night that it is less than 1% of all the supply in the United States.",
      "A 30-day delay on tariffs on Canada was announced Monday afternoon after that second call. Trudeau said he had a \u201cgood call with President Trump,\" who has used him as a political bogeyman for months. As part of the deal, Trudeau said the country would spend $1.3 billion on a border security plan and appoint a \u201cfentanyl czar.\u201d",
      "The Canadian government first proposed the border security funding part of the plan last year.",
      "A spokeswoman for the Canadian government did not reply to a request seeking comment about whether the already proposed plan was used as part of the deal with Trump.",
      "The White House did not reply to a request for comment.",
      "Most congressional Republicans have not commented publicly on whether they support Trump\u2019s push for tariffs on historic political and economic allies, with a few exceptions. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, was the first to chime in Monday morning when he took to X to \u201cplead\u201d with Trump to consider tariffs\u2019 impacts on his agriculture-heavy state.",
      "\u201cBiden inflation increase the input cost to farming by 20% incl particularly high prices on fertilizer,\u201d Grassley wrote. \u201cSo I plead w President Trump to exempt potash from the tariff because family farmers get most of our potash from Canada.\u201d",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told Newsmax that he shares \u201cthe market\u2019s concern\u201d about long-term tariffs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt Americans, American companies, American exporters. It will hurt American consumers long term,\u201d he said.",
      "While Trump brokered 30-day reprieves with Canada and Mexico, it is unclear how the tariff fight will end with them, and the threats against China \u2014 by far the largest economy of the three \u2014 were not resolved Monday.",
      "China has said\u00a0it will challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization and pursue \u201ccountermeasures\u201d in response.",
      "There is little indication that Republican senators will start to speak out in large numbers against Trump\u2019s threats of trade wars, even if there is a prolonged fight on the issue.",
      "\u201cThere might be a few,\u201d said a political adviser to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. \u201cBut generally, I think there is a sense that Trump holds all the cards here. To the extent there is concern about home state constituencies, I think a lot of that will be expressed quietly and behind the scenes.\u201d",
      "Another veteran Republican familiar with Thune\u2019s thinking said he is unlikely to react in any overtly public or rash way.",
      "\u201cThese are U.S. senators. They have egos like everyone else,\u201d the person said. \u201cSen. Thune approaches things differently. He is more of a read-the-room guy. I\u2019d not expect him to act impulsively on anything, including this.\u201d",
      "The impacts of potential tariffs, for now, have been averted, but the future remains unclear, which leaves uncertainty both in the United States and around the globe. U.S. markets fell early Monday, but they quickly rebounded after the one-month Mexico pause was announced.",
      "Though Trump ran on the promise that tariffs would be good for the nation, in recent days, he has begun to acknowledge that if they are fully implemented there would be some short-term pain. But he now argues that those bumps and bruises would be beneficial to the nation in the long run.",
      "\u201cWill there be some pain? Yes, maybe (and maybe not!),\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social. \u201cBut we will make America great again, and it will all be worth the price that must be paid. We are a country that is now being run with common sense \u2014 and the results will be spectacular!!!\u201d"

      "A group representing former FBI agents, the\u00a0Society of Retired Special Agents,\u00a0urged its members to call their elected officials to protest the potential punishment or firing of Jan. 6 case agents.",
      "\u201cThese employees were assigned to investigate these cases as part of their normal duties,\u201d the message said. \u201cThey put their lives on the line every day to protect this country and now the entire FBI workforce is distracted from their important responsibilities.\u201d",
      "Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee\u00a0demanded\u00a0answers from\u00a0Trump administration\u00a0Justice Department and FBI officials\u00a0about\u00a0the recent\u00a0firings and re-assignments of senior officials in both law enforcement agencies,\u00a0calling it \u201can alarming threat to national security.\u201d\u2019",
      "In letters to incoming Attorney General Pam Bondi and other top Trump appointees obtained exclusively by NBC News, Dick Durbin of Illinois and other Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee demanded records related to the second Trump administration's personnel actions.",
      "The Democratic senators said as many as 20 senior career Justice Department lawyers had been re-assigned or removed, and they noted the firings of at least eight senior FBI managers. The letter said there was widespread fear that a mass purge of FBI agents who worked on Capitol riot investigations is in the works.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump won the 2024 presidential election,\" the letter said. \"But he does not have the authority to dismantle the federal civil service or replace dedicated, nonpartisan career officials at DOJ with those whose only qualifications are loyalty to President Trump rather than the Constitution and laws of the United States of America.\"",
      "Only one of the 11 Republicans on the Judiciary Committee responded to requests for comment, Eric Schmitt of Missouri.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump was given a mandate by the American people, and this past election boiled down to the reformers versus permanent Washington,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump is now doing exactly what he promised\u2014enacting reforms at agencies that desperately need it, including the FBI. I suggest Democrats pace themselves with the outrage BINGO they are playing, it\u2019s going to be a long four years for them.\u201d",
      "Democrats try to respond",
      "Democrats are trying to respond to what has been a \u201cshock and awe\u201d campaign by the Trump administration to impose\u00a0sweeping new staff cuts and take control of\u00a0federal agencies in ways that some experts say may be illegal.",
      "\u201cAs America faces a heightened threat landscape, these shocking removals and reassignments deprive DOJ and the FBI of experienced, senior leadership and decades of experience fighting violent crime, espionage, and terrorism,\u201d the letter said.",
      "Minority\u00a0Democrats lack the power to enforce their document requests or to block the confirmation of Kash Patel, Trump\u2019s choice to be FBI director, who faces a committee vote next week.\u00a0And Republicans on the committee have been conspicuously silent about the events unfolding at the FBI recently.",
      "Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the committee chairman,\u00a0did not respond to a request for comment and has not said anything publicly about what current and former FBI officials are calling a crisis at the FBI.",
      "Patel declined to comment through a spokesman.",
      "Patel told senators at his confirmation hearing Thursday that he was aware of no plans for mass firings.\u00a0Hours later, news broke that the Justice Department had forced out eight top executives, including the heads of the field offices in Miami and Washington.",
      "The Trump administration\u00a0also\u00a0began efforts to obtain the names of every FBI employee who worked on Jan. 6 cases, sparking fears of a mass firing that have roiled the bureau.\u00a0Acting Director Brian Driscoll told employees in a message over the weekend that FBI agents cannot be fired or disciplined without hearings and other due process.",
      "James Dennehy, the\u00a0head\u00a0of the New York field office, went even further in an email to staff members challenging the Trump administration. \u201cToday, we find ourselves in the middle of a battle ... as good people are being walked out of the FBI,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd others are being targeted because they did their jobs in accordance with the law and FBI policy.\u201d",
      "Ousted prosecutors collect their belongings",

      "None of them were accused of wrongdoing, but the text of their dismissal letters quoted from Trump's executive order pardoning and commuting the rioters\u2019 sentences. It described the Jan. 6 prosecutions as \u201ca grave national injustice that has been perpetrated upon the American people.\u201d"

    "summary": "The suit accuses the school of violating plaintiffs' free speech rights and argues that it \u201cabused its authority to ban people from public property.\u201d",
    "story": [
      "LANSING, Mich. \u2014 Jonathan Zou, a second-year student at the University of Michigan, was among the thousands of students who joined pro-Palestinian protests on university campuses nationwide this past year. Although the campus protests have subsided, the repercussions for students like Zou remain.",
      "Since his arrest by university police last Oct. 7 after using a megaphone during a pro-Palestinian march, Zou has been banned from all University of Michigan campuses, except for attending class or seeking medical care.",
      "Zou is one of five individuals facing similar bans who the American Civil Liberties Union is representing in a lawsuit that accuses the University of Michigan of violating their right to free speech. The lawsuit, filed Monday by the ACLU in federal court, also argues that the university \u201cabused its authority to ban people from public property.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe university says it appreciates this history of activism, but it will arrest students, ban students, surveil students and repress them through legal or school disciplinary means,\u201d Zou said in an interview before the lawsuit was filed.",
      "In response to a request for comment, a University of Michigan spokesperson said the university has not been served with the lawsuit and has no comment at this time.",
      "Pro-Palestinian demonstrations swept college campuses last spring, with activists setting up tent encampments and, in some cases, escalating their\u00a0protests further.\u00a0Thousands were arrested; while many had their cases dismissed, others remain in legal limbo as they pursue their education.",
      "On Wednesday, President Donald Trump\u00a0signed an executive order\u00a0calling for aggressive action to fight antisemitism on college campuses and promising to prosecute offenders and revoke visas for international students found to be what he called \u201cHamas sympathizers.\u201d",
      "Michigan has been\u00a0deeply affected\u00a0by tensions over the Israel-Hamas war, with metro Detroit home to the nation\u2019s largest Arab American community and a significant Jewish population. These dynamics have sparked unrest on University of Michigan campuses, resulting in police clashes with protesters and demonstrators\u00a0targeting university\u00a0regents for\u00a0protests.",
      "Last week, the University of Michigan\u00a0suspended\u00a0a pro-Palestinian group for two years and pulled its funding after accusing the group of violating the university\u2019s standards of conduct.",
      "The ACLU\u2019s lawsuit was brought on behalf of Zou and one other current student, two recent graduates and an Ann Arbor community member. According to the lawsuit, the individuals were each issued trespass bans after being accused of misconduct during protests but never formally charged for it.",
      "Zou was participating in a march on the University of Michigan\u2019s Ann Arbor campus on the\u00a0one-year anniversary\u00a0of Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and another 250 were taken hostage. The 2023 attack\u00a0sparked a war\u00a0that has devastated the Hamas-ruled Gaza strip.",
      "Zou was arrested after using a megaphone during the march, but never formally charged.",
      "The trespass bans have upended individuals \u201cdaily lives, disrupted their education and work, and are blocking their ability to speak and protest freely on the University\u2019s vast campus,\u201d according to the lawsuit. The individuals are asking the federal court to lift their bans and prevent the university from issuing broad trespassing bans in the future.",
      "A ceasefire\u00a0took effect last month between Hamas and Israel, leading to\u00a0hostage-for-prisoner swaps\u00a0and\u00a0a flood of aid\u00a0into the Gaza Strip after a 15-month ground war marked by devastation, hunger and mass displacement in the territory. Looming large is the possibility that fighting will resume if the ceasefire breaks down after the six-week first phase."

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 00:22:11 GMT",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump is moving at breakneck speed to disrupt and reshape the federal government, challenging oversight powers reserved for lawmakers.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump has tried to freeze up to hundreds of billions of dollars in federal money and given billionaire ally Elon Musk access to sensitive Treasury payment systems that send out trillions of dollars. Trump and his team have purged agency watchdogs, top FBI executives and federal prosecutors who worked on Jan. 6 cases.",
      "Now, Trump and Musk want to gut the U.S. Agency for International Development, which gives tens of billions of congressionally approved dollars to foreign allies every year.",
      "All are areas where members of Congress have either direct power or some level of oversight. And yet at each turn, Trump has bypassed them.",
      "Since he returned to the White House two weeks ago, Trump \u2014 at the height of his political power after he won the popular vote \u2014 has been expanding his own executive authority and steamrolling Congress as he tries to shrink the government and rid it of anyone he perceives to be disloyal.",
      "Lawmakers traditionally have heralded their oversight responsibilities and the power of the purse as points of pride in a city where there is a constant push and pull among the three branches of government. But in the second Trump administration, Republicans are so far largely deferring to Trump, who carries a huge level of influence among GOP primary voters.",
      "Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress and previously railed against executive overreach by Democratic presidents, have sat on the sidelines as Trump carries out controversial \u2014 and sometimes legally questionable \u2014 executive actions and orders. Instead, they\u2019re rooting Trump on as he upends Washington and tests America\u2019s system of checks and balances.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told NBC News that Democratic presidents have also tried to \u201cpush the limits\u201d of their power.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re going to see how far they can go,\u201d Tillis said of the Trump administration. \u201cI don\u2019t begrudge them for doing it.\u201d",
      "But Tillis, who did not point to examples of Democratic presidents\u2019 seeking to gut agencies by executive action, said it \u201cwould be helpful\u201d if Trump sought congressional approval to refuse to spend money that\u2019s legally required by Congress, like on USAID.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s legitimate; it\u2019s just not going to last long-term if it doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d said Tillis, who faces re-election next year.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said at a gathering of House Republicans last week at Trump\u2019s golf club near Miami that trump has \u201cbeen using his executive authority, I think, in an appropriate manner. He got a mandate from the American people. Let\u2019s not forget he ran on restoring common sense and fiscal sanity and ensuring that the government would be more efficient. It was a major theme of the campaign.\u201d",
      "A moderate Republican offered some words of caution for Trump on his efforts to dismantle USAID.",
      "\u201cI am concerned about \u2014 I have questions about the legality,\u201d said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska.",
      "She then summed up the largely muted reaction among most congressional Republicans to Trump.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all kind of getting into the mode of: Things happen, the news drops, and there\u2019s this explosive reaction, and then you find out that, OK, well, we\u2019re narrowing the order or, well, there\u2019s not really going to be tariffs,\u201d Murkowski said. \u201cAnd so I think we\u2019re all just kind of processing and figuring out the appropriate response.\u201d",
      "Except for quietly scuttling scandal-plagued former Rep. Matt Gaetz\u2019s bid for attorney general, Senate Republicans have also been overwhelmingly deferential in supporting Trump\u2019s nominees amid pressure from his allies to get on board with picks like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. More controversial nominations are ahead, like Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s for health and human services secretary and Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s for director of national intelligence.",
      "USAID under attack",
      "Musk said Monday that the government efficiency department Trump put him in charge of was \u201cshutting down USAID,\u201d and agency employees were told that they would not be allowed to enter their Washington headquarters and should work from home. Later in the day, Trump suggested USAID had been engaged in \u201cfraud\u201d and said he had appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio as its acting administrator.",
      "Rubio notified Congress that \u201ca review of USAID\u2019s foreign assistance activities is underway with an eye towards potential reorganization,\u201d the State Department said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been 20 or 30 years where people tried to reform it, and it refuses to reform. It refuses to cooperate,\u201d Rubio said of USAID during a visit to El Salvador on Monday. \u201cWhen we were in Congress, we couldn\u2019t even get answers to basic questions about programs. ... That\u2019s not going to continue.\u201d",
      "Asked by NBC News whether Trump could unilaterally dismantle USAID without congressional action, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., refused to criticize Trump and echoed Rubio\u2019s frustrations that the agency has not shared information about how it is spending tax dollars.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a lot more about finding out how the dollars are being spent, where they\u2019re going and whether or not they\u2019re consistent with the administration and our country\u2019s priorities when it comes to our national interests,\u201d Thune said.",
      "At the end of his first week in office, Trump fired 18 independent inspectors general, who were tasked with investigating instances of fraud, waste and abuse within federal agencies. Democrats and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said Trump\u2019s move violated a law Grassley helped write that requires the president to give 30 days\u2019 notice to Congress before he removed an inspector general and say why.",
      "Still, Grassley was largely deferential to Trump.",
      "\u201cThere may be good reason the IGs were fired. We need to know that if so,\u201d he said at the time.",
      "Last week, Republicans appeared to be caught off-guard after the Trump White House tried to unilaterally pause all federal loans and grants \u2014 previously approved by Congress \u2014 so it could review that the money was not funding initiatives it opposed. GOP leaders rallied behind the planned funding freeze, with House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., an institutionalist and 22-year congressional veteran, saying he had \u201cno problem\u201d with Trump\u2019s actions and others calling it perfectly \u201clegal.\u201d",
      "Hours later, after Trump rescinded the order that froze grants and loans and sparked confusion across the country, Republicans applauded the move. A federal judge also temporarily blocked Trump\u2019s freeze last week, though U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan said Monday that some forms of federal aid still appear to be frozen.",
      "Democrats make a stand",
      "With majorities in the House and the Senate, Republicans could use committees to launch investigations and subpoena Trump officials for records and testimony. But for now, that is not likely to happen. Congressional Republicans are working closely with Trump to pass his agenda on expanding energy production, boosting border security and cutting taxes.",
      "So it has fallen to Democrats in the minority to find ways to try to stop him.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in a letter Monday that Democrats will announce legislation \u201cto prevent unlawful access\u201d to the Treasury payment system \u201cthat contains highly confidential and personal information related to Social Security and Medicare recipients, taxpayers, households, nonprofits, businesses and federal contractors.\u201d The measure could test GOP willingness to put a check on Trump\u2019s move.",
      "Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., called on Democrats to \u201cfight back\u201d against Trump and Musk, urging them to vote no on all future nominees. And Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, which oversees USAID and the State Department, threatened Monday to place a \u201cblanket hold\u201d and stall all of Trump\u2019s State Department nominees in response to his attacks on USAID.",
      "\u201cDismantling USAID is illegal and makes us less safe. USAID was created by federal law and is funded by Congress. Donald Trump and Elon Musk can\u2019t just wish it away with a stroke of a pen \u2014 they need to pass a law,\u201d Schatz said in a statement.",
      "Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a moderate, warned that if Trump has \u201cgravely wounded\u201d USAID and that if he succeeds at unilaterally abolishing it, then a future president could also ignore appropriations laws.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s some disagreement about USAID,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the much more fundamental fight is over whether an agreement in appropriations that is a law will be respected and can hold.\u201d",
      "Earlier Monday, a group of House and Senate Democrats was blocked from entering USAID\u2019s headquarters at the Ronald Reagan Building. Outside, they showed support for USAID workers and decried Musk\u2019s push to hollow out the agency.",
      "\u201cWe are going to fight in every way we can, in the courts, in public opinion, with the bully pulpit, in the halls of Congress and here at AID itself,\u201d said Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia, the new top Democrat on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, who represents thousands of federal workers.",
      "Overhauling USAID is \u201ca matter for Congress to deal with \u2014 not an unelected billionaire oligarch named Elon Musk,\u201d Connolly said."

      "The second picture in Curtis' post was a street-view image of her Pacific Palisades community almost completely burned aside from a couple structures. Curtis tearfully spoke about the deadly California wildfires during an appearance on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\u201d  Jan. 8. At the time, she said, \"Where I live is on fire right now. Literally, the entire city of the Pacific Palisades is burning. I flew here last night. I started getting texts.

    "story": [
      "The Associated Press has apologized to Babyface after an awkward encounter between two of its reporters and the singer on the red carpet at the 2025 Grammy Awards on Sunday.",
      "The two Associated Press reporters were mid-interview with Babyface when one called out to Chappell Roan to try to get her attention \u2014 while Babyface was mid-sentence answering one of their questions.",
      "Babyface then asked if the reporters wanted to talk to Roan, who won the award for best new artist at the ceremony. His interview was then cut short and he walked away, according to livestream footage.",
      "The Associated Press said it had apologized to Babyface in a statement posted on X on Monday morning.",
      "\"We are deeply sorry for cutting our interview with Babyface short on our YouTube livestream of the Grammys red carpet,\" the news outlet said. \"We have apologized to him through his representative and to our viewers on the livestream.\"",
      "Babyface said \"music is bigger than any one moment\" in a statement to TODAY.com on Feb. 3.",
      "\"The best part of the night was reconnecting with old friends, meeting new artists, and feeling all the love in the room,\" he said. \"That\u2019s what I\u2019ll remember. That\u2019s what it\u2019s really about. Music is bigger than any one moment. Much love to everyone who won and everyone out here making great music.\"",
      "The full moment was caught on The Associated Press' livestream, and occurred when reporter Leslie Ambriz asked Babyface a question about the fusion of R&B with other genres like pop, hip-hop and rock.",
      "Babyface had started to answer the question when another reporter, Krysta Fauria, called out \"Chappell! Chappell!\" into the microphone as the singer made her way down the red carpet behind Babyface.",
      "\"I'm so sorry, Babyface,\" Ambriz said as she took his microphone and he walked away, before saying \"Hello!\" as Roan approached them.",
      "The reporters did apologize about two hours later on The Associated Press' livestream.",
      "\"I wanted to say I'm really sorry about interrupting Babyface earlier,\" Fauria said. \"Chappell Roan had come up and there was a lot of commotion, as there is on these carpets, but I'm a big Babyface fan, as are we all, so I just wanted to say that I really apologize.\"",
      "The backlash from fans and celebrities regarding Babyface's treatment during the interview, however, was swift.",
      "\u201c13x Grammy Award winning Kenneth \u2018Babyface\u2019 Edmonds? Am I seeing this correctly?\u201d\u00a0Dionne Warwick wrote in a post on X alongside video of the snub. (Babyface is listed as a 12-time winner on the Grammy website.)",
      "Khloe Kardashian also weighed in on the encounter in a post on X.",
      "\"This is so disrespectful how Babyface was treated in this interview,\" she said. \"Babyface has had such a significant impact on the music industry, in sooo many ways. Its maddening to see a LEGEND not get the respect and attention they deserve. He is a pioneer and deserves so much better than this.\"",
      "Kardashian cited his decades of work as a songwriter, producer and performer, calling him a \"class act.\"",
      "\"PS big or small, old or new, \u2014 you don\u2019t treat people like this. At least not in my eyes. There\u2019s a way to handle this and this was wrong in my opinion,\" she said."

    "summary": "Michael Bubl\u00e9 gets compared to Blake Shelton during the Season 27 premiere of \"The Voice\" after showing an old photo of himself with a mullet as part of his plea to get singer Ethan Eckenroad to be on his team.",
    "story": [
      "Michael Bubl\u00e9 appears to be pulling out all the stops to win over \"The Voice\" contestants in the new season.",
      "In an exclusive clip of the Season 27 premiere of \"The Voice,\" which airs on Monday, Feb. 3, contestant Ethan Eckenroad took the stage for his blind audition. He performed a rendition of \"Northern Attitude\" by Noah Kahan that wins over all of the coaches \u2014 Bubl\u00e9, John Legend, Kelsea Ballerini and Adam Levine \u2014 and resulted in a four-chair turn.",
      "When each judge tried to convince Eckenroad they are worthy of being his coach, Bubl\u00e9 had a little trick up his sleeve.",
      "Ballerini offered Eckenroad some cowboy boots and mentioned she was a country artist, going on to express her appreciation for his music. Bubl\u00e9 then had the perfect counter to her comments.",
      "\u201cI love country. I can even prove to you how much I love country because there\u2019s a picture I have,\u201d Bubl\u00e9 says as a photo of a younger version of himself with a mullet appears on screen.",
      "It resembled a yearbook picture, with a young Bubl\u00e9 smiling in front of a gray background, his mullet photographed in full glory.",
      "\u201cI mean, I sported that mullet for most of my life,\" he explains as Ballerini's jaw visibly dropped and all Levine could muster up is a shocked \"Oh wow.\"",
      "\u201cI told you he was related to Blake (Shelton), I told you,\u201d Legend jokes, mentioning the former \"Voice\" coach.",
      "The mullet seemed to be a good point of connection for Eckenroad, as he said a mullet might be in his future.",
      "\"I told my mom after the man bun I was going to do a mullet so,\" he shares.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d love to have you on my team, Ethan,\u201d Bubl\u00e9 responds. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so proud of us because I think we know good music and you\u2019re good music.\u201d",
      "But the other judges didn't go down without a fight.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so impressed by your poise, by the soulfulness of your voice, it was just a beautiful experience for us,\u201d Legend says to Eckenroad. \u201cI do not have a photo of me with a mullet, I will grant you that. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the way I would try and convince you to join my team anyway.\u201d",
      "Levine also made his case for Eckenroad to join his team, saying, \u201cYou have an effortless thing that you do that is so soulful and so simple. You have my favorite voice that I\u2019ve heard so far this entire blind audition. It would be a tragedy if you weren\u2019t on my team.\u201d",
      "\u201cWow, he ended with emotional blackmail,\u201d Legend cuts in, poking fun at Levine's choice of words.",
      "While the clip ends before finding out who Eckenroad picks as his coach on \"The Voice,\" it's clear that it won't be an easy choice."

    "story": [
      "Justin Baldoni has launched a website with documents related to his lawsuit against his \"It Ends With Us\" costar Blake Lively.",
      "The site, titled \u201cLawsuit Info,\u201d features links to two files \u2014 Baldoni\u2019s amended complaint, which was filed Jan. 31 in a New York district court, as well as a \u201ctimeline of relevant events,\u201d which purportedly summarizes events from January 2019 to January 2025 related to the creation of the movie \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to representatives for Lively for comment on the launch of the website.",
      "Baldoni and Lively starred in \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d the 2024 film at the center of a public feud between the two actors.",
      "Fans speculated Baldoni, who directed the film, and Lively were feuding amid the release of the movie in August 2024. Then on Dec. 20, 2024, Lively filed a sexual harassment complaint against Baldoni with the California Civil Rights Department, setting off a series of lawsuits.",
      "On Dec. 31, 2024, Baldoni and his publicists sued the New York Times for libel for an article published about Lively's sexual harassment complaint. That same day, Lively filed a federal lawsuit against Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and his publicists, alleging she was retaliated against for reporting sexual harassment.",
      "Baldoni subsequently sued Lively, her husband, Ryan Reynolds, and her publicist, accusing them of defamation on Jan. 16.",
      "On Jan. 31, Baldoni filed a timeline and amended complaint, which names Lively, Reynolds, publicist Leslie Sloane, Sloane\u2019s company Vision PR and the New York Times as \u201cconsolidated defendants.\u201d",
      "The amended complaint includes text messages between Lively and Baldoni, as well as between Reynolds and Baldoni. It also alleges that the New York Times may have been working on its article about Lively\u2019s complaint for \u201cmonths before\u201d the complaint was filed.",
      "Baldoni\u2019s attorney Bryan Freedman said in a statement that the amended lawsuit \u201cwas a logical next step due to the overwhelming amount of new proof that has come to light.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis fresh evidence corroborates what we knew all along, that due to a blind pursuit of power, Ms. Lively and her entire team colluded for months to destroy reputations through a complex web of lies, false accusations and the manipulation of illicitly received communications,\u201d Freedman said in the statement.",
      "A New York Times spokesperson said in a statement, \u201cThe Baldoni/Wayfarer legal filings are rife with inaccuracies about The New York Times, including, for example, the bogus claim that The Times had early access to Ms. Lively\u2019s state civil rights complaint.",
      "\u201cMr. Baldoni\u2019s lawyers base their erroneous claim on postings by amateur internet sleuths, who, not surprisingly, are wrong,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe sleuths have noted that a version of the Lively state complaint published by The Times carries the date \u2018December 10\u2019 even though the\u00a0complaint wasn\u2019t filed until more than a week later. The problem: that date is generated by Google software and is unrelated to the date when The Times received it and posted it.\u201d",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Lively, Reynolds and Sloane for comment on the amended complaint.",
      "The website launch comes weeks after Freedman released behind-the-scenes footage that he argues doesn't corroborate Lively's allegations of sexual harassment on set. In her December legal complaint, Lively alleged that Baldoni improvised scenes of physical intimacy and crossed boundaries.",
      "Her lawyers responded to the footage release in a statement to NBC News, claiming, \u201cThe video shows Mr. Baldoni repeatedly leaning in toward Ms. Lively, attempting to kiss her, kissing her forehead, rubbing his face and mouth against her neck, flicking her lip with his thumb, caressing her, telling her how good she smells, and talking with her out of character,\u201d Lively\u2019s legal team said. \u201cEvery moment of this was improvised by Mr. Baldoni with no discussion or consent in advance, and no intimacy coordinator present.\u00a0Mr. Baldoni was not only Ms. Lively\u2019s co-star, but the director, the head of studio and Ms. Lively\u2019s boss.\u201d",
      "Freedman previously said in a January interview on TODAY that his team planned  \u201cto release every single text message between the two of them,\u201d referring to Baldoni and Lively.",
      "\u201cThere is nothing that in any way is a concern about this entire situation from our perspective, and we want the truth to be out there,\u201d Freedman said at the time.",
      "A U.S. district court judge said Jan. 27 that Baldoni and Lively's lawsuits will be joined and both cases will go to trial March 9, 2026, according to documents obtained by NBC News.",
      "A pretrial conference is scheduled for Feb. 3."

      "MAE SOT, Thailand \u2014 For people fleeing the conflict in Myanmar, the injuries are often more than just physical.",
      "Four years after a military coup that has morphed into a grinding civil war, experts say there is a growing mental health crisis in the Southeast Asian nation, made worse by the junta\u2019s atrocities against civilians and a humanitarian disaster that has left more than 3 million people displaced.",
      "They find some relief at the Mae Tao Clinic on the outskirts of Mae Sot, a border town in neighboring Thailand.",
      "Each morning, hundreds of Burmese arrive at the clinic, waiting to see a doctor, receive vaccinations or get a prenatal checkup. Some are living in refugee camps along the Thai-Myanmar border, while others have jobs as migrant workers or have crossed into Thailand illegally.",
      "The donor-funded clinic, which opened in the 1980s with only four beds, has since evolved into a full-fledged primary health facility that offers a range of free services, including psychiatric care. It says its 700 doctors, nurses, medics and volunteers treat 120,000 people a year, a number that may increase after a freeze on foreign aid by the Trump administration that threatens to close U.S.-supported health care facilities treating Myanmar refugees in Thai border camps.",
      "Those who have fled Myanmar \u201chave so many traumas,\u201d said Thein, a Myanmar refugee who is one of the psychiatric care unit\u2019s two Burmese-speaking psychiatrists.",
      "On Tuesdays and Fridays, the two days the unit is open, Thein walks past the bustling outpatient wards and crosses a tranquil bamboo garden to his office. It is a single-story cement building painted light blue, with the windows and doors covered in translucent black film to protect patients\u2019 privacy.",
      "Thein, 36, sees about 10 patients a day in one-on-one sessions. They include rebel soldiers injured on the front lines as well as political refugees and migrant workers.",
      "\u201cThey have flashbacks and nightmares at night and they cannot sleep,\u201d said Thein, who has been in Mae Sot for a year and asked not to be identified by his full name to protect his safety and that of his family.",
      "While the clinic has social workers and counselors for patients with milder mental health issues, Thein works with the most serious cases.",
      "\u201cI can give counseling to them, like mindfulness or meditation or breathing,\u201d he said. But often his patients also require medication, which the clinic provides for free.",
      "Thein said he sometimes struggles with anxiety himself stemming from the abuse he received from the junta.",
      "Like most of his patients, Thein\u2019s life took a turn on Feb. 1, 2021, when the Myanmar military \u2014 which has ruled the former British colony for much of its history since it gained independence in 1948 \u2014 overthrew democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Peaceful protests broke out immediately, to which the new military government responded with deadly violence.",
      "According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a nonprofit group that has documented killings and arrests since the coup, the junta has killed at least 6,000 people and arrested more than 28,000. On Friday, Myanmar state media reported that the state of emergency that has been in place since the coup had been extended for another six months, further delaying promised elections.",
      "Though the junta remains in charge, its hold on power has slipped in the face of a coordinated offensive by ethnic rebel groups that have fought the Myanmar military for decades. In the past year the government has lost control of vast swaths of territory around the country, creating instability along Myanmar\u2019s borders with Thailand, India, China and others.",
      "\u201cI want to help my friends, but I don\u2019t want to kill people,\u201d Thein said. \u201cSo I treated the wounded people or wounded soldiers.\u201d",
      "Thein was arrested in 2022 on suspicion of helping the resistance and sent to Myanmar\u2019s notorious Insein Prison.",
      "\u201cThey tortured me with a whip. I think six people beat me during the interrogation. It was really scary,\u201d Thein recalled, as he raised his hands around his head to demonstrate how he tried to protect himself.",
      "Thein was released after a year of detention. Fearing another arrest, he left his life in Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s largest city, and fled to Thailand.",
      "Mae Sot has long been a place for Burmese to seek sanctuary, but it is an uneasy refuge. It is filled with people waiting for resettlement, living with constant anguish while facing the risk of arrest and deportation.",
      "Every month, Burmese who lack the documents needed to stay in Thailand legally have to pay local police 300 baht ($9) to obtain a card that prevents them from being detained or deported, but many find this fee unaffordable.",
      "\u201cSome patients were arrested on the way to the clinic by the Thai police because they have no documents,\u201d Thein said.",
      "The clinic\u2019s founder, Cynthia Maung, was also a doctor in Myanmar before she fled in 1988 amid a crackdown by the military government on a pro-democracy uprising.",
      "\u201cI think the struggles now and back then are very similar,\u201d she said.",
      "Mental health is often neglected in Myanmar, where Thein was trained. According to the World Health Organization, as of 2019 there were only 117 psychiatrists and two mental health hospitals in the country of 54 million people.",
      "Shwe Zin Aung is one of Thein\u2019s patients and has been struggling with bipolar disorder for a decade.",
      "The 35-year-old teacher arrived in Mae Sot from Myanmar\u2019s capital city, Naypyidaw, in early December, following in her brother\u2019s footsteps. She said that in addition to free medication, the clinic provided her with a safe place to talk about her feelings.",
      "Though she said she had not personally faced any abuse from the junta, \u201cit is so frustrating to see them brutally shoot the protesters,\u201d she said.",
      "Back home, Thein and his patients had respectable careers and stable lives, but here they are stateless \u2014 as are more than half a million people in Thailand, most of them from Myanmar.",
      "Though Bangkok has not ratified the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention and does not officially recognize refugees, Thai authorities have largely tolerated the influx of people from Myanmar, even before the coup in 2021.",
      "In October, the government of Thailand said it would grant citizenship to nearly 500,000\u00a0long-term residents as well as some children born in the country in an effort to address their legal status.",
      "Though her clinic is well known in Myanmar, Maung, 65, has not been in the country for almost four decades.",
      "When she first arrived in Thailand at the age of 28, Muang assumed she would return home in a few months once the political environment stabilized. But months soon turned into years.",
      "She felt newly hopeful in November 2020, when Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy was elected to a second consecutive term in a landslide. The military coup took place within three months, shattering Maung\u2019s dreams.",
      "Among those driven out of Myanmar by the coup, she said, were psychiatrists and psychologists who came to Mae Sot and have enabled the clinic to expand its services to help others struggling with displacement.",
      "\u201cSometimes, some people feel that this way is usual,\u201d Maung said, \u201cbut this is not normal.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The impacts of Donald Trump\u2019s long-promised pledge to use tariffs as a political cudgel started to come into focus Monday, even as the president cut last-minute deals with some of the country\u2019s closest allies allowing him to back down from his initial threats.",
      "On Saturday, Trump announced that he would slap broad 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, both U.S. allies, and 10% tariffs on China, a political foe. The move was expected, but it still sparked fears about the rising costs of goods across the U.S. economy.",
      "That concern is particularly potent because Trump campaigned heavily on lowering costs and easing inflation. If they are fully implemented, Trump's tariff proposals would affect American households' purchasing power by $1,000 to $1,200 annually, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University.",
      "The first domino to fall came early Monday, when Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced a deal had been reached to delay tariffs on her country by one month, in return for Mexico\u2019s agreeing to beef up its presence at the border with the United States with 10,000 members of its national guard.",
      "It was an effort to placate the Trump administration, which at times has been inconsistent with its messaging about the rationale for tariffs but has consistently said curbing the flow of drug trafficking into the United States is a main focus.",
      "Trump officials quickly took a victory lap after the announcement, even as several steps to avoid a potential heated trade war remain.",
      "\u201cSo for literally three days, I heard the far left in this country say that these tariffs would make Americans' life worse,\u201d Vice President JD Vance said at an event in Ohio in response to a question from NBC News. \u201cAnd what actually happened is the Mexican government was so afraid of the tariffs that they actually are taking their border enforcement and their anti-cartel activity more seriously.",
      "\u201cThat is not a pathway to making Americans worse off,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s a pathway to making Americans better off.\u201d",
      "Trump posted on Truth Social that he had a \u201cvery friendly conversation\u201d with Sheinbaum, a quick shift in tone. Over the weekend, she rejected what she called \u201cslander\u201d from Trump for suggesting her government had an alliance with drug traffickers.",
      "The past few days have shown one thing: Trump's tariff threats were not necessarily hollow campaign rhetoric.",
      "\u201cOne thing that is different is that leaders need to realize that Trump is serious,\u201d Heritage Foundation research fellow EJ Antoni said. \u201cIf they just think it\u2019s all bluster or campaign promises, nothing will really change, right? They have to know he is serious.\u201d",
      "Antoni predicted continued \u201cde-escalation\u201d as Trump\u2019s threats start to be interpreted as real, because of the size of the U.S. economy and the disproportionate trade relationships with Canada and Mexico. The two allies are America's largest trading partners, but international trade accounts for a much larger percentage of their overall economies.",
      "\u201cHe economically holds all the cards\u201d he said. \u201cHe has now made clear this is serious and happening. You can either get on the train, get off the tracks or get run over.\u201d",
      "At times, inconsistent rhetoric has come from the Trump administration about the motivation for tariffs. Trump economic adviser Peter Navarro told reporters in Washington on Monday that the fight is not a trade war but \"a drug war,\" echoing comments of other advisers.",
      "Trump himself, though, has repeatedly said he is concerned that the targets of the tariffs bully the United States and that the tariffs can be a weapon to end that perceived mistreatment.",
      "For example, hours after the Mexico deal was announced, Trump continued to antagonize Canada, claiming the only thing it could do to avoid tariffs is become the 51st state \u2014 which Canada has repeatedly said it would not do.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019d like to see ... Canada become our 51st state,\u201d Trump said in an Oval Office meeting with reporters when he was asked what Canada could do to end the pending trade war. \u201cWe give them protection, military protection. We don\u2019t need them to build our cars \u2014 I\u2019d rather see Detroit or South Carolina ... or any one of our states build the cars.\u201d",
      "Trump spoke shortly before he was scheduled to have his second call of the day with outgoing Canadian Prime Minster Justin Trudeau. Unlike from Mexico, little fentanyl comes across the U.S.-Canadian border. Trudeau told reporters Saturday night that it is less than 1% of all the supply in the United States.",
      "A 30-day delay on tariffs on Canada was announced Monday afternoon after that second call. Trudeau said he had a \u201cgood call with President Trump,\" who has used him as a political bogeyman for months. As part of the deal, Trudeau said the country would spend $1.3 billion on a border security plan and appoint a \u201cfentanyl czar.\u201d",
      "The Canadian government first proposed the border security funding part of the plan last year.",
      "A spokeswoman for the Canadian government did not reply to a request seeking comment about whether the already proposed plan was used as part of the deal with Trump.",
      "The White House did not reply to a request for comment.",
      "Most congressional Republicans have not commented publicly on whether they support Trump\u2019s push for tariffs on historic political and economic allies, with a few exceptions. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, was the first to chime in Monday morning when he took to X to \u201cplead\u201d with Trump to consider tariffs\u2019 impacts on his agriculture-heavy state.",
      "\u201cBiden inflation increase the input cost to farming by 20% incl particularly high prices on fertilizer,\u201d Grassley wrote. \u201cSo I plead w President Trump to exempt potash from the tariff because family farmers get most of our potash from Canada.\u201d",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told Newsmax that he shares \u201cthe market\u2019s concern\u201d about long-term tariffs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt Americans, American companies, American exporters. It will hurt American consumers long term,\u201d he said.",
      "While Trump brokered 30-day reprieves with Canada and Mexico, it is unclear how the tariff fight will end with them, and the threats against China \u2014 by far the largest economy of the three \u2014 were not resolved Monday.",
      "China has said\u00a0it will challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization and pursue \u201ccountermeasures\u201d in response.",
      "There is little indication that Republican senators will start to speak out in large numbers against Trump\u2019s threats of trade wars, even if there is a prolonged fight on the issue.",
      "\u201cThere might be a few,\u201d said a political adviser to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. \u201cBut generally, I think there is a sense that Trump holds all the cards here. To the extent there is concern about home state constituencies, I think a lot of that will be expressed quietly and behind the scenes.\u201d",
      "Another veteran Republican familiar with Thune\u2019s thinking said he is unlikely to react in any overtly public or rash way.",
      "\u201cThese are U.S. senators. They have egos like everyone else,\u201d the person said. \u201cSen. Thune approaches things differently. He is more of a read-the-room guy. I\u2019d not expect him to act impulsively on anything, including this.\u201d",
      "The impacts of potential tariffs, for now, have been averted, but the future remains unclear, which leaves uncertainty both in the United States and around the globe. U.S. markets fell early Monday, but they quickly rebounded after the one-month Mexico pause was announced.",
      "Though Trump ran on the promise that tariffs would be good for the nation, in recent days, he has begun to acknowledge that if they are fully implemented there would be some short-term pain. But he now argues that those bumps and bruises would be beneficial to the nation in the long run.",
      "\u201cWill there be some pain? Yes, maybe (and maybe not!),\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social. \u201cBut we will make America great again, and it will all be worth the price that must be paid. We are a country that is now being run with common sense \u2014 and the results will be spectacular!!!\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio has empowered a top official at the State Department to run the U.S. Agency for International Development and begin reviewing all of the work done by the government agency targeted for dismantling by President Donald Trump and tech billionaire adviser Elon Musk.",
      "Rubio tapped Pete Marocco, the director of foreign assistance at the State Department, to begin reviewing all of the work done by USAID. He also warned that certain projects or programs might be suspended or eliminated.",
      "Marocco held several national security positions during the first Trump administration, including at USAID, where his attempts to consolidate power and slash funding drove officials to write a dissent memo that ultimately pushed him out of office, according to multiple sources who spoke with NBC News.",
      "Marocco has worked closely with the administration\u2019s other political appointees at USAID during the first weeks of Trump's second term, two current USAID officials with knowledge of the agency\u2019s new leadership structure and a source familiar with USAID\u2019s day-to-day operations said.",
      "Other people familiar with the agency\u2019s operations say Marocco has largely directed the downsizing of the agency from afar.",
      "\u201cWhat he\u2019s doing now is frighteningly similar to everything he was trying to do at USAID before, but this time he\u2019s destroying it,\u201d said a USAID official familiar with Marocco's past actions.",
      "\u201cIf someone in the private sector did this with no mitigation plan, their stakeholders would go ape s---,\u201d a USAID staffer said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been responsible for building anything ever. He\u2019s very good at turning things off and questioning things and making people feel uncomfortable. He\u2019s taken apart a lot of things.\u201d",
      "The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on those characterizations of Marocco, who has also been tied to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.",
      "In early 2023, online sleuths who aided the FBI in cases against hundreds of Jan. 6 rioters identified Marocco and his now-wife as being among the rioters who stormed the Capitol in 2021, pointing to multiple images of them on the Capitol grounds that day and CCTV video that shows the man they identified as Marocco entering the Capitol through a broken window.",
      "Photos of the person who entered the building were a strong facial recognition match for publicly available images of Marocco, online sleuths said. Marocco, like hundreds of others whom sleuths identified as people who entered the Capitol, was not charged before Trump pardoned all Jan. 6 defendants.",
      "Marocco did not respond to a request for comment. Reached by D Magazine last year, he did not deny that he entered the Capitol, but he referred to \u201csmear tactics and desperate personal attacks.\u201d",
      "USAID has already largely been run out of the State Department since Inauguration Day, multiple sources said.",
      "Rubio had sent a letter informing the relevant congressional committee chairs and ranking members of the Trump administration\u2019s plans to reorganize USAID, four sources familiar with the letter\u2019s delivery said.",
      "In the letter, Rubio told the lawmakers that he is initiating \u201cconsultations\u201d with them about how foreign aid is distributed around the world through the program.",
      "\u201cUSAID has numerous conflicting, overlapping, and duplicative functions that is shares with the Department of State. Additionally, USAID\u2019s systems and processes are not well synthesized, integrated, or coordinated and often result in discord in the foreign policy and foreign relations of the United States,\u201d Rubio wrote. \u201cThis undermines the President\u2019s abilities to carry out foreign relations.\u201d",
      "Marocco\u2019s review could lead to the \u201csuspension or elimination of programs, projects or activities; closing or suspending missions or post; closing, reorganizing, downsizing, or renaming establishments, organizations, bureaus, centers, or offices; reducing the size of the workforce at such entities and contracting out or privatizing functions or activities performed by Federal employees,\u201d Rubio added.",
      "Trump administration officials are actively considering placing USAID under the State Department\u2019s authority, more than a dozen current and former officials and sources familiar with the discussions have said. As of Monday, USAID\u2019s website no longer loads on the web, resulting in a message that its server IP address cannot be found.",
      "USAID employees based out of the nation's capital were ordered overnight not to come into the office Monday and to work from home.",

      "The message said agency personnel who normally work at USAID's headquarters \"will work remotely tomorrow\" except for people who perform essential on-site and building maintenance duties. \"Further guidance will be forthcoming,\" it said.",
      "The email gave no reason for the work-from-home directive. Musk, who has been closely advising Trump after he was tapped to lead his Department of Government Efficiency, said in the early hours Monday that he and Trump were in the process of shutting down USAID.",

      "According to a recent Congressional Research Service report, more than 10,000 people work at the agency, about two-thirds of them overseas.

      "Once again, Trump said in his own post on social media that the U.S. will continue negotiations with Mexico over border security, headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.",
      "Follow live updates here",
      "The announcements come after Trump signed an executive order Saturday to place a 25% tariff on nearly all goods coming into the U.S. from Canada and Mexico starting on Tuesday. The move risked triggering a trade war with two of American\u2019s closest trading partners that could have driven prices higher for American consumers on a range of goods, including cars, fresh produce, homebuilding materials and gasoline.",
      "Trump also placed a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports and took steps to close a loophole that allows Chinese e-commerce companies like Temu and Shein to avoid tariffs by shipping packages worth less than $800 into the U.S. duty free. Those tariffs remain on track to go into effect Tuesday.",
      "China said it will challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization and take unspecified \u201ccountermeasures\u201d in response.",
      "Stocks fell Monday morning in response to the tariff announcement over the weekend, but recovered some of those losses following the agreement with Mexico. The U.S. imports more goods from Mexico than any other country, and economists and business groups had warned the tariffs could raise prices in the U.S. and trigger an economic slowdown.",
      "During his first term, Trump had also threatened to place tariffs on Mexico, before backing away less than two weeks later when Mexico responded with plans to deploy its national guard throughout that country to crack down on immigration and expand a program in which some migrants seeking asylum in the United States would wait for their immigration court hearings in Mexico.",
      "Trudeau had previously announced Saturday night that Canada would respond to Trump's tariffs by issuing its own 25% tariff on $155 billion Canadian worth of U.S. goods. That was set to include immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods as of Tuesday, the day the U.S. said it would begin collecting tariffs on Canadian goods.",
      "Earlier in the day Monday, Trump seemed to dismiss the need for trade with Canada and said the country had treated the U.S. unfairly.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t need them to make our cars. We don\u2019t need them to give us lumber. We don\u2019t need them for agricultural products, because we have all the agriculture we need,\u201d Trump told reporters.",
      "Tariffs on Canada would have driven prices higher for a wide range of goods, including lumber, cars and heating fuel, industry analysts said.",
      "The White House said in the executive order issuing the tariffs that the move was in response to the flow of fentanyl and immigrants coming into the country from Canada and Mexico, which Trump was declaring a national emergency. Under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the president has authority over trade in a national emergency.",
      "Nearly all of the 21,900 pounds of fentanyl seized by U.S. law enforcement in 2024 was at the southern border, with just 43 pounds of fentanyl seized at the northern border, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",
      "But in several social media posts over the weekend, Trump seemed to contradict that rationale, instead citing a trade deficit with the three countries and calling on companies to make their products in America. In another posting, Trump said the tariffs would pressure Canada to join the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars to SUBSIDIZE Canada. Why? There is no reason. We don\u2019t need anything they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have more Lumber than we can ever use. Without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable Country. Harsh but true! Therefore, Canada should become our Cherished 51st State. Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada \u2014 AND NO TARIFFS!\u201d Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "Mexico's Sheinbaum said she and Trump reached the agreement on the tariff delay in a phone call Monday morning. In the call, she said she also asked for U.S. officials to do more to stop the flow of high-powered guns into Mexico, which she said are being used by Mexican criminal groups.",
      "Sheinbaum said Trump asked her how long the tariffs should be paused and she initially said forever.",
      "After some back and forth, she said she suggested a monthlong pause, to which Trump agreed.",
      "\"I am sure that in this month we will be able to give results,\" she said."

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs announced over the weekend \u2014 as well as the promise of more punishing measures leveled against some of Washington\u2019s closest trading partners\u2014 have alarmed allies and spooked markets about what some fear may spiral into a global trade war.",
      "While most world leaders have been circumspect about the levies against Canada, Mexico and China, economists say consumers around the world will face spiraling prices as the supply chains that move goods among countries become more exposed to political risk and therefore costlier.",
      "Chrystia Freeland, a contender\u00a0to be Canada\u2019s prime minister, said Monday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d that Trump\u2019 actions were a \u201ccolossal act of self-harm,\u201d because the measures would also hurt American exporters trying to sell goods to Canada.",
      "\u201cThe fact is, these tariffs are being imposed truly for utterly no reason,\u201d she said. \u201cWe think that it is utterly crazy, and we\u2019re also really, really angry at you.\u201d",
      "But responses from most of America\u2019s\u00a0allies, fearing that they might also be the focuses of the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs, have been milder than Freeland\u2019s, although that\u2019s not uncommon for leaders with experience of Trump's negotiating style.",
      "The European Union said that it would \u201crespond firmly\u201d if Trump hits it with tariffs and that it \u201cregrets\u201d the duties he has imposed so far. Japan said it would \u201ccarefully examine\u201d the potential impact on global trade.",
      "Independent experts \u2014 who do not have to directly do business with Trump for the next four years \u2014 have been more plainspoken.",
      "\u201cWhat was considered to be bluff and bluster from Trump has turned into cold hard reality,\u201d Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at the British investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, said in an email Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s become clear that Trump\u2019s way of doing business is to sow seeds of chaos and unpredictability to gain domestic political wins.\u201d",
      "Promises kept",
      "Trump\u2019s tariffs, some of which are set to take effect Tuesday, are hardly a surprise given that he repeatedly telegraphed them during the election campaign.",
      "He has long seen trade deficits \u2014 countries selling more to the United States than they buy \u2014 as amounting to subsidies and has consistently cited them in his attempts to get countries to buy more American goods, while also pointing to\u00a0the illegal immigration crisis at the southern border and the flow of illicit fentanyl that has killed tens of thousands of people as other reasons for imposing them.",
      "Some of his allies \u2014 including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent \u2014 had suggested that tariffs would be used mainly as a negotiating tactic to gain favorable deals, rather than a practical policy option.",
      "\u201cThe tariff gun will always be loaded and on the table but rarely discharged,\u201d Bessent wrote to investors in his Key Square Group hedge fund last year.",
      "Over the weekend, however, Trump made good on his promise, announcing first Saturday a 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican goods and then a 10% tariff on Chinese ones.",
      "While both Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday that after separate telephone conversations with Trump, the\u00a0planned tariffs had been placed on hold for a month, other parts of the world are also bracing for similar levies, not least the European Union.",
      "The E.U.\u2019s trade deficit is an \u201catrocity,\u201d Trump told reporters in Maryland on Sunday, lamenting that the 27-nation bloc did not \u201ctake our cars, they don\u2019t take our farm products, they take almost nothing, and we take everything from them.\u201d",
      "European response",
      "The E.U. \u201cwould respond firmly to any trading partner that unfairly or arbitrarily imposes tariffs on E.U. goods,\u201d a spokesperson for the bloc said in a statement Monday.",
      "The Trump administration \u201cseems to be really following through with the threats,\u201d said Julian Hinz, a research director for trade policy at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German think tank.",
      "Even so, Europe itself is hardly unified on the issue. The bloc\u2019s traditional mainstream political parties have come under pressure from right-wing populists, many of whom share Trump\u2019s antipathy to the system of global trade that \u2014 alongside immigration \u2014 they blame for eroding jobs in manufacturing and other industries.",
      "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz defended globalization Sunday, saying that it \u201chas proven to be a great success story that has created prosperity for us all\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s why it\u2019s important that we don\u2019t divide up the world now with a lot of customs barriers.\u201d",
      "German auto giant Volkswagen said in a statement the same day that it was \u201ccounting on constructive talks between the trading partners to ensure planning security and economic stability and to avoid a trade conflict.\u201d",
      "Asian markets quake",
      "While Volkswagen was seeking to calm the waters, investors signaled their worries about non-American automakers.",
      "As VW\u2019s shares dropped by more than 5% Monday, the stock prices of Japanese and South Korean giants such as Toyota, Nissan and Honda fell, too, with investors eyeing those companies\u2019 Mexican factories that export cars to the United States.",
      "And in Taiwan, many of whose semiconductor and electronics companies have factories in both Mexico and China, the Economic Affairs Ministry said Monday that it would help companies affected by the U.S. tariffs, including by providing information on how to relocate to the United States.",
      "While the United States\u2019 Asian allies, such as Japan and South Korea, have not been hit with tariffs, they are no less at risk from the effects of the levies on their global corporations.",
      "\u201cWe have to carefully consider the reasoning behind this decision and what impact it may have,\u201d Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told lawmakers Monday. \u201cAt the same time, Mr. Trump often uses the word \u2018fair.\u2019 We will carefully examine how this serves the national interests of the United States and also how this may affect global free trade.\u201d",
      "Worse than expected",
      "Ishiba\u2019s muted reaction echoed those of his European counterparts, and the mild collective reaction of America\u2019s long-standing allies may mask the reality that Trump\u2019s actions are \u201cworse\u201d than expected, said David Henig, a director at the European Centre for International Political Economy, a think tank based in Brussels.",
      "European powers \u201cwould have expected that Trump wanted deals,\u201d Henig said. \u201cBut now he just seems to be saying: \u2018I want tariffs. The more tariffs the better.\u2019 And that leaves the rest of the world, which is used to trading, with big issues.\u201d",
      "What is causing most alarm in the European corridors of power is Trump\u2019s willingness to take action against Washington\u2019s northerly neighbor, Henig said.",
      "\u201cPeople are saying, \u2018Hang on a minute, the U.S. is taking on Canada?\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to put high tariffs on Canada, then frankly anybody would seem to be under threat. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to it.\u201d",
      "There today, here tomorrow",
      "America\u2019s European and Asian allies may well have been glued to financial markets Monday, with the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs having already stung the value of Mexican and Canadian assets.",
      "The Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar slid in early trading Monday, the latter falling to its lowest value against the U.S. dollar since 2003.",
      "Though Trudeau has\u00a0already announced retaliatory Canadian tariffs on a variety of American goods, China has been more restrained.",
      "And while Beijing reacted swiftly to Trump\u2019s tariffs during his first term, this time it has yet to specify how it plans to retaliate apart from saying it would file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization and enact unspecified \u201cnecessary countermeasures.\u201d",
      "Nevertheless, there may be an opportunity in the chaos for Chinese President Xi Jinping \u2014 who is trying to right his country\u2019s torpid economy.",

One of his security guards died, and three more people were injured in the explosion, the newspaper reported, citing Moscow's health department.",
      "\u201cThe assassination attempt on Sarkisyan was carefully planned and was ordered. Investigators are currently identifying those who ordered the crime,\u201d the state news agency Tass quoted a law enforcement official as saying.",
      "Major damage to front of the building, with shattered glass and debris strewn across the lobby, could be seen in a video the Investigative Committee of Moscow posted to Telegram.",
      "Without naming the victims, the committee said in a statement that two people died, one of them in a medical facility. Three more were injured, it added.",
      "Later, Ivan Prikhodko, the Russia-installed mayor of the town of Horlivka in eastern Ukraine where Sarkisyan grew up, said on Telegram that \u201cas a result of a terrorist attack committed in the Alyie Parusa residential complex, Armen Nagapetovich Sargasyan passed away.\u201d",
      "The bomb detonated as a man with bodyguards entered the lobby of the complex \u2014 the name of which translates to \u201cScarlet Sails\u201d \u2014 which lies on the banks of the Moskva River just 7 miles from the Kremlin, according to several Russian media reports.",
      "In 2021, an assassin killed organized crime boss Ali Heydarov, 40, in the complex's gym.",

The Biden administration\u00a0took steps last September\u00a0to curb the \u201coveruse and abuse\u201d of de minimis, arguing it has helped Chinese e-commerce companies undercut competitors with lower prices.\u00a0Officials have also argued\u00a0that de minimis shipments are \u201csubject to minimal documentation and inspection,\u201d raising product safety concerns.",
      "The U.S. processed more than 1.3 billion de minimis shipments in 2024,\u00a0according to data\u00a0from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency. That\u2019s up from 139 million a year in 2015, the CBP said.",
      "The loophole has enabled low-cost e-commerce companies like\u00a0PDD Holdings-owned Temu, Shein and\u00a0Alibaba\u2019s AliExpress, which all have links to China, to offer a virtual smorgasbord of cheap apparel, household items and electronics, such as $15 smartwatches and $3 shoes.",
      "Shein and Temu\u00a0have gone on a digital marketing blitz\u00a0over the last few years in an attempt to lure more deal-hungry shoppers. Temu\u00a0in 2024\u00a0vaulted to the top of\u00a0Apple\u2019s\u00a0list of the most downloaded free apps in the U.S. for the second year in a row, while Shein came in at number 12.",
      "Representatives from Temu, Shein and Alibaba did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Temu\u00a0has previously denied\u00a0that its growth is dependent upon de minimis.",
      "Shein\u00a0previously told CNBC\u00a0that import compliance is a \u201ctop priority.\u201d Shein\u2019s executive chairman, Donald Tang,\u00a0has also said\u00a0he supports efforts to reform de minimis, saying it needs a \u201ccomplete makeover.\u201d",
      "Their popularity in the U.S. prompted\u00a0Amazon\u00a0to\u00a0launch its own bargain outlet, called Haul, last year that allows third-party sellers to ship goods to consumers directly from China. Amazon reportedly relies on the de minimis trade rule to import items sold on Haul to bypass tariffs,\u00a0The Information reported, citing people familiar with the program. An Amazon spokesperson did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.",
      "Amazon,\u00a0eBay\u00a0and\u00a0Etsy\u00a0could stand to benefit from the Trump administration\u2019s clampdown on the de minimis loophole. The companies operate online marketplaces that let third-party sellers market wares directly to consumers, competing directly with Temu and Shein.",
      "Amazon has long connected Chinese manufacturers to American shoppers through its sprawling third-party marketplace. The marketplace is a key component of Amazon\u2019s retail strategy, accounting for about 60% of products sold on the site. Amazon also generates fees by providing fulfillment, shipping, account support and advertising services to sellers.",
      "China-based merchants have made up a sizable contingent of Amazon\u2019s marketplace for many years, though the company acknowledged for the first time in 2023 that they account for a \u201csignificant portion.\u201d By some estimates, they outnumber American sellers on the platform, according to data from\u00a0Marketplace Pulse.",
      "Temu and Shein have also expanded their strategies as the de minimis loophole came under threat. Last year, Temu began onboarding Chinese sellers to its site that have inventory at U.S. warehouses, allowing it to ship packages faster to American shoppers, according to\u00a0The Information. Shein\u00a0has also opened distribution centers\u00a0and\u00a0a supply chain hub\u00a0in the U.S."

      "So far, Trump has insulted Canada, played hardball with Denmark over the future of Greenland, cowed Colombia into repatriating undocumented immigrants on his terms and threatened to wrest from Panama the eponymous canal that is a source of great national pride.",
      "All are U.S. allies or partners to varying degrees. The State Department\u2019s own website hails Panama as a democratic \u201cpartner\u201d that works with the United States to \u201cadvance common interests.\u201d",
      "The website of the U.S. Embassy in Colombia included reports touting a counternarcotics strategy the two countries had devised \u2014 or at least it did during Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. The web pages are no longer available on the site.",
      "Canada fought alongside the United States in Afghanistan and fed and housed stranded airline passengers who couldn\u2019t land after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. After he slapped Canada with a 25% tariff, Trump wrote Sunday that it is propped up by U.S. subsidies to an extent that it can\u2019t stand on its own. It should become the 51st state, he said on his social media platform.",
      "Separately, Trump imposed a 25% tariff on another U.S. ally and neighbor, Mexico, and ordered a 10% tariff on imports from America\u2019s fiercest global rival, China.",
      "\u201cHe is coming down much harder on smaller states that the U.S. has very good relationships with,\u201d said Leslie Vinjamuri, director of the U.S. and the Americas program at Chatham House, a research group based in London. \u201cColombia is a very strong partner of the U.S. in Latin America. Canada and Mexico are also close partners. They\u2019re not adversaries. He is swinging the bat when you don\u2019t even need to do that. America already has the upper hand.\u201d",
      "Taking a tough stance with smaller, largely pro-American countries may seem a low-risk proposition for Trump. None wants to antagonize a superpower. Nor do any have nuclear missiles aimed at U.S. cities.",
      "But there are risks to Trump's brand of diplomacy, national security analysts and former officials say. Nations may rethink their ties to the United States and embrace an eager suitor with billions to spend: China.",
      "\"Colombia is one of a couple of dozen countries with important strategic relations with the U.S. that are increasingly hedging in their relations with China and Russia,\" said a former Biden administration national security official, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly. \"This will demonstrate to them that the U.S. is the kind of partner that pulls this s---. You will see as a consequence Colombia saying yes and kissing Trump\u2019s ass in its public messaging and then opening the door to strategic competitors of the U.S. because they don\u2019t consider the U.S. to be reliable.\"",
      "As Trump's defenders see it, Americans want a steely commander in chief who won't let the country get rolled.",
      "He promised nothing less than a \u201cgolden age\u201d for Americans, and if he can expand the country\u2019s influence around the world, boost wealth and gain more cooperation in hardening the borders, he could leave office with a consequential legacy.",
      "\u201cAt some point you need to demonstrate to your adversaries and to your allies who take you for granted and take advantage of you that those days [are] over \u2014 that the American superpower is back and the sleeping giant has woken up,\u201d said Richard Goldberg, who served in the White House National Security Council during Trump\u2019s first term.",

      "\u201cSpare me the sob story about how Canada is our 'best friend,'\" Vance wrote. \u201cI love Canada and have many Canadian friends.

      "In a move that the White House\u2019s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, called a\u00a0\u201cstep in the right direction,\u201d\u00a0Mulino also said that his country would end an agreement with China to take part in its infrastructure program, called \u201cBelt and Road.\u201d",
      "In the final year of Biden's term in office, the Pew Research Center reported that of 34 countries it surveyed, a majority held favorable views of the United States. By contrast, Pew wrote in 2021 that \"throughout Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, publics around the world held the United States in low regard, with most opposed to his foreign policies.\"",
      "\u201cLook, there\u2019s a problem with that [Trump's] approach, which is you\u2019ve got significant numbers of countries that have deepened and widened their relations with China over the past decade and a half,\u201d said Arturo Sarukhan, a former Mexican ambassador to the United States. \u201cSo this type of Frank Sinatra doctrine \u2014 my way or the highway \u2014 is going to throw a lot of these countries deeper into the embrace of China.\u201d",

      "\u201cYou have the Chinese ambassador trying to take advantage in the short term,\" Ryan Berg, director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in an interview.",
      "In taking a hard-line stance, Trump may have been trying to signal other countries in addition to Colombia that he won't brook any dissent: Leaders must take back their compatriots living in the United States illegally.",
      "It\u2019s not clear, though, that the dustup with Colombia was necessary. Colombian President Gustavo Petro had objected to the Trump administration\u2019s sending people back on military planes, saying they shouldn\u2019t be treated like criminals.",
      "Petro ultimately relented, averting what could have been a ruinous trade war with the United States.",

We did that over and over again. What\u2019s different is Trump wanted to do this with military flights. Colombia initially said no to that. Now they\u2019ll take the flights. In terms of limiting migration, it doesn\u2019t matter if the flights are military or civilian.\u201d",
