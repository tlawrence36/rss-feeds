      "Christopher Nolan has been elected to lead the Directors Guild of America, the organization said late Saturday. The Oscar-winning \u201cOppenheimer\u201d filmmaker said in a statement that it is, \u201cone of the greatest honors of my career.\u201d",
      "The guild represents the interests of some 19,500 film and television directors in the United States and abroad, in addition to hosting the DGA awards annually.",
      "\u201cOur industry is experiencing tremendous change, and I thank the Guild\u2019s membership for entrusting me with this responsibility,\u201d said Nolan, a well-known champion of the theatrical experience and film stock.",
      "The box office success of \u201cOppenheimer,\u201d which was shot entirely on large-format film ( a combination of 70mm and IMAX ), and made over $976 million worldwide made many in the industry reconsider the mass audience appeal of a format that not too long ago was in danger of extinction. Just over a decade ago, facing bankruptcy and an industry that seemed to be migrating to digital, Kodak nearly stopped film production. Filmmakers like Nolan, Martin Scorsese and others rallied to keep it going. Earlier this year, Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cSinners\u201d helped prove the point again.",
      "Nolan will take over for outgoing president Lesli Linka Glatter, who led the group for four years through the Hollywood strikes of 2023. He said he looks forward to collaborating with Glatter and the board \u201cto achieve important creative and economic protections for our members.\u201d",
      "The DGA\u2019s current three-year basic agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of studios and streamers about rates and benefits, expires next year. The AMPTP congratulated Nolan in a statement and wrote that they \u201clook forward to partnering with President Nolan to address the issues most important to DGA members while ensuring our member companies remain competitive in a rapidly changing industry.\u201d",

      "The North American box office has slowed down after a strong September.",
      "Neither a Jordan Peele-produced horror nor a Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell romantic drama were enough to continue the September hot streak at the movies. After back-to-back weekends that had films majorly overperforming, first \u201cThe Conjuring: Last Rights\u201d followed by the anime \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle,\u201d the North American box office slowed significantly.",
      "Overall ticket sales were down nearly 50% from last weekend, with the holdover champion \u201cDemon Slayer\u201d edging out the newcomer \u201cHim\u201d for first place, according to studio estimates Sunday. Crunchyroll and Sony Pictures\u2019 \u201cDemon Slayer\u201d added $17.3 million over the weekend, bringing its total to $104.7 million, which makes it the highest grossing anime film ever in North America.",
      "The football horror \u201cHim\u201d opened in second place with an estimated $13.5 million in ticket sales. Universal Pictures opened \u201cHim\u201d in 3,168 North American theaters, where the audience was 52% male and 65% over the age of 25. Internationally, it earned $400,000.",
      "Produced by Peele\u2019s Monkeypaw and directed by Justin Tipping, \u201cHim\u201d is about a promising young quarterback (Tyriq Withers) who is invited to train with a veteran (Marlon Wayans) at an isolated compound.",
      "\u201cHim\u201d scored with neither critics (it carries a 29% on Rotten Tomatoes) nor audiences, who gave the film a C- CinemaScore. In his review for The Associated Press, film writer Jake Coyle wrote that the film \u201cwas made with the potent premise of bringing the kind of dark, satirical perspective that characterizes a Monkeypaw production to our violent national pastime. But that promise gets fumbled in an allegorical chamber play that grows increasingly tedious.\u201d",
      "\u201cHim\u201d was also nearly upstaged by another horror, \u201cThe Conjuring: Last Rights,\u201d which made an estimated $13 million in its third weekend. With a global total of $400 million, it\u2019s now the biggest film in the Conjuring universe.",

      "One of her aides peeled \u201cMadame President\u201d off celebratory cupcakes before serving them to crushed staffers. Harris kept asking, \u201cMy God, my God, what will happen to our country?\"",

      "Although Harris earned a reputation as guarded and circumspect, the book has the tone of someone who is finished biting her tongue. She concedes mistakes, reveals frustrations and details some of the stranger moments from her race.",
      "The book isn't a winding memoir or a political treatise, and Harris doesn't disclose any future plans. Instead, it reads like a ticking time bomb, with each chapter counting down to Election Day.",
      "Here's some memorable moments.",

      "Biden's team appeared to be in denial. Afterward, they gave Harris talking points that said \u201cJOE BIDEN WON.\"",

      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t able to pull it off and all I can do is apologize,\u201d Fedez added. \u201cIf something like this isn\u2019t understood, it\u2019s because of a mistake made by whoever wrote it. So I take responsibility.\u201d",
      "The reference to \u201cpure-blooded Italian\u201d recalls Italian fascist propaganda from the 1930s, according to Giuseppe Martucci, the city council member, who added that the reference to Hitler was unacceptable.",
      "\u201cI felt it my duty to act and hold up the founding values of our constitution,\u201d Martucci said. \u201cWe can\u2019t allow language the evokes racism and hate to be normalized by public figures.\u201d",
      "By winning four Grand Slam titles over the last two years, Sinner has exceeded Italy\u2019s soccer stars to become the country\u2019s most popular athlete. He lost the U.S. Open final to Carlos Alcaraz this month and lost the No. 1 ranking to his Spanish rival.",
      "This is not the first time that Sinner has faced an underlying sentiment that he isn\u2019t fully Italian.",

      "Curtis, inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Crickets in 2012, died Friday, his wife of more than a half-century, Louise Curtis, confirmed to The Associated Press. His daughter, Sarah Curtis, wrote on his Facebook page that he had been suddenly ill.",
      "Curtis wrote or co-wrote hundreds of songs, from Keith Whitley's country smash \u201cI'm No Stranger to the Rain\u201d to the Everly Brothers' \u201cWalk Right Back,\u201d a personal favorite Curtis completed while in Army basic training. Bing Crosby, Glen Campbell, Bruce Springsteen and the Grateful Dead were among other artists who covered his work.",
      "Born during the Great Depression to cotton farmers outside of Meadow, Texas, Curtis was a childhood friend of Buddy Holly's and an active musician in the formative years of rock, whether jamming on guitar with Holly in the mid-1950s or opening for Elvis Presley when Elvis was still a regional act. Curtis' songwriting touch also soon emerged: Before he turned 20, he had written the hit \u201cSomeday\u201d for Webb Pierce and \u201cRock Around With Ollie Vee\u201d for Holly.",
      "Curtis had left Holly's group, the Crickets, before Holly became a major star. But he returned after Holly died in a plane crash in 1959 and he was featured the following year on the album \u201cIn Style with the Crickets,\u201d which included \u201cI Fought the Law\u201d (dashed off in a single afternoon, according to Curtis, who would say he had no direct inspiration for the song) and the Jerry Allison collaboration \u201cMore Than I Can Say,\u201d a hit for Bobby Vee, and later for Leo Sayer.",
      "Meanwhile, it took until 1966 for \u201cI Fought the Law\u201d and its now-immortal refrain \u201cI fought the law \u2014 and the law won\u201d to catch on: The Texas-based Bobby Fuller Four made it a Top 10 song. Over the following decades, it was covered by dozens of artists, from punk (the Clash) to country (Johnny Cash, Nanci Griffith) to Springsteen, Tom Petty and other mainstream rock stars.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my most important copyright,\u201d Curtis told The Tennessean in 2014.",
      "Curtis' other signature song was as uplifting as \u201cI Fought the Law\u201d was resigned. In 1970, he was writing commercial jingles when he came up with the theme for a new CBS sitcom starring Moore as a single woman hired as a TV producer in Minneapolis. He called the song \u201cLove is All Around,\u201d and used a smooth melody to eventually serve up lyrics as indelible as any in television history:",
      "\u201cWho can turn the world on with her smile? / Who can take a nothing day, and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile? / Well it's you girl, and you should know it / With each glance and every little movement you show it.\u201d",
      "The song's endurance was sealed by the images it was heard over, especially Moore's triumphant toss of her hat as Curtis proclaims, \u201cYou're going to make it after all.\u201d In tribute, other artists began recording it, including Sammy Davis Jr., Joan Jett and the Blackhearts and Minnesota's H\u00fcsker D\u00fc. A commercial release featuring Curtis came out in 1980 and was a modest success, peaking at No. 29 on Billboard's country chart.",

Brooks.",
      "\u201cJames L. Brooks came into this huge empty room, no furniture apart from a phone lying on the floor, and at first, I thought he was rather cold and sort of distant, and he said 'We're not at the stage of picking a song yet, but I'll listen anyway,'\u201d Curtis recalled. \u201cSo I played the song, just me and my guitar, and next thing, he started phoning people, and the room filled up, and then he sent out for a tape recorder.\u201d",
      "Curtis would eventually write two versions: the first used in Season 1, the second and better known for the remaining six seasons. The original words were more tentative, opening with \u201cHow will you make it on your own?\u201d and ending with \u201cYou might just make it after all.\u201d By Season 2, the show was a hit and the lyrics were reworked. The producers had wanted Andy Williams to sing the theme song, but he turned it down and Curtis' easygoing baritone was heard instead.",
      "Curtis made a handful of solo albums, including \u201cSonny Curtis\u201d and \u201cSpectrum,\u201d and hit the country Top 20 with the 1981 single \u201cGood Ol' Girls.\u201d In later years, he continued to play with Allison and other members of the Crickets. The band released several albums, among them \u201cThe Crickets and Their Buddies,\u201d featuring appearances by Eric Clapton, Graham Nash and Phil Everly. One of Curtis' more notable songs was \u201cThe Real Buddy Holly Story,\u201d a rebuke to the 1978 biopic \u201cThe Buddy Holly Story,\u201d which starred Gary Busey.",

    "story": [
      "Robert Redford, who died Tuesday at 89, transformed the film industry with the Sundance Institute and Film Festival",
      "Robert Redford was disillusioned with the Hollywood mainstream. The Sundance Kid, who died Tuesday at age 89, knew that there were more stories out there, ones that weren\u2019t getting made into films because of the rigidity of the business. So he made something different, founding Sundance Institute and the Sundance Film Festival as an alternative avenue for emerging filmmakers, where independence was a virtue, not a liability.",
      "Over the past four decades, the institute and the festival have given an early platform to countless young filmmakers, including Steven Soderbergh, Paul Thomas Anderson, Quentin Tarantino, Ryan Coogler, Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, Nicole Holofcener, Nia DaCosta, Taika Waititi, Ava DuVernay, Rian Johnson, Gina Prince-Bythewood, Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert and many more.",
      "\u201cFor me, the word to be underscored is \u2018independence.\u2019 I\u2019ve always believed in that word. That\u2019s what led to me eventually wanting to create a category that supported independent artists who weren\u2019t given a chance to be heard,\u201d Redford told The Associated Press in 2018. \u201cThe industry was pretty well controlled by the mainstream, which I was a part of. But I saw other stories out there that weren\u2019t having a chance to be told and I thought, \u2018Well, maybe I can commit my energies to giving those people a chance.\u2019 As I look back on it, I feel very good about that.\u201d",
      "In 2019, Redford said he intended to step back from his public facing role at the festival, though he remained the organization's president and founder until his death.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re at a point where I can move on to a different place, because the thing I\u2019ve missed over the years is being able to spend time with the films and with the filmmakers and to see their work and be part of their community,\u201d he said at the 2019 kickoff. \u201cI don\u2019t think the festival needs a whole lot of introduction now: It runs on its own course, and I\u2019m happy for that.\u201d",
      "Redford\u2019s love affair with Utah began much earlier, on a cross-country motorcycle road trip in 1961 when he bought 2 acres of land. By 1969, with more money in his pocket from his film successes, he\u2019d purchased 5,000 acres, some of which was a mountain resort but most of the land was for wilderness preserves. He named it Sundance, after his character in \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\u201d",
      "In 1981, the year he won best picture and director for \u201cOrdinary People,\u201d he established the Sundance Institute, a nonprofit organization and held the first filmmakers lab at the Sundance Mountain Resort, about 13 miles northeast of Provo. A few years later, in 1985, the institute took over what was then known as the U.S. Film Festival, which would later be renamed the Sundance Film Festival. The festival in the mid-80s hosted the Coen brothers \u201cBlood Simple\u201d and Jim Jarmusch\u2019s \u201cStranger Than Paradise.\u201d",
      "The festival was really put on the map when Soderbergh premiered \u201csex, lies and videotape\u201d in Park City in 1989. A true indie, the film went on to win the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes and get an Oscar nomination, but it was its box office success that ignited a veritable indie film boom. And Sundance was where all the discoveries were happening. In 1991, the festival premiered \u201cDaughters of the Dust,\u201d \u201cParis is Burning\u201d and \u201cSlacker,\u201d in 1992, Tarantino\u2019s \u201cReservoir Dogs,\u201d in 1993, Wes Anderson brought \u201cBottle Rocket,\u201d and in 1994 \u201cHoop Dreams\u201d and \u201cClerks.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Robert Redford, independent art houses might not have succeeded,\u201d said Gary Meyer, cofounder of Landmark Theatre, and a former festival director at Telluride who also worked with Redford. \u201cHaving the \u2018Sundance Kid\u2019 give his stamp of approval to independent features and documentaries brought audiences to our theaters, while helping launch the careers of dozens of filmmakers \u2026 He made it \u2018cool\u2019 to see adventurous movies when they came to commercial neighborhood theaters.\u201d",
      "In 1994, the Sundance Institute also made a commitment to Indigenous filmmakers by launching a festival program to showcase Native and Indigenous films that continues to this day.",
      "The festival might get the most headlines, but it\u2019s the year-round work of the Institute that has really left a mark on independent cinema.

      "NEW YORK -- Born during the Great Depression with sun-kissed California looks, Robert Redford never failed to epitomize something quintessential and hopeful about the American character.",
      "Redford, who died Tuesday at the age of 89, left a movie trail etched into land. He seemed to reside as much across the American landscape as he did on movie screens. He was in the Rocky Mountains of \u201cJeremiah Johnson,\u201d the Wyoming grasslands of \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\u201d the Washington, D.C., alleyways of \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men\u201d and the Montana streams of \u201cA River Runs Through It.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrom the time I was just a kid, I was always trying to break free of the bounds that I was stuck with, and always wanted to go outside,\u201d Redford told The Associated Press in 2018.",
      "Redford, a movie-star paragon, was surely savvy with how he played with and used his all-American image. No one who starred in the baseball drama \u201cThe Natural\u201d (1984) and gave Bernard Malamud\u2019s novel a storybook ending couldn't have some sense of self-mythology. But it was one of Redford\u2019s greatest feats that, despite his fame, he remained innately connected to some aspirational American ideal. Redford, an open-air actor of easy, rugged charm, evoked the kind of regular guy decency that stars like Jimmy Stewart did before him \u2014 only Redford did it through an era of distrust and disillusionment.",
      "\u201cHe was to me a throwback to the actors that I was nuts about when I was growing up and going to movies: real, classical, traditional, old-fashioned movie stars who were very, very redolent of some kind of American essence,\u201d said Sydney Pollack, who directed Redford in \u201cJeremiah Johnson,\u201d \u201cThe Way We Were\u201d and \u201cThree Days of the Condor,\u201d in 1993. \u201cThey were very much a part of the American landscape and they were heroic in a kind of understated way.\u201d",
      "That was most true, perhaps, in Utah. Wanting to escape paved-over Los Angeles, Redford first began buying land there early in his career. In Utah, he would fight to protect both untrampled wilderness and a spirit of moviemaking that had grown increasingly difficult in Hollywood. As a longtime trustee of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group, Redford was an outspoken environmentalist. In the 1970s, he successfully opposed a pair of rural Utah proposals: a six-lane highway and coal-fired power plant.",
      "In the Utah mountains, Redford also launched the Sundance Institute. Beyond Sundance's annual festival for independent film, the institute has been a lifeblood young filmmakers. Its year-round laboratory \u2014 the part of Sundance that Redford was most proud of \u2014 has helped nurture some of the most vital voices in American cinema for decades.",
      "\u201cFor me, the word to be underscored is \u2018independence,\u2019\u201d Redford once said of his legacy. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed in that word. That\u2019s what led to me eventually wanting to create a category that supported independent artists who weren\u2019t given a chance to be heard. The industry was pretty well controlled by the mainstream, which I was a part of. But I saw other stories out there that weren\u2019t having a chance to be told.\u201d",
      "That spirit of independence often infused his films, too. When Redford wanted to make \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d the seminal 1976 film directed by Alan Pakula about Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein\u2019s Watergate investigation, few in the film industry thought there was much drama to be found in a story that was then several years old.",
      "\u201cNixon had already resigned, and the held opinion (in Hollywood) was \u2018No one cares. No one wants to hear about this,\u2019\u201d Redford, who also co-produced the film, said in 2006. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018No, it\u2019s not about Nixon. It\u2019s about something else. It\u2019s about investigative journalism and hard work.\u2019\u201d",
      "If \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d one of the greatest newspaper movies, detailed the hard-earned revelations of Watergate, \u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d \u2014 one of the greatest political thrillers \u2014 captured the paranoia and disillusionment that followed. If anyone was completely unfamiliar with why Redford was so good, \u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d would be a good place to start.",

No one has ever been better at playing the regular guy trying to think fast on his feet, and make sense of an ever-darker world.",
      "Though some called for him to, Redford never entered politics, himself. He remained outspoken \u2014 he's in some way the model for the modern Hollywood activist \u2014 on a wide range of issues, including Indigenous and LGBTQ+ rights. The closest he came to running for office was Michael Ritchie's 1972 satire \u201cThe Candidate,\u201d in which Redford played an idealistic lawyer enlisted to challenge a highly favored incumbent Republican senator. Redford\u2019s candidate ultimately wins, but not without sacrificing his principles and seeing much of what he stands for diluted.",
      "Redford\u2019s place, instead, was outside politics. The perfect bookend to his \u201970s movies is \u201cSneakers,\u201d Phil Alden Robinson\u2019s absurdly underrated 1992 caper starring Redford as a former \u201960s radical now living under a false moniker and leading a band of security specialists. They stumble into possession of a computer device that brings the attention of the NSA, CIA, FBI and many others, forcing Redford to, yet again, try to figure out what\u2019s moral in a dangerous (and now newly digital) America.",
      "The world that Redford\u2019s films often presciently depicted seemed to push him further into the wilderness, on screen and off. He largely retreated into retirement over the last decade. When Redford died, he was at his home in the Utah mountains, outside Provo. One of his last films was 2015's \u201cA Walk in the Woods,\u201d playing Bill Bryson ambling along the Appalachian Trail.",
      "The most fitting and elegiac swan song, though was J.C. Chandor\u2019s \u201cAll Is Lost,\u201d a near-wordless 2013 drama about an old man at sea. Redford plays a solo mariner whose sailboat collides with a shipping container. Though terse, the movie reverberates with economic and ecological metaphor. A visibly older and weathered Redford \u2014 no longer the golden, freckled face of his youth \u2014 suffers through increasingly rough and stormy seas, improvising his survival.",
      "For an actor who had covered so much ground, \u201cAll Is Lost\u201d was one last frontier. Redford's unnamed character was credited only as \u201cOur Man.\u201d",

      "Anthony Roth Costanzo, who introduced $11 tickets to Opera Philadelphia, aims to surprise audiences again with the company\u2019s new season as it celebrates its 50th anniversary",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- Anthony Roth Costanzo, the man who brought $11 opera tickets to Philadelphia, hopes to keep surprising audiences during the company\u2019s new season.",
      "\u201cIt is very much opera. It\u2019s dramatic, it\u2019s cathartic, it\u2019s collaborative in interdisciplinary ways,\u201d Costanzo said of Opera Philadelphia\u2019s 50th anniversary season \u2014 the first he\u2019s been able to plan since taking charge of the financially teetering company last year. \u201cBut it\u2019s different from what your perception of opera might be.\u201d",
      "He slated a work by Rossini to kick things off, with opening night set for Friday. But instead of choosing a repertory staple, Costanzo picked the less-familiar \u201cIl viaggio a Reims.\u201d And the production will be anything but traditional: Director Damiano Michieletto has changed the original setting from an inn to an art gallery where the portraits come alive and sing.",
      "After that the offerings become even more adventurous. There\u2019s a multimedia piece by playwright Sarah Ruhl set to music by Vivaldi \u2014 including \u201cThe Seasons\u201d \u2014 and starring Costanzo, who maintains a flourishing performing career as a countertenor. Then comes a world premiere with libretto by Pulitzer-winner Michael R. Jackson and a score by 10 different composers. Another new opera follows, by Gregory Spears, in which the chorus has the starring role. Finally, bass-baritone Dav\u00f3ne Tines performs a \u201cvaudevillian rendering\u201d of a poem by Langston Hughes.",
      "\u201cAs I put all of the pieces together, I thought, how can I encapsulate this in just a few simple words,\u201d Costanzo said. \u201cAnd what occurred to me was: \u2018Opera, but different.\u2019 And that is the slogan of the season.\u201d",
      "His pride in the lineup is understandable, especially given that when he took over it wasn\u2019t certain there would even be a 2025-26 season.",
      "The company was nearing bankruptcy and needed to quickly raise $4 million, he recalled.",
      "Almost immediately he instituted a \u201cpick your price\u201d policy under which people could buy tickets to any seat in the house starting at $11. (The website gives buyers a range of higher options and invites them to make a donation on top of the purchase. Season subscriptions at higher prices are also still available.)",
      "\u201cI said OK, I have to think like a venture capitalist,\u201d Costanzo said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to spend money to make money. Besides, he said, the old pricing system was projected to bring in only 8% of the revenue the company needed, so little was at risk from the new policy.",
      "The publicity and good will generated by the move helped the company quickly raise $7 million in donations, more than enough to retire the debt. When tickets went on sale for 2024-25, all three operas sold out within three weeks, and the season ended with a surplus of $2.4 million.",
      "Corrado Rovaris, the company\u2019s longtime music director, was on the podium for the season-opening performance last fall of Missy Mazzoli\u2019s \u201cThe Listeners,\u201d a recent work having its U.S. premiere.",
      "\u201cIt was amazing to see the reaction in the house,\u201d he recalled. \u201cBeautiful to see a full house but also to see such an enthusiastic house. Beautiful and very moving.\u201d",

      "In a good portent for the growth of the company\u2019s audience, two-thirds of those who chose the \u201cpick your price option\u201d had never bought tickets to Opera Philadelphia before, and most were under 45 years old. This year a similar percentage are either first-timers or repeats from last season.",
      "As a result of the brighter financial outlook, the new season offers twice as many performances as last, though the budget is still substantially lower than it was in 2017, when the company launched an adventurous festival format that had several different works in performance over a period of two weeks.",
      "Just how did Costanzo settle on that $11 figure?",
      "\u201cAt first I thought it should be $25,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the problem is that everywhere across the country I see \u2018tickets starting at $25\u2026\u2019 and I thought people would see that and think, Oh, yeah, you can sit up in the top balcony.",

      "Major League Baseball has canceled plans to play games in London next season due to scheduling conflicts with West Ham's Olympic Stadium and TV commitments",
      "NEW YORK -- Major League Baseball has abandoned plans to play two games in London next season because of scheduling issues with West Ham's Olympic Stadium and the sport's television partner.",
      "MLB had hoped to have the New York Yankees and Toronto Blue Jays meet in London on June 13 and 14, but West Ham is home for its Premier League finale against Leeds on May 24. That left too little time to convert the field to baseball, and MLB was unable to schedule games there for later in June because Fox lacked available broadcast slots due to World Cup commitments.",
      "Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Tuesday after his question-and-answer session at Front Office Sports' \u201cTuned In\u201d event that the London games were definitely off.",
      "MLB played in London for the first time in 2019 when the New York Yankees swept two games from the Boston Red Sox. A planned two-game series between the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs in 2020 was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic, and series were split there by the Cardinals and Cubs in 2023 and the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies in 2024.",
      "MLB's labor contract included games in Paris for 2025 but they were called off because MLB and the players' association couldn't find a promoter.",
      "\u201cWe remain interested in Europe. We think London is an important jumping off point for us,\u201d Manfred said during his Q&A session. \u201cWe have a facility that has come a long way since the first Yankee-Red Sox game. It\u2019s a much better ballpark now than it was due to their willingness to make investments in that. We continue to believe that there\u2019s an opportunity there and that we can get at the developed economies in Europe through that London entree.\u201d",
      "Manfred said MLB is working on grassroots initiatives in India because of that nation's affinity for cricket.",
      "\u201cWe're really starting from the bottom up,\u201d he said.",
      "Mexico also is a priority. MLB played regular-season games at Monterrey in 1996, 1999, 2018 and 2019, and at Mexico City in 2023 and 2024. Arizona and San Diego are likely to play at Mexico City next April 25 and 26.",
      "\u201cWe have worked very hard to develop better relationships with the Mexican professional leagues,\" Manfred said. \"We think we can ultimately build those relationships in a way that they look like Japan and Korea: The domestic professional league thrives, but we have enough players coming to the U.S. to play that it drives our business here in the U.S.\u201d",
      "MLB has gained in the Asian market, especially in recent years because of Shohei Ohtani's following. MLB opened the season at Tokyo in 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2019 and this year, and at Seoul, South Korea, in 2024.",
      "\u201cOur approach to international has always been country by country, largely because we find the places we\u2019re interested in to be in different stages of development,\u201d Manfred said. \"With respect to Japan and Korea, we made investments there. We monetarily, and players, in terms of the sweat equity involved, of making the trip to Tokyo to open the season, making the trip to Seoul to open the season, that we have started to see return on those investments.",
      "\u201cI think that the opportunity to monetize the great fan base that we have in Japan and Korea will show up in terms of purely international revenue, but it will also show up in our national media. My prediction is there will be some of the more media companies \u2014 the streamers will be really interested in the ability to get access to well-developed economies where they don\u2019t have as much penetration as they do in countries like the United States and Canada. So it\u2019s going to show up in different places out of those developed economies.\u201d",

      "Playwright David Bar Katz is helping artists facing financial stress through The Relentless Award, the largest annual cash prize in American theater",
      "NEW YORK -- Many times in his life, playwright David Bar Katz didn't know how he was going to pay the bills. These days, he's helping the next generation of artists facing that same dilemma.",
      "Katz oversees The Relentless Award, the largest annual cash prize in American theater to a playwright in recognition of a new play. It's celebrating its 10th anniversary this year and, as always, seeking submissions that \u201cexhibit fearlessness.\u201d The award also honors musical theater.",
      "\u201cBeing able to create under financial stress is so difficult, and so anything we can do to give artists a little breathing room is what we want,\u201d says Katz.",
      "The award was inspired by Katz's friend and collaborator Philip Seymour Hoffman, the late actor who was described as relentless in his pursuit of truth in his art. A musical theater honor was added after the 2020 death of another of Katz's friends, Fountains of Wayne co-founder Adam Schlesinger.",
      "\u201cTo me, a big aspect of the award \u2014 the musical and the straight play \u2014 is not merely honoring Phil and Adam, but the idea of expanding their artistic legacies,\u201d says Katz.",
      "Some of the plays that have been recognized have gone on to great success, like Aleshea Harris\u2019 2016 winner \u201cIs God Is,\u201d which has been made into a movie starring Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Vivica A. Fox, Sterling K. Brown and Kara Young.",
      "\u201cAlicia typifies the whole point of the award,\u201d says Katz. \u201cI think at a moment in her life where she, like so many of us other artists, had kind of had it, she won the award and that was incredibly meaningful in her career.\u201d",
      "Other successes include Sarah DeLappe\u2019s \u201cThe Wolves\u201d and Clare Barron\u2019s \u201cDance Nation\u201d \u2014 joint winners in 2015 \u2014 who have gone on to become Pulitzer Prize finalists. \u201cThe impact, especially of those three plays, has been profound in theater,\u201d Katz says.",
      "The musical and the playwriting honors alternate each year. The winner this year is Jack D. Coen, who created the musical comedy \u201cJo Jenkins Before the Galactic Court of Consciousness.\u201d",
      "Cohen will receive $65,000 and his musical \u2014 as well as the works of the finalists \u2014 will be honored at a ceremony and performance on Oct. 12 at Building for the Arts\u2019 multi-theater complex, Theatre Row. Chris Collingwood, of Fountains of Wayne, will be performing as well.",

      "The play \u201cArt\u201d returns to Broadway with a fresh revival and a starry cast",
      "For evidence of how high inflation has gotten, look no further than Broadway. The fancy painting at the heart of the play \u201cArt\u201d cost the equivalent of $40,000 in 1998. In a crackling new revival, it's a hefty $300,000.",
      "The painting in question is a 4-by-5-foot white-on-white work with white lines. Playwright Yasmina Reza puts it at the center of an escalating fight between three male, middle-aged friends that exposes their fault lines, leading to a night in which each are ripped apart by the others and putting a 25-year friendship in jeopardy.",
      "If $300,000 sounds like a ridiculous price for a monothematic canvas, you'll side with Marc, played with pitch-perfect exasperation by Bobby Cannavale. If the painting speaks to you, you'll be with Serge, a flinty, slightly full-of-himself Neil Patrick Harris. If you just want to hang out and not talk about the painting any more, you'll identify with James Corden's hapless Yvan.",
      "Under Scott Ellis' tight and enthralling direction and with three perfectly cast actors who seem to be having a ball at the Music Box Theatre, \u201cArt\u201d frequently erupts in laughter but still has plenty to say about friendship, power dynamics and how we get on each others' nerves. The 90-minute play opened Tuesday night.",
      "This is the first time \u201cArt,\u201d translated from the original French by Christopher Hampton and which won the Tony Award for best play in 1998 starring Alan Alda, Victor Garber and Alfred Molina, has returned to Broadway, and it feels nothing like an antique. Designer David Rockwell puts the latest three lads in an elegant gray, spare living room that reeks of chilly luxury but also has little personality.",
      "Marc believes that Serge \u2014 by buying the Modernist painting against the express aesthetic rules followed by Marc \u2014 is indicating that he has stepped out of Marc\u2019s shadow. It is for him nothing less than a betrayal. Serge finds a new intolerance and inflexibility in his friend and a hostility to things new. They both lobby Yvan to be on their side, and when he vacillates, he is declared a spineless amoeba.",

      "Cannavale's Marc is prone to outbursts and patting his friend's shoulders, less out of affection than an expression of dominance. Harris' Serge goes from needy to flinty to icy, and Corden fills his Yvan with the comedian's gift for physical comedy, literally plunging into a sofa to search for something or looking sheepish as he buttons a jacket.",
      "A highlight is a hysterical scene in which the three men, still festering their grievances, silently eat olives and drop the pits in a bowl with a loud ting. And Corden triggers a mid-show ovation after nailing a 900-word monster of a monologue that smacks of Mark Rylance doing something similar in the same theater in \u201cLa B\u00eate.\u201d",
      "\u201cArt\u201d has never been a discussion about Modern art, despite its title. The white painting is merely the playwright's way to get at microaggressions and competition among friends, and how seemingly small things \u2014 like the way one waves away cigarette smoke or the tone of a suggestion \u2014 can fester in the other.",

      "Robert Caro has received the first-ever Historians' Laureate Medal from The New York Historical",
      "NEW YORK -- Receiving an award from one of Manhattan's oldest cultural institutions, The New York Historical, had Robert Caro thinking about childhood.",
      "\u201cIt (New York Historical) has been a very integral element of my life since I was a little boy,\" Caro said Wednesday night during his brief remarks as he accepted the first-ever Historians' Laureate Medal in the organization's 221 year-old existence.",
      "A native New Yorker who grew up near what was then called the New-York Historical Society and still lives just blocks away, Caro remembered many visits growing up as he walked around the neighborhood with a favorite aunt.",
      "\"Among the various honors I\u2019ve been lucky enough to receive, this is an award that is very special,\" added Caro, whose awards range from the Pulitzer Prize for his epic biography of municipal builder, Robert Moses, \u201cThe Power Broker,\u201d to a National Book Award for the third volume of his celebrated Lyndon Johnson series, \u201cMaster of the Senate.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd in a way, as I stand here before you tonight, I have this wonderful feeling that my life has come full circle, in a wonderful circle,\" he said, speaking to hundreds gathered for The New York Historical's \u201cHistory Makers Gala.\u201d",
      "Caro, who turns 90 next month and is still working on the long-awaited fifth Johnson book, has for years been the unofficial laureate of The New York Historical. His career is the subject of a permanent exhibition, his archives are stored there and a research room is named for him. He was introduced at the ceremony by a close friend, singer Judy Collins, who cited Caro's musical approach to his writing, his attention to rhythm and mood.",

      "A vaccine advisory committee handpicked by U.S. Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. met in Atlanta for two days this week to consider various vaccine recommendations",
      "NEW YORK -- A vaccine advisory committee handpicked by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met in Atlanta this week to consider whether to revise recommendations on shots against COVID-19, hepatitis B, and a combination shot that protects children against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox.",
      "The panel, which is charged with making vaccine recommendations, declined to recommend COVID-19 vaccines, saying instead that people could make individual decisions \u2014 a move that adds confusion as people weigh whether to get a dose this fall.",
      "During the sometimes chaotic two-day meeting, the panel also recommended new restrictions for a vaccine that protects against chickenpox as well as measles, mumps and rubella. In a surprise move, the group indefinitely postponed an expected vote on hepatitis B shots given to infants on the day they are born.",
      "With Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic, leading the country's health agencies, the meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, struck a different tone from past gatherings. Among the 12 members, all chosen this year by Kennedy after he fired the previous 17-member panel, are people who have criticized and spread misinformation about vaccines. Critics say the panel's makeup and agenda could sow distrust in the shots.",
      "The panel's recommendations will be sent to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency that has been rocked by disagreements over Kennedy's vaccine policies. The panel's recommendations are usually adopted by the CDC, and then widely followed by doctors and insurers.",
      "Here are some takeaways from the meeting.",
      "The panel on Friday debated COVID-19 vaccinations as the virus has remained a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths last fall and winter, according to CDC data.",
      "Until now, the vaccinations had been routinely provided to nearly all Americans who wanted them. The Food and Drug Administration recently put new restrictions on this year\u2019s shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax, reserving them for people over 65 or younger ones who are deemed at higher risk from the virus.",
      "Panelists declined to recommend the shots for anyone, including seniors and high-risk populations. They said individuals could make their own decisions. Removing the recommendations that were previously in place may confuse Americans trying to decide whether and how to get their fall boosters.",
      "The panel also urged the CDC to adopt stronger language around claims of vaccine risks, despite pushback from outside medical groups who said the shots had a proven safety record from the billions of doses administered worldwide.",
      "The divided panel narrowly avoided urging states to require a prescription for the shot.",
      "Several states have announced policies to try to ensure people's access to COVID-19 vaccines, worried about Friday\u2019s ACIP decision. And a group representing most health insurers, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, said earlier this week that its members will continue covering the shots through 2026.",
      "The committee recommended that a combined vaccine known as MMRV should not be given to children under 4. Instead, they said in an 8-3 vote with one abstention, children in this age group should get separate vaccines \u2014 one for MMR and another for varicella, or chickenpox.",
      "Their discussions centered on rare feverish seizures that can occur in kids who receive the first dose, between the ages of 1 and 2. Medical experts agree these seizures, while potentially frightening for families, are not linked to brain function or school problems.",
      "In 2009, the ACIP changed a previous recommendation to advise that either the combination shot or separate shots were acceptable for the first dose.",
      "Some doctors and public health experts say they are not aware of any new safety data that would explain the revisiting of those vaccination recommendations.",
      "About 85% of children already receive separate doses for the first round, according to information presented at the meeting.",

      "The panelists considered whether to recommend delaying that initial vaccination \u2014 something doctors and parents already can choose to do.",
      "One committee member asked if the vaccination right after birth was \u201casking our babies to solve an adult problem.\u201d Hepatitis B can spread through sex, sharing needles, or from an infected mother to a newborn baby.",
      "But several outside medical experts criticized that the committee was debating the issue at all and said the vaccine is safe and successful at reducing infant infections.",
      "After discussing it on Thursday, the panel decided Friday morning to indefinitely postpone a vote on the issue.",
      "Chairman Martin Kulldorff opened the meeting by challenging former CDC directors to a public debate. Several doctors representing outside medical groups accused the panel of not following the CDC\u2019s long-established guidelines in weighing evidence for making recommendations.",
      "CDC staff, as usual, presented numerous studies on the topics being debated, explaining how they chose which research to discuss. But a few times, panel members cited different papers they had found, including ones done in mice, which are not generally considered applicable.",
      "The committee also took a vote on Thursday that they had to redo on Friday morning concerning the government\u2019s Vaccines for Children program, which covers vaccine costs for about half of U.S. kids.

      "A government watchdog has raised concerns about high administrative costs in Georgia's Medicaid program",
      "ATLANTA -- A federal watchdog reported Thursday that Georgia\u2019s program requiring able-bodied adults to document low-paying work to get Medicaid has spent much more on administrative costs than on providing health care.",
      "The U.S. Government Accountability Office report on Georgia Pathways comes after Republicans mandated similar work requirements throughout the U.S. as part of the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d signed into law by President Donald Trump.",
      "Starting in 2027, most adults who seek Medicaid coverage must first show they are working, taking classes or performing community service for at least 80 hours a month. And they must be extremely poor, earning incomes no higher than the federal poverty line.",
      "The report attributes most of the administrative costs to the implementation of changes in determining eligibility and enrolling people, along with duplicative technology, training and coordination while the state litigated to overcome Biden administration objections.",
      "\u201cNow the entire country can see what we in Georgia already know \u2014 Georgia\u2019s Medicaid work reporting requirement program is the real waste, fraud, and abuse,\u201d Sen. Raphael Warnock, one of the Georgia Democrats who requested the report. \u201cThis report shows that Pathways is incredibly effective at barring working people from health coverage and making corporate consultants richer,\" his statement said.",
      "A spokesperson for Republican Gov. Brian Kemp countered that Democrats are responsible for the extra spending.",
      "\u201cNow, as other states prepare to adopt our model and reject one-size-fits-none big government healthcare, Democrats like Senators Ossoff and Warnock are trying to rewrite history after four years of inaction and blame the State for costs associated with their own stonewalling.\"",
      "Millions of eligible people will lose coverage due to the Trump law because the administrative process will make it too difficult for them to repeatedly document their work, critics say, pointing to what happened in Georgia, which is so far the only state that imposes work requirements.",
      "Georgia has among the highest rates of uninsured and is one of 10 states that refused to expand Medicaid to all adults with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level, as envisioned by President Barack Obama's health care overhaul.",
      "Instead, Kemp heralded his July 2023 launch of Georgia Pathways to Coverage, which limits Medicaid for adults to those who earn no more than poverty-level wages, now set at $15,650 a year. Georgia's traditional Medicaid still covers poorer children, disabled adults, poor people in nursing homes and a handful of other adults.",
      "Nationally, most adults on Medicaid in states that expanded it are already working, and in Georgia, an estimated 246,365 adults are potentially eligible for traditional Medicaid or Pathways. But a year after it launched, Pathways had enrolled around 4,300. As of this spring, there were 6,514 adults enrolled, according to the state Department of Community Health.",

      "BERLIN -- Air force fighter jets from Germany and Sweden were scrambled Sunday to intercept and track a Russian surveillance plane that was flying unidentified over the Baltic Sea, military officials said.",

It had been flying without providing a flight path or radio contact that could signal its presence, Swedish and German air force officials said.",

      "On Friday, three Russian fighter aircraft entered Estonia\u2019s airspace without permission and stayed there for 12 minutes, the Estonian Foreign Ministry said.

    "story": [
      "Vietnamese singer Duc Phuc was crowned the winner of the newly revamped Intervision song contest \u2014 a Russian answer to Eurovision that some say is as much about politics and power as it is about performance",
      "When Vietnamese singer Duc Phuc held aloft the crystal cup trophy in Moscow\u2019s Live Arena on Saturday night, he became the inaugural winner of new song contest Intervision \u2014 a Russian answer to Eurovision that some say is as much about politics and power as it is about performance.",
      "In a show overflowing with thundering vocals and pyrotechnics, Duc Phuc's song \u201cPhu Dong Thien Vuong,\u201d a heady mix of pop, rap and dubstep, saw off second-place Kyrgyzstan to take home the grand prize of 30 million rubles (about $360,000).",
      "The final also brought the unexpected. Moments before the U.S. entrant, Australian-born Vassy, was due to take to the stage, the show's presenters announced that she would not be able to perform due to \u201cpolitical pressure\u201d from the Australian government. Another act, singer-songwriter Brandon Howard, had been slated to perform for the U.S. until three days before the final show. He ultimately dropped out due to \u201cunforeseen family circumstances.\u201d",
      "Vassy told the Associated Press that she was not able to currently comment on the incident.",
      "Then, as Russian singer Shaman finished his act, he delivered a passionate speech asking for Russia's performance not to be considered by the international jury.",
      "\u201cRussia has already won by inviting so many countries to join us,\u201d he said.",
      "For decades, the sequin-encrusted pinnacle of international music competitions has been Eurovision \u2014 the European Broadcasting Union\u2019s continent-spanning celebration of song. Intervision wants to claim that crown. Much like Eurovision, the contest sees acts perform under their national flag in front of thousands in a bid to win votes and glory.",
      "But beneath the glitter, geopolitics bubbles. Signed into life by special presidential decree in February \u2014 three years after Moscow was barred from Eurovision for its full-scale invasion of Ukraine \u2014 the Russia-hosted Intervision gives Moscow a self-built platform back on the global cultural stage.",
      "Kremlin officials insist that Intervision is not an example of Russian soft power. \u201cWhat we are doing is diametrically opposite to the attempts to use sports, art, and any other human activities for political gains,\u201d Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told journalists in a pre-contest press conference.",
      "Yet high-level Russian politicians have been consistently linked to promoting Intervision. President Vladimir Putin discussed the contest during his state visit to China at the start of September and recorded a special video message screened before the show began. Lavrov also appeared at the show, holding an interview between the first and second acts.",
      "The competition\u2019s importance in showing a Russia that has been embraced, not ostracized, by the world at large, despite its 3\u00bd-year war, is impossible to avoid.",
      "\u201cEurovision pales in comparison to Intervision,\u201d lawmaker Leonid Slutsky told Russian state news agency Tass. \u201c(It) destroys the myth of Russian isolation.\u201d",
      "Intervision is modeled after a socialist-era contest of the same name hosted in Czechoslovakia between 1965 and 1968, and Poland between 1977 and 1980. Although the 2025 Intervision has been hailed as a revival, the competitions never sparked much interest in Soviet Russia, says historian Dean Vuletic, author of \u201cPostwar Europe and the Eurovision Song Contest.\u201d",
      "Czechoslovak and Polish television \"saw Intervision as a bridge between East and West,\u201d Vuletic says. \u201cThey wanted to attract the attention of Western media, Western record companies.\u201d",
      "Foreign artists also used Intervision to build their global profile. Boney M famously featured as an interval act in 1979, where they performed their hit \u201cRasputin.\u201d",
      "In 2025, there are still plenty of artists ready to embrace a global audience, although most of the performers involved are from countries that take at least a neutral stance to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",

      "The Intervision lineup featured 23 acts, including China, South Africa, Brazil, the UAE, India, Cuba, Ethiopia and Venezuela. Vassy, representing the United States, was a noticeable outlier.",
      "The selection process for individual acts, however, is difficult to track. In its rules, Intervision says that co-organizers \u2014 the legal entity in charge of nominating acts, organizing broadcasts and promoting the contest in its home country \u2014 can range from national broadcasters to individuals, but there\u2019s no public list to confirm who these co-organizers are.",
      "As a result, some performers outweigh others for cultural clout, despite Intervision\u2019s stipulation that all acts should be a \u201cnational star.\u201d Russia\u2019s entry, the ultra-patriotic Shaman, is one of the country\u2019s most heavily promoted acts. Musicians like Kenya\u2019s Sanaipei and Madagascar\u2019s Denise and D-Lain also have loyal followings back home.",
      "Other artists have a smaller profile. Egypt\u2019s Moustafa Saad is best known as a soloist at the Alexandria Opera House, a relatively niche genre in the country.",
      "Yet if Intervision hopes to build a real legacy, the contest doesn\u2019t need to win over musicians, but fans.",
      "Content creator Henrik Larsson films Eurovision-based reaction videos for his YouTube channel. He\u2019s one of a small group of creators to have posted Intervision-related clips. \u201cIt gave me a perspective of different songs apart from the world, not just Europe. And some of the songs are fantastic.\u201d",
      "But most Eurovision fan communities have ignored Intervision entirely. \u201cLet the dictators and war criminals have their own little party where they can spout their propaganda and call it a contest,\u201d read one comment on a popular Eurovision Reddit forum.",
      "Aside from Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Intervision has also made a public commitment to \u201ctraditional universal and family values\u201d \u2014 an affront to many fans of the LGBTQ+-friendly Eurovision. Information about Vassy's role as an ambassador for the NOH8 Campaign, a nonprofit promoting LGBTQ+ rights and gender equality, disappeared briefly from her Wikipedia page after her participation in the contest was announced. It was later restored.",
      "It\u2019s also unclear just how much interest Intervision will be able to command in Russia. The AP found several advertisements on online casting websites offering a small payment for anyone who would join the Intervision crowd.",
      "Without a fan base or a central organization driving the competition onward, Intervision\u2019s future will depend on political will. That\u2019s risky, says historian Dean Vuletic. Both the Czechoslovak and Polish iterations of Intervision of the 1960s and 1970s ultimately fizzled due to social upheaval and changing political priorities.",
      "As the 2025 show drew to a close, organizers announced that next year's Intervision would be held in Saudi Arabia.",
      "For now, Kremlin enthusiasm is in no short supply for the competition's planned 2026 edition.",
      "\u201cIn Soviet times, the party and government made decisions to promote a positive image of Russia abroad. Today, we must advance an objective portrayal,\u201d Lavrov said. \u201cIndeed, some of our perceived shortcomings provoke envy among many foreign counterparts.\u201d",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- With little chance of NATO membership for Ukraine, the country\u2019s Western allies have bought into an alternate strategy for helping it repel Russian aggression: invest billions in Ukraine's weapons industry so it can better defend itself.",
      "If the strategy works, Ukraine's weapons industry will eventually be able to help equip U.S. and European armies, too, with cutting-edge drones and other military technology being developed in the midst of its war with Russia.",
      "One recent advance in Ukraine\u2019s homegrown arsenal is a quadcopter drone that can evade Russian jamming devices, fly more than 20 kilometers (12 miles) and drop six kilograms (13 pounds) of guided explosives onto tanks and other high-value targets.",
      "\u201cThe Ukrainians are the leaders in the world in terms of drone technology,\u201d Keith Kellogg, the Trump administration's special envoy for Ukraine said last week at a conference in Kyiv. \u201cWe are working with Ukrainians now to make sure we have got this drone technology exchange, which I think is very important.\u201d",
      "Europeans have been taking the threat from Russia more seriously since the second Trump administration began signaling that NATO members shouldn\u2019t be overly reliant on the U.S. to defend them. Anxieties across Europe were heightened last week after Russian drones launched from Belarus were shot down in Polish airspace.",
      "For its part, Ukraine is seeking investment to triple its weapons production, become less reliant on Western partners to fight Russia \u2013 and hopefully deter future conflicts.",
      "Ukraine's weapons industry now meets nearly 60% of its army's needs, up from 10% when Russia's full-scale invasion began 3 1/2 years ago, according to its defense minister. But its military budget \u2014 $64 billion in 2024 \u2014 is less than half the size of Russia's, which is why it turns to Western allies for weapons and, increasingly, money.",
      "In addition to any private investment, and in lieu of NATO membership, security guarantees for Ukraine will likely center on European governments investing in its army \u2014 essentially paying Kyiv to build its own weapons and plugging in production gaps with mutually beneficial joint ventures.",
      "European countries are eager to do this, said Fabien Hinz of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. \u201cUkraine has the advantage of having battle-tested systems, of having quite low production costs and having entities in place capable of producing these systems rapidly.\u201d",
      "For both sides, the war has necessitated fast cycles of innovation as a matter of survival. How quickly a weapon can be developed, shipped to an army unit and improved upon is a matter of life and death.",
      "Like most defense companies in Ukraine, the maker of the R-34 quadcopter drone \u2014 FRDM \u2014 communicates with soldiers at all hours of the day and quickly incorporates feedback. Its founder, Vadym Yunyk, is guided by the motto: Robots should die in the front lines, not people.",
      "That underscores one of Ukraine's disadvantages in this war \u2014 its lack of soldiers, which has been a key driver of innovation for Ukrainian defense companies.",
      "Investments in artificial intelligence and robotics are enabling Ukraine to do what its allies could scarcely have imagined before Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. With help from drones and autonomous vehicles, Ukrainian forces can now strike targets with remote-controlled weapons further afield and more precisely, as well as deliver supplies and evacuate the wounded from the front lines without risking other soldiers' lives.",
      "Ukraine's small first-person view, or FPV, drones, are responsible for nearly 70% of Russian losses in manpower and weaponry within 15 kilometers of the front line, according to Ukrainian officials.",
      "At the other end of the spectrum are its deep strike drones, which can reach over 1,000 kilometers to hit targets deep inside Russian territory.",
      "FRDM's quadcopter lies somewhere in the middle. The latest version of the weapon was modified from an earlier model to fly three times farther and carry more guided bombs.",
      "\u201cWe learned very quickly how to scale any production. If the government places an order to produce 10,000 drones a year instead of 3,000, I will be capable of doing this in a month and a half,\u201d Yunyk said.",

      "KARBALA, Iraq -- Iraq is set to open the country\u2019s first industrial-scale solar plant Sunday in a vast expanse of desert in Karbala province, southwest of Baghdad.",
      "It\u2019s part of a new push by the government to expand renewable energy production in a country that is frequently beset by electricity crises despite being rich in oil and gas.",
      "\u201cThis is the first project of its type in Iraq that has this capacity,\u201d said Safaa Hussein, executive director of the new solar plant in Karbala, standing in front of row after row of black panels. From above, the project looks like a black-clad city surrounded by sand.",
      "The plant aims to \u201csupply the national network with electricity, and reduce the fuel consumption especially during the daytime peak load, in addition to reducing the negative environmental impact of gas emissions,\u201d he said.",
      "The newly opened solar plant in Karbala will eventually be able to produce up to 300 megawatts of electricity at its peak, said Nasser Karim al-Sudani, head of the national team for solar energy projects in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. Another project under construction in Babil province will have a capacity of 225 megawatts, and work will also begin soon on a 1,000 megawatt project in the southern province of Basra, he said.",
      "The projects are part of an ambitious plan to implement large-scale solar power projects in an effort to ease the country\u2019s chronic electricity shortages.",
      "Deputy Minister of Electricity Adel Karim said Iraq has solar projects with a combined capacity of 12,500 megawatts either being implemented, in the approval process, or under negotiation. If fully realized, these projects would supply between 15% and 20% of Iraq\u2019s total electricity demand, excluding the semi-autonomous northern Kurdish region, he said.",
      "\u201cAll the companies we have contracted with, or are still negotiating with, will sell us electricity at very attractive prices, and we will in turn sell it to consumers,\u201d Karim said, although he declined to disclose the purchase rates.",

      "Currently, Iraq produces between 27,000 and 28,000 megawatts of electricity, Karim said, while nationwide consumption ranges from 50,000 to 55,000 megawatts. Power plants fueled by Iranian gas contribute about 8,000 megawatts of the current supply.",
      "Iraq\u2019s heavy reliance on imported Iranian gas, as well as electricity imported directly from Iran to meet its electricity needs, is an arrangement that risks running afoul of U.S. sanctions.",
      "Earlier this year, Washington ended a sanctions waiver for direct electricity purchases from Iran but left the waiver for gas imports in place.",

      "\u201cI feel at peace,\u201d said Amani, who lives on the outskirts of the North Kivu provincial capital of Goma. \u201cI don\u2019t see this leg as plastic, but as a second chance.\u201d",
      "Amani's wife and four children were killed when they came under attack by armed groups in April. Badly wounded and seeking help to start over, he found his way to Shirika la Umoja, an orthopedic center on the front line of eastern Congo's conflict in Goma, which finds itself overwhelmed by surging numbers of casualties.",
      "Congo's mineral-rich east has long been battered by fighting involving more than 100 armed groups including the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels. The rebels made an unprecedented advance in January and seized two key cities including Goma, further deepening one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crises.",
      "Some 7 million people had been displaced in the conflict that was already one of the world's largest humanitarian crises before it escalated this year. While fighting has largely reduced as a result of peace efforts, there are still pockets of clashes and civilians are still being killed.",
      "Shirika la Umoja has long been producing prosthetics for the wounded in Goma, with support from the International Committee of the Red Cross since 2005. But the escalation in fighting has brought increased demand for artificial limbs for amputees.",
      "\u201cEvery week, we receive new patients who lost limbs to stray bullets, landmines, or explosion,\u201d said Gis\u00e8le Kantu, a physical therapist at the center.",
      "Since early 2025, the center has treated more than 800 amputees and other severely injured patients.",
      "The number of prosthetic limbs provided by the clinic has soared from 422 in all of 2024 to 326 in just the first half of 2025. There's no sign of demand easing anytime soon.",
      "The center currently runs with nearly three dozen professionals. Unlike in most other places, the prosthetics are made by hand, each one individually carved, molded and assembled.",
      "For each patient, there is a story of both horror and survival.",
      "Melisa Amuli, 30, survived a bombardment near a checkpoint in the town of Mubambiro in North Kivu province in January.",
      "\u201cI was lying among the dead. I started saying my final prayer,\u201d she recalled, wiping away tears. Hours later, some motorbike riders pulled her from the rubble. Gravely injured, Hamuli was spared amputations but her legs no longer functioned correctly.",
      "Today, with the help of a special orthotic brace supplied by the center, she can stand again. Forced to close her business selling potatoes, she now relies on others for support.

      "WHO WAS CONVICTED: Becciu was convicted of embezzlement for sending 100,000 euros in Vatican money to a charity controlled by his brother, and paying hundreds of thousands of euros in Vatican money to a self-styled security analyst. He was sentenced to 5\u00bd years in prison.",
      "The tribunal convicted eight other defendants of embezzlement, abuse of office, fraud and other charges, but acquitted them of many counts.",
      "All the defendants maintained their innocence and appealed.",
      "THE TEXT MESSAGES In the two years since the verdicts were delivered, thousands of pages of WhatsApp text and audio messages exchanged between some of the players have become public, throwing fresh doubt about the credibility of the trial and the Vatican legal system. These private communications, published by Domani newspaper, suggest questionable conduct by Vatican police, prosecutors and the late pope \u2014 and a behind-the-scenes effort to target Becciu.",
      "\u2033If it gets out that we all agreed, it\u2019s the end,\u201d warned one message. \u201cBecause if we all knew, the trial is null and void and it\u2019s a conspiracy.\u201d",
      "Lawyers for Becciu and other defendants seek to enter the chats into evidence; at least one devoted 80 pages of his appeals motion to them. The lawyers say the chats bolster their claims that their clients didn\u2019t get a fair trial in an absolute monarchy where Francis intervened repeatedly in the investigation. They say the chats prove the investigation that led to the trial, willed by Francis as a sign of his commitment to financial reform, was contaminated from the start.",
      "WHAT IT COULD CHANGE: Even if the chats are admitted, it\u2019s unclear what effect they might have on the appeals, since the original verdicts were based on other evidence. Vatican officials have dismissed their relevance, saying the tribunal didn\u2019t rely on the testimony of any of the people involved.",
      "But the chats have already spawned follow-on criminal complaints in Vatican and Italian courts, and will likely be used by the defense in further appeals and legal wrangling. Once the Vatican verdicts become definitive, Italian, British and other courts will be asked to implement them, including with possible prison sentences or financial damages seized from frozen bank accounts. Those foreign courts may weigh whether the Vatican trial was fair, and some defense lawyers say they are prepared to take their claims that it wasn\u2019t to the European Court of Human Rights.",
      "The Holy See insists the trial was fair and the defense was given every opportunity to present its side.",
      "THE PROSECUTORS\u2019 APPEALS While Becciu and eight others were convicted of some financial crimes, the tribunal largely threw out prosecutors\u2019 overarching theory of a grand plot to defraud the Holy See. Prosecutor Alessandro Diddi, who will also prosecute the appeals case, has doubled down on his original thesis and asked the court to reconsider all but a few of its acquittals.",
      "In a text message to The Associated Press, Diddi declined to comment on the chats.",
      "CARDINAL ANGELO BECCIU The once-powerful cardinal had been considered a papal contender in a future conclave. Francis fired him in 2020, before he was charged, after becoming convinced he was involved in financial misconduct stemming from his time as the No. 3 in the secretariat of state.",
      "MONSIGNOR ALBERTO PERLASCA Perlasca was Becciu\u2019s deputy and headed the Vatican administrative office that handled the London investment. Because of that role, Perlasca was initially a prime suspect. But after his first round of questioning in April 2020, Perlasca fired his lawyer, changed his story and began cooperating with prosecutors.",
      "Perlasca escaped indictment and was eventually listed as an injured party, entitling him to damages. Only during the trial did it emerge that Perlasca had been persuaded to change his story to turn on Becciu.",

      "FRANCESCA CHAOUQUI Perhaps none of the trial\u2019s surreal twists was as jaw-dropping as when Chaouqui, a controversial figure from the Vatican\u2019s past, emerged as having had the starring role in persuading Perlasca to change his testimony.",
      "Chaouqui, a public relations specialist, is known for her role in the \u201cVatileaks\u201d scandal of 2015-2016, when she was convicted by the same tribunal of conspiring to leak confidential Vatican documents to journalists and received a 10-month suspended sentence.",
      "When Perlasca was being questioned on the stand, it emerged that Chaouqui had engaged in an elaborate plot with a Perlasca family friend to persuade him to turn on Becciu.",
      "Chaouqui declined the AP\u2019s request for comment.",
      "KEY BACKGROUND: Chaouqui openly nurtured a grudge against Becciu because she blamed him for her Vatileaks prosecution. She saw the London investigation as a chance to expose what she said were Becciu\u2019s lies and crimes, but she needed Perlasca to turn on Becciu to accomplish it.",
      "GENEVIEVE CIFERRI Ciferri is the family friend desperate to help Perlasca avoid prosecution. The 3,225 pages of WhatsApp messages are the four years of correspondence, from 2020-2024, between her and Chaouqui. According to the chats, the two devised a plan in which Chaouqui posed as a retired magistrate and passed legal advice onto Perlasca via Ciferri. Ciferri turned over some of the messages to Vatican prosecutors after she grew suspicious of Chaouqui, whom she believed had lied about her close relations to the investigators and Francis.",
      "In a statement to AP, Ciferri said the chats were of no importance to the appeals trial itself, since the convictions didn\u2019t hinge on Perlasca\u2019s testimony. She said the chats were instead a \u201ccollateral\u201d affair that was being investigated separately.",
      "\u201cContinuing to exaggerate the importance of the chat messages makes no sense and is only a useless pretext, while the appeal will be based on the actual crimes and the individual responsibilities of each person for each count,\u201d Ciferri wrote.",
      "The Vatican hasn\u2019t disputed the authenticity of the audio or commented on its contents.",
      "POPE FRANCIS The trial revealed that Francis had intervened in the investigation by penning four secret decrees that greatly benefited prosecutors. The decrees, signed in 2019 and 2020, gave prosecutors wide-ranging powers to investigate, including via unchecked wiretapping and deviating from existing laws.",
      "Defense lawyers said such secret intervention in a criminal investigation by an absolute monarch with supreme legislative, executive and judicial power confirmed that there was no separation of powers in the Vatican and that the defendants couldn\u2019t get a fair trial.",
      "The tribunal dismissed the significance of the decrees. The prosecutor defended them for providingunspecified guarantees.",
      "FRANCIS\u2019 MESSAGES: But then came the WhatsApp messages, which showed Francis had an even greater role. There are references to prosecutors speaking with Francis about the investigation, claims by Chaouqui that she was working for him and detailed descriptions of interactions between Francis and Perlasca, who lived in the same Vatican hotel.",
      "Francis even lent Perlasca money after his Vatican bank accounts were frozen, the correspondence shows.",
      "The messages include photographs of correspondence between Francis and Perlasca, including one in which Perlasca asks the pope for forgiveness and for help getting a new job in the Vatican diplomatic service once he had decided to cooperate with prosecutors. In another, the pope encouraged him on the eve of his second round of questioning, when he turned definitively on Becciu.",
      "\u201cDear brother,\u201d Francis wrote Perlasca Aug. 19, 2020, a few days before the questioning. \u201cThanks so much for your letter of yesterday. I am close to you and I pray for you. Please do the same for me. You can count on me.\u201d",
      "Perlasca is now a prosecutor in another Vatican court.",

      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has signed a bill extending the state's cap-and-trade program through 2045",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday extended a signature state program aimed at reducing planet-warming emissions through 2045, a move Democrats cheered but Republicans warned would raise gas prices.",
      "The program known as cap and trade sets a declining limit on total greenhouse gas emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their pollution. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.",
      "It was set to expire after 2030. The law Newsom signed Friday at the Morrison Planetarium in San Francisco potentially boosts carbon-removal projects and requires the program to align with California's target of achieving so-called carbon neutrality by 2045. That means the state will remove as many carbon emissions as it releases. The law changes the name to \u201ccap and invest\u201d to emphasize that the money goes toward other programs.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doubling down on our best tool to combat Trump\u2019s assaults on clean air \u2014 Cap-and-Invest \u2014 by making polluters pay for projects that support our most impacted communities,\u201d Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement.",
      "Newsom also signed a law committing $1 billion in program revenue for the state\u2019s long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.",
      "He approved other measures aimed at advancing the state\u2019s energy transition and lowering costs for Californians. They include laws to speed up permitting for oil production in Kern County, refill a fund that covers the cost of wildfire damage when utility equipment sparks a blaze and allow the state\u2019s grid operator to partner with a regional group to manage power markets in western states.",
      "Newsom also signed a bill that would increase requirements for air monitoring in areas overburdened by pollution and codify a bureau within the Justice Department created in 2018 to protect communities from environmental injustices.",
      "California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country.

      "Environmental justice advocates said the cap-and-trade extension doesn't go far enough to address air pollution affecting low-income Californians and communities of color more likely to live near major polluters. The program's \u201ccap\u201d applies to planet-warming emissions, not other pollutants impacting air quality. Cap and trade doesn't set emissions limits for individual facilities, meaning an industrial polluter could continue to emit the same amount of greenhouse gases over time so long as it has the right amount of credits or offsets.",

Others taking the stage at the University of Minnesota's football stadium will include Dave Matthews,Margo Price,Kenny Chesney,Wynonna Judd, and Nathaniel Rateliff.",
      "This year\u2019s concert comes at a worrying time for American farmers. Farm profitability has been falling. Crop prices are low while production costs are rising. And the Trump administration\u2019s trade wars have added to the insecurity. China has not bought any of the 2025 U.S. soybean crop so far and has turned to America's competitors, such as Brazil, to meet its needs.",
      "A labor dispute nearly derailed the festival this year. Organizers said they would not cross the picket lines of striking teamster service workers at the university, saying \u201cthe farm and labor movements are inseparable.\u201d Nelson got on the phone with Gov. Tim Walz. The university and union reached a deal late last week.",
      "\u201cThe Governor knows how important this event is to farmers and farm country,\u201d Walz spokesperson Claire Lancaster said. \u201cHe worked with all parties involved, including Willie Nelson, to find a solution.\u201d",
      "Farm Aid is thrilled that the show will go on.",
      "\u201cFor four decades, Farm Aid has stood with farmers and workers,\u201d organizers said in a statement that called the agreement \u201ca reminder of what can be achieved when people come together in the spirit of fairness and solidarity.\u201d",
      "CNN will carry five hours of programming from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. CDT, featuring live performances by Nelson, Young, Mellencamp, Dylan, Matthews and Price. CNN will also stream it live on CNN.com, and on its apps without requiring a cable login. Sirius XM will carry it on satellite radio starting at noon CDT. Beginning at 11:30 a.m. CDT, it will also stream on the nugs live music platform and YouTube channel, and at FarmAid.org and on Farm Aid's YouTube channel.",
      "This will be the ninth Farm Aid for Rateliff, whose music combines rock, soul, country, gospel, folk and Americana. He said he joined because he has long felt a connection to farming and the land.",
      "\u201cI grew up in rural Missouri, and grew up with agriculture around me, and we didn\u2019t have much money as a family,\u201d Rateliff recalled in an interview. \u201cSo we had a huge one-acre garden, and my mom canned a lot of stuff, and my dad and I would hunt squirrel and rabbit and deer and whatever else we could eat.\u201d",

      "\u201cFarm Aid was kind of the first rallying point for farmers publicly,\u201d Fahy recalled. \u201cIt was the first time that farmers would reach out and call a number.\u201d",
      "That hotline \u2014 1-800-FARM-AID (1-800-327-6243) \u2014 was one of their first initiatives. Operators mostly come from agricultural backgrounds. Fahy said they can help with immediate needs, then connect farmers with other resources, such as financial and business counseling, legal advice or mental health support, or help them navigate federal farm programs.",

      "Rateliff said he keeps coming back to Farm Aid because not enough has changed. People are still fighting against the concentration of agriculture among bigger and bigger producers, he said. But he said music bridges political differences. He said his own fans include people who voted for Bernie Sanders, a self-named democratic socialist, and for President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cWhat music has the ability to do is bring people together \u2014 to create commonality in a shared human experience \u2014 so that we all can examine ourselves together and see how alike we are,\u201d Rateliff said.",

The flight's purpose was to provide Myers video training over a simulated news scene, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.",
      "Jillian Myers initially sued the companies and a maintenance facility in March 2023 for the death of her 41-year-old husband, with whom they had four children. The maintenance facility was later removed as a defendant.",
      "A National Transportation Safety Board report last year determined the probable cause of the crash was inadequate inspections, resulting in an eventual loosening of hardware and subsequent loss of helicopter control. A post-crash examination of the flight controls showed hardware that should have been connected to a part on the main rotor was disconnected and the connecting hardware was missing, the final NTSB report says.",
      "Thursday's order from Bridges said the plaintiffs' experts confirmed and expanded upon the NTSB finding that the crash was \u201cwas due to operational and maintenance errors committed by\" the remaining defendants.",
      "The judgment entered for Jillian Myers was actually $126.3 million against the defendants \u2014 a $105 million total agreed upon by attorneys on both sides of the case and that Bridges found was a fair and reasonable settlement valuation \u2014 along with accrued interest.",
      "But by agreement the defendants' primary insurers will pay $50 million. Jillian Myers now will be able to seek the rest of the amount against the companies' excess or umbrella insurance carriers, her attorney Gary C. Robb said on Friday.

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to talk with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Friday in a push to finalize a deal to allow the popular social media app TikTok to keep operating in the United States.",
      "The call also may offer clues about whether the two leaders might meet in person to hash out a final agreement to end their trade war and provide clarity on where relations between the world's two superpowers may be headed.",
      "It would be the second call with Xi since Trump returned to the White House and launched sky-high tariffs on China, triggering back-and-forth trade restrictions that strained ties between the two largest economies. But Trump has expressed willingness to negotiate trade deals with Beijing, notably for the social video platform that faces a U.S. ban unless its Chinese parent company sells its controlling stake.",
      "The two men also spoke in June to defuse tensions over China\u2019s restrictions on the export of rare earth elements, used in everything from smartphones to fighter jets.",

      "He said his relationship with China is \u201cvery good\u201d but noted that Russia's war in Ukraine could end if European countries put higher tariffs on China. Trump didn\u2019t say if he planned to raise tariffs on Beijing over its purchase of Moscow's oil, as he has done with India.",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington on Thursday didn\u2019t confirm the call or any upcoming summit between the leaders, but spokesperson Liu Pengyu said \u201cheads-of-state diplomacy plays an irreplaceable role in providing strategic guidance for China-U.S. relations.\u201d",

      "The Federal Reserve just cut its benchmark rate for the first time since last year, but that doesn't guarantee mortgage rates will keep dropping",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Hoping that mortgage rates will keep dropping following the Federal Reserve's first rate cut since last year? Don't bank on it.",
      "As expected, the central bank delivered a quarter-point cut Wednesday and projected it would lower its benchmark rate twice more this year, reflecting growing concern over the U.S. job market.",
      "Here's a look at factors that determine mortgage rates and what the Fed's latest move means for the housing market:",
      "Mortgage rates have been mostly falling since late July on expectations of a Fed rate cut. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage was at 6.35% last week, its lowest level in nearly a year, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac.",
      "A similar pullback in mortgage rates happened around this time last year in the weeks leading up to the Fed\u2019s first rate cut in more than four years. Back then, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage got down to a 2-year low of 6.08% one week after the central bank cut rates.",
      "But it hasn't come close to that since.",
      "Mortgage rates didn't keep falling last year, even as the Fed cut its main rate two more times. Instead, mortgage rates rose and kept climbing until the average rate on a 30-year home loan reached just over 7% by mid-January.",
      "Like last year, the Fed's rate cut doesn't necessarily mean mortgage rates will keep declining, even as the central bank signals more cuts ahead.",
      "\u201cRates could come down further, as the Fed has signaled the potential for two more rate cuts this year,\u201d said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS. \u201cHowever, there are still risks of a reversal in mortgage rates. Inflation heated up in August and if the September inflation report shows another bump in consumer prices, it\u2019s possible we could see rates rise.\u201d",
      "No. Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Fed's interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation.",
      "Mortgage rates generally follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "That's because mortgages are typically bundled into mortgage-backed securities that are sold to investors. To keep mortgage-backed securities attractive to investors, their yield \u2014 or annual return -- is adjusted to be competitive with the yield offered by the U.S. on its 10-year government bonds. When those bond yields rise, they tend to push up mortgage rates, and vice-versa.",
      "The 10-year Treasury yield has been mostly easing since mid-July as growing signs that the job market has been weakening fueled expectations of a Fed rate cut this month.",
      "Until now, the Fed had kept its main interest rate on hold this year because it was more worried about inflation potentially worsening due to the Trump administration's tariffs than about the job market.",
      "At the same time, inflation has so far refused to go back below the Fed\u2019s 2% target.",
      "When the Fed cuts rates that can give the job market and overall economy a boost, but it can also fuel inflation. That, in turn, could push up mortgage rates.",

      "\u201cIt's not just about what the Fed is doing today, it\u2019s about what they\u2019re expected to do in the future, and that\u2019s determined by things like economic growth, what\u2019s going to happen in the labor market and what do we think inflation is going to be like over the next year or so,\u201d said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\u201cIf the Fed keeps lowering rates, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean mortgages will go down,\u201d said Stephen Kates, financial analyst at Bankrate. \u201cIt means that they probably could go down more, and they may trend in that direction, even if they don\u2019t move in lockstep.\u201d",
      "Ahead of the Fed's rate cut, the futures market had priced in expectations that the central bank would cut its key interest rate at upcoming policy meetings this year and into 2026. But the Fed's latest projections show a less aggressive path of rate cuts than the market has been expecting.",
      "\u201cThis ongoing gap between market and Fed expectations means that some risk of upward pressure on mortgage rates remains,\u201d said Hale, adding that the decline in mortgage rates \u201cis likely to continue at least through this week.\"",
      "Hale recently forecast that the average rate on a 30-year mortgage will be between 6.3% and 6.4% by the end of this year. That's in line with recent projections by other economists who also don't expect the average rate to drop below 6% this year.",
      "The late-summer pullback in mortgage rates has been a welcome trend for the housing market, which has been in a slump since 2022, when mortgage rates began climbing from historic lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years and have remained sluggish so far this year.",
      "While lower rates give home shoppers more purchasing power, mortgage rates remain too high for many Americans to afford to buy a home. That\u2019s mostly because home prices, while rising more slowly than in years past, are still up by roughly 50% nationally since the start of this decade.",
      "\u201cWhile lower rates will bring some buyers and sellers into the market, today\u2019s cut will not be enough to break up the housing market logjam,\u201d said Sturtevant. \"We will need to see further drops in mortgage rates and much slower home price growth, or even home price declines, to make a dent in affordability.\u201d",
      "If mortgage rates continue to ease, home shoppers will benefit from more affordable financing. But lower mortgage rates could also bring in more buyers, making the market more competitive at a time when sellers across the country are having a tougher time driving a hard bargain.",
      "Predicting when mortgage rates will decline and by how much is daunting because so many variables can influence their trajectory from one week to the next.",
      "Home shoppers who can afford to buy at current rates may be better off buying now if they find a property that fits their needs, rather than attempt to time the market, said Kates.",
      "Many homeowners looking to refinance have already seized on the decline in rates, sending applications for refinance loans sharply higher in recent weeks.",
      "One rule of thumb to consider when refinancing is whether you can reduce your current rate by at least one percentage point, which helps blunt the impact of refinancing fees.",

      "PHILADELPHIA -- Bernie Parent, the Hall of Famer considered one of the great goalies of all time who anchored the net for the Philadelphia Flyers' only two Stanley Cup championships during their Broad Street Bullies heyday, has died. He was 80.",
      "The Flyers made the announcement Sunday but provided no immediate details. Parent died overnight in his sleep, said Joe Watson, a star defenseman on their Stanley Cup teams.",
      "Parent's steel-eyed stare through his old-school hockey mask landed him on the cover of Time magazine in 1975 when the Flyers reigned as one of the marquee teams in sports. He won Stanley Cup, Conn Smythe and Vezina trophies in back-to-back seasons when the Flyers won the Stanley Cup in 1974 and 1975, the first NHL expansion team to win the championship.",
      "After he made his NHL debut with Boston in 1965, Parent was left unprotected by the Bruins in the 1967 expansion draft and was selected by the Flyers. After 3 1/2 seasons, he was traded to Toronto but ended up back in Philadelphia ahead of the 1973-74 season. He won a league-high 47 games that season and led the NHL in wins again the next season with 44.",
      "He retired with the Flyers in 1979 after 271 wins \u2014 231 of them with the Flyers \u2014 over a 13-year career. Parent was accidentally struck in the right eye with a stick in 1979 and was temporarily blinded. He never played again.",
      "The Flyers beat the Bruins in six games to win the Stanley Cup in 1974 and beat Buffalo in 1975.",
      "On the flight home from Buffalo, the Flyers plopped the Stanley Cup in the middle of the aisle. For close to 90 minutes, the Flyers couldn\u2019t take their eyes off the ultimate prize.",

More than 2 million fans packed city streets for each of their championship parades.",

      "Parent was one of the more beloved Flyers and remained connected with the team over the years as an ambassador.",
      "The final career highlight came in 2011 when Parent was in the net for an alumni game outdoors at the baseball stadium Citizens Bank Park ahead of the NHL Classic. \u201cBernie! Bernie! Bernie!\u201d echoed throughout the park for the affable goalie, who played 5 minutes, 32 seconds and stopped all six shots. Each save made the \u201cBernie!\u201d chants return.",

      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Fiji scored five tries in a 20-minute spell on either side of halftime, then held on to beat Japan 33-27 Saturday in the final of the Pacific Nations Cup.",
      "Japan started and finished strongly, scoring first and adding the last 17 points of the match. But in between Fiji produced a series of spectacular tries to build a 33-10 lead which only just survived Japan's late comeback.",
      "Two of those tries went to winger Joji Nasova, who scored just before and just after halftime while lock Mesake Vocevoce scored one try and helped to create another. Captain Tevita Ikanivere also scored in the period between the 23rd and 43rd minutes when Fiji took the game away from Japan.",
      "Fiji was hard-pressed to hold on in the second half against a resurgent Japan team which scored tries through hooker Heyate Era \u2014 his second of the match \u2014 and fullback Ichigo Nakakuso to close the margin to six points.",
      "Japan had Fiji under enormous pressure when it was reduced to 13 men in the second half with backrower Viliame Mata and prop Eroni Mawa in the sin-bin.",
      "\u201cWe overcame a tough Japan team who came back in the second half because of the pace they brought and the ill-discipline we had,\u201d Ikanivere said. \u201cWe saw the 13 boys who were on the field, the 14 boys just working hard for each other.",
      "\u201cWe talked all five weeks of this competition about plowing the field and coming to harvest today.\u201d",
      "All of Japan's tries were spectacular but perhaps the best of all was finished by center Inia Tabuavou in the 35th minute. It began inside the Fiji 22 with a deft behind-the-back pass to scrumhalf Simione Kuruvoli who broke out and was joined by Vocevoce.",
      "Fiji took the ball almost the length of the field and then from one side of the field to the other before Tabuavou scored.",
      "\u201cWe're a bit disappointed,\" Japan captain Warner Dearns said. \u201cWe probably let them get away from us a little bit in the first half and we couldn't bring it back in the second.\"",
      "Fiji won the Pacific Nations Cup for the second year in a row and for the sixth time overall. The final was played in the United States for the first time, at America First Field near Salt Lake City.",

      "COLUMBIA, Mo. -- Ahmad Hardy bounced his way for 138 yards rushing and a touchdown, Beau Pribula led No. 23 Missouri downfield for a go-ahead score in the fourth quarter and the Tigers beat South Carolina 29-20 on Saturday night.",
      "Pribula threw for 171 yards with a touchdown pass, and Jamal Roberts had a nifty touchdown jaunt of his own with 9:32 left to give the Tigers (4-0, 1-0 SEC) the lead, ultimately helping them to their 14th consecutive home win.",
      "\u201cThat was a heck of a battle,\u201d Missouri coach Eli Drinkwitz said. \u201cYou could tell they were ticked off about last week's performance and came in and fought. Really proud of our team for not really flinching. ... We just kept hammering away.\u201d",
      "LaNorris Sellers had 302 yards passing and two touchdowns for the Gamecocks (2-2, 0-2), but their star quarterback missed a couple of open receivers in the fourth quarter when the game was on the line. South Carolina twice went three-and-out down the stretch, giving the powerful Missouri ground game the chance to close out the win.",
      "The Tigers finished with 285 yards rushing. South Carolina had minus-9 on the ground.",
      "\u201cWhen you're in the red zone like we were and go backwards, it's going to be hard to win,\u201d South Carolina coach Shane Beamer said. \u201cWhen you have opportunities to make plays and we don't get it done, it's going to be hard to win. And having said all that, we had the lead going into the fourth quarter and couldn't finish.\u201d",
      "Missouri rolled into the game amid a perfect start that included a win over rival Kansas, while the Gamecocks limped into town following a lopsided loss to Vanderbilt in which Sellers missed the second half after a hard blow to the head.",
      "There were questions about whether he would play early in the week. By game time, Sellers was off the injury report entirely.",
      "South Carolina needed his magic. The Tigers struck first with a 99-yard drive \u2014 their third full-field march of the season \u2014 before Sellers answered with a 49-yard touchdown throw to Vandrevius Jacobs to give the Gamecocks a 7-6 lead.",
      "Sellers hit Brian Rowe Jr. with his second touchdown throw later in the half, and South Carolina led 14-12 at the break.",
      "Hardy carried the Tigers in the second half, bouncing off defenders like a pinball. The highlight may have been his TD run, when it looked as if he was stood up at the line of scrimmage, spun off the pile and scored to give Missouri an 18-16 lead.",
      "\u201cI didn't even know I was off the ground until I started spinning and my legs started kicking,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cI just kept running.\u201d",

And after Hardy had checked out for a breather, Roberts did his best impersonation of him, bouncing off tackles on a 16-yard sprint to the pylon for a touchdown; Pribula added the 2-point conversion to give Missouri a 26-20 lead with 9:36 to go.",
      "Then it was the Tigers defense that stepped up, forcing South Carolina into a pair of three-and-outs before Robert Meyer kicked a clinching 40-yard field goal with 1:34 left on the clock.",

      "BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- Fernando Mendoza threw five touchdown passes and D'Angelo Ponds scooped up the punt he blocked and returned it 11 yards for a score Saturday night, leading No. 19 Indiana past No. 9 Illinois 63-10 for its first win over a top 10 foe in five years \u2014 and easily the most lopsided.",
      "Indiana's previous best was a 31-10 victory at then No. 9 Ohio State in 1987. It marked the first time since 1950 the Hoosiers and Fighting Illini squared off with each ranked.",
      "Ponds' blocked punt return opened the scoring, and Mendoza went 21 of 23 with 267 yards to become the first Hoosiers player with multiple games of five or more TD passes in three quarters. He also completed his final 17 passes as Indiana (4-0, 1-0 Big Ten) extended its school record home winning streak to 12, all coming under second-year coach Curt Cignetti.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll get people's attention with this one,\u201d Cignetti said. \u201cThe team really laid it on the line tonight. There\u2019s nothing better than being the Grinch in the second half with a big lead. I love that feeling.\u201d",
      "Elijah Sarratt caught nine passes for 92 yards and two scores while Omar Cooper Jr. had six receptions for 78 yards and one TD. Khobe Martin rushed for 107 yards and two TDs and Kaelon Black added 89 yards rushing and one TD.",
      "The Fighting Illini offense struggled as quarterback Luke Altmeyer was under pressure all night. Illinois (3-1, 0-1) allowed five sacks and rushed for only 3 yards in the first half, falling into an insurmountable 35-10 deficit. Indiana sealed the win with TD drives on each of its first two second-half possessions.",
      "It was the worst loss of coach Bret Bielema's tenure at Illinois and the worst for the Illini since a 63-0 rout at home against Iowa in 2018.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t respond to any adversity. It started with the blocked punt and never really got anything on offense or defense,\" Bielema said. \u201cEmbarrassing and at a loss for words.\u201d",
      "Altmeyer was 14 of 22 with 146 yards and one interception while being sacked seven times. Receiver Hank Beatty was limited to two catches for 13 yards and Illinois' only meaningful scores came on a 59-yard TD pass from Altmeyer to Collin Dixon in the first quarter and a 46-yard field goal to close the half.",
      "Illinois: Bielema didn't like his team's first half performance last week and this one was far worse. Aside from taking advantage of a rare, early coverage bust, Illinois couldn't sustain anything offensively. Expect a big slide in this week's Associated Press Top 25.",
      "Indiana: Those who questioned the Hoosiers after beating Old Dominion, Kennesaw State and Indiana State to start the season got their answer Saturday. The Hoosiers dominated this matchup in every possible way, and last year's biggest surprise team should start climbing in the rankings this week.",

      "Here's a rundown of what the treaty is, why it matters and what is still to come.",
      "Formally known as the Agreement on Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction, the treaty is the first legally binding agreement aimed at protecting marine biodiversity in international waters. These areas, which lie beyond the jurisdiction of any single country, account for nearly two-thirds of the ocean and nearly half of Earth\u2019s surface.",
      "Until now, no comprehensive legal framework existed to create marine protected areas or enforce conservation on the high seas.",
      "Despite their remoteness, the high seas are under growing pressure from overfishing, climate change and the threat of deep-sea mining. Environmental advocates warn that without proper protections, marine ecosystems in international waters face irreversible harm.",
      "\u201cUntil now, it has been the wild west on the high seas,\u201d said Megan Randles, global political lead for oceans at Greenpeace. \u201cNow we have a chance to properly put protections in place.\u201d",
      "The treaty is also essential to achieving what's known as the global \u201c30x30\u201d target \u2014 an international pledge to protect 30% of the planet\u2019s land and sea by 2030.",
      "The treaty creates a legal process for countries to establish marine protected areas in the high seas, including rules for potentially destructive activities like deep-sea mining and geoengineering. It also establishes a framework for technology-sharing, funding mechanisms and scientific collaboration among countries.",
      "Crucially, decisions under the treaty will be made multilaterally through what\u2019s called a conference of the parties rather than by individual countries acting alone.",

      "The first conference of the parties must be held within a year of the treaty taking effect. It will lay the groundwork for implementation, including decisions on governance, financing and the creation of key bodies to evaluate marine protection proposals.",
      "Environmental groups are pushing for even more countries to ratify the treaty and to do so quickly \u2014 the more countries that ratify, the stronger and more representative the treaty\u2019s implementation will be. There\u2019s a carrot for countries to do so. Only those that ratify by that first conference will be eligible to vote on critical decisions that determine how the treaty will operate.",

      "Robin is a therapeutic robot programed to act like a 7-year-old girl as it travels around nursing homes and hospitals\u2019 pediatric units providing emotional support while helping to combat staffing shortages",
      "Days after Meagan Brazil-Sheehan\u2019s 6-year-old son was diagnosed with leukemia, they were walking down the halls of UMass Memorial Children\u2019s Medical Center when they ran into Robin the Robot.",
      "\u201cLuca, how are you?\u201d it asked in a high-pitched voice programmed to sound like a 7-year-old girl. \"It\u2019s been awhile.\u201d",
      "Brazil-Sheehan said they had only met the 4-foot-tall (1.2-meter-tall) robot with a large screen displaying cartoonlike features once before after they were admitted several days earlier.",
      "\u201cHis face lit up,\" she said about the interaction in June in Worcester, Massachusetts. \"It was so special because she remembered him.\u201d",
      "Robin is an artificial intelligence -powered therapeutic robot programed to act like a little girl as it provides emotional support at nursing homes and hospital pediatric units while helping combat staffing shortages. Five years after launching in the U.S., it has become a familiar face in 30 health care facilities in California, Massachusetts, New York and Indiana.",
      "\u201cNurses and medical staff are really overworked, under a lot of pressure, and unfortunately, a lot of times they don\u2019t have capacity to provide engagement and connection to patients,\u201d said Karen Khachikyan, CEO of Expper Technologies, which developed the robot. \u201cRobin helps to alleviate that part from them.\u201d",
      "As AI increasingly becomes a part of daily life, it's found a foothold in medical care \u2014 providing everything from note-taking during exams to electronic nurses. While heralded by some for the efficiency it brings, others worry about its impact on patient care.",
      "Robin is about 30% autonomous, while a team of operators working remotely controls the rest under the watchful eyes of clinical staff. Khachikyan said that with each interaction, they\u2019re able to collect more data \u2014 while still complying with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA \u2014 and get closer to it being able to function independently.",
      "\u201cImagine a pure emotional intelligence like WALL-E. We\u2019re trying to create that,\u201d he said, referencing the 2008 animated film.",
      "On a recent Friday, a staff member at HealthBridge Children\u2019s Hospital in Orange County, California, read off a list of patients she needed Robin to visit, along with the amount of time to spend with each one.",
      "The robot with a sleek white triangle-shaped frame that Khachikyan said was designed for hugging, rolled into a room with a teenager injured in a car accident. The robot played what it described as his favorite song \u2014 \u201cNo Fear\u201d by DeJ Loaf \u2014 and he danced along. In the hallway, Robin cracked up a young child held by her mother when it put on a series of silly glasses and a big red nose. In another room, the robot played a simplified version of tic-tac-toe with a patient.",
      "Samantha da Silva, speech language pathologist at the hospital, said patients light up when Robin comes into their room and not only remembers their names but their favorite music.",
      "\u201cShe brings joy to everyone,\u201d da Silva said. \u201cShe walks down the halls, everyone loves to chat with her, say hello.\u201d",
      "Robin mirrors the emotions of the person it is talking with, explained Khachikyan. If the patient is laughing then the robot laughs along, but if they're sharing something difficult, its face reflects sadness and empathy.",
      "In nursing homes, Robin plays memory games with people suffering from dementia, takes them through breathing exercises on difficult days and offers them a form of companionship that resembles a grandchild with a grandparent.",
      "Khachikyan recalled a moment last year at a facility in Los Angeles where a woman was having a panic attack and asked specifically for the robot. Robin played songs by her favorite musician and videos of her favorite animal \u2014 Elvis Presley and puppies \u2014 until she had calmed down.",

      "But with the Association of American Medical Colleges projecting that the U.S. will face a shortage of up to 86,000 physicians in the next 11 years, Khachikyan\u2019s vision for Robin goes far beyond this type of support.",
      "He said they\u2019re working to make the robot able to measure patients\u2019 vitals and check to see how they\u2019re doing and then send that information to their medical team. Longer term plans include designing Robin to help elderly patients change their clothes and go to the bathroom.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to design the next evolution of Robin; that Robin will take more and more responsibilities and become even more essential part of care delivery,\u201d Khachikyan said.",
      "He clarified that it\u2019s not about replacing health care workers but about filling in the gaps in the workforce.",
      "At UMass, the robot is very much a part of a team of support for patients. When Luca needed an IV after not getting one in a while, Micaela Cotas, a certified child life specialist came in with the robot and showed him an IV and what was about to happen, and then Robin played a cartoon of it getting an IV put in.",
      "\u201cIt just kind of helps show that Robin has gone through those procedures as well, just like a peer,\" Cotas said.",
      "Robin was developed by Khachikyan while he was getting his Ph.D. He said growing up in a single-parent household in Armenia had been lonely, so years later he wanted to build a type of robot that could act as a person\u2019s friend.",
      "Developers tested it in a variety of industries before an investor suggested that pediatric hospitals would be a good fit because of the stress and loneliness children often feel.",
      "\u201cThat was kind of an aha moment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe decided, OK let\u2019s try it.\u201d",
      "They had success introducing it at a pediatric hospital in Armenia and by 2020 launched a pilot program at UCLA Mattel Children\u2019s Hospital.",
      "Since Robin was created, its personality and character have changed significantly based on the responses from people it interacts with.",
      "Khachikyan gave the example of Robin\u2019s answer to the question: \u201cWhat is your favorite animal.\u201d Initially they tried having the robot respond with dog. They also tried cat. But when they tried chicken, the children cracked up. So they stuck with it.",
      "\u201cWe created Robin\u2019s personality by really taking users into the equation,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we often say that Robin was designed by users.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to talk with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Friday in a push to finalize a deal to allow the popular social media app TikTok to keep operating in the United States.",
      "The call also may offer clues about whether the two leaders might meet in person to hash out a final agreement to end their trade war and provide clarity on where relations between the world's two superpowers may be headed.",
      "It would be the second call with Xi since Trump returned to the White House and launched sky-high tariffs on China, triggering back-and-forth trade restrictions that strained ties between the two largest economies. But Trump has expressed willingness to negotiate trade deals with Beijing, notably for the social video platform that faces a U.S. ban unless its Chinese parent company sells its controlling stake.",
      "The two men also spoke in June to defuse tensions over China\u2019s restrictions on the export of rare earth elements, used in everything from smartphones to fighter jets.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m speaking with President Xi, as you know, on Friday, having to do with TikTok and also trade,\u201d Trump said Thursday. \u201cAnd we\u2019re very close to deals on all of it.\u201d",
      "He said his relationship with China is \u201cvery good\u201d but noted that Russia's war in Ukraine could end if European countries put higher tariffs on China. Trump didn\u2019t say if he planned to raise tariffs on Beijing over its purchase of Moscow's oil, as he has done with India.",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington on Thursday didn\u2019t confirm the call or any upcoming summit between the leaders, but spokesperson Liu Pengyu said \u201cheads-of-state diplomacy plays an irreplaceable role in providing strategic guidance for China-U.S. relations.\u201d",
      "Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Washington-based think tank Stimson Center, predicted a positive discussion.",
      "\u201cBoth sides have strong desire for the leadership summit to happen, while the details lie in the trade deal and what can be achieved for both sides from the summit,\u201d Sun said.",
      "Following a U.S.-China trade meeting earlier this week in Madrid, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the sides reached a framework deal on TikTok's ownership but Trump and Xi likely would finalize it Friday.",
      "Trump, who has credited the app with helping him win another term, has extended a deadline several times for the app to be spun off from its Chinese parent company ByteDance. It is a requirement to allow TikTok to keep operating in the U.S. under a law passed last year seeking to address data privacy and national security concerns.",
      "Trump said TikTok \u201chas tremendous value\u201d and the U.S. \u201chas that value in its hand because we\u2019re the ones that have to approve it.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials have been concerned about ByteDance\u2019s roots and ownership, pointing to laws in China that require Chinese companies to hand over data requested by the government. Another concern is the proprietary algorithm that populates what users see on TikTok.",

      "No deals have been announced on tech export restrictions, Chinese purchases of U.S. agricultural products or fentanyl. The Trump administration has imposed additional 20% tariffs on Chinese goods linked to allegations that Beijing has failed to stem the flow to the U.S. of the chemicals used to make opioids.",

      "Chilling videos of Kirk's Sept. 10 assassination immediately overwhelmed sites like X, TikTok and YouTube, and companies are still working to contain their spread.

      "TikTok users in the U.S. may get a reprieve from the threat of a shutdown after the Trump administration announced it has reached a framework deal with China for the ownership of the popular social video platform.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a press conference after the latest round of trade talks between the world\u2019s top two economies concluded in Madrid that U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping would speak Friday to possibly finalize the deal. He said the objective of the deal would be to switch to American ownership.",
      "He did not disclose the terms of the deal, saying that it is between two private parties, but added that \"the commercial terms have been agreed upon.\u201d",
      "Little is known about the actual deal in the works, including what companies are involved and whether the United States would have a stake in TikTok. Li Chenggang, China\u2019s international trade representative, said the two sides have reached \u201cbasic framework consensus\u201d to properly solve TikTok-related issues in a cooperative way, reduce investment barriers and promote related economic and trade cooperation, according to China\u2019s official news agency Xinhua.",
      "Oracle Corp. has been floated as a likely buyer for the platform. Representatives for the company did not immediately respond to a message for comment on Monday.",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the team was \u201cvery focused on TikTok and making sure that it was a deal that is fair for the Chinese,\u201d but also \u201ccompletely respects U.S. national security concerns.\u201d",
      "Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China\u2019s Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, told reporters in Madrid there was consensus on authorization of \u201cthe use of intellectual property rights such as (TikTok\u2019s) algorithm\u201d \u2014 a main sticking point in the deal.",
      "The sides also agreed on entrusting a partner with handling U.S. user data and content security, he said.",
      "Though he has no clear legal basis to do so, Trump has continued to extend the deadline for TikTok to avoid a ban in the U.S. This gives his administration more time to broker a deal to bring the social media platform under American ownership. The next deadline is on Sept. 17, and Trump has already signaled he would extend it if needed.",
      "It is not clear how many times Trump can keep extending the ban as the government continues to try to negotiate a deal for TikTok, which is owned by China\u2019s ByteDance. While there is no clear legal basis for the extensions, so far, there have been no legal challenges against the administration. Trump has amassed more than 15 million followers on TikTok since he joined last year, and he has credited the trendsetting platform with helping him gain traction among young voters. He said in January that he has a \u201cwarm spot for TikTok.\u201d",
      "For now, TikTok continues to function for its 170 million users in the U.S. Tech giants Apple, Google and Oracle were persuaded to continue to offer and support the app, on the promise that Trump\u2019s Justice Department would not use the law to seek potentially steep fines against them.",

      "A recent Pew Research Center survey found that about one-third of Americans said they supported a TikTok ban, down from 50% in March 2023. Roughly one-third said they would oppose a ban, and a similar percentage said they weren\u2019t sure.",
      "Among those who said they supported banning the social media platform, about 8 in 10 cited concerns over users\u2019 data security being at risk as a major factor in their decision, according to the report.",
      "During his first term as president, Trump led the effort to ban TikTok, saying it posed a threat to U.S. national security. But his tune changed when he returned to the White House a second time, signing an executive order on his first day in office to keep the app running.",
      "During Joe Biden\u2019s Democratic presidency, Congress and the White House used national security grounds to approve a U.S. ban on TikTok unless its Chinese parent company sold its controlling stake.",

      "The suit was filed in May by the Marubo Tribe of the Javari Valley, a sovereign community of about 2,000 people in the Amazon rainforest.",
      "Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Tiana J. Murillo on Tuesday sided with the Times, whose lawyers argued in a hearing Monday that its coverage last year was fair and protected by free speech.",
      "TMZ argued that its coverage, which followed the Times\u2019 initial reporting, addressed ongoing public controversies and matters of public interest.",
      "The suit claimed stories by TMZ and Yahoo amplified and sensationalized the Times\u2019 reporting and smeared the tribe in the process. Yahoo was dismissed as a defendant earlier this month.",
      "Murillo wrote in her ruling that though some may \u201creasonably perceive\u201d the Times\u2019 and TMZ\u2019s reporting as \u201cinsensitive, disparaging or reflecting a lack of respect, the Court need not, and does not, determine which of these characterizations is most apt.\u201d",
      "The judge added that \u201cregardless of tone, TMZ\u2019s segment contributed to existing debate over the effects of internet connectivity on remote Indigenous communities.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are pleased by the comprehensive and careful analysis undertaken by the court in dismissing this frivolous lawsuit,\" Danielle Rhoades Ha, a spokesperson for the Times, said in a statement Wednesday to The Associated Press. \"Our reporter traveled to the Amazon and provided a nuanced account of tension that arose when modern technology came to an isolated community.\u201d",

      "Nicas reported that in less than a year of Starlink access, the tribe was dealing with the same struggles the rest of the world has dealt with for years due to the pervasive effects of the internet. The challenges ranged from \u201cteenagers glued to phones; group chats full of gossip; addictive social networks; online strangers; violent video games; scams; misinformation; and minors watching pornography,\" Nicas wrote.",
      "He also wrote that a tribal leader said young men were sharing explicit videos in group chats. The piece doesn't mention porn elsewhere, but other outlets amplified that aspect of the story.

There was no hint of this in the forest, and there was no suggestion of it in The New York Times\u2019s article.\u201d",
      "Nicas wrote that he spent a week with the Marubo tribe. The lawsuit claimed that while he was invited for a week, he spent less than 48 hours in the village, \u201cbarely enough time to observe, understand, or respectfully engage with the community.\"",

      "\u201cWe take blood and tissue samples to assess mercury,\u00a8 Trujillo told The Associated Press from the Colombian riverside town of Puerto Narino. \u201cBasically, we\u2019re using dolphins as sentinels for the river\u2019s health.\u201d",
      "Mercury contamination comes mainly from illegal gold mining \u2014 a growing industry across the Amazon Basin \u2014 and forest clearing that washes mercury that naturally occurs in soil into waterways.",
      "The miners use mercury to separate gold from sediment, then dump the sludge back into rivers, where it enters fish eaten by people and dolphins. Rising global gold prices have fueled a mining boom, and mercury pollution in remote waterways has increased.",
      "Mercury can damage the brain, kidneys, lungs and immune system and cause mood swings, memory loss and muscle weakness in people, according to the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Pregnant women and young children are most at risk, with prenatal exposure linked to developmental delays and reduced cognitive function.",
      "\u201cThe maximum any living being should have is 1 milligram per kilogram,\u201d Trujillo said. \u201cHere, we\u2019re seeing 20 to 30 times that amount.\u201d",
      "In previous years, his team found 16 to 18 milligrams per kilogram of mercury in dolphins, which can suffer the same neurological damage, organ damage and other problems as humans. In Colombia\u2019s Orinoco River, levels in some dolphins have reached as high as 42, levels scientists say are among the most extreme ever recorded in the species.",
      "Trujillo said it's difficult to prove the toxin is directly killing dolphins. Further studies are underway, he added, noting that \u201cany mammal with a huge amount of mercury will die.\u201d",
      "When Trujillo and his team tested their own blood three years ago, his results showed more than 36 times the safe limit \u2014 36.4 milligrams per kilogram \u2014 a level he attributes to decades working in mercury-affected areas and a diet heavy in fish. With medical assistance, his levels have dropped to about 7 milligrams.",
      "\u201cMercury is an invisible enemy until it builds up to a sufficient amount, then it starts to affect the central nervous system,\u201d Trujillo told AP after his team managed to capture and test four pink dolphins. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing evidence of it in Indigenous communities.\u201d",
      "A series of scientific studies and reports \u2014 including work by the International Pollutants Elimination Network and academic researchers \u2014 have found high mercury exposure among Indigenous peoples across the Amazon, including in Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Suriname and Bolivia. Hair samples showed averages well above WHO's safe threshold of 1 part per million, with one Colombian community registering more than 22 milligrams per kilogram.",

The International Union for Conservation of Nature listed the pink dolphin as endangered in 2018. Trujillo said exact numbers for the Amazon are unknown, but his organization estimates 30,000 to 45,000 across the basin.",

It banned mercury use in mining in 2018, ratified the Minamata Convention aimed at reducing mercury in the environment and submitted an action plan in 2024.

Brazil has launched raids and moved to restrict satellite internet used by illegal gold-mining camps that use mercury, aiming to disrupt logistics and supply lines. Peru recently seized a record 4 tons of smuggled mercury. Ecuador, Suriname and Guyana have filed action plans to cut mercury use in small-scale gold mining.",
      "The dolphin testing operation relies on Jos\u00e9 \u201cMariano\u201d Rangel, a charismatic former fisherman from Venezuela. He leads the charge when it\u2019s time to haul the animals \u2014 which can weigh as much as 160 kilograms (about 353 pounds) \u2014 into the small boats. It's a moment that can end with a stinging blow to the jaw as the dolphins thrash to break free.",
      "\u201cThe most difficult part of the captures is enclosing the dolphins,\u201d Rangel said.",
      "A portable ultrasound machine scans lungs, heart and other vital organs for disease. The team checks for respiratory problems, internal injuries and signs of reproduction, photograph the animals' skin and scars, swab blowholes and genital openings for bacterial cultures, and collect tissue for mercury testing. Microchips are implanted so researchers can identify each animal and avoid duplicating tests.",

They test some samples, prepare others to send to larger facilities and end their day repairing nets and refilling kits to do it all again at dawn.",
      "For Trujillo, each capture, scan and blood test is part of a larger fight.",

      "LONDON -- A cyberattack targeting check-in and boarding systems disrupted air traffic and caused delays at several of Europe\u2019s major airports on Saturday.",
      "While the impact on travelers appeared to be limited, experts said the intrusion exposed vulnerabilities in security systems.",
      "The disruptions to electronic systems initially reported at Brussels, Berlin's Brandenburg and London's Heathrow airports meant that only manual check-in and boarding was possible. Many other European airports said their operations were unaffected.",
      "\u201cThere was a cyberattack on Friday night 19 September against the service provider for the check-in and boarding systems affecting several European airports including Brussels Airport,\u201d said Brussels Airport in a statement, initially reporting a \u201clarge impact\u201d on flight schedules.",
      "Airports said the issue centered around a provider of check-in and boarding systems \u2014 not airlines or the airports themselves.",
      "Collins Aerospace, whose systems help passengers check themselves in, print boarding passes and bag tags and dispatch their luggage from a kiosk, cited a \u201ccyber-related disruption\u201d to its MUSE (Multi-User System Environment) software at \u201cselect airports.\u201d",
      "It was not immediately clear who might be behind the cyberattack, but experts said it could turn out to be hackers, criminal organizations, or state actors.",
      "Travel analyst Paul Charles said he was \u201csurprised and shocked\u201d by the attack that has affected one of the world's top aviation and defense companies.",
      "He said \"it's deeply worrying that a company of that stature who normally have such resilient systems in place have been affected.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a very clever cyberattack indeed because it\u2019s affected a number of airlines and airports at the same time \u2014 not just one airport or one airline, but they\u2019ve got into the core system that enables airlines to effectively check in many of their passengers at different desks at different airports around Europe,\u201d he told Sky News.",
      "As the day wore on, the fallout appeared to be contained.",
      "Brussels Airport spokesperson Ihsane Chioua Lekhli told broadcaster VTM that by mid-morning, nine flights had been canceled, four were redirected to another airport and 15 faced delays of an hour or more. She said it wasn\u2019t immediately clear how long the disruptions might last.",
      "Axel Schmidt, head of communications at the Brandenburg airport, said that by late morning, \u201cwe don\u2019t have any flights canceled due to this specific reason, but that could change.\u201d The Berlin airport said operators had cut off connections to affected systems.",
      "Heathrow, Europe\u2019s busiest airport, said the disruption has been \u201cminimal\u201d with no flight cancellations directly linked to the problems afflicting Collins. A spokesperson would not provide details as to how many flights have been delayed as a result of the cyberattack.",

      "\u201cThis was a great miscarriage of justice at the state level, and it shows the system has broken down and doesn\u2019t protect citizens,\u201d Evans said. \u201cIn a community like this, the federal government is the only avenue for anything to get done.\u201d",
      "Brown\u2019s beating was just the latest in a litany of police misconduct cases in DeSoto Parish, a rural swath of piney woods and rolling farmlands south of Shreveport, Louisiana.",
      "A month before Brown was pummeled, another deputy was charged with malfeasance after tackling and repeatedly punching a man walking into a grocery store. He agreed to a permanent ban from law enforcement in exchange for the charges being dismissed. In another case, a DeSoto Parish deputy was charged with third-degree rape after ordering a woman he arrested to perform oral sex on him.",
      "Russell Graham, a state police spokesperson, declined to explain his agency\u2019s conclusion that there \u201cwas not sufficient evidence\u201d the deputies in Brown's case committed a crime. He attributed delays in the investigation to the COVID-19 pandemic, which began six months after the beating.",
      "\u201cLSP remains committed to thorough, impartial investigations and working with partners to ensure accountability and uphold public trust,\u201d Graham wrote in an email to AP, adding the agency had \u201cconducted a thorough investigation of this matter when it was presented to them.\u201d",
      "Former deputy Javarrea Pouncy pleaded guilty to using excessive force and was sentenced last year to serve about three years in federal prison. He could not be reached for comment.",
      "The other deputy, DeMarkes Grant, who pleaded guilty to obstructing justice, was released from prison in April after serving a 10-month sentence. Grant told AP he was still \u201cstressed out\u201d and had \u201clost a lot\u201d as a result of his conviction. He declined to say whether he regretted the beating.",
      "\u201cWhat has happened has happened,\u201d he said.",
      "Use of force experts questioned the divergent outcomes at the state and federal level, saying Brown never posed a threat and the beating was excessive.",
      "The grainy footage shows a handcuffed Brown calmly walking into the jail\u2019s laundry room before disrobing. The beating begins halfway through the search, after the deputies confront Brown for not squatting as directed so they could fully search him.",

      "A Missouri judge has struck down ballot summary for an anti-abortion amendment backed by Republican state lawmakers",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- A Missouri judge has struck down a ballot summary for an anti-abortion amendment backed by Republican state lawmakers while concluding that it presented an unfair and insufficient description to voters.",
      "Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green ruled Friday that the ballot summary must be rewritten, but he rejected a request by abortion-rights advocates to block the proposed constitutional amendment from going to voters.",
      "The judge said the summary prepared by Republican lawmakers failed to inform voters that the new measure would repeal an abortion-rights amendment adopted by voters last year. He directed the secretary of state's office to write a new summary.",
      "The ruling marks the latest in a series of twists and turns in Missouri\u2019s abortion policies over the past three years.",
      "When the U.S. Supreme Court ended a nationwide right to abortion by overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022, that triggered a Missouri law to take effect banning abortions \u201cexcept in cases of medical emergency.\u201d But abortion-rights activists then gathered initiative petition signatures to put their own measure on the ballot.",
      "Last November, Missouri voters narrowly approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing a right to abortion until fetal viability, generally considered sometime past 21 weeks of pregnancy. That measure, known as Amendment 3, also allows later abortions to protect the life or health of pregnant women and creates a \u201cfundamental right to reproductive freedom\u201d that includes birth control, prenatal and postpartum care and \u201crespectful birthing conditions.\u201d",
      "In May, the Republican-led Legislature shut down Democratic opposition and approved a new referendum that would repeal Amendment 3 and instead allow abortions only for a medical emergency or fetal anomaly, or in cases of rape or incest up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. That proposed amendment also would prohibit gender transition surgeries, hormone treatments and puberty blockers for minors, which already are barred under state law.",
      "Abortion-rights advocates had argued in a lawsuit that the entire measure should be stricken, alleging that the combination of abortion and transgender policies violated a constitutional requirement that amendments contain only one subject. But Green agreed with Republican lawmakers that both topics fit under the measure's title of \u201creproductive health care.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Friday signed a proclamation that will require a $100,000 annual visa fee for highly-skilled foreign workers and rolled out a $1 million \u201cgold card\u201d visa as a pathway to U.S. citizenship for wealthy individuals, moves that face near-certain legal challenges amid widespread criticism he is sidestepping Congress.",
      "If the moves survive legal muster, they will deliver staggering price increases. The visa fee for skilled workers would jump from $215. The fee for investor visas, which are common in many European countries, would climb from $10,000-$20,000 a year.",
      "H-1B visas, which require at least a bachelor's degree, are meant for high-skilled jobs that tech companies find difficult to fill. Critics say the program is a pipeline for overseas workers who are often willing to work for as little as $60,000 annually, well below the $100,000-plus salaries typically paid to U.S. technology workers.",
      "Trump on Friday insisted that the tech industry would not oppose the move. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said \u201call big companies\u201d are on board.",
      "Representatives for the biggest tech companies, including Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta, did not immediately respond to messages for comment on Friday. Microsoft declined to comment.",
      "Lutnick said the change will likely result in far fewer H-1B visas than the 85,000 annual cap allows because \u201cit\u2019s just not economic anymore.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to train people, you\u2019re going to train Americans.\u201d Lutnick said on a conference call with reporters. \"If you have a very sophisticated engineer and you want to bring them in ... then you can pay $100,000 a year for your H-1B visa.\u201d",
      "Trump also announced he will start selling a \u201cgold card\u201d visa with a path to U.S. citizenship for $1 million after vetting. For companies, it will cost $2 million to sponsor an employee.",
      "The \u201cTrump Platinum Card\u201d will be available for a $5 million and allow foreigners to spend up to 270 days in the U.S. without being subject to U.S. taxes on non-U.S. income. Trump announced a $5 million gold card in February to replace an existing investor visa \u2014 this is now the platinum card.",
      "Lutnick said the gold and platinum cards would replace employment-based visas that offer paths to citizenship, including for professors, scientists, artists and athletes.",
      "Critics of H-1Bs visas who say they are used to replace American workers applauded the move. U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group, called it \u201cthe next best thing\u201d to abolishing the visas altogether.",

      "Critics say H-1B spots often go to entry-level jobs, rather than senior positions with unique skill requirements. And while the program isn\u2019t supposed to undercut U.S. wages or displace U.S. workers, critics say companies can pay less by classifying jobs at the lowest skill levels, even if the specific workers hired have more experience.",
      "As a result, many U.S. companies find it cheaper to contract out help desks, programming and other basic tasks to consulting companies such as Wipro, Infosys, HCL Technologies and Tata in India and IBM and Cognizant in the U.S. These consulting companies hire foreign workers, often from India, and contract them out to U.S. employers looking to save money.",

      "Major technology companies that use H-1B visas sought changes after massive increases in bids left their employees and prospective hires with slimmer chances of winning the random lottery. Facing what it acknowledged was likely fraud and abuse, USCIS this year said each employee had only one shot at the lottery, whether the person had one job offer or 50.",
      "Critics welcomed the change but said more needs to be done. The AFL-CIO wrote last year that while changes to the lottery \u201cincluded some steps in the right direction,\u201d it fell short of needed reforms.

      "Oregon authorities say DNA has helped identify a woman's remains after 49 years",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- Valerie Nagle spent decades wondering what happened to her older sister who was last seen in Oregon in 1974. She searched online databases of unidentified persons cases looking for her and sent DNA to a popular ancestry website in the hopes of finding a match.",
      "That all changed in June when authorities in Oregon called Nagle \u201cout of the blue\u201d to ask about comparing her DNA to a cold case known as \u201cSwamp Mountain Jane Doe,\u201d she said. Nagle\u2019s DNA ultimately helped confirm that the remains of a woman found near a mountain creek in Oregon\u2019s Central Cascades in 1976 were that of her sister, Marion Vinetta Nagle McWhorter.",
      "Oregon State Police publicly released the news this week after the remains were identified in June.",
      "\u201cI was very surprised that they called,\u201d Nagle, a 62-year-old who lives in Seattle, told The Associated Press. She was 11 when her sister went missing. \u201cI was really glad that they found me through DNA.\u201d",
      "McWhorter was last seen at a shopping mall in the Portland suburb of Tigard when she was 21.",
      "She was the oldest of five siblings, and Nagle was the youngest. Their mother was Alaska Native of the Ahtna Athabascan people, Nagle said, and her big sister had been named for an aunt who died in a boarding school for Indigenous children in Alaska in 1940.",
      "High rates of disappearances of Indigenous people, particularly women, have festered for generations amid inadequate public safety resources.",
      "Nagle, who lived in New York with her parents and one of her brothers at the time of her sister's disappearance, said her mother may have contacted authorities but that she wasn\u2019t sure of the exact extent of the efforts made by her parents to find her sister.",

      "Nearly 20 years later, the aunt shared another detail with Nagle: When McWhorter called her that day, she told her that a man in a white pickup truck had offered to give her a ride. It was unclear why her aunt waited that long to share that information.",

      "The detectives \u2014 Mark Baker, Cody Becker and Isaiah Emenheiser \u2014 were lauded by local law enforcement officials as pillars of the Northern York County Regional Police Department, where they had served nearly six decades combined.",
      "They had saved lives before and, a prosecutor said, were doing that again when they walked into an ambush as they searched for a 24-year-old man wanted in a stalking case.",
      "The department's chief, Dave Lash, said the men \u201crepresented the best of policing. They served with professionalism, dedication and courage.\u201d",
      "All were fathers, leaving behind wives and eight kids combined.",
      "Becker, 39, had served with the department for 16 years and had been a big name in his home town of Spring Grove going back to high school, when he was a star athlete for the Rockets in football, baseball and wrestling.",
      "\u201cTo know Cody was to know a man of unmatched dedication, grit, and unwavering selflessness,\u201d his former wrestling coaches said in a statement on social media.",
      "His high school football legend includes intercepting a pass from Chad Henne \u2014 who went on to quarterback in the NFL \u2014 and returning it for a touchdown.",
      "But he was most accomplished in wrestling.",
      "Becker went on to wrestle at Millersville University, even qualifying for the NCAA's Division 1 wrestling tournament in 2007. He returned to Spring Grove to mentor wrestlers there, an example of what the coaches say was unmatched humility and selflessness, \u201calways putting others before himself \u2014 traits that carried through every aspect of his life.\u201d",
      "Soon after joining the police force, Becker was honored for rescuing a mother and three children who were trapped on the third floor of a burning apartment building. The rescue included Becker climbing onto a second-story roof and catching the children as the mother dropped them into his arms, according to an FBI commendation bulletin.",
      "Becker loved being a cop, said Andy Ziegler, a lawyer who grew up with Cody.",
      "\u201cHe loved being able to help people. I mean, that was the big thing for him is he knew he was making a difference and he knew that he was helping people,\u201d Ziegler said.",
      "Becker was also the nicest person you were ever going to meet, he said. Ziegler recalled that when Becker heard Ziegler was struggling with his family and his mental health, Becker immediately went to see Ziegler.",
      "\u201cAnd that really does exemplify Cody. If you were a friend of Cody\u2019s, Cody had your back for life,\u201d Ziegler said.",

      "The Trump administration is trying to persuade a federal judge that Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's attempt to shut down part of an aging pipeline interferes with U.S. foreign policy",
      "The Trump administration is stepping into the legal fight over whether Enbridge can continue to operate an aging pipeline beneath a Great Lakes channel, arguing that Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer interfered with U.S. foreign policy when she revoked the line's easement almost five years ago.",
      "The pipeline, known as Line 5, has moved crude oil between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, since 1953. A 4.5-mile (6.4-kilometer) segment of the line runs under the Straits of Mackinac, a channel that links Lake Michigan and Lake Huron.",
      "Concerns about the line rupturing and causing a catastrophic spill in the environmentally sensitive area have been growing since 2017, when Enbridge revealed its engineers had known about gaps in its protective coating since 2014. A boat anchor damaged the segment a year later, further stoking fears of a spill.",
      "Whitmer, a Democrat and possible 2028 presidential contender, ordered her regulators in November 2020 to revoke the easement allowing the segment to operate beneath the straits. Enbridge filed a federal lawsuit that same year seeking to invalidate the order. The pipeline has continued to operate as the litigation drags on.",
      "The Trump administration isn't a party in the case. But U.S. Justice Department attorneys filed a brief on Sept. 12 arguing that Whitmer's order amounted to an attempt to \u201cglobalize\u201d Michigan's regulatory authority and clash with the federal government's goal of maintaining the flow of energy between the U.S. and Canada.",
      "They also contend that the revocation clashes with executive orders President Donald Trump issued this year declaring that an abundant, reliable energy supply is key to protecting national security.",
      "\u201cShutting down Line 5 could disrupt the energy supply chain, increase domestic prices, and enhance the economic and political power and leverage of malign foreign actors worldwide,\u201d the attorneys wrote. \u201cSuch outcomes conflict with our nation's foreign policy goals.\u201d",
      "They argue, too, that only the federal government can regulate pipeline safety and allowing states to enter that arena would lead to a untenable patchwork of regulations. A 1977 treaty between the U.S. and Canada prohibits authorities from impeding the flow of energy through pipelines running between the two counties, they add.",
      "Whitmer's attorneys say the state has authority to revoke the easement under the public trust doctrine, the legal principle that natural resources belong to the public and the state therefore has a duty to protect them.",
      "Danny Wimmer, a spokesperson for Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, who is defending the revocation, said in an email Friday that Nessel plans to file a response in October. He pointed to earlier filings in which she argues that revoking the easement doesn't impose or continue any safety regulations and is actually a pipeline routing decision within the state's authority. The filings also contend that private parties such as Enbridge can't bring a federal lawsuit to enforce the treaty with Canada.",
      "The Trump administration's arguments largely mirror those of Enbridge. Asked for comment on the administration's filing, company spokesperson Michael Barnes in an email Friday pointed again to treaty provisions that he said prevent states and judges from unilaterally shutting down the pipeline.",

She has stepped lightly around Trump, convincing him to meet with her three times since January. In April, Trump called her a \u201cvery good person.\"",
      "Enbridge has proposed encasing the straits segment in a protective concrete tunnel, at an estimated cost of at least $500 million. Construction would destroy wetlands and bat habitat but the tunnel would eliminate the chance of another anchor rupturing the line, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.",
      "Michigan regulators approved permits for the tunnel in December 2023. Enbridge needs only Army Corps' approval before construction can begin. The Corps fast-tracked the permit in April after the Trump administration identified the tunnel for expedited emergency permitting.",
      "Environmental groups and Native American tribes have sued the Michigan Public Service Commission, arguing the panel didn't consider the overall need for the pipeline when weighing whether to grant the tunnel permits. The Michigan Supreme Court announced Friday that it would hear the case.",
      "Nessel filed her own lawsuit seeking to void the straits easement in 2019. The U.S. Supreme Court is weighing whether the case belongs in federal or state court.",
      "The pipeline is at the center of a yet another legal dispute, this time in Wisconsin. A federal judge in Madison last summer gave Enbridge three years to shut down part of Line 5 that runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior\u2019s reservation. The company has proposed rerouting the pipeline around the reservation and has appealed the shutdown order to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "On a separate legal track, environmental groups and the Bad River Band have asked a judge to void state permits for the reroute. Hearings in that matter are scheduled to stretch into October.",

      "OREM, Utah -- It took two decades for Utah Valley University to evolve from a small community college into the state's largest school, boasting of having one of the safest campuses in the nation.",
      "It took only seconds for that image to be shattered by the assassination of right wing activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "The sprawling campus of nearly 50,000 students beneath the Wasatch Mountains will be forever tethered to the events of Sept. 10, when a bullet took down the founder of Turning Point USA as he spoke to a large crowd at an outdoor amphitheater in the middle of campus.",
      "The university \u2014 largely unknown outside Utah until now \u2014 was fixed in an unwanted national spotlight during the search for Kirk\u2019s killer. Students and faculty returned to classes this week still reeling with grief, fear and anxiety, and confronting a thorny question: How do they deal with UVU's sudden infamy?",
      "\u201cThis has put the university on the map and given it more attention than it\u2019s ever received,\u201d said branding expert Timothy Calkins, a professor at Northwestern University. \u201cThey certainly didn\u2019t want this situation. But they have to find some way to come back.\u201d",

      "Kyle Reyes, one of Utah Valley University\u2019s vice presidents, said he hopes the school can be a model of healing and embracing difficult dialogue.",
      "\u201cWe know that the eyes are on us and we\u2019re not going to shy away from demonstrating our resilience collectively on this,\u201d Reyes said.",
      "The school has had only minimal violence for years, according to data collected by the U.S. Department of Education. UVU's most recent report for its main campus in Orem, covering 2021-2023, showed police investigated or received reports on four aggravated assault allegations, 13 rape allegations, one apparent arson and no cases of murder or manslaughter. Kirk's killing was the first murder on campus that administrators are aware of, University spokeswoman Ellen Treanor said.",
      "University officials cite this data to support the claim that it is \u201cone of the safest colleges in the country.\u201d",
      "UVU also touts its strong connections to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, as home to the world\u2019s largest education institute for young Mormons. Its mascot is the wolverine. \u201cJust like wolverines, UVU students are determined, ambitious, and fearless,\u201d the university\u2019s website says.",
      "Student Marjorie Holt, 18, who is studying elementary education at UVU, was late to the Kirk rally and arrived minutes before he was shot. She ran with others to shelter inside a nearby building in the immediate aftermath.",
      "In the days since, Holt took time off from work and went home to spend a night with her family in Salt Lake City. She said she feels like the university failed Kirk and his family by not providing better security. She worries about going to classes in a building near the crime scene.",
      "Yet as Kirk's shooting deepens the nation's political divides, Holt believes the shared trauma has brought UVU closer together.",
      "\u201cWe're all people who, you know, loved him or hated him,\u201d she said of Kirk. \u201cWe're all still coming together no matter how we believed, and I feel like this has made our school closer than ever.\u201d",
      "When students returned Wednesday, they reported classes were quieter than usual. Matthew Caldwell, 24, said that in history class, \u201cit felt as if the professor was more understanding of all beliefs and that ultimately it\u2019s about sharing those beliefs.\u201d",

The change was dropped in 2000, said Karen Cunningham, a professor in Kent State's School of Peace and Conflict Studies that was established in response to the 1970 shootings.",

      "Delphine Cherry knows as well as anyone how intractable violent crime is in Chicago. In 1992, her teenage daughter was gunned down in one of the city's toniest neighborhoods \u2014 a bystander caught up in a gang shootout. Twenty years later in a suburb just south of the city, it claimed her son.",
      "\u201cYou don't think it's going to happen twice in your life,\u201d she said.",
      "Chicago has been bracing for weeks for President Donald Trump's promised deployment of National Guard troops to the nation's third-largest city. Although Trump said the troops would help fight crime in a city he described as a \u201chellhole,\u201d his administration has been tightlipped about the operation's details, including when it would start, how long it would last, how many troops would be used and what role they would play in civilian law enforcement.",
      "Trump has also veered back and forth on sending troops to Chicago \u2014 at times insisting he would act unilaterally to deploy them and at other points suggesting he would rather send them to New Orleans or some other city in a state where their governor \u201cwants us to come in.\u201d Most recently, he said this week that Chicago is \u201cprobably next\u201d after National Guard troops are sent to Memphis.",
      "Although Chicago has had one of the highest rates of gun violence of any major American city for some time, city and state leaders overwhelmingly oppose the planned operation, calling it political theater. And even those most directly affected, including people who have lost loved ones to violent crime, wonder how sending in troops would have any lasting effect on the fight against it.",
      "With plans for the Chicago deployment unknown, the ways National Guard troops have been used in Los Angeles and Washington this summer might offer clues.",
      "In June, Trump deployed thousands of Guard troops to Los Angeles amid protests over his administration's immigration crackdown there. Although the troops initially were assigned to guard federal property, they also provided protection for immigration agents during raids and took part in a show of force at a park in a heavily immigrant neighborhood of LA that local officials believe was meant to sow fear.",
      "In August, Trump announced he was placing Washington\u2019s police force under his control and mobilizing federal forces to reduce crime and homelessness there. The troops who were deployed have patrolled around Metro stations and in the most tourist-heavy parts of the nation's capital. But they have also been spotted picking up trash and raking leaves in city parks.",
      "The White House reported that more than 2,100 arrests had been made in Washington in the first few weeks after Trump announced he was mobilizing federal forces. And Mayor Muriel Bowser credited the federal deployment with a drop in crime, including an 87% decline in carjackings, but also criticized the frequent immigration arrests by masked ICE agents. However, an unusually high rate of cases being dropped has some, including at least one judge, wondering whether prosecutors are making charging decisions before cases are properly investigated and vetted.",
      "Washington is unique in that it is a federal district subject to laws giving Trump power to take over the local police force for up to 30 days. The decision to use troops to try to fight crime in other Democratic-controlled cities would represent an important escalation.",
      "Although the Trump administration hasn't said what the troops would be doing and what parts of Chicago they would operate in, they have explicitly promised a surge of federal agents targeting immigration enforcement. The city's so-called sanctuary policies are among the country's strongest and bar local police from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement.",
      "Chicago isn\u2019t the only Democratic-led city in Trump\u2019s sights \u2014 he\u2019s also mentioned Baltimore as a likely target.

Chicago about to find out why it\u2019s called the Department of WAR.\u201d",

    "published": "Sun, 21 Sep 2025 10:44:59 -0400",
    "summary": "The action movie star, who tapped into some childhood trauma to play mixed martial arts fighter Mark Kerr in his new film, reveals that he told costar Emily Blunt and director Benny Safdie he was scared to take on the dramatic role.",
    "story": [
      "This picturesque farm in rural Virginia is Dwayne Johnson's very private sanctuary, with a well-stocked pond that he usually fishes alone. \"Just me,\" he said, \"and I'll bring the girls here, and it's magical. Just the way the property is set up, I never have to see anybody. And I know it sounds crazy, and maybe kind of weird, but that's fun for me.\"",
      "I asked, \"What does that do for you?\"",
      "\"Peace,\" he replied.",
      "Peace has been hard to come by lately. Last month, Johnson made his first trip to the Venice Film Festival, for what is probably the most ambitious film of his career, \"The Smashing Machine.\" He plays the real-life mixed martial arts fighter Mark Kerr, a two-time world champion who fought drug addiction and depression.",
      "Johnson endured three hours of makeup and prosthetics a day to look like Kerr, and he's never played anyone quite so real before. But it's something he says he's been aching to do.",
      "\"For years, I've been dreaming and hoping,\" he said. \"My desire was to play not only a dramatic role, but something that I felt like I could really sink my teeth into, and rip myself open. You hear that term. I just didn't want to do drama. I wanted to do something that really allowed me to do that.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"The Smashing Machine\" click on the player below:",
      "I asked, \"This is a big, raw role. Did you have any doubts that you could do it?\"",
      "\"When it became real, yes,\" he said.",
      "Director Benny Safdie paired Johnson with Emily Blunt as Mark Kerr's volatile wife, Dawn Staples. The two last worked together in Disney's 2021 film \"Jungle Cruise,\" the kind of film on which Johnson built his multi-billion-dollar career.",
      "\"I was chasing something for a lot of years, and what I was chasing was box office,\" he said. \"And there's a part of me, the brain [that goes], 'Don't rock the boat. Stay in this zone. Everyone's happy. You're paying the bills.' But the heart is like, 'Yeah. But you're not being fulfilled.'\"",
      "\"Did you feel like that, you weren't being fulfilled?\" I asked.",
      "\"One hundred percent,\" Johnson said. \"But I was really nervous. And on day one, I remember Benny coming to me, and Emily as well, [they] said, 'Are you scared?' I went, 'Yes.'\"",
      "\"You flat out said, 'Yes, I'm scared'?\"",
      "\"Absolutely. I am.\"",
      "And Dwayne Johnson doesn't scare easily.",
      "His father was a professional wrestler, and with dad on the road a lot of the time, young Dwayne grew up with his share of trauma. When he was 15, Dwayne and his mom were evicted from their apartment because they couldn't pay the rent.",
      "He moved around a lot, and eventually started wrestling on local TV in Memphis, which he showed us in 2022.",
      "We also saw where he stayed back then: a dilapidated trailer in nearby Mississippi.",
      "The trailer park kid fought his way out of poverty, became the wrestling legend known as \"The Rock,\" and eventually moved into movies, from action (the \"Fast and the Furious\" series) to animation (\"Moana\").",
      "For \"The Smashing Machine,\" he had to find a way to transform into someone whose whole world was coming apart, like the scene where Mark Kerr loses his first fight. To conjure up the feelings of despair on camera, Johnson knew right where to go. \"I went back to what it's like being a 15-year-old kid and coming home and being evicted,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"You said it felt like you were ripping yourself open. What do you think that did for you, Dwayne Johnson, ripping yourself open like that?\"",
      "\"The thing that I was running from, which was ripping myself open, is actually the thing that I needed the most,\" he replied, \"because it made me realize that the thing I love, which is acting and telling these stories, now I see it in a different world.\"",
      "These days, Johnson talks a lot about gratitude. At his property in Virginia, far from the trailer in Mississippi, he said, \"Even more reason to be grateful.\"",
      "One thing he won't talk about: Oscar buzz. \"No, no, I can't, I can't,\" he said. \"The thought that that is even a question? \u00a0\u2026 \u00a0You know, trailer park kid.\"",
      "The married father of three will be starting work on another \"Moana\" film soon, and also another drama. Yes, Dwayne Johnson will always be The Rock, but as any scientist can tell you, rocks can change.",
      "This Rock, for one, seems smaller now. \"Yeah. Svelte!\" he laughed. \"Because I'm preparing for a role.\"",
      "\"So, this really is, this is like a new era for you?\"",
      "\"It's a new, I wouldn't say, chapter. I would say new book. A whole new book. And I love it.\"",

      "In Priscilla Beaulieu Presley's new memoir, \"Softly, as I Leave You: Life After Elvis\" (written with Mary Jane Ross, to be published Sept. 23 by Grand Central), she recounts what she lost when she divorced the King, and how she found herself \u2013 as a single mother, businesswoman and actress.",
      "In the excerpt below, Priscilla writes about the events of August 16, 1977, when Elvis was found dead at Graceland, and the effect upon her and their daughter, Lisa Marie.",

      "On August 16, 1977, I was meeting my sister for lunch on Melrose Avenue. It was a strangely cold and damp day for summer in Los Angeles. As I neared the restaurant, Michelle was flagging me down from the corner across the street. When I came to a stop, she rushed over to the car. She told me that she'd just had a call from Dad. Joe Esposito was phoning all over, trying to get a hold of me. It was something about Elvis being in the hospital. My heart stopped. I knew Joe wouldn't be doing that if it was just another of Elvis's hospital stays. Something must be terribly wrong.",
      "I did a U-turn and raced home, running traffic lights and going far too fast. Cars skidded to a halt to miss me. It's a miracle I didn't get hit. All the way home, I prayed over and over, \"Dear God, please let it be all right.\" Lisa was at Graceland, due to come home later that day, so she was part of whatever was happening.",
      "When I reached home, I could hear the phone ringing as I got out of the car. I prayed it would keep ringing until I reached it. I let myself into the house with shaking hands and grabbed the receiver.",
      "It was Joe. I said, \"What's happened?\" He replied, \"It's Elvis.\"",
      "\"Oh my God.\"",
      "\"Cilla, he's dead. We've lost him.\" His voice broke.",
      "I began screaming, \"No! No, no, no, no, no!\" I started to sob, and I could hear Joe crying on the other end of the line.",
      "\"Joe, where's Lisa?\"",
      "\"She's okay. She's with Grandma.\" I asked Joe to send a plane for me, as quickly as he could, and hung up. The questions I needed answered would have to wait.",
      "A few minutes later, the phone rang again, and when I picked it up, I heard Lisa's voice saying, \"Mommy! Mommy! Something's happened to Daddy! Everybody's crying.\"",
      "I could hear Vernon's voice in the background, sobbing and saying, \"My son! My son!\"",
      "I told Lisa, \"I know, baby,\" and reassured her that Daddy's plane was coming for me soon. I told her to wait with Grandma until I got there. She said she was going outside to play with her friend.",
      "I hung up in a kind of daze. I couldn't absorb what Joe had told me. How could Elvis be dead? I had just talked to him two days before. He'd sounded good.",
      "Joe sent Elvis's private plane, the Lisa Marie, to pick up Michelle and me, my parents, Jerry Schilling, and a handful of other close friends to fly us to Memphis. When we got to Graceland, I found Lisa playing golf carts in the yard with one of her friends. At first, I thought it was an odd reaction, and I worried about what the paparazzi would make of Lisa playing in the wake of her father's death. But then I realized it was a child's way of escaping the reality of the silent house. I hugged her close, then went inside.",
      "I still didn't know what had happened, so Joe told me. Ginger had found Elvis unconscious, face down on the floor of the bathroom, that afternoon. She called downstairs for help, and Joe had raced upstairs. He knew immediately that Elvis had passed, but he didn't want to believe it. My heart plummeted as Joe confirmed that Lisa had seen Elvis's body. Elvis was still face down on the floor when she saw him, his face buried in the shag carpet. Lisa had been afraid he was suffocating. Joe wasn't sure if she'd understood what she was seeing. He'd sent her to see Grandma while the ambulance came. He did chest compressions while they waited for the ambulance. A doctor continued efforts to resuscitate Elvis as they raced to the hospital, but all the efforts were futile. Shortly after arrival, Elvis was pronounced dead. Apparently, it was a heart attack.",
      "Inside Graceland, the atmosphere was eerie. The house seemed hollow and dead. It was as if the energy had been sucked out of it\u2014Elvis's life force. We all walked around like zombies. Vernon was distraught. He felt Elvis's passing very, very deeply. It broke my heart to see such a strong man repeatedly call out his son's name, tears streaming down his face. He was losing his only child. A part of Vernon was lost that day as well. I never again saw the energy he once had. When- ever he'd come into a room and said, \"Hey, son,\" his face would light up with a smile. I never saw that smile again. Grandma struggled to believe that Elvis was gone. After he left us, she always carried a little handkerchief. I'd see her tearing up, and she'd wipe her eyes and whisper, \"My boy.\"",
      "There was no privacy for those of us closest to Elvis, including the family. People and cameras surrounded the property. Mourners waited to be admitted to the house for a public viewing of Elvis's open casket. The funeral was a nationally televised event. The streets near Graceland were thronged with tens of thousands of people. The crowds were so large by the second day that President Jimmy Carter called up the Air National Guard to help local police. It was hot and muggy, and some in the crowd fainted from the heat and from emotion. In the afternoon, thousands of people filed past the open casket that had been set up in the front hall. Lisa stayed with Elvis's body as much as she could. She didn't want to leave him. We sat on the stairs and watched as people walked by. Crowds of strangers in Elvis's home, crying and paying their respects. Some mourners had walked away from their jobs to drive sixteen hours or more to Memphis and line up along Elvis Presley Boulevard, hoping to be admitted to the house. The trip was a financial sacrifice for many of them, for much of the crowd was made up of the everyday people who identified with Elvis as one of their own. He, too, had come from poverty. He had remained loyal to his hometown and his family, and he never got above his upbringing. They felt compelled to pay their respects as they would to a family member. It was overwhelming. There wasn't room yet for our own grief.",
      "His memorial was an international event. While mourners gathered in Memphis, Christ's Church in London held a service in Elvis's honor. Over five hundred people crowded the sanctuary and the lawn outside. At the close of the service, they all sang \"Amazing Grace\" in his honor. Elvis's passing was felt not just in Memphis, but around the world.",
      "The private funeral service was held in the living room and adjoining music room, with the peacock glass framing an archway between the two. Elvis's coffin was moved into the room for the service. Vernon had hired a local preacher who didn't know Elvis and who talked primarily about Elvis's legendary generosity. The Blackwood Brothers, longtime friends and backup singers for Elvis, sang gospel songs. I sat on the couch with Lisa and Vernon, numb with grief. It was all a blur at the time, and it still is.",
      "Lisa and I waited until we could be alone with Elvis to say goodbye. I had bought a silver bracelet engraved with the words, \"I love you, Daddy,\" for Lisa to give him. I helped her put it around his wrist. Then we each kissed him one last time. I'm not sure it hit me until then that he was really gone. The body I had held and caressed so many times was now stiff and empty. It was an eerie, aching feeling.",
      "A line of white Cadillacs formed the funeral procession to the Forest Hill Cemetery. Lisa and I rode with Vernon in the car immediately following the hearse. Elvis was entombed in the Presley family crypt with his mother. Two days later, after two thieves tried to steal the coffin, he was moved to the Meditation Garden at Graceland and kept under security. Gladys was moved to Graceland shortly afterward, to lie beside him. Elvis and I used to sit in that garden in the small hours of the morning, in the peace and the moonlight. I was glad they had brought him home.",
      "Vernon had a bronze plaque made to cover the coffin, with an inscription ending, \"We miss you, Son and Daddy.\"",
      "I returned home to LA with Lisa, feeling that a large part of me had died with Elvis. I couldn't accept that he had passed. I'd felt Elvis would always be there. He was such a force of nature. Despite all my fears for him, I never thought he would die at the age he did. He was still so young. He'd talked so much about what he still wanted to do. He had plans for his music and for his life. Elvis wasn't ready to leave. I wasn't ready.",
      "It was a constant battle to accept that he was gone. Every morning, I would wake up and remember, \"Oh God, Elvis isn't here anymore. How can I live knowing that?\" I was frightened to be in a world without Elvis in it.",
      "There would be no more calls. I would never again pick up the phone and hear his voice. There would be no more visits, no more dropping by unexpectedly. I wouldn't be going to Graceland anymore, except to visit Grandma and Vernon. There was no more Memphis Mafia. Everybody scattered. Everything changed. I changed. I had been happy-go-lucky, always excited about where we were going or what we were doing next. I had finally adjusted to the separation, feeling free and adventurous. Optimistic. My memories of Elvis had been happy ones. When I went somewhere we'd been, I would think, \"Oh my gosh, we went here.\" I remembered the times fans would cling to him and want pictures. They loved him and didn't want to let him go, and when he tried to escape, a trail of girls would follow him. It had been fun. He had so much charm and was so generous to loved ones and strangers alike. It filled him with joy when he was able to do something special for other people.",
      "Now my mind was filled with images of loss. I couldn't get away from reminders of him. The media was filled with articles and broadcasts about Elvis, and his songs flooded the radio stations. If I went out, people would come over and say, \"I'm so sorry.\" I knew they meant well, but it was painful. For a long time after Elvis passed, I rarely went anywhere. I waited a while to continue with my life.",
      "Worst of all, I no longer had a father for my daughter. I was raising my child by myself, a brokenhearted child who had lost her daddy. When we got back home from the funeral, we were surrounded by reminders of his passing. I had to protect her from all the news reports, the unwanted attention, the nonstop condolence calls. It seemed like every newspaper and magazine had a headline about his passing. If Lisa and I went to the grocery store, I'd pull the ones with headlines out of the rack and turn them around in the checkout line so Lisa wouldn't see them. To get her away from the constant reminders, I decided to send her to summer camp. I hoped it would not only insulate her from the publicity but also take her mind off her thoughts. Joanie's kids and some of her other friends were there. I checked on her regularly at camp, and she seemed to be doing pretty well. She later said that camp had helped. When it ended for the summer, my sister and I took her out of the country to give her some privacy until the incessant publicity died down. We went to England and later to Europe. We were seldom recognized there, and we could explore the sights in peace.",

    "story": [
      "It was a truly Vegas affair at the Aladdin Hotel; Elvis in a paisley tux, Priscilla with a rhinestone tiara. By the time they'd met, when Priscilla Beaulieu was just 14, Elvis Presley had already gyrated his way into pop culture, from his music to his movies.",
      "He redefined what celebrity was, and yet, Hollywood was no place for him. \"He would always go back to Memphis; that's where home was,\" said Priscilla.",
      "Priscilla met Elvis while he was in the Army stationed in Germany. The only thing that made more news than their relationship was their divorce in 1973. \"I mean, I was very much in love with Elvis, very much,\" said Priscilla, now 80. \"I am still very much in love with him. I didn't leave him because I didn't love him; I just couldn't live the life.\"",
      "Her split from Elvis is where she begins \"Softly, as I Leave You\" (to be published Tuesday), what she says is her final telling of what it was like to be a queen to the King, and what came after. \"I was living Elvis' life,\" she said. \"It was all about him. I had to find me. Who was I? I was Elvis' wife. I don't think we could ever have a life that I wanted. I wanted him for myself.\"",
      "But so did his fans. Elvis, it seemed was destined to be shared. \"I thought, well, what if he runs into someone he falls in love with?\" said Priscilla. \"And I mentioned it to him, and he goes, 'You don't have to worry. You never have to worry.' But when you see these beautiful girls hanging out, I'm going,\u00a0Could that be the one?",
      "\"I couldn't live a life of being in panic all the time, of losing him to someone else,\" she said.",
      "There were affairs on both sides, and yet after their divorce, they still couldn't quit each other. They stayed uncommonly close. Neither ever remarried. \"We couldn't find anyone else!\" she laughed.",
      "She started businesses, and began taking acting classes. She says it helped with her shyness, and grew her confidence. She was also busy raising her and Elvis' only daughter, Lisa Marie. They had joint custody for nearly four years \u2026 before it all ended.",
      "At age 42, Elvis was gone.",
      "Priscilla had seen the changes \u2013 the bloating, the slurred words, the drugs.",
      "I asked, \"Was there anybody around him who could convince him to stop?\"",
      "\"No,\" she replied. \"You couldn't convince Elvis on anything unless he believed in it or, you know, thought about it.\"",
      "She said doctors would basically give him anything he wanted, enabling him. \"He was Elvis; you're not going to say no to Elvis,\" she said.",
      "In his absence sat Graceland, the Memphis mansion that had been hemorrhaging money. The urge was to sell. Priscilla said, \"And I looked at the guy who was telling me, the attorney, and I said, 'That will never happen, ever.'\"",
      "Instead, she opened it to the public. It went from a home to a family shrine.",
      "By the time Lisa Marie turned 25, Elvis' inheritance was hers. It was 1993, the same year another King popped the question \u2026 the King of Pop, Michael Jackson.",
      "Priscilla recalled, \"We were walking on the beach, and she said, 'Mom, you know, Michael wants to get married.' I said, 'Lisa, I'm not really for it.' And she goes, 'Why not.' And I go, 'Who are you? Michael Jackson, Lisa Presley?' And I knew that Michael loved attention, which he did. I knew that's the reason why. They didn't even know each other that long.\"",
      "Priscilla was no fan of another celebrity, O.J. Simpson. She worked with him on the \"Naked Gun\" series. \"He could be very, very nice, but I just didn't, I just felt something about him in the way he was with his wife, and it didn't set well with me,\" she said.",
      "That said, Priscilla was a huge fan of co-star Leslie Nielsen.",
      "Before \"Naked Gun,\" Priscilla had never done comedy. She was thought of in most circles as a more serious actor after her role in \"Dallas\" a few years before.",
      "\"Dallas\" was a spotlight the size of Texas, and Priscilla's role as Jenna Wade put her in the pop zeitgeist all over again.",
      "She left the series after having her second child, Navarone, with her longtime partner Marco Garibaldi.",
      "In 2023, her last physical link with Elvis left. Lisa Marie Presley died suddenly at her home in California from complications after bariatric surgery, and once again the Presley name was draped in grief.",
      "\"I miss her every day,\" Priscilla said. \"I miss her, but I have to let that go and live my life. But her spirit is still with me very, very much.\"",
      "She's buried at Graceland, like her dad. Priscilla says she will be there one day, too. For her, the first home she had as a married woman will be her last.\u00a0 That's not looking backward, she says; it's a comfort for the future.",
      "\"When you stop and think about it, we're not here that long. We're not,\" Priscilla said. \"All of a sudden we're older and we think, Wow, I don't want to hold on to bad things. I don't want to hold on to, you know, things that are in the past that happened. I want to move forward.\"",

      "For someone so big, so famous, so incandescent, he seemed heroically untouchable, and yet, he was always more than gracious with us.",
      "Years after that first interview, he sat down with our Rita Braver, and a few years after that, he met with me.",
      "Across the decades, he never really changed; his passions, his principles, his politics \u2014 each was as firmly grounded as he was.",
      "As a kid growing up in Southern California, he'd watch other stars romance their way across the screen; frankly back then, he thought it was all pretty silly. \"Any time there was a love scene on the screen, we'd go, Aww! Boo! You tell him lover! And make fun of the scene,\" Redford said. \"Suddenly, the idea that I would be that guy was just too much for me to take.\"",
      "He wasn't always the heartthrob, of course, especially in his later works. In \"All Is Lost,\" it was all him. For an hour and forty-five minutes, he rarely even spoke, but we watched, because it was Redford.",
      "He was 77 when he shot that. He was 81 when he did \"The Old Man and the Gun.\" It was that film, he told us, that would likely be his last. As hard as it was for us to hear him say that, Redford replied, \"It's hard for me to say it! Well, yeah, it's hard to talk about your end. I mean, who does?\"",
      "Among his more than 80 films, many have become classics. He defined what a leading man was.",

      "His Sundance Institute wasn't looking for stars; it was looking for storytellers.",

    "published": "Sat, 20 Sep 2025 14:07:05 -0400",
    "summary": "His music dates back to the birth of rock 'n' roll, as an early bandmate of Buddy Holly, and the writer of such classic songs as \"I Fought the Law.\" But Sonny Curtis' most memorable composition may be a TV theme song that turned the world on with a smile.",
    "story": [
      "The theme song to \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" is familiar to generations of TV watchers. The name of the man who wrote and sang it, less so.",
      "Who can turn the world on with her smile?Who can take a nothing day, and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile?Well, it's you, girl, and you should know itWith each glance and every little movement you show it",
      "Love is all around, no need to waste itYou can have the town, why don't you take itYou're gonna make it after all",
      "But by the time Sonny Curtis recorded \"Love Is All Around\" in 1970, he'd \"made it\" several times over himself, as a songwriter, as a recording artist, and as an early bandmate of the legendary Buddy Holly.",
      "Born in 1937 in rural West Texas, Curtis grew up picking cotton on his father's farm. \"Oh, it was a miserable job,\" he told correspondent Mo Rocca. \"The heavier the cotton sack gets, the worse it is, man.\"",
      "His love of music came from family. His aunt taught him to play the guitar, and while working those fields, Curtis dreamed up his own songs: \"Driving a tractor, you go down half a mile that way, and when you get there, you turn around and come back a half mile this way. You have plenty of time to write a song!\"",
      "Curtis was just 14 when he met a young Buddy Holly in nearby Lubbock. \"Buddy had black hair, but he had dyed it blonde, and it was growing out. And he reminded me of a black-and-tan coon hound. We sorta skipped all the niceties and got our guitars and started playing.\"",
      "Rocca asked, \"How quickly did you realize this guy's serious about music?\"",
      "\"Buddy, he exuded confidence. He just knew he was gonna make it big one day.\"",
      "The two became fast friends, bonded by their love of music. Sometimes, Curtis said, he'd spend the night at Buddy's. The two would wake up at midnight and flip on the car radio for a show out of Shreveport, Louisiana, to hear some of the rhythm and blues voices that would shape rock 'n' roll: \"We heard, oh, Big Mama Thornton and Lonnie Johnson, and Lead Belly, Little Richard, Ray Charles, you name it.\"",
      "\"Were you just absorbing this?\" asked Rocca.",
      "\"Oh, boy, were we ever, yeah!\"",
      "Buddy and Sonny had formed a band and were still figuring out their own sound, when a then little-known Elvis Presley came to town. \"And I mean, the girls were goin' nuts, man. And that really got our attention. All a sudden, we thought, this not only involves music, this involves pretty girls!\"",
      "When Elvis came back to town in 1956, Buddy and Sonny's band was the opening act. \"Well, I guess we were right there sort of at the beginning of rock 'n' roll.\"",
      "\"What was Elvis like backstage?\" asked Rocca.",
      "\"He was just an old boy.\"",
      "The band went on to record some demos, but wasn't making much money.",
      "So, Curtis left to tour with country star Slim Whitman. \"He treated me kind of like a little brother,\" Curtis said. \"I remember I'd be on the stage and he'd come over and say, 'Now don't be nervous.'\"",
      "Meanwhile, Buddy Holly formed a new band, which would prove to be seminal. The Crickets shot to fame, appearing on \"The Ed Sullivan Show.\"",
      "Rocca asked, \"When that was happening, did you feel a little left out, like, 'Ugh'?\"",
      "\"I did feel kind of like the train left the station and I wasn't on it, you know?\" Curtis replied.",
      "But on February 3, 1959, Curtis' friend and former bandmate died in a plane crash near Clear Lake Iowa.",
      "Curtis served as a pallbearer.",
      "\"Buddy Holly was 22 when he died,\" Rocca said.",
      "\"Yes. Can you imagine the amount of music he pumped into the system in a short period of, like, 18 months? No telling how much he would've contributed had he been around.\"",
      "By that time, Curtis had joined the Crickets. But with Holly gone, the band felt rudderless.",
      "It was Curtis' talent for songwriting that helped put the wind back in his sails. His song \"Walk Right Back'' became a big hit for the Everly Brothers:",
      "And then there's this classic, which Curtis claims he wrote in about 20 minutes: \"I Fought the Law\":",
      "\"I Fought the Law\" has been covered by artists from The Bobby Fuller Four to The Clash.",
      "Sonny Curtis is 84 now. He and Louise, his wife of more than 50 years, live outside Nashville, where they raised their daughter, Sarah. He is enshrined in Nashville's Musicians Hall of Fame \u2013 as is his old guitar.",
      "In 2012, the year the Crickets retired, they were inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.",
      "But it's a song Curtis wrote for the small screen that may be his most enduring legacy.",
      "In 1970, he was living in Los Angeles when he got a call from a friend about a new sitcom being produced for Mary Tyler Moore: \"It was just this young girl gets jilted in this small community, and she moves to the big city of Minneapolis, gets a job at a news station. And that was about it.\"",
      "Curtis wrote the theme song based on a four-page description of the show. \"I honed in on the part that she rented an apartment she had a hard time affording, and wrote, 'How will you make it on your own?' \u2026 'This world is awfully big, and girl, this time you're all alone.'\"",
      "Within just a few hours, Curtis was summoned to the studio to play his song for producer James L. Brooks. Curtis recalled, \"I got my guitar out and I sang it to him. He smiled and said, 'Sing that again.' And I had to sing it about ten times. And before I left that afternoon, the room was full of people standing all around the walls. I thought, 'I believe I got a shot at this!'\"",
      "WEB EXTRA: Sonny Curtis on writing the \"Mary Tyler Moore Show\" theme song",
      "Rocca said, \"It wasn't a given that you'd write and sing it.\"",
      "\"No. As a matter of fact they didn't want me to sing it. I said, 'I wanna sing this,' you know? And I was probably more pushy than I should have been, if I'da known better. But fortunately, I didn't know better at the time!\"",
      "When the show became a hit, Curtis was asked to rework his song: \"When they started to do the second season, he said, 'Sonny, she's obviously made it. And we have to have some new lyrics.'\"",
      "For a man whose career dates back to the birth of rock 'n' roll, Sonny Curtis remains disarmingly humble. \"Oh, I've always sort of had a rule, don't give advice in a crowd,\" he laughed.",
      "But when pressed, he will share some wisdom: \"If they say, 'Man, you oughta go back to Texas 'cause you'll never make it,' just look at them and say, 'No, you're wrong, because I am gonna make it.'\"",
      "Rocca replied, \"You know, I should write this down, 'cause this sounds like a song right here!\"",

    "summary": "Sonny Curtis died Friday, his wife of more than a half-century, Louise Curtis, confirmed to The Associated Press.",
    "story": [
      "Sonny Curtis, a vintage rock 'n' roller who wrote the raw classic \"I Fought the Law\" and posed the enduring question \"Who can turn the world on with her smile?\" as the writer-crooner of the theme song to \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,\" has died at 88.",
      "Curtis, inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Crickets in 2012, died Friday, his wife of more than a half-century, Louise Curtis, confirmed to The Associated Press. A statement from his family on his Facebook page Saturday said that he had become suddenly ill.",
      "\"He made a mark on this world, and he made a mark on the hearts of all who knew him. It's a sad day, but what a life. May we look at his life with joy rather than sadness. He would have wanted that,\" the statement read.",
      "The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum also acknowledged Curtis' death.",
      "\"Sonny Curtis was a gentle, humble man who wrote extraordinary songs,\" said Kyle Young, CEO of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, in a statement.",
      "Curtis wrote or co-wrote hundreds of songs, from Keith Whitley's country smash \"I'm No Stranger to the Rain\" to the Everly Brothers' \"Walk Right Back,\" a personal favorite Curtis completed while in Army basic training. Bing Crosby, Glen Campbell, Bruce Springsteen and the Grateful Dead were among other artists who covered his work.",
      "Curtis' start with Buddy Holly",
      "Born during the Great Depression to cotton farmers outside of Meadow, Texas, Curtis was a childhood friend of Buddy Holly's and an active musician in the formative years of rock, whether jamming on guitar with Holly in the mid-1950s or opening for Elvis Presley when Elvis was still a regional act. Curtis' songwriting touch also soon emerged: Before he turned 20, he had written the hit \"Someday\" for Webb Pierce and \"Rock Around With Ollie Vee\" for Holly.",
      "Curtis had left Holly's group, the Crickets, before Holly became a major star. But he returned after Holly died in a plane crash in 1959 and he was featured the following year on the album \"In Style with the Crickets,\" which included \"I Fought the Law\" (dashed off in a single afternoon, according to Curtis, who would say he had no direct inspiration for the song) and the Jerry Allison collaboration \"More Than I Can Say,\" a hit for Bobby Vee, and later for Leo Sayer.",
      "Meanwhile, it took until 1966 for \"I Fought the Law\" and its now-immortal refrain \"I fought the law \u2014 and the law won\" to catch on: The Texas-based Bobby Fuller Four made it a Top 10 song. Over the following decades, it was covered by dozens of artists, from punk (the Clash) to country (Johnny Cash, Nanci Griffith) to Springsteen, Tom Petty and other mainstream rock stars.",
      "\"It's my most important copyright,\" Curtis told The Tennessean in 2014.",
      "\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\"",
      "Curtis' other signature song was as uplifting as \"I Fought the Law\" was resigned. In 1970, he was writing commercial jingles when he came up with the theme for a new CBS sitcom starring Moore as a single woman hired as a TV producer in Minneapolis. He called the song \"Love is All Around,\" and used a smooth melody to eventually serve up lyrics as indelible as any in television history:",
      "\"Who can turn the world on with her smile? / Who can take a nothing day, and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile? / Well it's you girl, and you should know it / With each glance and every little movement you show it.\"",
      "The song's endurance was sealed by the images it was heard over, especially Moore's triumphant toss of her hat as Curtis proclaims, \"You're going to make it after all.\" In tribute, other artists began recording it, including Sammy Davis Jr., Joan Jett and the Blackhearts and Minnesota's H\u00fcsker D\u00fc. A commercial release featuring Curtis came out in 1980 and was a modest success, peaking at No. 29 on Billboard's country chart.",
      "Curtis would recall being commissioned by his friend Doug Gilmore, a music industry road manager who had heard the sitcom's developers were looking for an opening song.",
      "\"Naturally I said yes, and later that morning, he dropped off a four-page format \u2014 you know 'Girl from the Midwest, moves to Minneapolis, gets a job in a newsroom, can't afford her apartment etc.,' which gave me the flavor of what it was all about,\" said Curtis, who soon met with show co-creator (and later Oscar-winning filmmaker) James L. Brooks.",
      "\"James L. Brooks came into this huge empty room, no furniture apart from a phone lying on the floor, and at first, I thought he was rather cold and sort of distant, and he said 'We're not at the stage of picking a song yet, but I'll listen anyway,'\" Curtis recalled. \"So I played the song, just me and my guitar, and next thing, he started phoning people, and the room filled up, and then he sent out for a tape recorder.\"",
      "Curtis would eventually write two versions: the first used in Season 1, the second and better known for the remaining six seasons. The original words were more tentative, opening with \"How will you make it on your own?\" and ending with \"You might just make it after all.\" By Season 2, the show was a hit and the lyrics were reworked. The producers had wanted Andy Williams to sing the theme song, but he turned it down and Curtis' easygoing baritone was heard instead.",
      "Solo career",
      "Curtis made a handful of solo albums, including \"Sonny Curtis\" and \"Spectrum,\" and hit the country Top 20 with the 1981 single \"Good Ol' Girls.\" In later years, he continued to play with Allison and other members of the Crickets. The band released several albums, among them \"The Crickets and Their Buddies,\" featuring appearances by Eric Clapton, Graham Nash and Phil Everly. One of Curtis' more notable songs was \"The Real Buddy Holly Story,\" a rebuke to the 1978 biopic \"The Buddy Holly Story,\" which starred Gary Busey.",
      "Curtis settled in Nashville in the mid-1970s and lived there with his wife, Louise. He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1991 and, as part of the Crickets, into Nashville's Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2007. Five years later, he and the Crickets were inducted into the Rock Hall, praised as \"the blueprint for rock and roll bands (that) inspired thousands of kids to start up garage bands around the world.\"",

      "At 24 years old, Young may appear to be an overnight sensation after her breakout hit \"Messy\" went viral online and topped charts around the world, but she has been writing songs since age 11. Her recent debut at Coachella left her stunned by the massive audience response.",
      "\"I felt a bit confused to be honest,\" Young told \"CBS Mornings\" about her April performance. \"It was absolutely bonkers. Just the amount of people that were standing there screaming. It was like, 'For me, like, what?' Do you know what I mean?\"",

      "\"Jimmy Kimmel Live will be pre-empted indefinitely,\" an ABC spokesperson told CBS News in a statement. There was no word on if or when the show may return. Kimmel's show has been a staple of the network since it began airing in 2003.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Kimmel's representatives for comment.",
      "ABC's announcement came after media giant Nexstar announced in a news release that it would pre-empt Kimmel's show indefinitely on all its stations over Kimmel's remarks.",
      "\"Mr. Kimmel's comments about the death of Mr. Kirk are offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse, and we do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located,\" said Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar's broadcasting division, in a statement. \"Continuing to give Mr. Kimmel a broadcast platform in the communities we serve is simply not in the public interest at the current time, and we have made the difficult decision to preempt his show in an effort to let cooler heads prevail as we move toward the resumption of respectful, constructive dialogue.\"",
      "Nexstar owns and operates more than 200 stations nationwide, including more than two dozen ABC affiliates.",
      "Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the Federal Communications Commission to approve it.",
      "\"The decision to preempt 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' was made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision,\" a Nexstar spokesperson told CBS News in an email Thursday.",

      "\"I want to thank Nexstar for doing the right thing,\" Carr wrote. \"Local broadcasters have an obligation to serve the public interest. While this may be an unprecedented decision, it is important for broadcasters to push back on Disney programming that they determine falls short of community values.\"",
      "The FCC's website\u00a0features a fact sheet\u00a0about freedom of speech that says the agency is \"barred by law from trying to prevent the broadcast of any point of view.\"",
      "\"Expressions of views that do not involve a 'clear and present danger of serious, substantive evil' come under the protection of the Constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech and freedom of the press and prevents suppression of these expressions by the FCC,\" the fact sheet reads. \"According to an FCC opinion on this subject, 'the public interest is best served by permitting free expression of views.' This principle ensures that the most diverse and opposing opinions will be expressed, even though some may be highly offensive.\"",
      "The Writers Guild of America, which represents the writers on Kimmel's show, said in a statement Wednesday night, \"As a Guild, we stand united in opposition to anyone who uses their power and influence to silence the voices of writers, or anyone who speaks in dissent. If free speech applied only to ideas we like, we needn't have bothered to write it into the Constitution. What we have signed on to \u2014 painful as it may be at times \u2014 is the freeing agreement to disagree.\"",

      "Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah wrote in a Substack post Monday that the company dismissed her last week after she spoke out \"against political violence, racial double standards, and America's apathy toward guns,\" noting that she only referred to Kirk once in a separate social media post.",

      "Earlier this month, a jury found Cardi B not liable after deliberating for less than an hour in a California civil trial. A security guard had accused the rapper of assault, and her testimony went viral when she candidly admitted to calling the security guard names.",
      "\"When the attorney asked me, like, 'What was you calling her?' You cannot sit here and lie and be like, 'I wasn't calling her no names.' That's not the truth,\" she said. \"I said what I said for real. Like, just don't lie.\"",
      "Following her court victory, Cardi B made headlines when she threw a pen at a reporter who asked a question about her pregnancy, which she had not yet confirmed, and asked if she was concerned about \"paternity issues\" with NFL player Stefon Diggs.",
      "\"I threw it at the floor so he could shut ... up,\" she said, explaining that she thought the question was \"disrespectful\" and \"distasteful.\"",
      "Co-parenting with Offset",
      "The rapper, whose real name is Belcalis Alm\u00e1nzar, filed for divorce from fellow rapper Offset in July 2024 after seven years of marriage. The couple has three children together, and the divorce has not yet been finalized, but Cardi B says she's been ready to move on.",
      "\"I am so tired of people, like, associating me with somebody that is from the past because I filed for divorce a year ago. That should be very clear. I don't deal with that, I don't mess with that, I don't have no contact with that,\" she said.",

Continue being a winner. If I had one wish, I wish you would've been a man of your word.\"",

      "Regarding whether they could successfully co-parent their three children, Cardi B said \"not right now.\"",
      "\"I don't really have hate in my heart anymore. I think he has, like, some type of hate in his heart right now. And I don't know how long that's going to take, because somebody could say it, but their actions don't show it,\" she said.",
      "Cardi B said she is hopeful for unity with Offset.",

      "\"You can't always bottle it inside, because that turns you crazy. That's why some celebrities, they do drugs, they start developing mental issues and stuff like that,\" she said. \"You have to say it. Let it out.\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Academy Award-winning actor-director Robert Redford (Aug. 18, 1936-Sept. 16, 2025) was one of the biggest movie stars to ever grace the screen. His startlingly-magnetic charisma in such films as \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\" \"The Way We Were,\" \"The Sting\" and \"All the President's Men,\" and his nonchalance about his striking good looks, made him one of the leading box office draws of the 1970s and '80s.",
      "He became as well known for founding the Sundance Institute, using his celebrity to help nurture independent films while promoting generations of young filmmakers, as well as environmental and social justice issues. Since 1985 the institute hosted the internationally famous Sundance Film Festival, which has been the launching pad for innumerable talents, from Quentin Tarantino, John Sayles and Christopher Nolan to the Coen Brothers, Ryan Coogler and Jordan Peele, and for such audience favorites as \"Sex, Lies and Videotape,\" \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" \"Beasts of the Southern Wild,\" and \"The Blair Witch Project.\" In 1989 the New York Times called Redford \"a godfather to the American independent film movement.\"",
      "Yet, according to Redford, his fame was hardly predictable. \"I was so much the last choice\" for the role of the Sundance Kid opposite Paul Newman, he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2006. \"They tried everything to keep me out of the picture because I wasn't known, compared to Paul.\"",
      "His performance changed all that. Four years later, Redford and Newman re-teamed in Hill's Oscar-winning caper, \"The Sting,\" which won seven Academy Awards, including best picture. Redford was also nominated for best actor for his performance as a small-time con artist out for revenge against a big-city gambler (played by Robert Shaw).",
      "Redford's remarkable screen presence was a highlight of a slew of pictures: \"Downhill Racer,\" \"The Hot Rock,\" \"Jeremiah Johnson,\" \"The Candidate,\" \"The Way We Were\" with Barbra Streisand, \"The Great Gatsby\" with Mia Farrow, \"The Great Waldo Pepper,\" \"Three Days of the Condor\" with Faye Dunaway, \"The Electric Horseman\" with Jane Fonda, and \"Brubaker.\"",
      "But his most surprising film was one which he produced and fought for: the acclaimed 1976 drama, \"All the President's Men,\" the story of Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who uncovered the Watergate scandal. \"It took four years, and the studio, they said, 'Politics? I don't think so,'\" Redford said in 2006. \"'You know, Watergate is a dead issue.' And I said, 'It's not. It's a detective story about investigative journalism and about the American trait of hard work, and hard work [which] led to something that spared us the loss of our first amendment. That to me is worth making.\"",
      "Redford starred in hit after hit, but he told \"Sunday Morning \" in 2018 many of those films he's never watched. Really? \"I don't know. I haven't ever counted 'em, but a lot,\" Redford said. \"'Cause I thought if I look at myself too much, I'm gonna be too aware of myself and that means when I go to do something new, I won't be able to do it without being slightly aware of what I'm doing rather than just being free.\"",
      "He moved on to a job where he wouldn't have to look at himself \u2014 behind the camera, as director of \"Ordinary People,\" starring Mary Tyler Moore and Donald Sutherland. The film won best picture, best supporting actor for Timothy Hutton (in his film debut), and best director for Redford.",
      "While he continued appearing on screen (\"The Natural,\" \"Out of Africa\" with Meryl Streep, \"Legal Eagles,\" \"Indecent Proposal,\" \"Sneakers,\" \"The Last Castle,\" \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier,\" \"Truth,\" \"All Is Lost,\" \"A Walk in the Woods,\" \"The Old Man & the Gun\"), he returned to the director's chair eight times, with an eclectic mix of stories and genres: \"The Milagro Beanfield War,\" about a land war pitting a Hispanic farmer against real estate interests; \"A River Runs Though It,\" a period drama of family and fly-fishing, with Brad Pitt; \"Quiz Show,\" about TV's quiz show scandal in the 1950s; \"The Horse Whisperer,\" about a horse trainer with a remarkable gift; \"The Legend of Bagger Vance,\" a golf fable with Will Smith and Matt Damon; \"Lions for Lambs,\" a political drama of wartime co-starring Tom Cruise and Meryl Streep; \"The Conspirator,\" about the Confederate plot surrounding Lincoln's assassination; and the political thriller \"The Company You Keep.\"",
      "Meanwhile, much of his energy was devoted to the success of the Sundance Institute and its eponymous film festival, held in the mountains of Utah each January, and to its workshops and screenwriting labs.",
      "In 2018, the private Redford reflected to \"Sunday Morning\" on a favorite saying by T.S. Eliot:\" \"There's only the trying. The rest is not our business. It's one of my favorite phrases. Because you can't guarantee where the trying is going to get you. So, you can't guarantee the result. The only thing there is in its place is the trying. That's where the action is.\""

      "Cardi B said she and Diggs share the same ambition, each determined to be \"the greatest\" in their fields. She also credited Diggs with giving her a sense of stability as she readies her next album, \"Am I The Drama?,\" which includes a track called \"Safe.\"",
      "\"And he just makes me feel safe and very confident and very strong,\" she said. \"I mean, like, two weeks ago I was literally having a panic attack.

      "California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington on Wednesday issued unified recommendations on COVID-19, influenza and RSV vaccines that differ from those issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Governors of the states, which make up the newly-formed West Coast Health Alliance, said in a joint press statement that their alliance was \"fighting back against the Trump administration's assault on science.\" Earlier this month, the states announced the formation of the alliance as a response to what it called the \"weaponization\" of the CDC, spearheaded by Health Secretary and vocal vaccine critic Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Kennedy's moves included firing all 17 members of the CDC's vaccine recommendations committee\u00a0and\u00a0replacing them with apointees that include vaccine skeptics, and\u00a0rolling back recommendations on who should receive COVID vaccines.",
      "\"Public health leaders warn these moves dismantle independent, science-based oversight and inject politics into decisions that protect Americans' health \u2014 undermining the CDC's credibility at a moment when trust and clarity are most needed,\" the alliance said Wednesday.",
      "The West Coast Health Alliance's recommendations for respiratory viruses say the COVID vaccine should be given to \"all who choose protection,\" and specifically children 6 months to 23 months old, all adults over 65, those younger than 65 with risk factors, and anyone pregnant or planning to get pregnant.",
      "The recommendations largely mirror what the CDC previously advised until this year, when Kennedy announced the CDC would no longer recommend the COVID vaccine for children and pregnant women.",
      "U.S. Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon criticized the alliance's recommendations in a statement to the Associated Press.",
      "\"Democrat-run states that pushed unscientific school lockdowns, toddler mask mandates, and draconian vaccine passports during the COVID era completely eroded the American people's trust in public health agencies,\" Nixon said. \"HHS will ensure policy is based on rigorous evidence and Gold Standard Science, not the failed politics of the pandemic.\"",
      "The alliance also recommended that everyone 6 months and older get a flu vaccine, and that all babies, people 50-74 years old with risk factors, and everyone 75 and\tolder receive the RSV vaccine.",
      "Separately, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced he had signed a new law, AB 144, which allows the state to base future immunization guidance on independent medical organizations rather than the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The law is designed to address which vaccines health insurance companies will cover, since insurers typically cover only those vaccines recommended by ACIP.",
      "Wednesday's announcement by the Western states comes on the same day former CDC chief Susan Monarez\u00a0told a Senate committee that she was fired by Kennedy for refusing to pre-approve childhood vaccine guidance regardless of the scientific data and refusing to dismiss career officials responsible for vaccine policy, without cause.",

    "published": "Sat, 20 Sep 2025 17:48:41 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is targeting a visa widely used by tech companies and other employers to hire foreign workers.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is adding $100,000 to the existing fee for H-1B visa applications, taking aim at a program that is used to attract highly skilled workers to the U.S.",
      "President Trump signed a proclamation late Friday adding the new visa application fee and barring H-1B workers from entering the U.S. unless they had made the $100,000 payment.",
      "\"We're going to be able to keep people in our country that are going to be very productive people, and in many cases these companies are going to pay a lot of money for that, and they're very happy about it,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson clarified to CBS News in an email Saturday that the fee \"does not apply to anyone who has a current visa,\" and \"only applies to future applicants in the February [2026] lottery who are currently outside the U.S. It does not apply to anyone who participated in the 2025 lottery.\"",
      "\"The Proclamation does not impact the ability of any current visa holder to travel to/from the U.S.,\" Jackson said.",
      "A White House official told CBS News Saturday that the $100,000 is a one-time fee that only applies to new visas and is not an annual payment. It does not apply to renewals or current visa holders, the official said.",
      "This comes after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had told reporters Friday that the fee was \"annual.\"",
      "\"President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down wages,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told CBS News in a statement Saturday. \"It also gives certainty to American businesses who actually want to bring high-skilled workers to our great country but have been trampled on by abuses of the system.\"",
      "The additional charge would impact employers including technology giants such as Amazon, IBM, Microsoft and Google, which have\u00a0relied on the program\u00a0to hire foreign workers.",
      "The plan was\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier by Bloomberg News.",
      "H-1B visas are already expensive, with the cost ranging from about $1,700 to $4,500, depending on whether the visa is expedited. The fees are typically considered a business expense for the employer.",
      "The new fee comes amid a debate over the H-1B visa, which some critics say enables companies to hire foreign applicants at lower salaries than American workers. Some employers also award H-1Bs for entry-level roles rather than for senior positions with greater skill requirements, detractors of the program say.",
      "Tech companies have been among the primary beneficiaries of the visa program. Amazon received the\u00a0most H1-B visas\u00a0of any business in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. This year, the online retailer remains the leading recipient of the visas, with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google.",
      "\"This will ensure that the people they're bringing in are actually very highly skilled and that they're not replaceable by American workers. So it'll protect American workers, but ensure that companies have a pathway to hire truly extraordinary people and bring them to the United States,\" a White House aide said.",
      "Still, Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan research group, said the plan could backfire if it incentivizes U.S. companies to shift jobs overseas, especially in specialized areas like research and development.",
      "\"The second impact will further decrease the number of international students who have an interest in coming to study in the U.S. If there's no opportunity work in the U.S., it's much less likely they'll enroll in U.S. programs,\" Anderson told CBS News.",
      "Last year, the most popular type of job for H-1B visas was software developer. To receive an H-1B visa, which is awarded by lottery, an applicant needs to have at least a bachelor's degree in their field and have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company.",
      "President Trump plans to order the Labor Secretary to start a new rule-making process that would update wage levels for the program, Bloomberg reported. Currently, U.S. companies must offer the prevailing wage or the actual wage of similarly qualified workers, whichever is higher, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.",
      "The program is capped at 65,000 new visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be issued for employees with a master's degree or higher, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The cap and higher-degree exemption quota is already filled for fiscal year 2026, according to the USCIS.",
      "The H-1B program is already the most restrictive visa program in the U.S., with about 20% of applications resulting in approved workers, according to a March\u00a0study\u00a0from the nonpartisan National Foundation for American Policy.",

    "story": [
      "Americans' grocery bills are growing, causing some shoppers to cut back on discretionary spending as they find themselves struggling to afford the basics.",
      "Food prices grew by half a percent from July to August, marking the fastest monthly rate of change since the fall of 2022. Behind the rising cost of food items on store shelves are three main culprits, according to experts.",
      "The Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs, climate change and a shortage of agricultural workers in the U.S. are the leading causes of grocery inflation, Phil Lempert, a food industry analyst also known as the \"Supermarket Guru,\" told CBS News correspondent Jo Ling Kent.",
      "Price hikes, he added, have been steepest on goods that the U.S. imports from nations facing higher levies. For example, the U.S. imports about 35% of its coffee from Brazil, whose exports are taxed at a rate of 50%.",
      "The latest Consumer Price Index data shows that coffee prices rose 21% in August compared with a year ago.",
      "As companies see their costs rise, they pass along those burdens to consumers. In the case of tariffs, some businesses began raising prices on products even before the levies were in full force.",
      "\"There's no question that what we've seen is, we're seeing companies increased prices because of the impending tariffs,\" said Lempert.",
      "\"What they want to do is they want to protect themselves. A lot of these big food companies are public companies. So what they've gotta do is they've gotta report back to their shareholders on profit margins. So they've been hedging their bets,\" Lempert said.",
      "Sometimes, packaged-goods companies disguise price hikes by offering consumers less product for the same amount of money. The covert inflation strategy has been dubbed \"shrinkflation,\" Lempert explained.",
      "\"What they're doing is they're trying to put less in the package, hoping that you and I are not gonna observe that and keep that price either stable or just slightly increased,\" he said",
      "Climate change",
      "Increasing temperatures and\u00a0shifts in weather patterns have made conditions for growing some fruits and vegetables in the U.S. inhospitable. As a result, a lot of domestic production has been moved to Central and Latin America, according to Lempert.",
      "\"We can't grow our food where we used to grow it,\" he said.",
      "Labor shortage",
      "Additionally, Mr. Trump's immigration policies, including raids on workplaces that employ large numbers of immigrants, plus waning interest in agricultural work, have led to an industrywide labor shortage, Lempert explained.",
      "Consumers are reacting to higher prices by looking for deals, purchasing store brand goods instead of name-brands and buying shelf-stable groceries in bulk at shopping clubs like Costco.",
      "Lempert said a little planning can go a long way to ensure that consumers can buy what they need.",
      "\"The number one thing that people want to do if they want to save money \u2014 stop wasting food,\" Lempert said.",
      "\"Forty percent of all of our food in this country is wasted. A lot of that's in our homes. So, take doggy bags from restaurants, use leftovers, freeze leftovers, don't waste food and you'll save a substantial amount of money,\" he said.",

Corporations can sponsor people for Gold Cards if they give the government at least $2 million.",

      "The change could mark a substantial crackdown on the H-1B program. Critics argue that the visas allow employers to undercut U.S. workers by sponsoring foreign job applicants willing to work for lower salaries. But supporters of the program argue it is essential to industries like tech that often struggle to find qualified U.S.-based workers \u2014 with firms like Amazon applying for thousands of H-1Bs per year \u2014 and employers are already required to pay H-1B recipients no less than the wages earned by similarly qualified workers.",
      "Asked Friday how he believes tech companies will react to the new H-1B fee, Mr. Trump told reporters: \"I think they're going to be very happy.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tiktok-algorithm-us-china-deal-trump/",
    "published": "Fri, 19 Sep 2025 18:20:31 -0400",
    "summary": "TikTok's algorithm is the \"secret sauce\" behind the app's success, experts say. U.S.-China talks over the app's ownership must resolve who controls the technology.",
    "story": [
      "A deal in the works between the U.S. and China over the ownership of TikTok could include a licensing agreement for the closely guarded secret of the social media company's algorithm, to which access has proved a major sticking point in negotiations between the countries.",
      "The Chinese government once vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm, the technology that seems to intuit user preferences almost instantaneously and that has been a driving force for the video-sharing app's explosive growth in recent years.",
      "Previously, TikTok had also seemed unwilling to budge. In May, when the platform was challenging a 2024 law banning TikTok in the U.S., the company said in a legal filing that \"divesting TikTok Inc.'s U.S. business and completely severing it from the globally integrated platform of which it is a part is not commercially, technologically, or legally feasible.\"",
      "President Trump this week\u00a0again pushed back enforcement of the TikTok law, which would require its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market. In the meantime, an agreement between the U.S. and China appears to be moving forward. Mr. Trump on Friday said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping have\u00a0\"made progress\" in talks over a potential deal to resolve the dispute over TikTok's ownership.",
      "Although key elements of the framework deal remain unclear, when some details were released earlier this week, Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, told reporters in Madrid that the arrangement included agreement over \"the use of intellectual property rights,\" according the Associated Press.",
      "William Akoto, an assistant professor at American University, thinks ByteDance executives may be urging the Chinese government to strike a deal so the company can continue earning revenue from the algorithm, while maintaining a foothold in the U.S.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "How would a TikTok licensing deal work?",
      "Mr. Trump, asked Thursday about what will happen with TikTok's algorithm, said, \"TikTok has tremendous value. The United States has that value in its hand since we're the ones that have to approve it.\"",
      "Chinese law\u00a0prohibits the export of TikTok's proprietary algorithm, including to the U.S., without government approval, according to experts. So exactly how a licensing deal would work remains unclear, including whether ByteDance could maintain any sort of outside control over TikTok's algorithm once ownership transfers to U.S. owners.",
      "\"What I understand is they would give a U.S. entity legal permission to use it under certain terms,\" said Sarah Kreps, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization. \"So it would be like they're renting the algorithm rather than selling it.\"",
      "Kreps added that in retaining a measure of ownership over the algorithm, ByteDance could have the right to access internal TikTok metrics and influence how content is ranked in the U.S., akin to how a software vendor can patch or upgrade licensed software.",
      "The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter,\u00a0said\u00a0this week that TikTok would create a new U.S. app and that the company's engineers would re-create content-recommendation algorithms using technology licensed from ByteDance.",
      "A White House spokesperson declined to comment on the contours of the U.S.-China framework deal over TikTok. \"Any details of the TikTok framework are pure speculation unless they are announced by this administration,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "What makes TikTok's algorithm special?",
      "Algorithms are complex data systems that act as recommendation engines, ranking the content users ultimately see in their feeds. They also help companies gather information about their customers in order to serve them targeted advertisements, a key source of revenue.",
      "Like other social media players, TikTok's algorithm delivers content to users based on their interests and interactions on the platform. Lauryn Williams, a deputy director and senior fellow focused on technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, described the algorithm as TikTok's \"secret sauce.\"",
      "Kreps highlights the algorithm's ability to quickly pick up on user behavior, interests and preferences. \"There's something about it that is so well-tailored to what they understand people to want that it gets them on the platform and keeps them there in ways that don't seem to be the case with other platforms,\" she said.",
      "In its own explanation of how it recommends videos, TikTok says it considers a range of factors, such as how long someone stays on a video and personal user information, such as someone's language preference or country of origin. The algorithm then \"selects from a large collection of eligible content and ranks them based on the system's prediction of how likely you'll be interested in each one.\"",
      "A Supreme Court ruling\u00a0from January\u00a0upholding the TikTok ban\u00a0notes\u00a0that each interaction a user has on TikTok \u2014 whether watching a video, following an account or leaving a comment \u2014 enables the recommendation system to \"further tailor a personalized content feed.\"",
      "National security concerns",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on Monday that \"we want to ensure that the Chinese have a fair, invested environment in the United States, but always that U.S. national security comes first,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to CNN.",
      "But while a deal between the U.S. and China could address the ownership dispute, it might not resolve all of the national security concerns that led Congress to pass the TikTok ban with bipartisan support in April of 2024, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Justice Department last year accused TikTok of collecting sensitive data about U.S. users, warning that the Chinese government could use the information to manipulate the content that people see. It also said TikTok employees were able to communicate directly with ByteDance engineers in China via an internal messaging system called Lark.",
      "In 2022, TikTok acknowledged in a letter to U.S. senators that China-based employees could have access to American users' data in certain circumstances and said it was taking steps to strengthen data security.",
      "In its\u00a0decision to uphold the TikTok ban in January, the Supreme Court also noted that China can require TikTok's parent company \"to cooperate with [its] efforts to obtain personal data,\" and that \"there is little to stop all that information from ending up in the hands of a designated foreign adversary.\"",
      "To minimize any national security concerns, Akoto, the American University assistant professor, said the new arrangement would have to ensure that the app's China-based engineers are unable to access the U.S. version of Tiktok. If the algorithm sends user data back to China or if the algorithm can be updated outside of the U.S, that could leave American users' data vulnerable, he said.",
      "When Jingtao, the deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, spoke to the press earlier this week, he indicated the U.S. and China have agreed on entrusting a partner with handling U.S. user data and content security, although its unclear how exactly that would work.",

      "\"The FTC alleges that in public, Ticketmaster maintains that its business model is at odds with brokers that routinely exceed ticket limits,\" the agency said in a news release. \"But in private, Ticketmaster acknowledged that its business model and bottom line benefit from brokers preventing ordinary Americans from purchasing tickets to the shows they want to see at the prices artists set.\"",

But the raid, which included arrests of more than 300 South Korean citizens, led to questions about the wisdom of the Asian nation investing in the U.S.",
      "The company said it now plans to produce 10 models of electric and hybrid gas-electric vehicles in Georgia, up from the current two the plant has been assembling as it ramps up production.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-interest-rate-cut-september-2025-rates-loans-mortgages/",
    "published": "Thu, 18 Sep 2025 13:27:19 -0400",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut since December could be followed by more reductions later in 2025. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday delivered its first rate cut since December, a move that will ripple through everything from home loans to credit cards, although not all Americans will notice the change in the same way.",
      "The Fed cut reduces its federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 by one-quarter point, shaving its target range to between 4% and 4.25%, down from its prior range of 4.25% to 4.5%.",
      "Though incremental, the policy turn is significant. Fed officials foresee two additional cuts in 2025 and one more in 2026, a trajectory that could lower rates by a full percentage point and lighten the load for millions of borrowers. For now, the quarter-point reduction will trickle through unevenly: some borrowers will see relief almost immediately, while others may notice little change, depending on their rates and the products they hold, according to experts.",
      "\"Any reduction is welcome, and especially if this is the first of several to come, which it sounds like it might be,\"Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, said in a statement. \"That's a positive thing.\"",
      "One area where Schulz doesn't expect consumers to see significant change is on credit card rates. While banks will lower their annual percentage rates in response to the cut, it's probably not going to make much of a dent for people who carry a balance, given that the average APR currently stands at about 20%.",
      "\"That quarter point isn't going to make that much of a difference,\" Schulz said.",
      "Here's where you're most likely to feel an immediate impact from the Fed's reduction \u2014 for better and worse.",
      "Home equity line of credit",
      "A home equity line of credit (HELOC) represents one of the financial products where the Fed rate cut could provide a bigger bang for borrowers' bucks.",
      "A HELOC is a line of credit based on the value of your home. In some ways, it is similar to a credit card, because it provides a maximum credit line that borrowers can draw down and their interest rates are variable \u2014 which means they rise and fall based on the prime rate, which in turn is influenced by the fed funds rate.",
      "If you have a HELOC, you can expect your rate to decline by one-quarter point within a month or two, according to Bankrate. The average HELOC today has a rate of about 8.05%, the financial site notes.",
      "\"HELOCs are one of the types of loans that tend to be directly impacted, so if you do have a HELOC, that quarter-point reduction can be pretty significant,\" Schulz said.",
      "According to CBS News' Managing Your Money, that 0.25 percentage-point reduction could trim a borrowers' costs on a $100,000 HELOC by about $173 annually. Bigger savings could be in store if the Fed carries through with additional rate cuts later this year and in early 2026.",
      "Mortgages",
      "House hunters enjoyed a preemptive benefit from the Fed rate cut, as mortgage rates have declined this month in anticipation of lower rates.",
      "Average rates for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.35%\u00a0this week, its lowest level in nearly a year. Just two years ago, mortgages approached 8%, hitting their\u00a0highest levels since 2000.",
      "Mortgage rates aren't set by the Fed, but they're heavily influenced by its policy moves, as well as bond market investors' expectations for economic growth and inflation.",
      "\"It's not just about what the Fed is doing today, it's about what they're expected to do in the future, and that's determined by things like economic growth, what's going to happen in the labor market and what do we think inflation is going to be like over the next year or so,\" Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, told AP News.",
      "While additional rate cuts later this year aren't guaranteed to result in lower home loan rates, it's a possibility, said Stephen Kates, financial analyst at Bankrate.",
      "\"It means that they probably could go down more, and they may trend in that direction, even if they don't move in lockstep,\" he added.",
      "High-interest savings accounts",
      "Unfortunately, the Fed's rate cut could have a negative impact on one group: Savers.",
      "Since the Fed started hiking rates in 2022 to battle soaring inflation, high-interest savings accounts and certificates of deposit have been the silver lining for consumers. People who had money to sock away in one of those accounts or a CD could get rates as high as 5% in 2024.",
      "Currently, savers can still find high-interest savings accounts offering 4%, but those might drop soon as banks adjust their offers to reflect the Fed's rate reduction, Schulz said.",
      "\"Expect yields on high-interest savings accounts and CDs to drop. Savers may want to act now by locking in today's still-high rates before they fall further,\" he noted.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to allow President Trump to fire Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to allow President Trump to remove Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors while a legal challenge to her firing moves forward.",
      "In its request for emergency relief from the high court, the Justice Department said that the justices should freeze a lower court decision that ordered Cook to be reinstated to her post on the Fed Board.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled earlier this week that Cook could remain\u00a0in her role while a legal challenge to her firing moves forward.",
      "Mr. Trump's emergency appeal to the high court comes after Cook participated in a two-day meeting of the Fed's committee that sets interest rates this week. The central bank on Wednesday lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, its first cut since December. The president has repeatedly criticized the Fed for moving too slowly to lower interest rates.",
      "\"That the Federal Reserve Board plays a uniquely important role in the American economy only heightens the government's and the public's interest in ensuring that an ethically compromised member does not continue wielding its vast powers,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the request to the Supreme Court. \"Put simply, the President may reasonably determine that interest rates paid by the American people should not be set by a Governor who appears to have lied about facts material to the interest rates she secured for herself \u2014 and refuses to explain the apparent misrepresentations.\"",
      "Lisa Cook's firing",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook last month over allegations she made misrepresentations on mortgage filings. She has not been charged with any crime and denies wrongdoing. Cook's removal by Mr. Trump was unprecedented \u2014 no president has attempted to remove a Fed governor in the central bank's 112-year-history. Critics warned that it threatened the independence of the Fed.",
      "Cook swiftly filed a lawsuit against the administration, arguing her removal violated the Federal Reserve Act. The law specifies that a president can only remove a governor \"for cause.\" Cook also argued her due process rights were violated because she was not provided notice of the allegations against her and a meaningful opportunity to respond.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb sided with Cook earlier this month, finding that her firing likely violated the Federal Reserve Act and her right to due process under the Fifth Amendment. She ordered Cook to be reinstated to her post on the Fed Board.",
      "The Trump administration sought emergency relief from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which left Cobb's order intact. Judge Bradley Garcia wrote in a concurring opinion that Cook is likely to succeed in her claim that Mr. Trump's attempt to terminate her violated her due process rights. But he wrote that the court did not need to address the meaning of \"for cause\" at this stage in the case.",
      "The White House had said the administration would seek the Supreme Court's intervention, as it has done in several other legal challenges to Mr. Trump's efforts to remove Democratic-appointed officials at independent agencies. The high court has so far allowed the president to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission, but it acknowledged in May that the Fed is a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "In his filing, Sauer argued that Cook received adequate notice and opportunity to contest her removal.",
      "\"The President notified Cook of the charges against her and waited five days for her to respond before removing her,\" he wrote. \"Having declined to bring any defense to the President's attention or to dispute any material facts, Cook cannot complain about insufficient process.\"",
      "The solicitor general noted that the administration is not contesting the constitutionality of the for-cause removal protection for members of the Fed Board, but instead believes the president's firing of Cook complies with it. Still, Sauer said the district court's finding that conduct that occurred before Cook was appointed to the Fed does not constitute \"cause\" under the Federal Reserve Act\u00a0 was \"flawed.\"",
      "\"The President's strong concerns about the appearance of mortgage fraud, based on facially contradictory representations made to obtain mortgages by someone whose job is to set interest rates that affect Americans' mortgages, satisfies any conception of cause,\" he wrote. \"That is especially true here, where Cook has not disputed any material fact or offered any plausible justification for her conduct.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced last month that he was\u00a0firing Cook, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, from the Fed Board of Governors and had \"sufficient cause\" to oust her. Cook's 14-year-term on the Fed is set to end in January 2038.",
      "The president cited as grounds for her removal claims made by Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, that Cook made false statements on mortgage documents.",
      "Pulte alleged in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi last month that Cook claimed two different properties in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta as her principal residence on mortgage documents from 2021 in order to gain more favorable lending terms. Pulte, who was appointed to lead the FHFA by Mr. Trump, has continued to make accusations against Cook related to mortgage documents.",
      "Cook's lawyers have said she \"did not ever commit mortgage fraud.\" Documents obtained by The Associated Press this week showed that Cook referred to the property as a \"vacation home\" in a loan estimate, potentially undercutting the Trump administration's claims of fraud.",

      "\"This is a game-changer deal for Intel as it now brings them front and center into the AI game,\" Ives said. \"Along with the recent U.S. government investment for 10% (equity stake in Intel) this has been a golden few weeks for Intel after years of pain and frustration for investors.\"",
      "Nvidia, meanwhile, has soared because its specialized chips are underpinning the artificial intelligence boom. The chips, known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, are highly effective at developing powerful AI systems.",
      "The deal between the two chipmakers comes as China moves to be less dependent on U.S. semiconductor technology. This week, Chinese officials reportedly forbade several large domestic technology companies from purchasing Nvidia chips, and Huawei announced that it was expanding its development of AI chips and manufacturing.",
      "While Nvidia and Intel will work together to develop new chips, a manufacturing deal has yet to be struck between the two.

      "Brooke Allen, a full-time student who also works at a Starbucks in Davis, California, said she was told by a manager in July that the Crocs she was wearing didn't meet the new standards and she would have to wear different shoes if she wanted to work the following day. Allen had to go to three stores to find a compliant pair, which cost her $60.09.",
      "Allen has spent an additional $86.95 on clothes for work, including black shirts and jeans.",
      "\"I think it's extremely tone deaf on the company's part to expect their employees to completely redesign their wardrobe without any compensation,\" Allen said. \"A lot of us are already living paycheck to paycheck.\"",
      "Allen said she misses the old dress code, which allowed her to express herself with colorful shirts and three facial piercings.",
      "\"It looks sad now that everyone is wearing black,\" she said.",
      "The lawsuits and complaints filed Wednesday allege that Starbucks' dress code violates state laws that require companies to reimburse workers for expenses that primarily benefit the employer. Colorado law also prohibits employers from imposing expenses on workers without their written consent, according to that lawsuit. The plaintiffs seek damages on behalf of all Starbucks workers in those states, whether or not their stores are unionized.",
      "Multiple plaintiffs, like Allen, said they requested reimbursement from Starbucks to conform to the dress code but were denied. Gilbert Cruz, an employee in Aurora, Illinois, requested $10 for the cost of removing a nose piercing.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-fomc-meeting-today-rate-cut-september-2025-powell-impact/",
    "published": "Wed, 17 Sep 2025 16:20:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve is cutting its benchmark interest rate as the U.S. economy faces headwinds, including a faltering labor market.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points \u2014 its first cut since December \u2014 as the U.S. grapples with a stalling labor market and slower economic growth.",
      "The Fed cut reduces the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 4% and 4.25%, down from its prior range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The last time the central bank eased borrowing costs was in December 2024, when it also trimmed rates by a quarter of a percentage point.",
      "Federal Reserve officials are also penciling in two more rate cuts in 2025, but only one in 2026, according to the central bank's summary of economic projections. That may disappoint Wall Street, with investors before the meeting projecting a total of five cuts over the rest of the year and 2026.",
      "According to those median\u00a0projections, Fed officials expect the nation's unemployment rate, currently 4.3%, to reach 4.5% by year-end before ticking down to 4.4% in 2026 and 4.3% the following year.",
      "Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) \u2014 the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation \u2014 is forecast to level off at 3% this year, well above the central bank's 2% annual target, before receding to 2.6% next year and 2.1% in 2027. The median projections for core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, forecast PCE of 3.1% this year.",
      "The move comes as the Fed contends with a two-fold economic challenge: curbing inflation, which has flared in recent months, while supporting job growth, which has slumped. The Fed typically seeks to tame inflation by nudging up interest rates to slow economic growth, while cutting rates in periods when the economy is faltering to encourage consumer spending and business investment.",
      "\"In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen,\" Powell said in a press conference following the Fed's two-day meeting.",
      "He added that recent labor data shows that what he termed \"people at the margins,\" which he said include recent college grads, are now having a harder time finding employment.",
      "\"The overall job-finding rate is very, very low, but the layoff rate is also very low,\" Powell noted. \"The concern is that if you start to see layoffs, the people who are laid off, there won't be a lot of hiring going on.\"",
      "In acting to lower interest rates, the Fed is signaling that it views the slowing labor market as a more pressing concern than rising prices, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell underlined at his\u00a0Jackson Hole address\u00a0last month in Wyoming.",
      "\"Concerns for the labor market's health are rising,\" said Cory Stahle, economist in the Indeed Hiring Lab, in a statement after the Fed's decision. \"Unemployment and layoffs are relatively stable at historically low levels, which is encouraging, but they are unlikely to stay that way if labor market conditions deteriorate further.\"",
      "At the same time, Powell said the Fed now views the pass-through of the Trump administration's tariff as being \"smaller and slower\" than central bank officials had expected earlier this year. \"We continue to expect [inflation] to move up, maybe not as much as we would have a few months ago,\" he said.",
      "The rate cut comes amid intense political pressure on the Fed, with President Trump repeatedly accusing Powell of moving too slowly to ease borrowing costs and shore up economic activity.",
      "Mr. Trump is also seeking to put his imprint on the Fed. To that end, he has\u00a0sought to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook from her seat on the central bank's board, alleging that she engaged in mortgage fraud. She has denied committing fraud and challenged Mr. Trump's authority to fire her, with an appeals court ruling Monday that Cook can keep her job.",
      "One vote for a jumbo cut",
      "An economic adviser to Mr. Trump, Stephen Miran, was\u00a0confirmed by the Senate\u00a0on Monday to take an open spot on the Fed's Board of Governors. He will also sit on the 12-member Federal Open Markets Committee, or FOMC, which sets interest rates for the Fed.",
      "\"Stephen Miran was a last-minute addition to the FOMC, but his vote won't drastically alter the outcome. He joined too late to submit an economic projection and path for monetary policy,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a report this week ahead of the Fed's rate cut.",
      "All of the voting FOMC members except one \u2014 Miran \u2014 voted in favor of the quarter-point cut, according to the central bank's statement. Miran voted for a larger cut of 0.50 percentage points, the Fed noted.",
      "A key question for consumers and businesses is whether the Fed trimming borrowing costs for the first time in nearly a year augurs additional cuts in 2025 and heading into 2026. Fed officials have two more meetings this year, set for October and December.",
      "Although the FOMC members were largely united on the size of today's cut, their projections of future cuts show a difference of opinion about the path of monetary policy moving forward. Many of the group's members don't expect the panel to make any more cuts this year, according to the summary of economic projections.",
      "\"That median hides the deep split on the FOMC \u2013\u2013 nine of 19 members don't anticipate further cuts this year,\" Michael Pearce, deputy chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report.",
      "Powell noted that a quarter-point cut isn't likely to make a huge difference to the economy, but added, \"You have to look at the path\" of future cuts expected later this year and in 2026. \"It starts with a 25 basis point cut \u2014 it's not just one action,\" he said.",

      "Average homeowners insurance costs have risen nearly 70% over the past five years, according\u00a0to data from ICE Mortgage Technology. On average, single-family homeowners with a mortgage now pay $2,370 a year for their property policy. In 2025, homeowners insurance costs rose have risen most sharply in California, where premiums in Los Angeles were up 19.5% compared to a year ago, according to the loan analytics firm.",
      "Soaring homeowners insurance rates are leading some Americans to switch insurers, or do without coverage altogether \u2014 a risky step that can prove financially ruinous and that experts strongly discourage.",
      "\"All things being equal, if you raise prices customers aren't happy,\" J.D. Power managing director Craig Martin told CBS MoneyWatch. \"As premiums increase, it starts to impact how people perceive insurance, and they start to wonder if their insurer cares about them or their profits.\"",
      "Property insurance premiums vary by geography, and are typically higher in places where residents are more vulnerable to disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires that scientists link to climate change, according to insurance experts.",
      "\"The price of insurance is increasing as the level of risk increases,\" said Sean Kevelighan, CEO of the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group that provides information to consumers. \"We are beginning to see some trends of Americans making tougher decisions about their insurance.\"",
      "According to a recent Realtor.com survey of homeowners, nearly 60% of respondents said they might forgo purchasing property coverage if it becomes too expensive.",
      "\"Households are feeling squeezed, and more are considering going without home insurance altogether,\" Realtor.com economic data analyst Hannah Jones told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "What's behind rising premiums?",
      "Several factors have led to the surge in property insurance costs:\u00a0higher home values, mounting climate-related risks, and the higher cost of lumber, steel and other building materials, insurance experts said. In June, the median home sale price in the U.S. hit a record high of nearly $400,000, according to online real estate firm Redfin.",
      "\"We've seen costs related to construction materials rise, and the price of insurance is a reflection of risk, plus the cost to pay a claim,\" Kevelighan said.",
      "\"It's a double whammy,\" Jones added. \"If your home is worth more, it costs more to insure, and also your home is more at risk, so you stand to lose more if you go without insurance.\"",
      "\"We don't recommend going without insurance because it leaves you extremely exposed in case you do suffer property damage, or a complete loss of property,\" she said.",
      "However, homeowners do have alternatives when it comes to choosing an insurer, while there are steps they can take to try to minimize their coverage costs.",
      "\"A few of these things are under people's control,\" NerdWallet homeowners insurance expert Holden Lewis told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you are in a place where there are a lot of wildfires, you can change your landscaping so you don't have flammable materials, for example.\"",
      "A home that's perceived as less vulnerable is less costly to insure, he explained.",

      "Each fall \u2014 typically in October or November \u2014 the IRS announces inflation adjustments that affects everything from the tax brackets people are subject to based on their income to the size of the standard deduction. Some experts are already projecting those changes by analyzing the same inflation data the tax agency uses as part its annual reset.",
      "Based on that analysis, the IRS is likely to apply an inflation rate of 2.7% in adjusting its brackets and other items, according to Bloomberg Tax. It based its projection on chained Consumer Price Index data for the past 12 months.",
      "Separately, the bottom two tax brackets will see a bigger adjustment next year because of the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law, which applies a more generous inflation bump for those bands. Those brackets will see a roughly 4% increase in their income thresholds next year, Bloomberg Tax calculated.",
      "The IRS tweaks those thresholds to avoid so-called \"bracket creep,\" which can occur if the bands fail to keep up with inflation. Without those annual adjustments, workers who get a cost-of-living pay increase could be pushed into a higher tax bracket even though their standard of living hasn't changed.",
      "\"If they didn't do it year after year, for example with the standard deduction, it would become less and less meaningful each year for taxpayers,\" Amber Gorski, an analyst at Bloomberg Tax and Accounting, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In other words, you'll have to earn more income next year to reach each higher band of taxation. For instance, a single taxpayer who earns $50,000 in 2025 would have a top tax rate of 22%, but in 2026 their highest marginal rate would be 12%, according to Bloomberg's projections.",
      "How the adjustments could impact you",
      "Some Americans could see a tax break due to the higher thresholds for each bracket.",
      "\"Going into 2026, they could use that information to estimate what their tax return potentially is going to be, and what they might owe in taxes,\" Gorski said.",
      "On top of the higher income thresholds for 2026, some seniors and workers could also benefit from changes implemented under the \"big, beautiful\" bill. Those include an extra $6,000 senior deduction and the elimination of some taxes on tipped income and overtime pay for qualifying workers.",
      "The passage of the tax and spending bill in July ensures that next year's tax bracket rates will remain the same. That means the individual tax rates will remain at 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37%, although the thresholds for each band will edge higher because of the inflation adjustments.",
      "Without the new tax law, enacted \u00a0by President Trump in July, the bracket rates would have reverted to their levels before the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Prior to that law, for instance, the highest individual income bracket stood at 39.6%.",

    "published": "Tue, 16 Sep 2025 13:28:07 -0400",
    "summary": "CBS News looked at the cost of producing coal, gas, nuclear, wind and solar energy to determine which is the cheapest.",
    "story": [
      "The emergence of renewable energy like wind and solar as a viable alternative to oil, gas and other fossil fuels has raised critical questions about which form of power offers the best value today \u2014 a debate made all the more urgent by the ravages of climate change.",
      "In the U.S., where energy policy has been shaped by politics for more than a century, the battle continues to play out at the highest levels of government. Former President Biden delivered one of the biggest endorsements of renewable energy in the form of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which offered tax credits and rebates to businesses, organizations and households that invest in solar, wind and geothermal technologies.",
      "By contrast, President Trump has been a staunch supporter of the oil and gas industry. During his inauguration speech in January, he reaffirmed his commitment to fossil fuel production, saying, \"We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet. That will help to do it.\"",
      "Within six months of taking office, Mr. Trump signed the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" into law, which phases out clean energy tax incentives while simultaneously expanding tax breaks for the oil and gas industries. Separately, his administration has pared back offshore wind leasing and made it more difficult for clean energy projects to qualify for federal dollars.",
      "On the global trade front, Mr. Trump has issued a flurry of tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, which experts say will translate into higher costs for energy projects that rely on imports. The White House is pushing these policies amid concerns over rising U.S. energy prices, with average electricity costs up 5.5% from a year ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "To get to the bottom of which form of energy is the cheapest, CBS News analyzed the cost to produce coal, gas, nuclear, wind and solar energy, including the impact of tax incentives, tariffs and other factors.",
      "Determining the cheapest form of energy",
      "Multiple criteria come into play in trying to assess the cheapest form of energy. These include consumers' monthly costs; the cost to produce energy; and the potential social cost energy production can have on a community's health and the environment. External factors like tax incentives and fluctuations in the economy also can affect the price it costs to heat and cool our homes.",
      "CBS News set out to answer the question using what's called the Levelized Cost of Energy, or LCOE, a commonly cited benchmark for wholesale energy costs. LCOE is the price that a power-generating facility must receive for its electricity to cover all its expenses \u2014 including capital, equipment, maintenance and other financing costs \u2014 over the lifespan of a project.",
      "A 2025 LCOE report from investment bank Lazard shows the cost to produce energy without any government subsidies and how that changes when you layer in other factors, such as tax subsidies provided under the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Yet while LCOE calculations are widely used, they don't offer a full picture when it comes to evaluating the cost and value of energy, experts told CBS News. Other factors, such as interest rates and federal regulations, can also have a major impact on the cost of building and operating energy infrastructure.",
      "LCOE also doesn't account for the value a given form of energy delivers. For example, because solar and wind are affected by the weather, they tend to be less consistent than oil and gas, meaning a backup source of energy may be necessary.",
      "\"You have to talk about, what is the additional cost of balancing that production from a resource that doesn't produce all the time?\" Severin Borenstein, faculty director of the Energy Institute at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business, told CBS News.",
      "How tax subsidies factor in",
      "The U.S. government has a long history of using tax subsidies to encourage energy production. Oil and gas companies have benefited from such support for more than a century. One example is a tax deduction known as Intangible Drilling Costs, or IDCs, which allows companies to deduct certain expenses associated with finding and preparing an oil or gas well.",
      "By comparison, only in recent decades have renewable energy projects drawn a larger share of federal dollars. The push for renewables accelerated in the 1970s, when the U.S. was facing an energy crisis defined by fuel shortages and high prices,\u00a0according\u00a0to Congress.gov.",
      "Lazard's report shows how the LCOE for renewable energy fluctuates when you account for certain provisions of the IRA aimed at lowering the cost of developing clean energy projects. Those include the investment tax credit (ITC), production tax credit (PTC) and energy community bonus, which increases the value of the ITC and PTC by 10% for projects in certain areas.",
      "Lazard's calculations assume these credits will be in place for 10 years. Notably, however, the Republican-backed \"big, beautiful bill\" signed into law by Mr. Trump this summer is slated to phase out those credits over the next two years.",
      "Although Lazard examines how the IRA affects renewable energy prices, it doesn't factor in any government subsidies flowing to the oil and gas industry, which vary widely and can be difficult to assess.",
      "The Environmental and Energy Study Institute, a bipartisan nonprofit research group,\u00a0estimates that direct U.S. subsidies to the fossil fuel industry amount to at least $20 billion per year. However, the FracTracker Alliance, a nonprofit focused on the impact of fossil fuels,\u00a0says the industry receives an estimated $760 billion annually in government subsidies and tax breaks.",
      "More benefits will go to the oil and gas industries under the \"big, beautiful bill.\" A June report from the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the legislation will funnel nearly $18 billion in tax incentives to the oil and gas industry over the next 10 years.",
      "Oil and gas companies have lauded the new law as a win for the industry. Sunil Mathew, chief financial officer of Occidental Petroleum, said during a recent company earnings call that the measure \"will provide significant cash tax benefits to Oxy.\" He expects the law will save Occidental $700 million to $800 million in \"cash taxes\" by the end of next year.",
      "How do tariffs factor into energy production costs?",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs are also projected to alter the cost it takes to fund energy projects in the U.S. To gauge the impact of tariffs on energy costs, CBS News turned to a model created by global data and analytics company Wood Mackenzie.",
      "In the following chart, dark green indicates a scenario in which the U.S. hasn't applied any country-level tariffs, but still maintains levies on copper, steel and aluminum imports; the medium shade of green represents current baseline tariffs imposed by the U.S. since Mr. Trump resumed office in January through August 7; and the light green indicates if trade relations with a U.S. economic partner is likely to worsen or deteriorate.",
      "As depicted, U.S. tariffs are projected to hit battery storage production the hardest. Chris Seiple, vice chairman of the power and renewables group at Wood Mackenzie, noted that while some energy equipment is produced domestically, other tech, such as battery cells, mostly comes from abroad, making them more susceptible to tariffs.",
      "\"The vast majority of our battery cells come from China,\" he said. \"And so the cost of a battery project is going to go up by a certain percentage.\"",
      "This could lead to what Seiple described as a \"whack-a-mole\" effect, in which over time companies move their manufacturing to non-tariffed countries to avoid an additional financial burden.",
      "What is the cheapest form of energy?",
      "Given these multiple and interconnected factors, what ends up being the cheapest form of energy to produce?",
      "According to Lazard, renewables remain the most cost-competitive form of generating and distributing energy. Onshore wind, which runs from $37 to $86 per megawatt-hour ($/MWh), is the most affordable on a baseline level and when tax subsidies are included.",
      "Utility scale solar \u2014 what most people think of when they hear about solar energy \u2014 is the next most cost-effective approach, with costs ranging from $38 to $78 per megawatt-hour.",
      "Fossil fuel and nuclear energy sources are more expensive to generate. Coal costs $71 to $173 per megawatt-hour; gas costs $48 to $109; and U.S. nuclear costs $141 to $220, Lazard found.",
      "The main reasons for these differences in cost? Experts told CBS News that while the capital cost for renewable projects is steep, the expense of operating and maintaining such facilities tends to be lower than that associated with fossil fuel production.",
      "\"Wind and solar you basically do all the investment up front, and then it operates \u2014 not quite for free \u2014 but at extremely low operating costs per kilowatt hour,\" Borenstein said.",
      "With fossil fuels, the cost of oil, gas and coal \u2014 which can be volatile \u2014 is another key factor.",
      "\"For a natural gas-fired power plant, you have to buy the natural gas,\" he explained. \"And likewise, a coal-fired power plant, you have to buy the coal. And so the price\u2026 is going to fluctuate.\"",
      "Experts who spoke with CBS News agreed that renewable energy ends up being the most competitive when it comes to costs. Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a Washington, D.C. consulting firm, concurred that solar and wind are the cheapest to run. Natural gas is the most affordable source of backup energy, which is necessary to make sure power is available around the clock, he said.",
      "Seiple said if you need a small amount of inexpensive electricity, solar is the way to go. It's \"low cost to build, it can be deployed quickly and modularly, the fuel is free and not volatile in price, and the ongoing maintenance costs are minimal,\" he said. \"And if the U.S. didn't penalize it with tariffs, it would be even lower cost.\"",
      "Despite such advantages for renewable energy, experts say the U.S. shouldn't put all of its eggs in one basket. Multiple sources told CBS News that what's needed is a diversity of energy options that can meet the country's\u00a0rising demand for electricity. Taking certain forms of energy out of the mix would compromise the system as a whole, they note.",
      "\"There is no one cheapest form that you can run the whole system on, and in fact, it depends on combining them in ways to [get] the cheapest possible cost,\" Borenstein said.",

    "summary": "President Trump is renewing his call to reestablish a U.S. presence at Bagram, even saying \"we're talking now to Afghanistan\" about the matter.",
    "story": [
      "The Taliban government on Sunday rejected U.S. President Trump's bid to retake Bagram Air Base, four years after America's chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan left the sprawling military facility in the Taliban's hands.",
      "Mr. Trump on Saturday renewed his call to reestablish a U.S. presence at Bagram, even saying \"we're talking now to Afghanistan\" about the matter. He did not offer further details about the purported conversations. Asked by a reporter if he'd consider deploying U.S. troops to take the base, the president demurred.",
      "\"We won't talk about that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We want it back, and we want it back right away. If they don't do it, you're going to find out what I'm going to do.\"",
      "Mr. Trump followed up with a social media post saying \"If Afghanistan doesn't give Bagram Airbase back to those that built it, the United States of America, BAD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN!!!\"",
      "On Sunday, chief Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid rejected Mr. Trump's assertions and urged the U.S. to adopt a policy of \"realism and rationality.\"",
      "Afghanistan had an economy-oriented foreign policy and sought constructive relations with all states on the basis of mutual and shared interests, Mujahid posted on X.",
      "It had been consistently communicated to the U.S. in all bilateral negotiations that Afghanistan's independence and territorial integrity were of the utmost importance, he said.",
      "\"It should be recalled that, under the Doha Agreement, the United States pledged that 'it will not use or threaten force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Afghanistan, nor interfere in its internal affairs,'\" he said. The U.S. needed to remain faithful to its commitments, he added.",
      "Mujahid did not reply to questions from The Associated Press about conversations with the Trump administration regarding Bagram and why Mr. Trump believed the U.S. could retake it.",
      "'Ceding Afghan soil is out of the question'",
      "Earlier Sunday, the chief of staff at the Defense Ministry, Fasihuddin Fitrat, addressed Mr. Trump's comments. \"Ceding even an inch of our soil to anyone is out of the question and impossible,\" he said during a speech broadcast by Afghan media.",
      "In August last year, the Taliban celebrated the third anniversary of their takeover at Bagram with a grand military display of abandoned U.S. hardware, catching the eye of the White House. Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized his predecessor, Joe Biden, for his \"gross incompetence\" during the withdrawal of U.S. forces after the country's longest war.",
      "Mr. Trump last week, during his state visit to the United Kingdom, hinted that the Taliban, who have struggled with an economic crisis, international legitimacy, internal rifts and rival militant groups since their return to power in 2021, could be game to allow the U.S. military to return.",
      "\"We're trying to get it back because they need things from us,\" Mr. Trump said of the Taliban. While the U.S. and the Taliban have no formal diplomatic ties, the sides have had hostage conversations. An American man who was abducted more than two years ago while traveling through Afghanistan as a tourist was released by the Taliban in March.",
      "The Taliban also said they reached an agreement with U.S. envoys on an exchange of prisoners as part of an effort to normalize relations between the United States and Afghanistan.",
      "They gave no details of the detainee swap, and the White House did not comment on the meeting in Kabul or the results described in a Taliban statement. The Taliban released photographs from their talks, showing their foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, with Mr. Trump's special envoy for hostage response, Adam Boehler.",

      "And this week on Face the Nation: As world leaders gather in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, we will talk exclusively with two of them.",
      "Plus, the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates by a quarter-point. What does that signal for the economy?",
      "With Russia and Israel intensifying their offensive efforts in both the war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict, we will preview a crucial week ahead, as President Trump heads to his first U.N. meeting of his second term.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron tells us why France and other U.S. allies will recognize Palestinian statehood, despite strong opposition from the U.S. and Israel.",
      "Plus, we traveled to Syria for an upcoming 60 Minutes piece and spoke to the country's new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa. He will be the first Syrian president to address the U.N. in nearly 60 years. We will tell you why he's such a controversial figure.",
      "Finally, former White House economic adviser Gary Cohn will join us to talk about the cooling labor market, tariffs and more.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "Most of our conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron was about his plan to end the war in Gaza. You will see that in our next half-hour.",
      "When we spoke with him Thursday at the Elysee Palace in Paris, we asked him about NATO scrambling jets for the first time in the alliance's history to shoot down Russian drones that had crossed into Poland and Romania. The day after we spoke, three Russian warplanes crossed into Estonia too.",
      "President Trump was asked about the incident in Poland 10 days ago.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): Could have been a mistake. Could have been a mistake. But, regardless, I'm not happy about anything having to do with that whole situation.",
      "(End VT)",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe that these incursions could have been a mistake, as President Trump has suggested?",
      "EMMANUEL MACRON (French President): Very clearly, Russia is a destabilizing and aggressive power in Europe. They increased during the past few weeks the attacks against Kiev and killing a lot of civilians.",
      "They destroyed official buildings of the Ukrainian government, but as well premises of the U.K. government, of the European Union. And, at the same time, during the same weeks, they violated the Polish and the Romanian air.",
      "There is no mistake. There is just a project which is to destroy the maximum territories of Ukraine, to have a victory in Ukraine, and just to highlight what they want, the weakness of NATO.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: NATO says they're still investigating. They are not as certain as you seem to be\u2026",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: No. I'm not saying\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 that Russia did this intentionally.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: I just say this is not totally \u2013 I \u2013 this is not a specific point. If we had a situation where they were declining or decreasing the attacks against Kiev and \u2013 and on the battlefield, I could accept this argument.",
      "My point is to say, it's largely beyond that. My point is to say, look at what they did during the past few weeks. So, I sincerely believe that your president was committed and is committed to make peace in Ukraine.",
      "And he engaged. He took the risk to make a summit with President Putin in Anchorage. And \u2013 and he asked for negotiations. And I think he's right.",
      "But, at the same time, I have to \u2013 just to recognize that there is no clear willingness of President Putin to be sincerely engaged in such a move, because, as we were working on a diplomatic way, as we were trying to organize bilateral, trilateral, quadrilateral summit, the Russians were increasing the assaults in Donbass, but not just in Donbass, intensified provocations on one side and attacks on Kyiv on the other side.",
      "So I just look at the facts, and your president is as well looking at the facts. So, now what do we do? We have to increase sanctions against Russia, but we have to find the way to precisely put more pressure on Russia to bring them back at the table.",
      "In parallel, let me insist on one point. When we came to Washington, D.C., a series of European leaders with President Zelenskyy, we took a commitment. We will work to provide to Ukraine security guarantees. And we delivered. A few days ago here in Paris, we gathered what we call the coalition of the willing.",
      "You have 30 countries working together in order to provide the day-after peace security guarantees to Ukraine. So we have all these elements now with an historical commitment of the Europeans who provide the security guarantees to Ukraine. What we need now is Ukraine to be at the table with Russia and negotiating what the peace agreement could be on territory, on security guarantee, on the escalation, on recovery, et cetera.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't see any evidence of Russian interest? I mean, it's been more than a\u2026",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: So, now we have to step up, and we need political, military and economic surge in order to bring them back at the table and to negotiate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's now more than a month since that Alaska Summit, that big risk you said President Trump took. When he's been asked, so why not put sanctions or secondary tariffs on Russia, he points back here at Europe and the consumption of Russian oil and gas that still takes place.",
      "I know Hungary and Slovakia, for example, continue to use it.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: This is true. And we are fixing it. And we had discussion with Ursula von der Leyen. And she made great work with her teams to fix that.",
      "But let's be honest. This is very marginal. This is not a key driver today. We decreased by more than 80 percent the consumption of oil and gas. And I can tell you, because we were not the most impacted as a country because we were less dependent on this oil, oil and gas coming from Russia.",
      "But we have to finalize, to finish the job. This is true. But now it's clearly much more that when we are to do \u2013 what we have to do. We \u2013 we have to step up our support to Ukraine, and we have to provide the way to better resist to the new attacks on Kiev and civilians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What's the delay on the sanctions or tariffs then?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: As soon as possible. If it depends just on me, tomorrow, but it doesn't just depend on me.",
      "So I hope \u2013 I think we have to react collectively. If you want my \u2013 my strong view, I think it's very important. I think we all agree we want peace. We all agree the problem is Russia, because they don't want peace. So now we have to increase the pressure to convince Russia to come back at the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. has not contributed fighter jets to that new effort that was just recently announced after the drone incursions. The supreme allied commander is an American.",
      "But does that signal something to you, does that concern you that the United States isn't more muscular here?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: No, I'm not concerned or worried about that.",
      "I want to say that the NATO secretary-general worked very hard, and we all gathered and exchanged information with the Polish prime minister and the Polish president in the hours right after this \u2013 what happened. And, for instance, U.K. and France stepped up. And we sent fighters.",
      "But it's fine. We were in a situation to do so, and we are totally credible. But, at the same time, look at what the U.S. is doing in \u2013 on the eastern flank of NATO. You are a very strong contributor and reliable partner. So I don't want to \u2013 to diminish this role and your commitment.",
      "And \u2013 and I think your president was very clear about as well his commitment to NATO. But I'm totally in line with the fact that the Europeans have to step up. I have defended for years the fact that we need more independence, more strategic autonomy in Europe. And we need a stronger European pillar.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A year ago, if Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa had tried to come to New York, he would have risked being arrested. The U.S. had a $10 million bounty on him because of his past connections to the Islamic State and al Qaeda.",
      "Al-Sharaa turned against those groups years ago.",

      "(CHANTING)",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In December, he led the rebel forces that toppled Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, who used bombs and chemical weapons against his own people.",

      "(PRESIDENT AHMED AL-SHARAA SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Last week, I went to Syria and spoke with al-Sharaa for 60 Minutes. He accused the Assad regime of destroying entire communities and displacing 14 million people. He said foreign investment is desperately needed to rebuild.",
      "In June, President Trump temporarily waived some economic sanctions to help Syria recover. But Congress, the U.N. and European nations would have to permanently lift more sanctions to draw long-term investment.",
      "On Capitol Hill and in foreign capitals, there are people who don't trust Ahmed al-Sharaa. In New York, he hopes to reintroduce Syria to the world and perhaps spend more time with President Trump.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you want to meet again with President Trump when you're standing on U.S. soil?",
      "AHMED AL-SHARAA (Syrian President) (through translator): President Trump took a big step towards Syria by lifting the sanctions with a quick, courageous and historic decision.",
      "He recognized that Syria should be safe, stable and unified. This is in the greatest interest for all countries of the world, not just Syria. I believe the answer is yes. We need to discuss a great many issues and mutual interests between Syria and the USA. We must restore relations in a good and direct way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Many of the officials that I spoke to about you describe you as a pragmatist. Other skeptics say that you change to meet what you need to be in that moment and that's important to understand who you are and the direction you're taking Syria in.",
      "Are you saying that you are just a completely changed man?",
      "PRESIDENT AHMED AL-SHARAA (through translator): I don't entirely agree with the description of pragmatist, because, in Arabic, it has some negative connotations.",
      "The point is, let's look at what's happening now, regardless of what was said in the media. Today, we have really saved the people from the oppression that was being thrust on them by the criminal regime. And we have restored hope for the people who are refugees or internally displaced, so they can return to their homeland.",
      "We supported the people who were bombed with chemical weapons. We also confronted ISIS. We expelled the Iranian militias and Hezbollah from the region. All of these noble acts we took in Syria should have been the role of the international community. But the international community was unable to free a single prisoner or break the siege on a single town where people were starving to death.",
      "The international community failed to deter the regime from using chemical weapons. So I don't believe we should be standing accused at the defense table, but we should be the one asking others, why did you stand silent as these terrible crimes were taking place in Syria?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You believe the world failed Syria and now the world should help rebuild it?",
      "PRESIDENT AHMED AL-SHARAA (through translator): Of course. And I believe the world must not be complicit again in the killing of the Syrian people by slowing down or preventing the lifting of sanctions and preventing them from reconstructing their nation.",
      "Anybody who stands against the lifting of sanctions would be complicit in killing the Syrian people once again.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: More of my interview with President al-Sharaa will appear on the new season of 60 Minutes.",
      "And regarding that Russian incursion into Estonia on Friday, President Trump said this morning he would help Poland and the Baltic countries if Russia continues with its escalation.",
      "Up next, former White House Economic Council Director Gary Cohn will join us.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to a look at the U.S. economy.",
      "Gary Cohn was the head of the White House National Economic Council in the first Trump administration.",
      "Good morning. Great to have you back.",
      "GARY COHN (Former Director, White House National Economic Council): Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it finally happened. The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by a quarter-point, which was expected. So, rates are now in this range of 4 to 4.25 percent, lowest level since 2022.",
      "The president had said all this was overdue. What changes now?",
      "GARY COHN: So, look, I think the Fed gave us a lot of important information this last week. As you said, they started down the path of cutting interest rates, going to 4 \u2013 to 4.25.",
      "They also gave us their outlook. So, the 17 governors gave us their projections to where they think interest rates are going. So that plot that they put out shows that, overall, they believe that interest rates will be cut two more times over the course of this year. Now, it's not 100 percent clear because the committee is divided.",
      "There are about seven members of the committee that do not want another cut this year, but there are 10 members of the committee that want at least two more cuts, and one wants more than two cuts. So that averages out to two cuts this year, which would take the federal funds rate \u2013 and it's important to understand it's the federal funds rate \u2013 would take that down to 3.6 percent for the \u2013 for year-end.",
      "Well, what is also important is, the committee was fairly unanimous. I think people were worried about the independence of the Fed. I think the Fed clearly showed themselves to be independent thinkers. They took into account all of the economic data, and they came out with a \u2013 projections that made sense based on what is going on in the economy today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when rates go lower, money gets cheaper to borrow, essentially.",
      "GARY COHN: Well\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what does it actually mean for consumers?",
      "GARY COHN: Yes and no.",
      "So, what the Federal Reserve sets is, they set the federal funds rate. That's the overnight rates that banks charge each other to borrow on a secured basis. It has nothing to do where \u2013 with where American consumers borrow money.",
      "Unfortunately, American consumers borrow money on more of the five-year, the seven-year, the 10-, and the 30-year rates, because that's where automobile loans, credit card loans, student loans, and mortgages are indexed to. Those interest rates are not determined by the Federal Reserve. They're determined by the open market.",
      "Those rates, in fact, after they cut rates earlier this week, went up a little bit. That said, they are down over the last few months, but those rates do not automatically go down when the Federal Reserve cuts rates. They have more to do with the market. And it's a supply-demand situation that determines those rates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, one of the other things the Fed highlighted here is that the labor market is \u2013 quote \u2013 \"really cooling off.\"",
      "That's what Fed Chair Powell says.",
      "GARY COHN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The administration, the treasury secretary says, data is bad. They're not seeing that in the jobs numbers.",
      "So, which is it? What's happening here?",
      "GARY COHN: Well, the chairman went out of his way to talk about the dual mandate that the Fed has. The Fed has two requirements that they're supposed to run interest rate policy off of. One is called stable prices, which means 2 percent inflation. The other is full employment. Full employment is exactly what it sounds like.",
      "The chair said, look, we are going to have to deal with the full employment part of the equation, even though we still have inflation in the system. So the Federal Reserve itself and the Board of Governors admitted that we are having a declining job market. And we see that. The data over the last three or four months, we have gone from creating well over 100,000 jobs a month to creating less than 50,000 jobs a month.",
      "It may be temporary. It may be quite temporary, but the reality is, we have seen the job market degrade. We have also seen companies announce an enormous amount of CapEx and \u2013 capital expenditures that's going to come into the system.",
      "I think it's interesting to take a step back and look at what's going on in the world today. I do think that we have seen companies cut back on the amount of employees they have. When you take companies, and you put them in a very difficult environment, and you increase the cost of input costs \u2013 and inputs have been going up because of tariffs. They have been going up other reasons.",
      "And they're not able to raise prices to the final consumer. The one lever they can pull to make sure they keep their margins intact is, they can cut down on the cost of labor. We came out of a tough situation in COVID, where companies were actually afraid about being able to attract and retain people. So they were hoarding labor.",
      "So we went from a hoarding labor situation to a situation today where companies are being very aggressive about managing their expenses. And the one expense they can manage is the cost of labor. So they're letting their labor force decline naturally as people retire out of the labor system. And we're seeing that in the data.",
      "And I think it's clearly showing up. And the Federal Reserve recognized that in this \u2013 in this week's action.",

      "GARY COHN: I'm saying across the board.",
      "I mean, we are \u2013 we have seen across the board. And we see anecdotal evidence of this. I have seen and I have heard it directly from corporate CEOs in every business line that they have gone out of their way to cut their human capital overhead.",
      "So, just the data for Q2 was pretty \u2013 pretty interesting. Corporate revenues rose about 6.3 for Q2, and corporate profits rose close to 12 percent. The way you do that, unless you're raising prices on the consumer \u2013 and we haven't seen a lot of prices go up to the consumer \u2013 is, you have to cut something out of the expense bucket.",
      "The one thing they're cutting is, they're cutting labor costs. We have seen it in the U.S. data. We have seen it in the private data. And we have seen it in the anecdotal data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president signed an executive order on Friday that I want to ask you about, because you have this role at IBM and some insight into tech.",
      "The order is going to impose a $100,000 one-time fee for visas granted to foreign workers, highly skilled workers, H-1B visas. \"The Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that this caused, like, a panic, because there wasn't a lot of detail, at, like, Apple, and Google, and Microsoft.",
      "Did it cause a panic at IBM?",
      "GARY COHN: Well\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean, what's going on?",
      "GARY COHN: The \u2013 the \u2013 I think it caused a panic over the weekend because people weren't sure what was going on with the existing H-1B visas.",
      "It's been cleaned up over the weekend. So, at this point, there's not a panic in the system. Everyone who's got an H-1B visa understands their status and understands how it \u2013 how it's \u2013 how it's going to work. I actually think this is a good idea.",
      "If you understand the H-1B visa program in the United States, historically, it has been a lottery system. So companies have turned in for these visas, and then the U.S. government lotteries them off. If you're now telling a company, look, you need to spend $100,000 to get one of these visas, you're not just going to ask for a visa and put a name in the lottery unless that is a highly skilled person who you need who you cannot hire in the United States.",
      "This visa program is meant for high-skilled labor where you cannot hire that person in the United States. So if that's what it's used for, ultimately, we're going to bring high-skilled people into the United States. It's going to help grow our economy. And that's good for all of us.",

It's a move the U.S. is opposed to.",

      "So, right after this \u2013 this recognition, we have a first phase, which is, I would say, is the emergency phase. Ceasefire, release of all hostages, and, third, restoring the humanitarian roads and stabilization of Gaza.",
      "You know, the second package, which is the day after, we will revert into (ph) that, how to organize gathering (ph) in terms of governance, security, and construction.",
      "And third package, a perspective of the two states. But recognizing a Palestinian state today is the only way to provide a political solution to a situation which has to stop.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you are not making the release of the hostages a condition before recognition? That comes after?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: It will be \u2013 it will be first the requirements very clearly before opening, for instance, any embassy in \u2013 in Palestine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this is a reckless decision. That's the word he used. He said, \"it gives Hamas little incentive to actually start diplomacy to release the hostages.\"",
      "Why do you disagree with that sequencing?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: I think probably this is an excessive word, and I disagree with this approach. Why? Because the objective of Hamas is absolutely not to create a Palestinian state. The objective of Hamas is to destroy Israel, to convince a maximum number of people that they have no chance to have peace and stability in precisely a Palestinian state, and \u2013 and to kill the maximum number of Israeli people. And this is why. If we \u2013 we want to stop this war, if we want to isolate Hamas, the recognition process and the peace plan which goes with this recognition process is a pre-condition.",
      "So, my first point is to say, I don't answer (INAUDIBLE). I don't mix the expectations of Hamas. Hamas is just opposite (ph) by destroying Israel. But I recognize the legitimacy of so many Palestinian people who want a state, who are a people, they want a nation, they want a state, and we should not push them toward Hamas. If we don't offer them a political perspective and such a recognition, the unique answer would be security, and they will be completely tapped by Hamas as a unique (ph) option.",
      "My second point is, thanks to the recognition, and thanks to the diplomatic move we launched, we started to isolate Hamas because we, at the New York declaration, which was voted, as you know, by 142 countries, we gathered all of (INAUDIBLE) states, all of the leaders of the regions to work closely with us to precisely dismantle and disarm Hamas. To know that we're not engaging in such a move.",
      "Now, we gathered all these states, all these people who work closely with us in this move. So, I think this is why we can create the condition of a concrete action first to give this right to the Palestinian people, second, to isolate Hamas from the rest of the Palestinians in the whole region and precisely build security.",
      "But let me tell you something which for me very important in this context. Israel had wonderful security results against Hezbollah, Hamas, top leaders, and they managed to \u2013 to \u2013 to neutralize (ph) a lot of top decision makers of (INAUDIBLE). They did it. This is their merit.",
      "But in terms of fighting against Hamas, this is a failure today. They start",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What is a failure?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: Because they \u2013 they killed all of the key leaders. This is a success. But at the beginning of this war, you had more or less 25,000 Hamas fighters. The Israeli army killed probably half of them. But Hamas managed to recruit the equivalent. You have as many fighters as at the very beginning, which is the best evidence of the fact, if we want to dismantle Hamas, the total war is not the answer because it's just killing the credibility of Israel. And, by the way, weakening and killing our own credibility if we don't make a move as the one we are organizing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you just pointed to something that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu would say, well this is why we need to continue until we get rid of every Hamas member. You're saying, you can't kill that idea. You need to provide a different idea?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: Exactly. But this is so \u2013 this is the whole perspective. And look at the situation, not just by the way in Gaza, but everywhere in the region. Hamas was clearly not backed by a lot of people before the 7th of October. If you took the pulse (ph) in Gaza, but in all the countries of the region, they were very low in all the polls (ph). Today, the level of support is much higher because they are making the mistake, in fact, to reduce all of the perspective of the Palestinians to Hamas. What we have to say is, we want the dismantling of Hamas. You had the success. There is no more top leaders. We want to isolate them. We want to \u2013 to bring everybody working with us to dismantle the Hamas, but recognizing this right to have a Palestinian state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: So, a diplomatic challenge. This is just giving another channel and \u2013 and offering a political way in isolating Hamas. So, I think there is no future with the option which would be just, let's kill the maximum number of Hamas people because they just recruit others and others because each time they launch this type of operations, they kill so many civilians that they are just destroying their own reputation and credibility and they are creating an unsustainable framework of security in the whole region.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But since October 7th, popular support in Israeli for a Palestinian state has also declined. Prime Minister Netanyahu has been opposed for a very, very long time. And now he says that, just look at those attacks that day. If you allow for any kind of Palestinian state, it will be a launchpad for terrorism. I mean that is his argument, that this shows you can't allow for the safety and security of Israel if there are two states. Why is he wrong?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: First, I want to \u2013 I want to say that the 7th of October was a total trauma for everybody in \u2013 in our country here because we had so many French people being killed during the 7th of October terrorist attack launched by Hamas. And \u2013 and it was, for us, one of the biggest terrorist attacks against our own fellow citizens. But we \u2013 we did share and we do share the pain and the suffer of the Israeli people and so many families. And for me, the top priority remains the release of hostages.",
      "And I met very regularly families of \u2013 of hostages. And I have to say that what they live is unbearable. And I \u2013 I had the opportunity to met with them. Yeta Hargiz (ph) mother and so many of them. And what they describe is \u2013 is absolutely unbearable.",
      "But I consider that if we want precisely to build a sustainable peace for Israel, it's a \u2013 and for the Israeli people, a political process and the recognition of a Palestinian state, if the state recognizes the right of Israel to leave and defend itself is demilitarized, has security forces with the vetting process by Israel, with obviously a proper governance and reformed governance, and \u2013 and is precisely \u2013 we have a series of reform, which are a part of the process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that that's it, right? You are talking about recognizing the Palestinian Authority, with some governance over the West Bank. Already was working with Israeli Security Forces. But Hamas came to power through the ballot box in the first place.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: Look, it's \u2013 if we are honest, it started (ph) different. And this is why I think \u2013 let's accept the fact that a lot of people have worked very hard to kill the credibility of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza years ago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Uh-uh.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: And Hamas appeared as a \u2013 precisely a sort of alternative option.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Uh-uh.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: But (INAUDIBLE) attacks were launched by Hamas, not by Palestinian Authority. And if we say all those living in Gaza, and all those backing the Palestinian state are de facto parts of Hamas, there is no end to this war, except that you will kill everybody. And this is \u2013 this is terrible.",
      "So, we have to recognize that the Palestinian Authority has to be reformed, the governance is not satisfactory today. We need a new \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The leader is nearly 90 years old.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: You have a new \u2013 we need a new Palestinian Authority. But let's just remark and please notice with me that thanks to the work of mission process (ph) we launched. For the first time for many years, we got 9th of June a series of clear commitments from the Palestinian Authority. They refused him (ph). Now, the \u2013 the reform, a new vice president being elected, a reform of the education program, (INAUDIBLE) of the (INAUDIBLE) program as well with the monitoring by a U.S. (INAUDIBLE).",
      "So, we launched a series \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they denounced the attack. They denounced October 7th.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: And for the very first time there were \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Twenty months later.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: This is true, but for what? Because we made this move.",
      "So, the recognition is the way (INAUDIBLE) to reengage and bring them back and to table. And my point is to say, let's isolate Hamas. And let's focus on the dismantling of Hamas from a military and a political point of view. In order to do so, we have to reengage with those who can be, I would say, a political achievement for the Palestinian people. And this is why the recognition is so important. And if we revert to West Bank, one of the key element which triggered my decision to announce in July the perspective of \u2013 as a recognition for the 22nd of September, is a vote of the Knesset. When the Knesset decided to start the (INAUDIBLE) again, in West Bank, it was the best evidence of the fact that they don't want to \u2013 to fight against Hamas. There is no Hamas in West Bank. They just want to destroy the existing political bodies and the possibility of two states. And I really believe this is a terrible mistake for Israel itself because, in doing so, they just kill any other perspective that (ph) war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. But when you \u2013 I understand the argument you are making, but it has put you at direct odds with the Trump administration, who argue that your decision to make this recognition announcement, along with all these U.N. members, that it, in fact, kills the diplomacy they had underway. They said they were working to get, for example, the tax money from the Israelis to hand back over to the Palestinian Authority. That they were doing practical things on the ground to help Palestinians.",
      "Secretary Rubio said that West Bank division you were talking about with the settlements, he drew a direct line to your recognition. Why do you think they're blaming you for that?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: We \u2013 we \u2013 we are closely coordinated with the U.S. administration when we speak about the ceasefire and the release of hostages. We were always in close coordination with the secretary of state or key \u2013 key \u2013 President Trump's advisers in order to work with Qatar, Egypt and Israel on the release of hostages, a ceasefire.",
      "But your administration is focusing on the day after. And what we propose is a full-fledged plan where we have first the emergency package. So, let's deliver the release of hostages, ceasefire and \u2013 and humanitarian access.",
      "The day we have that, we start the day after. And I think we are very convergent with the work which is being done by \u2013 by your administration. What we want is a de facto governance in Gaza with clearly a sort of transitional administration, including the Palestinian Authority, excluding, clearly, Hamas, but with a vetting process of Israel, and an association of all the neighbors. We have a security package in this \u2013 in this day after approach, which is, let's scale up the training of the policemen and security forces of the Palestinians. And \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who will do that?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: We \u2013 we are already are doing that \u2013 are doing so. Many country (INAUDIBLE). It does exist. But we need to scale up. And in parallel, we proposed, and we worked very closely with the United Kingdom and all the leaders of the region precisely to offer a military, I would say, an international force to be deployed in Gaza with a U.N. mandate, which is a unique framework to be defended, and \u2013 which could be legitimate to assist and \u2013 and back, I would say, this policemen and security forces. And \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know Israel does not trust the United Nations at all.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: No, I \u2013 this is a U.N. framework, but this \u2013 first they would have a vetting process for (INAUDIBLE), and it would involve Jordan, Egypt, and some others \u2013 some others are ready as well to finance. But, obviously, it needs to be made in close coordination with Israel.",
      "And in the second (ph) package of \u2013 is a core element is a dismantling of Hamas. There is no other option. If you want to fix the situation, to disarm Hamas, and precisely to demobilize so many fighters, to organize what we call a DDR (ph) process, which is very familiar to all the experts in this type of situation. And this is in this day after for Gaza, in the security package, as we can organize such a DDR vis-\u2026-vis Hamas and to be sure that Hamas will never be involved in the Golans (ph) but sets \u2013 Hamas will be disarmed, dismantled, with some key people to leave Gaza and some other to be deradicalized and the weapons to be taken.",
      "In order to do so, you need clear security forces here. You need international forces to be here. And, obviously, we have the (INAUDIBLE). On that, I think there is a strong alignment with the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: My point is the recognition and the process we launch with that is the only way to bring with us on this track all the neighbors and key countries in order to deliver such a package. And \u2013 and look at the situation. Today, when Egypt, when so many leaders of the region are not uncomfortable with what is being done, you need to re-engage them. And this is exactly what we are doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: But my point is to see, if we don't have this full package, the day after is impossible because today, de facto, you are accepting the displacement of population in Gaza City. How do you want the day after to be possible if you displace thousands of people?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, exactly on this point. When you say day after, that means when the war ends and some kind of rebuilding happens. What you're talking about with the Trump administration is this idea of having Palestinians leave Gaza, by choice, they say, but some would say that is a step towards ethnic cleansing. In fact, an independent commission set up by the U.S. concluded Israel has a, quote, \"intent to destroy Palestinians in Gaza as defined by the genocide convention.\" Does France agree with that report?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: No, we don't qualify as a genocide who's happening because it is not a political statement. This is judges (ph) or the end \u2013 or the historians to qualify a genocide by a series of evidence and a clear jurisprudence and \u2013 and clear elements.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you reject that report and that finding?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: No, I don't reject the report. This is not my point. My point is, it should not \u2013 it should not be a political debate. What's happening is clearly a lot of civilians are being killed de facto underground, and the project is to displace people. So, I think this is a big mistake. And this is where I try to convince your administration that if we agree on the day after, and we want this de facto authority, this security package, the dismantling of Hamas and the reconstruction (ph), let's work on the \u2013 on the current day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: If you accept de facto, Israel to displace its people, you will never see the day after. And by the way, I look very carefully at all the plans being shared by your administration or shared by experts working for your administration, they always reiterate, let's work and be together for Gazans. It means that they are ready to preserve and protect Palestinian people because Gazans are those who are living in Gaza. But if the precondition of such a plan is to push them out, this is just a craziness. So, we \u2013 we should not be, for the credibility of the United States, for the credibility of France, we cannot be implicitly or explicitly complacent with such a project because such a project, we know it. And by the way, all of the security expert, even in Israel, are very clear on the fact it will be a humanitarian disaster. And this project will kill the possibility of the day after.",
      "So, we have to be very explicit on the fact that attacking civilians just to get a few \u2013 a few terrorists and a few fighters is clearly not acceptable, but displacing people in order just to take a territory, which is not in the hands of \u2013 of \u2013 of Israel, in order to prepare the day after, is not just a tad crazy,, but unacceptable for all of us.",
      "(END VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The final part of our interview, when we come back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: France has one of the largest Muslim and Jewish populations in Europe. And there has been a significant rise in the number of anti-Semitic acts around the world. In France, it's most than tripled recently.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. ambassador to France, Charles Kushner, the father of the son-in-law to the president of the United States, Jared's father, he published an article, and I know you've \u2013 you've read it, saying France is not dealing with anti-Semitism in France. He said, \"not a day passes without Jews assaulted in the streets, synagogues or schools defaced, or Jewish-owned businesses vandalized. Your own interior ministry reported anti-Semitic incidents, even at preschools.",
      "Do you accept this criticism as \u2013 as genuine and valid?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: Not at all. I think this is a mistake. And \u2013 and an unacceptable statement for somebody who is supposed to be a diplomat. This is my \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Unacceptable statement?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: Yes. Never a French ambassador would be allowed to do so.",
      "So \u2013 and so you are a person who wants to express freely (ph), fine. If you are a diplomat, you have to follow the role of diplomacy. And I'm not the one. This is (INAUDIBLE) to be the ambassador of the United States in France. But the taxpayer money is not properly used to finance this \u2013 this kind of statement.",
      "So, this is not a speech letter (ph) \u2013 word of an ambassador. This is unacceptable. Now the matter is much more important. And the matter about anti-Semitism is, for me, one of my top priority. I was the first president in France to adopt a definition of anti-Semitism, making it the equivalent of anti-Zionism (ph). And \u2013 And I have always been very engaged against anti-Semitism. We've worked very hard during the past few years in order to precisely reengage, have faster sanctions, and I never neglected this topic. And we took \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know in the U.S. sometimes people hear criticism of Israel as anti-Semitic. And you are saying it's different?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: No, but \u2013 no. My point is to say, you can \u2013 you cannot reject the existence of Israel. Anti \u2013 anti-Zionism (ph) is unacceptable and is anti-Semitism. But it doesn't mean that you are not allowed to be in disagreement with the government of Israel, otherwise we will become crazy. I'm sorry, but I \u2013 I want to fight very hard against anti-Semitism. I \u2013 I'm totally (ph) against any anti-Zionist (ph) speech. But I do endorse to be in disagreement with Prime Minister Netanyahu and some of his ministers on many topics. It doesn't make me an anti-Semitic.",

      "Where did Charlie Kirk's memorial service taking place?",
      "The service was held at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, near Phoenix. The stadium, which is home to the NFL's Arizona Cardinals, can typically seat up to 63,400 people.",
      "Organizers planned\u00a0for tight security, with \"TSA-level screening\" for the crowd.",
      "Federal authorities designated the memorial service as a Special Event Assessment Rating (SEAR) Level 1 event, a senior Department of Homeland Security official said. That designation is used for \"significant events with national and/or international importance that require extensive federal interagency support,\" like the Super Bowl.",

      "The president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., also addressed the crowd, as did right-wing media personality and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.",
      "Many of the speakers had extensive personal and professional ties with the slain activist.",
      "Kirk was a stalwart supporter of the president starting during his first campaign in 2016, and he remained allied with Mr. Trump after he left office under a cloud of controversy following the Capitol riot in January 2021. In last year's presidential race, Kirk's Turning Point USA was widely credited with assisting the Trump campaign with grassroots voter mobilization.",
      "Kirk was also close with Donald Trump Jr. and worked closely with the younger Trump as an aide during the 2016 campaign. \"Charlie wasn't just a friend \u2014 he was like a little brother to me,\" Donald Trump Jr. wrote on X.",
      "Vance has credited Kirk with introducing him to Donald Trump Jr. ahead of his 2022 Senate campaign, and with advocating \"in public and private\" for the president to choose Vance as his running mate last year. Kirk's body was flown from Utah to Arizona on Vance's jet, Air Force Two.",
      "Kennedy has called Kirk the \"primary architect of my unification with President Trump,\" referring to the former Democrat's decision to drop his independent campaign for president last year and publicly endorse Mr. Trump at a Turning Point Action rally.",

      "Kirk frequently drew controversy for his views. He supported Mr. Trump's false claims of voter fraud after the 2020 election, and his group maintained a \"Professor Watchlist\" of college instructors accused of spreading \"leftist propaganda.\"",
      "Turning Point USA says it has chapters at thousands of high schools and colleges, and the group's political arm, Turning Point Action, engages in grassroots canvassing.",
      "Kirk was also a family man with two young children",
      "\"He was the perfect father. He was the perfect husband,\" Erika Kirk said last week in her first public remarks after the shooting.",

      "Washington \u2014 Gary Cohn, IBM vice chair and former National Economic Council director in President Trump's first term, said Sunday that \"we've seen the job market degrade,\" though he noted that it may be \"temporary.\"",
      "\"The Federal Reserve itself and the board of governors admitted that we are having a declining job market. And we see that,\" Cohn said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Last week, the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, in the first rate cut since December, amid slower economic growth and a stalling labor market. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has a dual mandate to ensure that both inflation and unemployment remain low, said \"what's different now is that you see a very different picture of the risks to the labor market.\" And though Powell noted that he didn't want to put \"too much emphasis on payroll job creation,\" he said \"it's just one of the things that suggests that the labor market is really cooling off.\"",
      "\"That tells you that it's time to take that into account,\" Powell said.",
      "Meanwhile the jobs numbers, which have shown an ongoing slowdown in the labor market, have been under scrutiny in recent weeks, as the administration has questioned the validity of the government data. Last month, President Trump fired former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after a disappointing July jobs report.",
      "Cohn pointed to job data on Sunday, saying, \"over the last three or four months, we have gone from creating well over 100,000 jobs a month to creating less than 50,000 jobs a month.\" And he noted that \"I do think that we have seen companies cut back on the amount of employees they have.\"",
      "The IBM vice chair outlined that when companies are put in a \"very difficult environment,\" with input costs going up due to tariffs and other reasons, and they're unable to raise prices on consumers, \"the one lever they can pull to make sure they keep their margins intact is they can cut down on the cost of labor.\"",
      "\"We came out of a tough situation in COVID where companies were actually afraid about being able to attract and retain people, so they were hoarding labor,\" Cohn said. \"So we went from a hoarding labor situation to a situation today where companies are being very aggressive about managing their expenses, and the one expense they can manage is the cost of labor.\"",
      "Cohn said companies are now \"letting their labor force decline naturally as people retire out of the labor system.\" He said in the data, \"I think it's clearly showing up, and the Federal Reserve recognized that in this week's action.\"",
      "Cohn said he didn't think this change is specific to tech, but \"across the board.\" He noted that he's \"heard it directly from corporate CEOs in every business line that they have gone out of their way to cut their human capital overhead.\"",
      "On the rate cut more broadly, Cohn said \"the Fed gave us a lot of important information this last week,\" pointing to the rate cut, along with Fed officials providing their outlook, with projections of where they think interest rates are going. And he also noted that \"what is also important is the committee was fairly unanimous,\" acknowledging concerns about the independence of the Fed that have come to a head in recent weeks.",
      "\"I think the Fed clearly showed themselves to be independent thinkers,\" he said. \"They took into account all of the economic data, and they came out with a projection that made sense based on what is going on in the economy today.\"",

    "summary": "In an interview with CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" the French president pushed back on criticism for recognizing a Palestinian state.",
    "story": [
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said it was out of line for Charles Kushner, the U.S. ambassador to France and the father of President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, to publicly accuse him of taking insufficient action to combat antisemitism, and for him to link France's foreign policy positions to domestic incidents of violence against Jews in France.",
      "In a letter he published in the Wall Street Journal to Macron in August, Kushner wrote that he had \"deep concern over the dramatic rise of antisemitism in France and the lack of sufficient action by your government to confront it.\"",
      "\"Public statements haranguing Israel and gestures toward recognition of a Palestinian state embolden extremists, fuel violence, and endanger Jewish life in France,\" he wrote, urging Macron to \"enforce hate-crime laws without exception; ensure the safety of Jewish schools, synagogues and businesses, prosecute offenders to the fullest extent; and abandon steps that give legitimacy to Hamas and its allies.\"",
      "In an interview with \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan on Thursday in Paris, Macron called Kushner's criticism a \"mistake\" and an \"unacceptable statement for somebody who is supposed to be a diplomat.\"",
      "\"This is unacceptable,\" he said.",
      "Macron said a French ambassador would never be allowed to make similar public remarks about another country because it would risk diplomacy with those nations.",
      "\"So either you are a person who wants to express freely,\" Macron said. \"If you are a diplomat, you have to follow the rule of diplomacy. \u2026 The [American] taxpayer money is not properly used to finance this kind of statement.\"",
      "France's foreign ministry summoned the ambassador last month in a formal rebuke. The French ministry said Kushner's claims \"run counter to international law,\" citing the \"obligation not to interfere in the internal affairs of states\" in the 1961 Vienna Convention of Diplomatic Relations.",
      "Kushner also wrote that \"anti-Zionism is antisemitism \u2014 plain and simple.\"",
      "The State Department said at the time in a statement to the Associated Press, that Kushner \"is our U.S. government representative in France and is doing a great job advancing our national interests in that role.\"",
      "Macron acknowledged that at times people who criticize the state of Israel and its government may be motivated by hate of Jews, but rejected the idea that any of his criticism of the policies of the Netanyahu government is inherently anti-semitic.",
      "He told Brennan, \"I was the first president in France to adopt the definition of antisemitism, making it the equivalent of anti-Zionism.\"",
      "Macron firmly rejected the notion that his objections to the killing in Gaza or his call for the creation of a Palestinian state is inherently antisemitic or puts at risk French Jews. He argued \"it doesn't mean that you are not allowed to be in disagreement with the government of Israel.\" Disagreeing with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"doesn't make me an antisemitic,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu currently leads the most right- wing government in Israeli history, opposes the creation of a Palestinian state, and has waged a nearly two- year- long war in Gaza that succeeded in killing the Hamas leaders who carried out the bloody October 7th terrorist attack that killed 1200 of his people. The war since that time has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, and his policies including a blockade of humanitarian aid has led to famine in Gaza.",
      "Hamas still operates in Gaza, and Macron said Hamas continues to be able to recruit more fighters despite Israel killing the top echelons of the terror group. The failure to eliminate support for Hamas via military force is proof, Macron argues, that support is needed for an alternate government in the form of the Palestinian Authority.",
      "Netanyahu accused Macron of fueling antisemitism after the French president announced France would recognize Palestinian statehood this Monday at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.",
      "The high-level gathering of world leaders and their representatives, and other countries, including the U.K., Australia and Canada, also plan to join France in recognizing Palestinian statehood. The majority of the world's countries - 147 UN members - recognize the right of Palestinians to self-determination but the decision by Western powers including UN Security Council member France and UK is symbolically significant. It is also a sign of the increased isolation of the current Israeli government, which has refused to end the nearly two year war in Gaza.",
      "The plan developed by France and Saudi Arabia involves several phases, including a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, Hamas releasing the remaining hostages it's held since its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel and the restoration of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Those conditions would have to be met before France opens an embassy there, Macron said. The second phase involves Gaza's reconstruction and governance and the third phase focuses on a two-state solution.",
      "Macron succeeded in getting Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas, the 90-year-old leader who governs the Occupied West Bank, to publicly denounce Hamas and agree to reform the Authority and hold elections.",
      "\"Recognizing the Palestinian state today is the only way to provide a political solution to a situation which has to stop,\" Macron said.",
      "The position puts France in direct conflict with the Trump administration, which blocked Palestinian Authority members from obtaining visas to attend the diplomatic gathering. Despite President Trump's statements that starvation is happening in Gaza and Israel should end its war there, Netanyahu has brushed off any American urging to do so. Recently Trump said he 'wasn't thrilled' with Netanyahu's decision to bomb US ally Qatar while Hamas members were meeting to discuss a US proposal to end the Gaza war.",
      "The current U.S. administration also appears to oppose the creation of a Palestinian State, with Trump supporting a proposal to remove Gazans and send them to other countries. The U.S. remains a staunch supporter of Israel, as well as its main weapons provider.",
      "Margaret Brennan is moderator of \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on CBS. Based in Washington, D.C., Brennan is also the Network's chief foreign affairs correspondent and a contributing correspondent to 60 Minutes. Additionally, she appears regularly on the \"CBS Evening News,\" leading coverage from Washington when news breaks on the political and foreign affairs fronts."

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Gary Cohn, IBM vice chairman and former director of the U.S. National Economic Council, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 21, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to a look at the U.S. economy. Gary Cohn was the head of the White House National Economic Council in the first Trump administration. Good morning. Great to have you back.",
      "GARY COHN: Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it finally happened. The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by quarter point, which was expected. So, rates are now in this range of four to four and a quarter percent, lowest level since 2022 the President had said all of this was overdue. What changes now?",
      "GARY COHN: So, look, I think the Fed gave us a lot of important information this last week. As you said, they started down the path of cutting interest rates, going to four to four and a quarter.\u00a0 They also gave us their outlook. So the 17 governors gave us their projections to where they think interest rates are going. So that plot that they put out shows that overall, they believe that interest rates will be cut two more times over the course of this year. Now it's not 100% clear, because the committee is divided. There are about seven members of the committee that do not want another cut this year, but there are 10 members of the committee that want at least two more cuts, and one wants more than two cuts. So that averages out to two cuts this year, which would take the federal funds rate, and it's important to understand the federal funds rate, would take that down to 3.6% for the- for year end. What is also important is the committee was fairly unanimous. I think people were worried about the independence of the Fed. I think the Fed clearly showed themselves to be independent thinkers. They took into account all of the economic data, and they came out with a projections that made sense based on what is going on in the economy today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when rates go lower, money gets cheaper to borrow, essentially. But what does it actually mean?",
      "GARY COHN: Yes and no. So, what the Federal Reserve sets is they set the federal funds rate. That's the overnight rates the banks charge each other to borrow on a secured basis. It has nothing to do where- with where American consumers borrow money. Unfortunately, American consumers borrow money on more of the five year, the seven year, the ten and the thirty year rates, because that's where automobile loans, credit card loans, student loans and mortgages are indexed to those. Interest rates are not determined by the Federal Reserve. They're determined by the open market. Those rates, in fact, after they cut rates earlier this week, went up a little bit that said they are down over the last few months. But those rates do not automatically go down when the Federal Reserve cuts rates. They have more to do with the market, and it's a supply demand situation that determines those rates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So one of the other things the Fed highlighted here is that the labor market is, quote, \"really cooling off.\" That's what Fed Chair Powell says.",
      "GARY COHN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The administration, the Treasury secretary, says, data's bad. They're not seeing that in the jobs numbers. So which is it? What's happening here?",
      "GARY COHN: Well, look, the chairman went out of his way to talk about the dual mandate that the Fed has. The Fed has two requirements that they're supposed to run interest rate policy off of, one is called stable prices, which means 2% inflation. The other is full employment. Full employment is exactly what it sounds like. The Chair said, look, we are going to have to deal with the full employment part of the equation, even though we still have inflation in the system. So, the Federal Reserve itself and the Board of Governors admitted that we are having a declining job market, and we see that, the data over the last three or four months, we have gone from creating well over 100,000 jobs a month to creating less than 50,000 jobs a month. It may be temporary, it may be quite temporary, but the reality is, we have seen the job market degrade. We've also seen companies announce an enormous amount of CapEx and capital expenditures that's going to come into the system. I think it's interesting to take a step back and look at what's going on in the world today. I do think that we have seen companies cut back on the amount of employees they have. You know, when you take companies and you put them in a very difficult environment and you increase the cost of input costs. And inputs have been going up because of tariffs. They've been going up be- other reasons, and they're not able to raise prices to the final consumer. The one lever they can pull to make sure they keep their margins intact is they can cut down on the cost of labor. We came out of a tough situation in COVID where companies were actually afraid about being able to attract and retain people, so they were hoarding labor. So we went from a hoarding labor situation to a situation today where companies are being very aggressive about managing their expenses, and the one expense they can manage is the cost of labor. So they're letting their labor force decline naturally as people retire out of the labor system, and we're seeing that in the data, and I think it's clearly showing up.And the Federal Reserve. Recognize that in this in this week's action,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you ask the administration about this point, let's say, well, productivity is going to increase, and there are these technological shifts that are happening. So this data is distorted. Are you-, speaking specifically about tech, or are you saying across the board?",
      "GARY COHN: I'm saying across the board. I mean, we are-- we have seen across the board, and we've seen anecdotal evidence of this. I've seen, and I've heard it directly from corporate CEOs in every business line that they have gone out of their way to cut their- their human capital overhead. So just the data for Q2 is pretty, pretty interesting. Corporate revenues rose about 6.3% for Q2 and corporate profits rose close to 12%. The way you do that, unless you're raising prices of the consumer, and we, and we haven't seen a lot of prices go up to consumer, is you have to cut something out of the expense bucket. The one thing they're cutting is they're cutting labor costs. We've seen it in the U.S. data. We've seen it in the private data, and we've seen it in the anecdotal data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the president signed an executive order on Friday that I want to ask you about, because you have this role at IBM, and some insight into tech. The order is going to impose a $100,000 one-time fee for visas granted to foreign workers, highly skilled workers, H-1B visas. The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that this caused, like, a panic, because there wasn't a lot of detail, at, like, Apple, and Google, and Microsoft. Did it cause a panic at IBM? I mean, what's going on?",
      "GARY COHN: The- the- I think it caused a panic over the weekend because people weren't sure what was going on with the existing H-1B visas. It's been cleaned up over the weekend, so at- at this point, there's not a panic in the system. Everyone who's got an H-1B visa understands their status and understands how it- how it's- how it's going to work. I actually think this is a good idea. If you understand the H-1B visa program in the United States, historically, it has been a lottery system. So companies have turned in for these visas, and then the U.S. government lotteries them off. If you're now telling a company, look, you need to spend $100,000 to get one of these visas, you're not just going to ask for a- a visa and put a name in the lottery, unless that is a highly skilled person who you need, who you cannot hire in the United States. This visa program is meant for high skilled labor, where you cannot hire that person in the United States. So if that's what it's used for, ultimately we're going to bring high skilled people in the United States. It's going to help grow our economy, and that's good for all of us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll see. Gary Cohn, thank you for your insights, as always. We'll be right back."

      "The following is the full transcript of an interview with French President Emmanuel Macron, a portion of which aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 21, 2025.",
      "The interview was taped on Thursday, September 18 at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in Paris. See previously released clips\u00a0here\u00a0and\u00a0here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, Mr. President, if you're ready, we'll dive right in.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for having us here. You know, most countries in the world recognize Palestinian statehood. It's 147 of 193 countries at the UN, but France is going to be the first western UN Security Council member to do so. What conditions are there for this?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Look, thank you, and thank you for being here and offering me the opportunity to have such a discussion. I think it was a necessity first to decide this recognition, and I will announce it on the 22nd of September at the United Nations, precisely because we are at the very moment where if we want peace and security for all in the region, we have to preserve the condition of a political perspective for everybody. So we will announce the recognition, but which is the beginning of a political process and a peace and security plan for everybody. So right after this- this recognition, we have a first phase, which is, I would say, the emergency phase, ceasefire, release of all hostages..and third, restoring the humanitarian roads and the stabilization of Gaza. We have a second package, which is the day after we will revert on that how to organize Gaza in terms of governance, security and reconstruction. And third package, the perspective of the two states.\u00a0 But recognizing the Palestinian state today is the only way to provide a political solution to a situation which has to stop.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you are not making the release of the hostages a condition before recognition--",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: \u00a0So this is a clear condition before we will open an embassy. This is the first series of conditions and requirements we will push-\u00a0 we will put in the peace process. But we will announce the 22nd this recognition of Palestinian state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this is a 'reckless decision.' That's the word he used. He said it gives Hamas little incentive to actually start diplomacy to release the hostages. Why do you disagree with that sequencing?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: So my first point is to say, I don't answer the Hamas with that. I don't meet the expectations of Hamas. Hamas is just obsessed by destroying Israel, but I recognize the legitimacy of so many Palestinian people who want a state, who are a people. They want a nation, they want a state, and we should not push them towards Hamas. If we don't offer them a political perspective and such a recognition, the unique answer will be security, and they will be completely trapped by Hamas as a unique option. My second point is, thanks to this recognition, and thanks to the diplomatic move we launched, we started to isolate Hamas because we- at the New York declaration, which was voted, as you know, by 142 countries. We gathered all the Arab League states, all the leaders of the regions, to work closely with us to precisely dismantle and disarm Hamas. Till now, they were not engaged in such a move. Now we gathered all these states, all these people to work closely with us in this move. So I think this is why we can create the condition of a concrete action, first, to give this right to the Palestinian people, second, to isolate Hamas from the rest of the Palestinians and the whole region, and precisely build security. But let me tell you something which is, for me, very important in this context, Israel had wonderful security results against Hezbollah Hamas top leaders, and managed to- to neutralize a lot of top decision makers of terrorist groups. They did it. This is their merit. But in terms of fighting against Hamas, this is a failure of today. They started--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What is a failure?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: --Because they- they killed all the key leaders- this is a success. But at the beginning of this war, you had more or less 25,000 Hamas fighters. The Israeli army killed probably half of them, but Hamas managed to recruit the equivalent. You have as many fighters at the very beginning, which is the best evidence of the fact, if we want to dismantle Hamas, the total war is not the answer, because it's just killing the credibility of Israel- and by the way, weakening and killing our own credibility if we don't make a move as the one we are organizing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you just pointed to something that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu would say, well, this is why we need to continue until we get rid of every Hamas member. You're saying you can't kill that idea, you need to provide a different idea?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Exactly. But this is so- this is the whole perspective. And look at the situation, not just by the war in Gaza, but everywhere in the region. Hamas was clearly not backed by a lot of people before the seventh of October. If you took the polls in Gaza, but in all the countries of the region, they were very low in all the polls. Today, the level of support is much higher, because they are making the mistake, in fact, to reduce all the perspective of the Palestinians to the Hamas. What we have to say is we want the dismantling of Hamas. You had this success, there is no more top leaders. We want to isolate them. We want to bring everybody working with us to dismantle the Hamas. But recognizing this right to have a Palestinian state through a diplomatic channel, this just giving another channel and offering a political way and isolating Hamas. So, I think there is no future with the option, which would be just, let's kill the maximum number of Hamas people, because they just recruit others and others. Because each time they launch this type of operation, they kill so many civilians that they are just destroying their own reputation and credibility, and they are creating an unsustainable framework of security in the whole region.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, since October 7th, popular support in Israel for a Palestinian state has also declined. Prime Minister Netanyahu has been opposed for a very, very long time, and now he says that just look at those attacks that day. If you allow for any kind of Palestinian state, it will be a launch-pad for terrorism. I mean, that is his argument, that this shows you can't allow for the safety and security of Israel if there are two states. Why is he wrong?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: First, I want to- I want to say that the seventh of October was a total trauma for everybody in our country here, because we had so many French people being killed during the seventh of October terrorist attack launched by Hamas. And- and it was, for us, one of the biggest terrorist attack against our own fellow citizen. But we- we did share, and we do share, the pain and the suffer of Israeli people and so many families. And for me, the top priority remains the release of hostages. And I met very regularly families of hostages, and I have to say that what they live is unbearable. And I had the opportunity meet with (unintel) Guy's mother and so many of them, and what they describe is absolutely unbearable. But, I consider that if we want precisely to build a sustainable peace for Israel itself and for Israeli people, a political process and the recognition of a Palestinian state, if the state recognizes the right of Israel to live and defend itself, is demilitarized, has security forces with the vetting process by Israel, with, obviously, a proper governance and reform governance and- and is precisely we have a series of reform which are part of the process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's it, right? You are talking about recognizing the Palestinian Authority, which has some governance over the West Bank, already was working with Israeli security forces. But Hamas came to power through the ballot box in the first place.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Look, it's- if we are honest, it's totally different. And this is why I think- let's accept the fact that a lot of people worked very hard to kill the credibility of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza years ago, and Hamas appeared as precisely as sort of an alternative option. But, terrorist attacks were launched by Hamas, not by Palestinian Authority. And if we say all those living in Gaza, and all those backing the Palestinian state are de-facto the support of Hamas, there is no end to this war except the you kill everybody. And this is this is terrible. So we have to recognize that the Palestinian Authority has to be reformed. The governance is not satisfactory today. We need a new- you have a new- we need a new Palestinian Authority. But, let's just remark, and, please notice with me, that thanks to the recognition process we launched, for the first time for many years, we got, the ninth of June, a series of clear commitments from the Palestinian Authority. They refused till now. The reform; a new vice president being elected, reform of the education program, a pay forcely, obviously, program as well, with the monitoring by a US audit structure. So we don't just theories --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they denounced October 7th--",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: -- And for the very first time --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --20 months later.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: This is true. But for what? Because we made this move. So the recognition is the way as well to re engage and bring them back in the table. And my point is to say, let's isolate Hamas, and let's focus on the dismantling of Hamas from a military and a political point of view. In order to do so, we have to re-engage with those who can be, I would say, a political achievement for Palestinian people. And this is why the recognition is so important. And if we revert to West Bank, one of the key elements which triggered my decision to announce in July, the perspective of the recognition for the 22nd of September is a vote of the Knesset. When the Knesset decided to start the settlements again in West Bank, it was the best evidence of the fact that they don't want to fight against Hamas. There is no Hamas in West Bank. They just want to destroy the existing political bodies, and the possibility of the two states. And I really believe this is a terrible mistake for Israel itself, because in doing so, they just kill any other perspective that war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you- I understand the argument you are making, but it has put you at direct odds with the Trump administration, who argue that your decision to make this recognition announcement, along with all these UN members, that it, in fact, kills the diplomacy they had underway. They said they were working to get, for example, the tax money from the Israelis to hand back over to the Palestinian Authority, that they were doing practical things on the ground to help Palestinians. Secretary Rubio said, that West Bank division you were talking about with the settlements, he drew a direct line to your recognition. Why do you think they're blaming you for that?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Look, first, I think we all work very hard in order to improve the situation of- of people on the ground. And let me tell you that France, a lot of French people, French doctors, French citizen, French members of NGOs, are working very hard with our administration as well to help Palestinian people. And during the past years, we worked very (UNINTEL) and financed a lot of actions as well being led by UNRWA. Second, I think my- my objective is precisely to- to provide another perspective. We- we- we are closely coordinated with the U.S. administration when we speak about the ceasefire and the release of hostages. We were always in close coordination with Secretary of State, or- or key- key President Trump's advisors, in order to work with Qatar, Egypt, and Israel on the release of hostages, of ceasefire. But your administration is focusing on the day after. And what we propose is a full-fledged plan, where we have first, the emergency package. So let's deliver release of all hostages, ceasefire, and- and humanitarian access. The day we have that, we start the day after. And I think we are very convergent with the work which is being done by- by your administration. What we want is a de facto governance in Gaza, with clearly a sort of transitional- transitional administration, including the Palestinian Authority, excluding, clearly, Hamas. But with a vetting process of Israel and an association of all the neighbors, we have a security package in this- in this day after approach, which is, let's scale up the training of the policemen and security forces of the Palestinians, and--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who will do that?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: We- we are already doing that, we're doing so. Many countries of the regions. It does exist, but we need a scale up, and in parallel, we proposed, and we work very closely with the United Kingdom, and all the leaders of the region, precisely to offer a military- I would say, an international force to be deployed in Gaza, with a UN mandate. Which is a unique framework to be defended, and which could be legitimate, to assist and- and back, I would say, this policemen and security forces. And--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know, Israel does not trust the United Nations at all.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: No- this is a UN framework, but this- first, they would have a vetting process of all the structure, and it would involve Jordan, Egypt, and some of- some others are ready as well to finance. But obviously it is to be made in close coordination with Israel. And in the security package, obviously, the core element is a dismantling of Hamas. There is no other option if you want to fix the situation, to disarm the Hamas, and precisely, to demobilize so many fighters, to organize what we call a DDR process, which is very familiar to all the experts in- in this type of situation. And this is in this day after for Gaza, in the security package, that we can organize such a DDR, vis a vis Hamas. And to be sure that Hamas will never be involved in the government, but that Hamas will be disarmed, dismantled, with some key people to leave Gaza and some other to be deradicalized, and the weapons to be taken. In order to do so, you need clear security forces here. You need these international forces to be here. And obviously we have the reconstruction. On that, I think there is a strong alignment with the United States. My point is, the recognition and the process we launched with that is the only way to bring with us, on this track, all the neighbors and key countries in order to deliver such a package. And- and look at the situation today, when Egypt, when so many leaders of the region, are not comfortable with what is being done. You need to re-engage them. And this is exactly what we are doing. But my point is to say, if we don't have this full package, the day after is impossible, because today, de facto, you are accepting the displacement of population in Gaza City. How do you want the day after to be possible if you displace thousands of people?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, exactly on this point, when you say, day after, that means when the war ends and some kind of rebuilding happens. What you're talking about with the Trump administration is this idea of having Palestinians leave Gaza, by choice, they say. But some would say that is a step towards ethnic cleansing. In fact, an independent commission set up by the UN concluded Israel has a, quote, \"intent to destroy Palestinians in Gaza, as defined by the Genocide Convention.\" Does France agree with that report?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: No, we don't qualify as a genocide what's happening because it is not a political statement. This is the judges or the, and or the historians to qualify a genocide by a series of evidence and a clear jurisprudence and clear elements.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you reject that report and that finding?",
      "And this is where I try to convince your administration that if we agree on the day after and we want this de facto authority, the security package, the dismantling of Hamas and the reconstruction, let's work on the current day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: If you accept de facto Israel to displace these people, you will never see a day after. And by the way, I look very carefully at all the plans being shared by your administration or shared by experts working for your administration. They always reiterate, let's work and build Gaza for Gazans. It means that they are ready to preserve and protect Palestinian people because Gazans are those who are living in Gaza. But if the precondition of such a plan is to push them out, this is just a craziness. So we, we should not be\u2014for the credibility of the United States, for the credibility of France\u2013we cannot be implicitly or explicitly complacent with such a project. Because such a project, we know it. And by the way, all the security experts, even in Israel, are very clear on the fact it will be a humanitarian disaster. And this project will, will kill the possibility of a day after. So we have to be very explicit on the fact that attacking civilians just to get a few, a few terrorists and a few fighters is clearly not acceptable. But displacing people in order just to take a territory, which is not in the hands of Israel, in order to prepare the day after, is not just totally crazy, but unacceptable for all of us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN : So France has one of the largest both Muslim and Jewish populations --",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: -- This is true. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- in all of Europe. The U.S. Ambassador to France, Charles Kushner, the father of the son-in-law to the President of the United States, Jared's father, he published an article, and I know you've you've read it, saying France is not dealing with antisemitism here in France. He said \"not a day passes without Jews assaulted in the street, synagogues or schools defaced, or Jewish-owned businesses vandalized. Your own Interior Ministry has reported antisemitic incidents even at preschools.\" Do you accept this criticism as genuine and valid?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Not at all. I think this is a mistake and an unacceptable statement for somebody who is supposed to be a diplomat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Unacceptable statement.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Yes, never a French Ambassador will be allowed to do so. So either you are a person who wants to express freely. Fine. If you are a diplomat, you have to follow the rule of diplomacy. And I'm not the one, this is you to pay the Ambassador of the United States in France, but the taxpayer money is not properly used to finance this kind of statement. So this is not a speech, a letter or a word of an ambassador. This is unacceptable. Now, the matter is much more important. And the matter about antisemitism is, for me, one of my top priority. I was the first president in France to adopt the definition of antisemitism, making it the equivalent of anti-zionism. And I've always been very engaged, again, antisemitism. We've worked very hard during the past few years in order to precisely re-engage, have faster sanctions and I never neglected this topic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know in the U.S. sometimes people hear criticism of Israel as antisemitic. --",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: No. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- But you're saying it's different. --",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: --No. My point is to say, you can, you cannot reject the existence of Israel. Ani, anti-Zionism is unacceptable and is antisemitism. But it doesn't mean that you are not allowed to be in disagreement with the Government of Israel. Otherwise we will become crazy. I'm sorry, but I want to fight very hard against anti, antisemitism. I am very against any anti-Zionist speech, but I do endorse to be in disagreement with Prime Minister Netanyahu and some of his ministers on many topics. It doesn't make me an antisemitic. Otherwise we are completely trapped in an impossible world. And this is precisely why the public debate makes this situation completely crazy. If we want peace and stability and unity, we have to be precise, sharp and respectful. So in this country, for many years, we had this problem with antisemitism like in a lot of other countries. What I disagree with is the argument made by your ambassador and the Prime Minister of Israel, in another public letter, making a link between the recognition and antisemitism. You have, you have a surge of antisemitism in the U.S. and you don't recognize. You have a surge of antisemitism in Germany. Nothing to do with recognition. Everywhere we have such a surge of antisemitism. It started before the seventh of October. A lot of these guys expressed their antisemitism the seventh of October itself. How, as awful it could be, but they did and it increased after. We have to fight against this phenomenon. We have to read - first, we have to sanction. We just passed a law for our high schools and universities to improve the regulations and to be in a situation to sanction all the antisemitism being expressed there. So we are very hard. We work very hard with the Jewish community in, in our country. And, and Jewish people are part of the DNA of the French Republic. So no chance anybody here will abandon the situation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Has this hurt your relationship with the U.S.?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: No, I don't think so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you do have a few other points of friction right now, or different views than the Trump administration.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: My objective on this- on this- on this issue, is- is very clearly to- to engage on the basis of the plan we will put on the table with, with the U.S. administration. And there is a work, an important work, which is made by Mr. Witkoff, Secretary Rubio, but as well Jared Kushner and Tony Blair. So we had many exchange with, with these people and and they work very hard on, on, on important ideas. So my objective is clearly to to engage with this administration, and to show that we can clearly articulate what they have in mind and a full-fledged peace and security plan for all.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what's happening here in Europe. In regard to Russia, NATO jets were scrambled twice within just the past few weeks because of these Russian drones that have been crossing into Poland and into Romania. It's the first time in NATO's history that they had to shoot down enemy crafts that had crossed in do you believe that these incursions could have been a mistake, as President Trump has suggested?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Very clearly, Russia is a destabilizing and aggressive power in Europe. They increased, during the past few weeks, the attacks against Kiev and killing a lot of civilians. They destroyed official buildings of the Ukrainian government, but as well premises of the UK Government, of the European Union. And at the same time, during the same weeks, they violated the Polish and the Romanian air. There is no mistake. There is just a project which is to destroy the maximum territories of Ukraine, to have a victory in Ukraine, and just to highlight what they want, the weakness of NATO.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: NATO says they're still investigating. They are not as certain as you seem to be--",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: --No. I'm not saying--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --that Russia did this intentionally.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: I just say this is not totally i- This is not a specific point. If we had a situation where they were declining or decreasing the attacks against Kiev and and on the battlefield. I could accept this argument. My point is to say it's largely beyond that. My point is to say, look at what they did during the past few weeks. So, I sincerely believe that your president was committed and is committed to to make peace in Ukraine, and he engaged, he took the risk to make a summit with President Putin in Anchorage and- and he asked for negotiations. And I think he's right. But at the same time, I have to, just to recognize that there is no clear willingness of President Putin to be sincerely engaged in such a move, because as we were working on a diplomatic way, as we were trying to organize bilateral, trilateral, quadrilateral summit, the Russians were increasing the assaults in Donbas, but not just in Donbas, intensified provocations on one side and attacks on Kyiv on the other side. So I just look at the facts, and your president is as well looking at the facts. So now, what do we do? We have to increase sanctions against Russia, but we have to find the way to precisely put more pressure on Russia to bring them back at the table. In parallel, let me insist on one point. When we came to Washington D.C., a series of European leaders with President Zelenskyy, we took a commitment, we will work to provide to Ukraine security guarantees, and we delivered. A few days ago here in Paris, we gathered what we call the coalition of the willing. You have 30 countries working together in order to provide the day after peace security guarantees to Ukraine. So we have all these elements now with an historical commitment of the Europeans who provide the security guarantees to Ukraine. What we need now is Ukraine to be at the table with Russia and negotiating what the peace agreement could be, on territory, on security guarantee, on the escalation, on recovery etc.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't see any eviden- evidence of Russian interest. I mean it's been more than--",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: --So now we have to step up, and we need political, military and economic surge in order to bring them back at the table and to negotiate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So to that point, because it's now more than a month since that Alaska Summit, that big risk you said President Trump took. When he's been asked, so why not put sanctions or secondary tariffs on Russia, he points back here at Europe and the consumption of Russian oil and gas that still takes place. I know Hungary and Slovakia, for example, continue to use it.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: This is true, and we are fixing it. And we had discussion with Ursula von der Leyen, and she made a great work with with her teams to fix that. But let's be honest, this is very marginal. This is not a key driver today. We decreased by more than 80% the consumption of oil and gas. And I can tell you, because we were not the most impacted as a country, because we were less dependent on this oil- oil- oil and gas coming from Russia. But we have to finalize- to finish the job. This is true, but now it's clearly much more that when we are to do- what we have to do. We- we have to step up our support to Ukraine, and we have to provide the way to better resist to the new attacks on Kiev and civilians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What's the delay on the sanctions or tariffs then?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: As soon as possible. If it depends just on me, tomorrow. But it doesn't just depend on me. So I hope, I think we have to react collectively if you want my- my strong view, I think it's very important. I think we all agree we want peace. We all agree the problem is Russia because they don't want peace. So now we have to increase the pressure to convince Russia to come back at the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: As the Trump administration has pointed to the idea that there are billions of dollars sitting in European bank accounts that could be seized, for example. Or that, you know, here you could put more tariffs on China or sanctions on China. Are these valid arguments by the administration, or are these--",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: --Look, regarding the frozen assets we are all very much attached to- to be compliant with international rules. And you cannot seize these assets from the central bank even in such a situation. And I think it's a matter of credibility, and it's very important that our countries remain [inaudible] and do respect the international laws. Because this is our problem everywhere. If we speak about Middle East, if we speak about the situation in Ukraine, when some countries start to disrespect international laws and when we are not sufficiently strong, this is the beginning of a total chaos. So we will respect international law. We are predictable, and we will not do all impossible things with these frozen assets. We already took them as, not as a collateral, but we took this frozen asset, and all the proceeds coming from this frozen asset were used to finance our efforts, part of our effort to Ukraine. This is the first point. As for your second point, it was sorry--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --I asked about the China aspect. That the administration would like you to push back on China more.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Look, I think we will have our own diplomacy on China, and we are very much attached to our independence, which is normal. And we have a de-risking strategy, but we are not in a decoupling strategy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So that's a no on the pressure from the administration to do that?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: My point is, let's focus on some secondary sanctions, if they make sense. I think what we- what we have to do is to engage a serious dialogue in order to see where and in which capacity Russia is helped by third countries, and to increase the pressure. So I think this approach is a good one, but it should be targeted and directly related to Russia. And I think- what I don't think what we- what we will do as Europeans with the US administration, it is working hard in all capacity by capacity, product by product, to see the key countries allowing Russia, sometimes to have a third way and to avoid sanctions or to benefit from the current situation. This is what we call the secondary sanction, because you don't sanction directly Russia, but a third country which is helping them, and this job has to be made, has already started technically. I'm totally in favor of this job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And just a final question here to ask you again about NATO. The US has not contributed fighter jets to that new effort that was just recently announced after the drone incursions. The Supreme Allied Commander is an American, but does that signal something to you? Does that concern you that the United States isn't more muscular here?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: No, I'm not concerned or worried about that. I want to say that the NATO Secretary General worked very hard, and we all gathered and exchanged information with the Polish Prime Minister and the Polish president in the hours right after this, what happened. And for instance, UK and France stepped up and we sent fighters. But it's fine. We were in a situation to do so, and we are totally credible. But at the same time, look at what the US is doing in on the Eastern flank of NATO. You are a very strong contributor and reliable partner. So I don't want to- to diminish this role and your commitment and- and I think your President was very clear about, as well, his commitment to NATO. But I- I'm totally in line with the fact that the Europeans have to step up. I've defended for years the fact that we need more independence, more strategic autonomy in- in Europe, and we need a stronger European pillar. This is why, by the way, right after my first election, I started to increase the budget of our army, and in 10 years, we will have doubled this budget. And- and I am already in favor of having all the Europeans increasing their budget, their defense expenditures, and as well building an actual industry research and development basis for defense and security, working together and building a strong, consistent European pillar in NATO. Because it's fair that the US wants to focus much more on its own security, or wants to work much more on the Pacific side, and asks Europeans to be more engaged and committed for their own security. I share this perspective, and this is one of the priority of the Europeans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. President. Thank you for your time today.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Thank you very much for being here and offering me this opportunity to explain our views. Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you."

    "summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a move to decertify an organ procurement organization and steps to reform the organ donation system.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced on Thursday new action to reform the nation's organ transplant system, as well as a move to decertify an organ procurement organization.",
      "\"Every American should feel safe becoming an organ donor and giving the gift of life, yet decades of ignored patient safety concerns have driven more and more Americans off the donor list,\" Kennedy said. \"Today, under President Trump's leadership, we are taking bold action and historic action to restore trust in the organ procurement process.\"",
      "Transplant experts said last year there had been a\u00a0spike\u00a0in people revoking\u00a0organ donor\u00a0registrations, after a report that a Kentucky man who'd been declared dead woke up just as a team was preparing to remove his organs. Since then, there have been more\u00a0reports\u00a0of attempts to remove organs from patients who had mistakenly been declared dead.",
      "Kennedy said at a news conference that \"we are acting because of years of documented patient safety data failures and repeated violations of federal requirements, and we intend this decision to serve as a clear warning.\"",
      "The secretary said the Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency, a division of the University of Miami Health System, \"has a long record of deficiencies directly tied to patient harm.\"",
      "\"Unlike the Biden administration, which ignored these problems and failed to act, the Trump administration is setting a new standard that patient safety comes first,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Kennedy said along with the decertification, HHS is reforming the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network and \"investing in new ways to encourage organ donation.\"",
      "In July, HHS announced a plan to begin reforming the organ transplant system, citing a federal investigation that \"revealed disturbing practices by a major organ procurement organization.\"",
      "Kennedy said in a statement at the time that the investigation, conducted by the Health Resources and Services Administration under HHS, showed \"that hospitals allowed the organ procurement process to begin when patients showed signs of life,\" calling it \"horrifying\" and pledging to hold accountable organ procurement organizations that coordinate access to transplants.",
      "HHS said the investigation examined 351 cases where organ donation was \"authorized, but ultimately not completed,\" finding that nearly 30% showed \"concerning features,\" like neurological signs in patients that the agency said are incompatible with organ donation. And at least 28 patients \"may not have been deceased at the time organ procurement was initiated.\"",
      "More than 100,000 people are on the national transplant waiting list, and 13 people die every day waiting for a transplant, according to the Health Resources and Services Administration. There are 55 organ procurement organizations nationwide that serve specific geographic regions.",
      "House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith and House Oversight Subcommittee Chairman David Schweikert wrote a\u00a0letter to Life Alliance Organ Recovery Center in July demanding documents about reports that claim the organization \"knowingly and deliberately engaged in a Medicare fraud scheme.\" The letter also cites reporting from The New York Times on a case involving the organization in which, the lawmakers said, \"clinicians sedated a patient, withdrew life support, and waited for death before removing the organs of a patient who was crying and biting on his breathing tube which one Life Alliance employee interpreted as the patient not wanting to die.\"",
      "\"Patient safety lapses have long been a recurring issue for your organization and others like it, reflecting a history of ongoing concerns rather than isolated incidents,\" the chairmen wrote.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency said its top priority \"has always been safe, respectful, and compliant organ donation practices.\"",
      "\"We will cooperate fully with HHS to ensure a smooth transition and will not appeal,\" the organ procurement organization said. \"We hope that other OPOs follow suit in putting patients first. Our focus remains on protecting the dignity of donors, supporting their families, and advancing the life-saving mission of organ transplantation.\"",
      "The Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, of which Life Alliance is a member, pledged in a statement \"that we and our members will keep saving lives nationwide\" and \"will continue to support the team at Life Alliance to ensure South Florida organ donors, transplant patients and their families have access to organ donation and transplantation services.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump announced that he would nominate senior White House aide Lindsey Halligan to serve as the top federal prosecutor for the Virginia office.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Saturday that he would be nominating senior White House aide Lindsey Halligan to serve as the top federal prosecutor for the Virginia office that was thrown into turmoil when its U.S. attorney, Erik Siebert, abruptly left on Friday.",
      "In a social media post just after he departed the White House for an event at Mount Vernon, Mr. Trump wrote he would be\u00a0nominating Halligan as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, writing that she \"will be Fair, Smart, and will provide, desperately needed, JUSTICE FOR ALL!\"",
      "Mr. Trump's selection of Halligan came just hours after another conservative lawyer, Mary \"Maggie\" Cleary, said in an email to staff that was obtained by CBS News that she had been named acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.",
      "\"While this appointment was unexpected, I am humbled to be joining your ranks,\" Cleary told employees in the email. \"The Eastern District of Virginia has a distinguished legacy upon which we will build.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for clarification on whether Cleary or Halligan will be leading the Eastern District of Virginia while Halligan's Senate nomination process plays out.",
      "Halligan has been part of Mr. Trump's legal orbit for the last several years, including serving as one of his attorneys in the early days of the FBI's investigation into Mr. Trump's retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, which President Trump referenced in a follow-up Truth Social post later Saturday evening.",
      "\"Lindsey is a tough, smart, and loyal attorney, who has worked with me for a long time, including in the winning fight against the Weaponization of our Justice System by Crooked Joe Biden and the Radical Left Democrats, which she witnessed firsthand when she stood up for my rights during the Unconstitutional and UnAmerican raid on my home, Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Florida,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "She has more recently been enlisted in a White House effort to remove what the administration contends is \"improper ideology\" from Smithsonian properties.",
      "Siebert\u00a0resigned amid pressure from Trump administration officials to bring criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James in a mortgage fraud investigation. Multiple sources had told CBS News Friday that federal prosecutors for the district were concerned that Siebert could be removed for failing to prosecute James.",
      "Mr. Trump did not push back on those concerns, saying Friday, \"Yeah, I want him out.\"",
      "Halligan would take over an office in tumult over political pressure by administration officials to criminally charge James, a longtime foe of Mr. Trump. In May, multiple sources familiar with the investigation told CBS News that the Justice Department had launched a criminal fraud probe targeting James.",
      "The investigation stems from allegations that James provided false information on mortgage applications to get better loan rates for a home in Virginia.",
      "The Justice Department has spent months conducting the investigation but has yet to bring charges, and there's been no indication that prosecutors have managed to uncover any degree of incriminating evidence necessary to secure an indictment. James' lawyers have vigorously denied any allegations and characterized the investigation as an act of political revenge.",
      "In 2022,\u00a0James sued Mr. Trump\u00a0for years of alleged financial fraud, claiming Mr. Trump and his family participated in a conspiracy to inflate his net worth by billions of dollars in order to secure better loan rates, among other things. A\u00a0judge found them liable\u00a0and ultimately ruled\u00a0Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization must pay $354 million in fines, though the actual total\u00a0recently climbed to above $500 million\u00a0due to interest amid the appeals process. In August, a New York appellate court threw out the half-billion-dollar penalty, ruling that the fine was \"excessive,\" while saying they were divided on the merits of the case.",
      "While Siebert said in an email to colleagues Friday evening that he had submitted his resignation, Trump wrote in a social media post: \"He didn't quit, I fired him!\"",
      "Mr. Trump wrote Saturday that he \"withdrew\" Siebert's nomination for U.S. attorney when he \"was informed\" that Siebert had \"received the UNUSUALLY STRONG support\" of Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner of Virginia. Both senators had expressed support for Siebert's nomination back in May.",
      "\"What is Trump focused on?\" the two senators wrote in a joint statement Friday. \"Threatening to pull anyone who criticizes him on TV off the air. And now, pushing out the interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia that we recommended and he himself nominated because Erik Siebert is an ethical prosecutor who refused to bring criminal charges against Trump's perceived enemies when the facts wouldn't support it.\"",
      "The president reiterated his statement that he fired Siebert in a separate\u00a0Truth Social post Saturday, writing that Siebert \"lied to the media and said he quit, and that we had no case. No, I fired him, and there is a GREAT CASE, and many lawyers, and legal pundits, say so.\"",
      "In that post, Mr. Trump also praised Halligan as a \"really good lawyer.\" A little over one hour later, he had announced that he would be nominating her to lead the Eastern District of Virginia.",
      "Cleary recently rejoined the Justice Department as a senior counsel in the criminal division after working as a prosecutor in the Culpepper Commonwealth's Attorney's Office. She also worked as deputy secretary of public safety in Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin's administration and later served in Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares' office.",
      "Cleary wrote in an article for The Spectator World earlier this year about being wrongly identified in a photo which allegedly placed her on Capitol grounds during the Jan. 6 riot. Cleary, who at the time was working as a federal prosecutor in the Western District of Virginia, wrote: \"Everyone knew I was a conservative. It was all over my resume. I was in leadership in my local Republican Committee. But I had not gone to the Capitol that day.\"",
      "She described being placed on administrative leave and interviewed by agents before later being cleared to return to work.",
      "\"In the last four years, I've been somewhat cautious about sharing my experience, but now, while Donald Trump is president, I feel emboldened to finally tell how, I, too, was targeted politically,\" Cleary wrote.",

    "summary": "The Department of Homeland Security is escalating its clash with so-called sanctuary states, warning multiple states they could face legal action, CBS News has learned.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Department of Homeland Security has escalated its clash with so-called sanctuary states this week, warning California, New York, and Illinois in letters obtained by CBS News that refusal to honor immigration detainers could trigger federal legal action.",
      "In letters dated Sept. 10, Acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons ordered the attorneys general of the three states to declare within two days whether they would comply with \"thousands of ICE detainers\" lodged against individuals in state custody, according to DHS. Immigration detainers are formal requests by ICE asking local jails and prisons to notify the agency before releasing an individual, and to hold them briefly so federal agents can take undocumented migrants into federal custody.",
      "According to DHS, Illinois and New York formally declined to cooperate. California initially did not respond. On Thursday, Lyons sent follow-up letters obtained by CBS News accusing each state of obstructing immigration enforcement and vowing to enlist the Department of Justice in response. Senior DHS officials tell CBS News the department will tap the DOJ to sue states, blocking future federal funding.",
      "In his follow-up letter to Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, Lyons wrote that the state's refusal \"will result in thousands of criminal aliens being released into Illinois communities,\" adding that \"ICE will engage with the U.S. Department of Justice and other federal partners to pursue all appropriate measures against you.\"",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James received a similar warning after two aides to Gov. Kathy Hochul confirmed the state would not expand cooperation, according to DHS.",
      "Lyons wrote in his letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta, \"I take this lack of response to mean that you will continue refusing to honor ICE detainers, resulting in thousands of criminal aliens being released into California communities.\"",
      "The states have largely argued that complying with ICE detainers is voluntary.",
      "The California attorney general's office responded to Lyons in a letter, dated Sept. 20 and obtained by CBS News, that pointed to federal regulations and a court case that found that immigration detainers are requests.",
      "The Illinois attorney general's office referred CBS News to a letter it sent to Lyons on Sept. 12, which also said ICE detainers are \"requests\" and state and local authorities cannot be forced to comply with them. The office also noted that it doesn't oversee pre-trial detention in Illinois, so the office \"rarely, if ever, receives ICE detainers,\" and it can't \"unilaterally override state law\" by forcing local police departments to honor ICE's requests.",
      "\"Responding to an ICE detainer based on erroneous information could subject Illinois law enforcement agencies to liability for ICE's mistakes,\" the letter read. \"And unfortunately, the number of erroneous detentions by ICE continues to grow at an alarming pace.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin wrote, \"These dangerous sanctuary policies, often combined with cashless bail for serious crimes, allow criminal illegal aliens to be released back into American communities \u2014 threatening the American people's lives and wellbeing.\"",
      "A DHS spokesperson tells CBS News that the agency has arrested roughly 400,000 undocumented immigrants since the start of the Trump administration, and 70% of those arrested by ICE have criminal charges or convictions.",
      "Among those released by state authorities include undocumented migrants charged with sex crimes on minors, multiple assaults on police officers with a dangerous weapon, indecent assault and battery, as well as those with drug trafficking and weapons charges, a DHS spokesperson said.",
      "Federal regulation dictates that immigration detainers instruct local jails and prisons to hold someone for up to 48 hours after their scheduled release so ICE can take custody. Historically, federal courts have ruled that these detainers are requests, with some local and state authorities outlawing compliance. Some courts have also found that holding people without a judge's warrant can raise constitutional challenges, citing the Fourth Amendment's protections against unlawful detention.",
      "California, New York, and Illinois have each passed laws limiting compliance with ICE detainers.",
      "California law bars local police from honoring detainers, except for individuals convicted of select serious crimes, while New York law restricts cooperation, requiring judicial warrants rather than administrative detainers to detain undocumented migrants. The New York attorney general's office advises local police departments not to honor ICE detainers unless they are accompanied by warrants issued by judges. Illinois' TRUST Act also prohibits state and local law enforcement from detaining individuals without a judicial warrant.",
      "Supporters of city- and state-level \"sanctuary\" laws typically argue the policies lead to greater trust between local police and residents whose immigration status may make them reluctant to cooperate with law enforcement or report crimes.",
      "But the Trump administration argues \"sanctuary\" policies make it harder for ICE to apprehend undocumented migrants, prompting the federal agency to send more law enforcement agents into American communities to conduct arrests on the streets. Those operations have drawn protests in major cities like New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles in recent months, leading to some clashes with ICE and several arrests.",
      "In recent months, the Justice Department and other agencies have sought to cut off grants to cities and states that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities, drawing lawsuits.",
      "In his warnings to state attorneys general, Lyons underscored that ICE prefers cooperation but will not allow what he calls \"inadvisable and irresponsible obstruction\" to continue, though he fell short of specifying exactly how the Justice Department will pursue lawsuits or other federal action in the coming weeks.",

      "Under the Gold Card program, which Mr. Trump first floated in February, non-Americans who give a gift of at least $1 million to the Commerce Department will be eligible for an \"expedited process\" to gain an immigrant visa, the executive order states. Corporations can sponsor people for Gold Cards if they give the government at least $2 million.",

      "People who are approved for a Gold Card after vetting by the State Department and Department of Homeland Security \u2014 and who pay a $15,000 \"vetting fee\" \u2014 will be considered lawful permanent residents, more commonly known as green-card holders, Lutnick told reporters Friday.

      "\"You can prove exceptional value for the United States of America by contributing $1 million to the United States of America. That's a pretty good expectation that they're highly valuable,\" he said.",

      "Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas sharply criticized the head of the Federal Communications Commission for urging ABC to crack down on the now-benched late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, calling the Trump appointee's comments \"dangerous as hell\" and comparing his move to a mafia shakedown.",
      "ABC, owned by Disney, took \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" off the air indefinitely on Wednesday, two days after Kimmel faced criticism for his comments on conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination. Just hours before the company's decision, FCC Chair Brendan Carr had publicly urged ABC to \"take action\" in response to Kimmel's remarks, saying in an interview: \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way.\"",
      "On his podcast Friday, Cruz called Carr a \"good guy\" but skewered him for his outspoken intervention.",
      "\"I gotta say, that's right out of 'Goodfellas.' That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar, going, 'nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it,'\" the Texas senator said, mimicking a mob boss's accent.",
      "Kimmel had drawn conservatives' ire for saying during his monologue on Monday's show: \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\" Kimmel also mocked President Trump's reaction to the shooting.",
      "Cruz had little sympathy for Kimmel, whom he called \"profoundly unfunny\" and \"bitter and nasty.\" The senator also called the comedian's disappearance from the airwaves a \"fantastic thing\" and argued his show was preempted because he \"flat-out lied\" about Kirk's killing.",
      "But the senator warned that the FCC chair's approach could set a risky precedent.",
      "\"If the government gets in the business of saying, \u2026 'we're going to ban you from the airwaves if you don't say what we like,' that will end up bad for conservatives,\" Cruz said.",
      "\"Let me tell you what will happen: Going down this road, there will come a time when a Democrat wins again, wins the White House,\" he added. \"They will silence us, they will use this power, and they will use it ruthlessly. And that is dangerous.\"",
      "Asked about Cruz's comments Friday, Mr. Trump called Carr a \"courageous person\" and said he disagrees with the senator.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the FCC for comment.",
      "Carr called for action on Kimmel in an interview Wednesday with right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson. The FCC commissioner \u2014 a staunch Trump ally \u2014 called Kimmel's remarks \"some of the sickest conduct possible,\" and suggested it would be appropriate for ABC to suspend Kimmel. He also said the independent companies that own ABC's local affiliates ought to \"push back\" against the network and possibly take Kimmel's show off the air, pointing to FCC rules requiring broadcast TV stations to act in the public interest.",
      "Shortly after Carr's comments on Wednesday, media giants Nexstar and Sinclair Broadcast Group \u2014 which each own dozens of ABC affiliate stations \u2014 announced they would preempt Kimmel's show, condemning Kimmel's remarks about Kirk's assassination.",
      "Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase rival station owner Tegna, which will require FCC approval. A Nexstar spokesperson told CBS News: \"The decision to preempt 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' was made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision.\"",
      "Later Wednesday, an ABC spokesperson said the show will be \"pre-empted indefinitely,\" taking Kimmel off the airwaves nationwide.",
      "The move drew outrage, with the FCC's lone Democratic appointee, Commissioner Anna Gomez, accusing ABC of engaging in a \"shameful show of cowardly corporate capitulation\" that \"has put the foundation of the First Amendment in danger.\"",
      "\"This FCC does not have the authority, the ability, or the constitutional right to police",
      "content or punish broadcasters for speech the government dislikes,\" she said in a statement.",
      "ABC's decision added to a weeklong debate over free speech in the wake of Kirk's death, as conservatives and Trump administration figures have called for consequences against anybody who mocks, celebrates or makes light of the assassination.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has celebrated Kimmel's indefinite departure from the airwaves \u2014 and suggested Thursday that TV networks should \"maybe\" lose their licenses over negative coverage.",
      "\"They'll take a great story and they'll make it bad,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Friday, arguing coverage of him is overwhelmingly negative. \"See, I think that's really illegal, personally.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is ending the Temporary Protected Status of thousands of immigrants from Syria living in the U.S., arguing it is not in America's interest to continue the humanitarian program, the Department of Homeland Security announced Friday.",
      "The department said conditions no longer prevent Syrians from returning to their war-ravaged homeland. Syria faced a bloody civil war for over a decade until dictator Bashar al-Assad was ousted last year. Sectarian violence has continued even after the Assad government was overthrown.",
      "In a statement, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin also cited terrorist activity in Syria as additional grounds to terminate the TPS program.",
      "\"Syria has been a hotbed of terrorism and extremism for nearly two decades, and it is contrary to our national interest to allow Syrians to remain in our country,\" McLaughlin added. \"TPS is meant to be temporary.\"",
      "Syrians who don't have another legal mechanism to remain in the U.S. once their TPS expires in roughly 60 days will be eligible to be arrested and deported by federal immigration officials. The Trump administration on Friday advised Syrians enrolled in the TPS program to self-deport from the U.S. using its CBP Home smartphone app.",
      "Syria's TPS designation dates back to the Obama administration, which in 2012 announced the program in response to the civil war that broke out there the year prior. The designation was extended multiple times, including by the first Trump administration. Government data indicates nearly 4,000 Syrians in the U.S. had TPS protections as of the end of March.",
      "Since its creation by Congress in 1990, TPS has been used by Democratic and Republican administrations to offer a temporary safe haven to foreigners from nations dealing with an armed conflict, environmental disaster or other crises. It allows recipients to work and live in the U.S. legally, but does not directly give them a path to permanent legal status.",
      "The Biden administration expanded TPS eligibility to a record number of migrants from crisis-stricken countries, including many who crossed the U.S. southern border illegally.",
      "The second Trump administration has sought to dismantle most TPS programs, moving to terminate the legal status of hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua and Venezuela. Pro-immigrant advocates have called the effort the largest de-documentation campaign in U.S. history, challenging the terminations in federal courts across the country.",
      "Trump administration officials have argued that TPS designations have been extended for far too long by Democratic administrations, despite the temporary nature of the policy. It has also argued conditions in many of the affected countries have improved or that the programs are magnets for illegal immigration.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/aca-costs-trump-administration-catastrophic-health-insurance-plans/",
    "published": "Wed, 17 Sep 2025 05:00:10 -0400",
    "summary": "Tens of millions of people face sticker shock enrolling in Affordable Care Act insurance for 2026. To save money, the Trump administration wants them to consider less generous coverage.",
    "story": [
      "Trump administration officials, looking at the possible impact of large insurance premium increases for millions of next year's Obamacare customers, want more people to consider plans with less generous benefits and high deductibles.",
      "The agency that oversees the ACA announced early this month that it would expand eligibility for \"catastrophic\" plans sold in Affordable Care Act online marketplaces. The plans require people to spend more than $10,000 a year on deductibles before the policies pay most medical costs but carry lower monthly premiums than other Obamacare policies.",
      "The move reflects growing concern among Republicans about political backlash if Congress doesn't extend larger tax credits put in place during the COVID-19 public health emergency to help consumers pay their premiums. The extra subsidies are set to expire at the end of the year, resulting in an average 75% increase in the amount people pay for coverage, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "A small, bipartisan group of House lawmakers introduced legislation to extend the enhanced COVID-era subsidies for one more year, which would keep them in place through midterm congressional elections in the fall.",
      "But the fate of that legislation is uncertain, with many Republicans opposed to extending the extra tax credits, with a permanent change costing at least $335 billion over 10 years. Without an extension, tax credit amounts would revert to pre-pandemic levels.",
      "\"They spent the last 15 years against the ACA, so a lot will be steadfast, but others are worried about the effect of massively spiked premiums on their constituents,\" noted a Democratic Senate staffer who asked not to be identified because they weren't authorized to speak to the media.",
      "Republicans currently control Congress by slim margins, raising the stakes if voters who lose their ACA tax credits blame them at the ballot box.",
      "Catastrophic plans are a little-known type of Obamacare policy that have previously been limited mainly to people under age 30. While they come with lower monthly premiums than other types of ACA plans, the coverage has higher annual deductibles, which are set at the out-of-pocket maximum for the year: $10,600 for individuals in 2026 or $21,200 for families.",
      "A deductible is the amount patients must spend on health care before insurance plans pay for most services. Catastrophic plans do cover three primary care visits a year without having to pay the full deductible and, as with other ACA policies, policyholders pay nothing for preventive services such as some cancer screenings and vaccines.",
      "The catastrophic plans will automatically show up on the federal marketplace, healthcare.gov, for consumers who lose tax credit coverage entirely next year due to their household income. Another category of consumers \u2014 people who continue to qualify for tax credits but not for subsidies that reduce out-of-pocket costs \u2014 may also be eligible but would have to send in paperwork.",
      "\"By expanding access to catastrophic plans, we are making sure hardworking people who face unexpected hardships can get affordable coverage that protects them from devastating medical costs,\" Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz said in a statement.",
      "It isn't clear whether the policy changes will make the plans more attractive to consumers. Catastrophic plans aren't available in all states, and the size of the deductibles can be off-putting.",
      "\"It's a ton of money,\" said Louise Norris, a health insurance analyst and broker who writes regularly about the ACA. \"A full-price catastrophic plan is still more expensive than some people can afford, but they're doing this to offer a slightly more affordable option.\"",
      "Catastrophic plans have had limited appeal, with only about 54,000 out of Obamacare's 24 million enrollees currently opting for the coverage, according to government data, Norris said.",
      "\"Uptake has always been quite low,\" said Katie Keith, director of the O'Neill Institute's Center for Health Policy and the Law at Georgetown University. \"It's not a bad option if it is the only option you have. I question whether consumers are looking for this kind of coverage.\"",
      "CMS plans to grant people a \"hardship\" designation to enroll in catastrophic plans if they lose eligibility for ACA tax credits next year. Most likely to qualify are people earning more than four times the federal poverty rate ($62,600 for an individual this year, or $106,600 for a family of three), who will lose access to all premium subsidies if Congress does not extend the current enhanced tax credits. It's also unclear how much premiums will cost. Insurers, reacting to the new administration guidance, might seek to recalculate their rates based on what they estimate may be an influx of older people into the plans, Norris said.",
      "AHIP, the insurance industry lobbying group, is pushing hard for the larger tax credits to be extended. It did not comment specifically on how the new guidance might affect catastrophic health plan premiums. Still, AHIP spokesperson Chris Bond said that \"while catastrophic plans can provide important coverage for specific needs, they are not a replacement for affordable comprehensive coverage.\"",
      "There are other hurdles. Norris said insurers don't offer plans at all in 10 states: Alaska, Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, and Wyoming. And where they are available, options are few. This year, for example, a 25-year-old in Orlando, Florida, had a choice of 61 \"bronze\" plans, the cheapest level of coverage available to all ACA shoppers, but just three catastrophic plans.",
      "Policy experts say the expanded eligibility for catastrophic plans makes it more important than ever for consumers to consider all options when shopping for ACA coverage during the annual open enrollment period, which starts Nov. 1. In addition to the catastrophic and bronze plans, there are also \"silver\" and \"gold\" plans, each with varying premiums and deductibles.",
      "Bronze plans have the lowest premiums but the highest deductibles; the average bronze deductible this year is $7,186, which is still lower than the catastrophic plans, according to KFF.",
      "Catastrophic plan deductibles, while high, are comparable to some bronze plans, Norris noted. People who choose catastrophic plans are not eligible for any ACA tax subsidies to help pay monthly premiums.",
      "A pending court battle may provide lawmakers concerned about voter pushback on Obamacare changes an unintended reprieve.",
      "In late August, a federal judge in Maryland temporarily put on hold some changes the Trump administration had ordered for next year. Those changes, included in a June regulatory filing by the administration, would have added additional verification paperwork requirements for some people enrolling in ACA plans, and were challenged by several cities, which cited government estimates that the changes could cause up to 1.8 million people to lose their insurance in 2026.",
      "The court ruling stayed several provisions of the Trump administration rules, including income verification requirements that would affect people below the poverty level and those without tax return information. The move also paused verification requirements affecting people who apply outside the annual open enrollment period and blocked a $5 monthly charge for people who are automatically enrolled into plans in which subsidies cover the entire premium \u2014 unless they contact the marketplace and confirm their selection.",
      "The Trump administration is appealing the decision, but the case may not be settled until next year, said Keith at Georgetown University.",
      "That makes it likely that the pause of the new requirements will stay in place for this year's open enrollment season.",
      "Keith said the ruling was a \"bigger deal\" than expanding eligibility for catastrophic plans. \"Consumers all across the country won't have to deal with red tape the Trump administration rushed to put into place ahead of the new plan year,\" and the ruling also \"helps people keep their coverage.\"",

At least six types of arthropods were found preserved, according to the study.",
      "Almost all known amber deposits from the past 130 million years have been in the Northern Hemisphere, and it's long been \"an enigma\" that scientists have found few in southern regions that once comprised the supercontinent Gondwana, said David Grimaldi, an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History who was not involved in the discovery.",
      "This marks the first time researchers have identified ancient beetles, flies, ants and wasps in fossilized tree resin in South America, said Ricardo P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente, a paleoentomologist at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, who also was not involved in the new study.",
      "\"Amber pieces are little windows into the past,\" P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente said, adding that the discovery will help researchers understand the evolving interactions between flowering plants and insects that lived during the era of the dinosaurs.",
      "The researchers uncovered hundreds of fragments of amber, some containing ancient insects, pollen and tree leaves, at a sandstone quarry in Ecuador that's on the edge of what is today the Amazon basin.",
      "Two types of amber were discovered, according to the study: There was a more common form of amber found around the roots of resin-producing plants, and a rarer form of the material formed from resin exposed to air. The amber formed around the roots did not hold any specimens, the study said.",
      "\"A different kind of forest\"",
      "The discoveries provide evidence that the area was once a \"humid, resinous forest ecosystem,\" according to the study.",

    "story": [
      "In the forests of Uganda and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, chimps crowd into fig and plum trees, feasting on fruit that's sweet, soft and just a little boozy. A new study shows those daily snacks quietly add up to the equivalent of nearly two alcoholic beverages for humans.",
      "A team of scientists at University of California Berkeley and other institutions tested the fruit chimps actually snack on: figs in Uganda's canopy and the plum-like fruits on the forest floor in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Collecting the data wasn't easy \u2014 with little electricity beyond solar panels and constant humidity threatening the instruments, researchers spent three seasons hauling equipment and calibrating test kits to measure alcohol in many different tropical fruits.",
      "In the end, they found that on average, the fruit's alcohol content came in at about .3% by weight. This is kombucha-level, but when chimpanzees eat 10 pounds of fruit a day and weigh around 90 pounds, it adds up to about 14 grams of ethanol, equating to about two cocktails for a human.",
      "But don't picture chimps swinging drunkenly from the trees. To actually get drunk, they'd have to binge on fruit until their bellies ballooned, the researchers said. Instead, they're exposed to a steady low dose, a quiet buzz from nature's own fermentation process.",
      "Senior author of the paper and UC Berkeley professor of integrative biology Robert Dudley first floated the \"drunken monkey\" hypothesis in 2000, arguing that our attraction to alcohol could come from ancestral fruit-eating habits. Dudley argued that it makes sense primates would be tuned to alcohol, since their diets have long revolved around ripe fruit.",

      "Spider monkeys in Panama, slow lorises in Malaysia and even elephants have been documented consuming naturally fermented fruit or nectar.",
      "What makes this study different is that it provides the first direct chemical measurements of ethanol in the fruits that wild chimps routinely eat, and then connects those numbers to daily intake.",
      "The open question is whether chimps are actually selecting fruit for its alcohol content or just chasing sugar and calories. Either way, Dudley says the story connects to us.",
      "\"We inherited the taste for alcohol,\" Dudley said. \"Even though our diets have diversified \u2026 that bias to consume quickly when this molecule is present could still be a powerful force.\"",

      "Scientists have discovered what's thought to be the oldest known mummies in the world in southeastern Asia dating back up to 12,000 years.",
      "Mummification prevents decay by preserving dead bodies. The process can happen naturally in places like the sands of Chile's Atacama Desert or the bogs of Ireland where conditions can fend off decomposition. Humans across various cultures also mummified their ancestors through embalming to honor them or send their souls to the afterlife.",
      "Egypt's mummies may be the most well-known, but until now some of the oldest mummies were prepared by a fishing people called the Chinchorro about 7,000 years ago in what's now Peru and Chile.",

      "Studying the bones further, scientists discovered the bodies were likely exposed to heat. That suggested the bodies had been smoke-dried over a fire and mummified by hunter-gatherer communities in the area.",
      "The practice \"allowed people to sustain physical and spiritual connections with their ancestors, bridging time and memory,\" study author Hirofumi Matsumura with Sapporo Medical University in Japan said in an email.",
      "The results were \"a great surprise,\" said Hsiao-chun Hung, senior research fellow at Australian National University.",
      "\"The bones are so ancient, and it is remarkable to discover that this tradition is so old, connecting the practices of ancient peoples with those still found in some communities today,\" Hung said.",
      "The process allowed relatives to maintain contact with the deceased, and in some cases was believed to allow the spirit to roam freely during the day and return to a body at night.",
      "\"I believe this reflects something deeply human \u2014 the timeless wish that our loved ones might never leave us, but remain by our side forever,\" Hung told Agence France-Presse.",

    "summary": "The capture by the International Space Station's robot arm came a day late because of an unexpected, but now resolved, software issue.",
    "story": [
      "Running a day late because of software issues, Northrop Grumman's Cygnus XL cargo ship caught up with the International Space Station early Thursday and then stood by while the lab's robot arm latched on to a grapple fixture to wrap up a successful, if extended, rendezvous.",
      "The capture came after Northrop Grumman engineers adjusted the sensitivity of the main engine fault detection software that prematurely triggered shutdowns during two rendezvous thruster firings Tuesday.",
      "As it turned out, the main engine was healthy all along and once the software was adjusted, the spacecraft was able to press ahead with the rendezvous, pulling up to a point just below the station so robot arm operator Jonny Kim, assisted by Zena Cardman, could capture the ship.",
      "\"A big congratulations to the NASA and Cygnus teams for a successful Cygnus launch, rendezvous and capture,\" Kim radioed mission control. \"Adapting and overcoming unforeseen challenges is something we do at NASA, and I'm very proud to be a part of this team.\"",
      "Unlike SpaceX's cargo Dragon and Russian Progress freighters, which carry out autonomous dockings at their respective ports, the Cygnus was designed to be captured by the station's arm and pulled in for berthing.",
      "After locking onto the Cygnus XL at 7:24 a.m. EDT, Kim handed off arm operations to flight controllers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston so the ship could be pulled in for berthing at the Earth-facing port of the central Unity module.",
      "Northrop Grumman names its cargo ships after notable figures in the space community. The Cygnus XL was named in honor of shuttle pilot William \"Willie\" McCool, who lost his life in the 2003 Columbia disaster.",
      "Space station astronaut Mike Fincke, a member of the 1996 astronaut class along with McCool, said he was \"a gifted pilot, a devoted crewmate and a man of deep humility, his life continues to inspire us.\"",
      "\"To see a ship bearing his name safely arrive at the station is a reminder that his courage and kindness are still circling our beautiful planet Earth,\" he said.",
      "On board: more than 5 tons of needed spare parts, research material and crew supplies, including holiday treats for the station crew.",
      "\"The (Cygnus) is packed with consumables, like nitrogen, oxygen, food and toilet parts, and it has a large number of spare parts that are required for systems like, for example, our urine processor,\" said Dina Contella, deputy manager of the space station program at the Johnson Space Center.",
      "\"We're stocking up on these items since we were short over the past year, and we'd like to have a good reserve for the future,\" she said.",
      "That shortfall was caused, in part, by damage an earlier Cygnus suffered during shipment from a subcontractor in Europe to Cape Canaveral, Florida. That vehicle is still grounded pending analysis and repairs.",
      "Sunday's launch of the Cygnus XL marked the maiden flight of an upgraded version of the cargo ship, which is about 5 feet longer than the original, allowing it to carry about 2,600 pounds of additional cargo.",
      "NASA pays for cargo delivery flights using Cygnus and Dragon spacecraft. To date, SpaceX has successfully carried out 32 Dragon resupply missions while Northrop Grumman has executed 21 successful flights, including the current mission.",
      "Bill Spetch, operations integration manager for the space station, said the resupply flights \"and especially this great capability that Cygnus brings and the amount of cargo that it brings to us, is critical for us to keep us running smooth and doing the things that we need ... to do the research.\"",

    "story": [
      "Northrop Grumman's Cygnus XL cargo ship, carrying more than 11,000 pounds of equipment and supplies for the International Space Station, is scheduled to rendezvous with the space station Thursday morning, NASA announced Wednesday.",
      "This comes after two premature engine shutdowns Tuesday forced flight controllers to interrupt a carefully planned rendezvous and delay the ship's arrival at the outpost.",
      "On Wednesday evening, NASA announced that the issue had been resolved and the cargo ship was expected to arrive at the space station at 7:18 a.m. Eastern Time Thursday.",
      "\"Data shared by the spacecraft confirmed that Cygnus XL operated as intended during two planned maneuvers when an early warning system initiated a shutdown command and ended the main engine burn because of a conservative safeguard in the software settings,\" NASA explained in a statement.",
      "NASA said that astronaut Jonny Kim, with support from NASA astronaut Zena Cardman, will capture Cygnus XL using the station's Canadarm2 robotic arm.",
      "The Cygnus was launched Sunday from Cape Canaveral atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The cargo ship was released from the booster's upper stage as planned, kicking off a precisely planned sequence of rendezvous rocket firings to catch up with the space station.",
      "Unlike SpaceX's cargo Dragon and Russian Progress freighters, which carry out autonomous dockings at their respective ports, the Cygnus was designed to be captured by the station's robot arm and pulled in for berthing.",
      "The Cygnus XL capture had been planned for Wednesday morning, but was put on hold while engineers work to understand the problem and develop an alternate rendezvous plan.",
      "\"Early Tuesday morning, Cygnus XL's main engine stopped earlier than planned during two burns designed to raise the orbit of the spacecraft for rendezvous with the space station,\" NASA had said in a previous blog post. \"All other Cygnus XL systems are performing normally.\"",
      "A Progress launched last week successfully docked at the station Saturday. The Cygnus XL launch is a long-awaited milestone for Northrop Grumman after an earlier Cygnus was damaged during transit from a subcontractor in Europe to Cape Canaveral. That vehicle is still grounded pending analysis and repairs.",
      "Sunday's launch was the third of at least four SpaceX flights purchased by Northrop Grumman while the company recovers from the transit setback and presses ahead with work to develop a new booster of its own.",
      "And it was the maiden flight of the Cygnus XL, so named because the upgraded cargo ship has been lengthened to carry more cargo to the station per flight.",
      "\"We've been partnering with Northrop Grumman on this update, and we're excited that Northrop is ready to deliver this incredibly beneficial increase in capacity,\" Dina Contella, deputy manager of the space station program for NASA, said before launch. \"It's about 1.6 meters (5 feet) longer and it carries about 2,600 additional pounds more cargo.\"",
      "For its first flight, the XL ship is loaded with more than five-and-a-half tons of needed spare parts, research material and crew supplies, including holiday treats for the station crew.",
      "\"The (Cygnus) is packed with consumables, like nitrogen, oxygen, food and toilet parts, and it has a large number of spare parts that are required for systems like, for example, our urine processor,\" said Contella. \"We're stocking up on these items since we were short over the past year, and we'd like to have a good reserve for the future.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/solar-activity-increasing-after-decades-low-nasa/",
    "published": "Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:20:00 -0400",

    "story": [
      "The sun has become more and more active over the last 16 years, in a turn that surprised scientists and could affect space weather and technology on Earth, NASA announced\u00a0this week.",
      "A new research, conducted by two NASA scientists and published earlier in September in the peer-reviewed\u00a0Astrophysical Journal Letters, shows that solar activity has ramped up after 2008 \u2014 an unexpected reversal following a decades-long decline that was initially thought to foreshadow a period of historic inaction on the surface of the sun.",
      "\"All signs were pointing to the Sun going into a prolonged phase of low activity,\" Jamie Jasinski, a space plasma physicist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the study's lead author, said in a statement. \"So it was a surprise to see that trend reversed. The Sun is slowly waking up.\"",
      "An uptick in solar activity could influence space weather, potentially leading to more solar storms,\u00a0solar flares\u00a0and coronal mass ejections, the researchers found. Space weather patterns have the potential to directly impact spacecraft operations and the safety of astronauts, but\u00a0they may be felt on Earth, too, as space weather can affect power grids, GPS systems and radio communication, according to NASA.",
      "The downward trend was documented from the 1980s until 2008, when the space agency determined that the sun had reached its weakest point on record. The sun's action, or inaction, tends to fluctuate in 11-year cycles, according to NASA, although some patterns draw on longer.",
      "Earth is currently in\u00a0Solar Cycle 25, which began in 2020. The last cycle maintained an average length of 11 years and was the weakest solar cycle to occur in a century, according to the National Weather Service. Scientists thought the sun would stay in what they dubbed \"deep solar minimum,\" believing that the stretch of quietness from the sun would continue, eventually leading to a new phase of record low activity.",
      "\"But then the trend of declining solar wind ended,\" Jasinski said in NASA's announcement.",
      "His study, co-authored by Marco Velli, a fellow researcher at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, instead tracked increasing bursts of solar plasma and stronger magnetic field measurements throughout the solar system, which are all affected by the sun.",
      "Solar Cycle 26 is expected to begin some time between January 2029 and December 2032, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said, but the agency has not yet produced a prediction for the next cycle.",
      "In order to better track space weather, NASA announced that it will launch the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) and\u00a0Carruthers Geocorona Observatory\u00a0missions, as well as the NOAA's\u00a0SWFO-L1\u00a0mission, from Falcon 9 as early as next week. It comes just a few months after\u00a0SpaceX helped NASA launch TRACERS twin satellites which are studying how the electrically-charged solar wind interacts with Earth's magnetic field.",
      "\"Space weather predictions are critical for supporting the spacecraft and astronauts of NASA's Artemis campaign, as understanding the space environment is a vital part of mitigating astronaut exposure to space radiation,\" NASA said Monday.",
      "In May 2024, NASA officials recorded the\u00a0strongest geomagnetic storm in more than 20 years. Several X-class solar flares \u2014 the largest of B-class, followed by C and M \u2014 sent the\u00a0northern lights\u00a0to far lower latitudes than normal,\u00a0as far south as Mexico.",
      "Geomagnetic storms have the ability to impact how and whether technology functions on a massive scale, electrical engineer David Wallace explained in\u00a0The Conversation\u00a0last year.",
      "\"Internet service providers could go down, which in turn would take out the ability of different systems to communicate with each other. High-frequency communication systems such as ground-to-air, shortwave and ship-to-shore radio would be disrupted,\" Wallace wrote.",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Sep 2025 18:20:31 -0400",
    "summary": "TikTok's algorithm is the \"secret sauce\" behind the app's success, experts say. U.S.-China talks over the app's ownership must resolve who controls the technology.",
    "story": [
      "A deal in the works between the U.S. and China over the ownership of TikTok could include a licensing agreement for the closely guarded secret of the social media company's algorithm, to which access has proved a major sticking point in negotiations between the countries.",
      "The Chinese government once vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm, the technology that seems to intuit user preferences almost instantaneously and that has been a driving force for the video-sharing app's explosive growth in recent years.",
      "Previously, TikTok had also seemed unwilling to budge. In May, when the platform was challenging a 2024 law banning TikTok in the U.S., the company said in a legal filing that \"divesting TikTok Inc.'s U.S. business and completely severing it from the globally integrated platform of which it is a part is not commercially, technologically, or legally feasible.\"",
      "President Trump this week\u00a0again pushed back enforcement of the TikTok law, which would require its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market. In the meantime, an agreement between the U.S. and China appears to be moving forward. Mr. Trump on Friday said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping have\u00a0\"made progress\" in talks over a potential deal to resolve the dispute over TikTok's ownership.",
      "Although key elements of the framework deal remain unclear, when some details were released earlier this week, Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, told reporters in Madrid that the arrangement included agreement over \"the use of intellectual property rights,\" according the Associated Press.",
      "William Akoto, an assistant professor at American University, thinks ByteDance executives may be urging the Chinese government to strike a deal so the company can continue earning revenue from the algorithm, while maintaining a foothold in the U.S.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "How would a TikTok licensing deal work?",
      "Mr. Trump, asked Thursday about what will happen with TikTok's algorithm, said, \"TikTok has tremendous value. The United States has that value in its hand since we're the ones that have to approve it.\"",
      "Chinese law\u00a0prohibits the export of TikTok's proprietary algorithm, including to the U.S., without government approval, according to experts. So exactly how a licensing deal would work remains unclear, including whether ByteDance could maintain any sort of outside control over TikTok's algorithm once ownership transfers to U.S. owners.",
      "\"What I understand is they would give a U.S. entity legal permission to use it under certain terms,\" said Sarah Kreps, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization. \"So it would be like they're renting the algorithm rather than selling it.\"",
      "Kreps added that in retaining a measure of ownership over the algorithm, ByteDance could have the right to access internal TikTok metrics and influence how content is ranked in the U.S., akin to how a software vendor can patch or upgrade licensed software.",
      "The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter,\u00a0said\u00a0this week that TikTok would create a new U.S. app and that the company's engineers would re-create content-recommendation algorithms using technology licensed from ByteDance.",
      "A White House spokesperson declined to comment on the contours of the U.S.-China framework deal over TikTok. \"Any details of the TikTok framework are pure speculation unless they are announced by this administration,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "What makes TikTok's algorithm special?",
      "Algorithms are complex data systems that act as recommendation engines, ranking the content users ultimately see in their feeds. They also help companies gather information about their customers in order to serve them targeted advertisements, a key source of revenue.",
      "Like other social media players, TikTok's algorithm delivers content to users based on their interests and interactions on the platform. Lauryn Williams, a deputy director and senior fellow focused on technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, described the algorithm as TikTok's \"secret sauce.\"",
      "Kreps highlights the algorithm's ability to quickly pick up on user behavior, interests and preferences. \"There's something about it that is so well-tailored to what they understand people to want that it gets them on the platform and keeps them there in ways that don't seem to be the case with other platforms,\" she said.",
      "In its own explanation of how it recommends videos, TikTok says it considers a range of factors, such as how long someone stays on a video and personal user information, such as someone's language preference or country of origin. The algorithm then \"selects from a large collection of eligible content and ranks them based on the system's prediction of how likely you'll be interested in each one.\"",
      "A Supreme Court ruling\u00a0from January\u00a0upholding the TikTok ban\u00a0notes\u00a0that each interaction a user has on TikTok \u2014 whether watching a video, following an account or leaving a comment \u2014 enables the recommendation system to \"further tailor a personalized content feed.\"",
      "National security concerns",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on Monday that \"we want to ensure that the Chinese have a fair, invested environment in the United States, but always that U.S. national security comes first,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to CNN.",
      "But while a deal between the U.S. and China could address the ownership dispute, it might not resolve all of the national security concerns that led Congress to pass the TikTok ban with bipartisan support in April of 2024, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Justice Department last year accused TikTok of collecting sensitive data about U.S. users, warning that the Chinese government could use the information to manipulate the content that people see. It also said TikTok employees were able to communicate directly with ByteDance engineers in China via an internal messaging system called Lark.",
      "In 2022, TikTok acknowledged in a letter to U.S. senators that China-based employees could have access to American users' data in certain circumstances and said it was taking steps to strengthen data security.",
      "In its\u00a0decision to uphold the TikTok ban in January, the Supreme Court also noted that China can require TikTok's parent company \"to cooperate with [its] efforts to obtain personal data,\" and that \"there is little to stop all that information from ending up in the hands of a designated foreign adversary.\"",
      "To minimize any national security concerns, Akoto, the American University assistant professor, said the new arrangement would have to ensure that the app's China-based engineers are unable to access the U.S. version of Tiktok. If the algorithm sends user data back to China or if the algorithm can be updated outside of the U.S, that could leave American users' data vulnerable, he said.",
      "When Jingtao, the deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, spoke to the press earlier this week, he indicated the U.S. and China have agreed on entrusting a partner with handling U.S. user data and content security, although its unclear how exactly that would work.",

      "Nvidia said it will spend $5 billion to buy Intel common stock at $23.28 a share. The investment, which is subject to regulatory approvals, comes a month after the U.S. government took a 10% stake in Intel.",
      "\"This historic collaboration tightly couples NVIDIA's AI and accelerated computing stack with Intel's CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem \u2014 a fusion of two world-class platforms,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said. \"Together, we will expand our ecosystems and lay the foundation for the next era of computing.\"",
      "The two companies said they will work on \"seamlessly connecting\" their architectures.",
      "In morning trading, Intel shares jumped 25%, its biggest one-day percentage gain in decades. Nvidia shares added 2%.",
      "For data centers, Intel will make custom chips that Nvidia will use in its AI infrastructure platforms. While for PC products, Intel will build chips that integrate Nvidia technology.",
      "The agreement provides a lifeline for Intel, which was a Silicon Valley pioneer that enjoyed decades of growth as its processors powered the personal computer boom, but fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone's 2007 debut.",
      "Intel fell even farther behind in recent years amid the artificial intelligence boom that's propelled Nvidia into the world's most valuable company. Intel lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, and expects to slash its workforce by a quarter by the end of 2025.",
      "The U.S. government stepped in last month to secure a 10% stake, making it one of Intel's biggest shareholders. Federal officials said they invested in Intel in order to bolster U.S. technology and domestic manufacturing.",

      "Users of the chatbot identified as under the age of 18 will automatically be directed to a version of ChatGPT governed by \"age-appropriate\" content rules, OpenAI said in a\u00a0statement. This under-age edition includes protection policies such as blocking sexual content and \u2014 \"in rare cases of acute distress\" \u2014 law enforcement to ensure a user's safety, according to the company.",
      "\"The way ChatGPT responds to a 15-year-old should look different than the way it responds to an adult,\" the company said in the announcement.",
      "OpenAI also said it is introducing parental controls, such as enabling parents to link their account to their teen's account, manage chat history, set blackout hours and more. The safeguards will be available by the end of September.",
      "The announcement comes just days after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched a probe into the potential negative effects of AI chatbot companions on children and teens. OpenAI said that it's prioritizing \"making ChatGPT helpful and safe for everyone, and we know safety matters above all else when young people are involved.",
      "A spokesperson for OpenAI recently told CBS News that it's prioritizing \"making ChatGPT helpful and safe for everyone.\"",
      "Before the FTC probe, OpenAI indicated that it would introduce\u00a0extra safety protections\u00a0for vulnerable users and teens, after the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine of California, who died by suicide in April, sued the company late last month. Raine's family allege that ChatGPT led their teen to commit suicide.",

      "\"What they should be doing is not targeting ChatGPT to minors until they can prove that it's safe for them,\" Golin said. \"We shouldn't allow companies, just because they have tremendous resources, to perform uncontrolled experiments on kids when the implications for their development can be so vast and far-reaching.\"",
      "California State Senator Steve Padilla, who introduced legislation to create safeguards in the state around AI Chatbots, said in a statement to CBS News, \"We need to create common-sense safeguards that rein in the worst impulses of this emerging technology that even the tech industry doesn't fully understand.\"",

      "The precise structure of the final deal was unclear Monday night, but will include multiple companies, the sources said. It's not clear what level of involvement Chinese firms \u2014 including TikTok's current parent company ByteDance \u2014 will have in the deal, and who will control TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm. Presidents Trump and Xi are expected to talk on Friday.",

      "\"We have a group of very big companies that want to buy it,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And, you know, the kids wanted it so badly. I had parents calling me up. They don't want it for themselves.

      "Last year, Congress passed and then-President Joe Biden signed a bill that essentially gave TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, an ultimatum: either divest from TikTok or face a ban in the U.S. The Supreme Court upheld the law in a unanimous 9-0 decision. But Mr. Trump has issued a series of orders unilaterally delaying its enforcement. The latest came in June, when he pushed back the deadline for enforcing the measure until this Wednesday.",
      "The president's orders have directed the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against tech companies such asApple and Google for failing to comply with the law by offering the TikTok app on their platforms.",
      "The TikTok divestiture law was passed in 2024 after years of bipartisan concern over possible national security risks posed by the ultra-popular video app. Those include worries that the Chinese government could force ByteDance to divulge information on U.S.-based users or manipulate the platform's algorithm to control what Americans see. TikTok has long denied that the Chinese authorities exert any influence on the platform.",
      "The concerns stretch back to Mr. Trump's first term. The president signed an executive order to ban TikTok in the U.S. in 2020 on national security and data privacy grounds, but the move was blocked by a judge. Four years later, Mr. Trump\u00a0 changed his view and expressed support for the app, which he has credited for his improved performance among younger voters in last year's election.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe that these incursions could have been a mistake, as President Trump has suggested?",
      "EMMANUEL MACRON (French President): Very clearly, Russia is a destabilizing and aggressive power in Europe. They increased during the past few weeks the attacks against Kiev and killing a lot of civilians.",
      "They destroyed official buildings of the Ukrainian government, but as well premises of the U.K. government, of the European Union. And, at the same time, during the same weeks, they violated the Polish and the Romanian air.",
      "There is no mistake. There is just a project which is to destroy the maximum territories of Ukraine, to have a victory in Ukraine, and just to highlight what they want, the weakness of NATO.",

      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: No. I'm not saying\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 that Russia did this intentionally.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: I just say this is not totally \u2013 I \u2013 this is not a specific point. If we had a situation where they were declining or decreasing the attacks against Kiev and \u2013 and on the battlefield, I could accept this argument.",
      "My point is to say, it's largely beyond that. My point is to say, look at what they did during the past few weeks. So, I sincerely believe that your president was committed and is committed to make peace in Ukraine.",
      "And he engaged. He took the risk to make a summit with President Putin in Anchorage. And \u2013 and he asked for negotiations. And I think he's right.",
      "But, at the same time, I have to \u2013 just to recognize that there is no clear willingness of President Putin to be sincerely engaged in such a move, because, as we were working on a diplomatic way, as we were trying to organize bilateral, trilateral, quadrilateral summit, the Russians were increasing the assaults in Donbass, but not just in Donbass, intensified provocations on one side and attacks on Kyiv on the other side.",
      "So I just look at the facts, and your president is as well looking at the facts. So, now what do we do? We have to increase sanctions against Russia, but we have to find the way to precisely put more pressure on Russia to bring them back at the table.",
      "In parallel, let me insist on one point. When we came to Washington, D.C., a series of European leaders with President Zelenskyy, we took a commitment. We will work to provide to Ukraine security guarantees. And we delivered. A few days ago here in Paris, we gathered what we call the coalition of the willing.",
      "You have 30 countries working together in order to provide the day-after peace security guarantees to Ukraine. So we have all these elements now with an historical commitment of the Europeans who provide the security guarantees to Ukraine. What we need now is Ukraine to be at the table with Russia and negotiating what the peace agreement could be on territory, on security guarantee, on the escalation, on recovery, et cetera.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't see any evidence of Russian interest? I mean, it's been more than a\u2026",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: So, now we have to step up, and we need political, military and economic surge in order to bring them back at the table and to negotiate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's now more than a month since that Alaska Summit, that big risk you said President Trump took. When he's been asked, so why not put sanctions or secondary tariffs on Russia, he points back here at Europe and the consumption of Russian oil and gas that still takes place.",
      "I know Hungary and Slovakia, for example, continue to use it.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: This is true. And we are fixing it. And we had discussion with Ursula von der Leyen. And she made great work with her teams to fix that.",
      "But let's be honest. This is very marginal. This is not a key driver today. We decreased by more than 80 percent the consumption of oil and gas. And I can tell you, because we were not the most impacted as a country because we were less dependent on this oil, oil and gas coming from Russia.",
      "But we have to finalize, to finish the job. This is true. But now it's clearly much more that when we are to do \u2013 what we have to do. We \u2013 we have to step up our support to Ukraine, and we have to provide the way to better resist to the new attacks on Kiev and civilians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What's the delay on the sanctions or tariffs then?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: As soon as possible. If it depends just on me, tomorrow, but it doesn't just depend on me.",
      "So I hope \u2013 I think we have to react collectively. If you want my \u2013 my strong view, I think it's very important. I think we all agree we want peace. We all agree the problem is Russia, because they don't want peace. So now we have to increase the pressure to convince Russia to come back at the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. has not contributed fighter jets to that new effort that was just recently announced after the drone incursions. The supreme allied commander is an American.",
      "But does that signal something to you, does that concern you that the United States isn't more muscular here?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: No, I'm not concerned or worried about that.",
      "I want to say that the NATO secretary-general worked very hard, and we all gathered and exchanged information with the Polish prime minister and the Polish president in the hours right after this \u2013 what happened. And, for instance, U.K. and France stepped up. And we sent fighters.",
      "But it's fine. We were in a situation to do so, and we are totally credible. But, at the same time, look at what the U.S. is doing in \u2013 on the eastern flank of NATO. You are a very strong contributor and reliable partner. So I don't want to \u2013 to diminish this role and your commitment.",
      "And \u2013 and I think your president was very clear about as well his commitment to NATO. But I'm totally in line with the fact that the Europeans have to step up. I have defended for years the fact that we need more independence, more strategic autonomy in Europe. And we need a stronger European pillar.",

      "He recognized that Syria should be safe, stable and unified. This is in the greatest interest for all countries of the world, not just Syria. I believe the answer is yes. We need to discuss a great many issues and mutual interests between Syria and the USA. We must restore relations in a good and direct way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Many of the officials that I spoke to about you describe you as a pragmatist. Other skeptics say that you change to meet what you need to be in that moment and that's important to understand who you are and the direction you're taking Syria in.",
      "Are you saying that you are just a completely changed man?",
      "PRESIDENT AHMED AL-SHARAA (through translator): I don't entirely agree with the description of pragmatist, because, in Arabic, it has some negative connotations.",
      "The point is, let's look at what's happening now, regardless of what was said in the media. Today, we have really saved the people from the oppression that was being thrust on them by the criminal regime. And we have restored hope for the people who are refugees or internally displaced, so they can return to their homeland.",
      "We supported the people who were bombed with chemical weapons. We also confronted ISIS. We expelled the Iranian militias and Hezbollah from the region. All of these noble acts we took in Syria should have been the role of the international community. But the international community was unable to free a single prisoner or break the siege on a single town where people were starving to death.",
      "The international community failed to deter the regime from using chemical weapons. So I don't believe we should be standing accused at the defense table, but we should be the one asking others, why did you stand silent as these terrible crimes were taking place in Syria?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You believe the world failed Syria and now the world should help rebuild it?",
      "PRESIDENT AHMED AL-SHARAA (through translator): Of course. And I believe the world must not be complicit again in the killing of the Syrian people by slowing down or preventing the lifting of sanctions and preventing them from reconstructing their nation.",

      "GARY COHN (Former Director, White House National Economic Council): Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it finally happened. The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by a quarter-point, which was expected. So, rates are now in this range of 4 to 4.25 percent, lowest level since 2022.",
      "The president had said all this was overdue. What changes now?",
      "GARY COHN: So, look, I think the Fed gave us a lot of important information this last week. As you said, they started down the path of cutting interest rates, going to 4 \u2013 to 4.25.",
      "They also gave us their outlook. So, the 17 governors gave us their projections to where they think interest rates are going. So that plot that they put out shows that, overall, they believe that interest rates will be cut two more times over the course of this year. Now, it's not 100 percent clear because the committee is divided.",
      "There are about seven members of the committee that do not want another cut this year, but there are 10 members of the committee that want at least two more cuts, and one wants more than two cuts. So that averages out to two cuts this year, which would take the federal funds rate \u2013 and it's important to understand it's the federal funds rate \u2013 would take that down to 3.6 percent for the \u2013 for year-end.",
      "Well, what is also important is, the committee was fairly unanimous. I think people were worried about the independence of the Fed. I think the Fed clearly showed themselves to be independent thinkers. They took into account all of the economic data, and they came out with a \u2013 projections that made sense based on what is going on in the economy today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when rates go lower, money gets cheaper to borrow, essentially.",
      "GARY COHN: Well\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what does it actually mean for consumers?",
      "GARY COHN: Yes and no.",
      "So, what the Federal Reserve sets is, they set the federal funds rate. That's the overnight rates that banks charge each other to borrow on a secured basis. It has nothing to do where \u2013 with where American consumers borrow money.",
      "Unfortunately, American consumers borrow money on more of the five-year, the seven-year, the 10-, and the 30-year rates, because that's where automobile loans, credit card loans, student loans, and mortgages are indexed to. Those interest rates are not determined by the Federal Reserve. They're determined by the open market.",
      "Those rates, in fact, after they cut rates earlier this week, went up a little bit. That said, they are down over the last few months, but those rates do not automatically go down when the Federal Reserve cuts rates. They have more to do with the market. And it's a supply-demand situation that determines those rates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, one of the other things the Fed highlighted here is that the labor market is \u2013 quote \u2013 \"really cooling off.\"",
      "That's what Fed Chair Powell says.",

      "So, which is it? What's happening here?",
      "GARY COHN: Well, the chairman went out of his way to talk about the dual mandate that the Fed has. The Fed has two requirements that they're supposed to run interest rate policy off of. One is called stable prices, which means 2 percent inflation. The other is full employment. Full employment is exactly what it sounds like.",
      "The chair said, look, we are going to have to deal with the full employment part of the equation, even though we still have inflation in the system. So the Federal Reserve itself and the Board of Governors admitted that we are having a declining job market. And we see that. The data over the last three or four months, we have gone from creating well over 100,000 jobs a month to creating less than 50,000 jobs a month.",
      "It may be temporary. It may be quite temporary, but the reality is, we have seen the job market degrade. We have also seen companies announce an enormous amount of CapEx and \u2013 capital expenditures that's going to come into the system.",
      "I think it's interesting to take a step back and look at what's going on in the world today. I do think that we have seen companies cut back on the amount of employees they have. When you take companies, and you put them in a very difficult environment, and you increase the cost of input costs \u2013 and inputs have been going up because of tariffs. They have been going up other reasons.",
      "And they're not able to raise prices to the final consumer. The one lever they can pull to make sure they keep their margins intact is, they can cut down on the cost of labor. We came out of a tough situation in COVID, where companies were actually afraid about being able to attract and retain people. So they were hoarding labor.",
      "So we went from a hoarding labor situation to a situation today where companies are being very aggressive about managing their expenses. And the one expense they can manage is the cost of labor. So they're letting their labor force decline naturally as people retire out of the labor system. And we're seeing that in the data.",
      "And I think it's clearly showing up. And the Federal Reserve recognized that in this \u2013 in this week's action.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you ask the administration about this point, they will say, well, productivity is going to increase, and there are these technological shifts that are happening, so this data is distorted.",
      "Are you speaking specifically about tech, or are you saying across the board?",
      "GARY COHN: I'm saying across the board.",
      "I mean, we are \u2013 we have seen across the board. And we see anecdotal evidence of this. I have seen and I have heard it directly from corporate CEOs in every business line that they have gone out of their way to cut their human capital overhead.",
      "So, just the data for Q2 was pretty \u2013 pretty interesting. Corporate revenues rose about 6.3 for Q2, and corporate profits rose close to 12 percent. The way you do that, unless you're raising prices on the consumer \u2013 and we haven't seen a lot of prices go up to the consumer \u2013 is, you have to cut something out of the expense bucket.",
      "The one thing they're cutting is, they're cutting labor costs. We have seen it in the U.S. data. We have seen it in the private data. And we have seen it in the anecdotal data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president signed an executive order on Friday that I want to ask you about, because you have this role at IBM and some insight into tech.",
      "The order is going to impose a $100,000 one-time fee for visas granted to foreign workers, highly skilled workers, H-1B visas. \"The Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that this caused, like, a panic, because there wasn't a lot of detail, at, like, Apple, and Google, and Microsoft.",
      "Did it cause a panic at IBM?",
      "GARY COHN: Well\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean, what's going on?",
      "GARY COHN: The \u2013 the \u2013 I think it caused a panic over the weekend because people weren't sure what was going on with the existing H-1B visas.",
      "It's been cleaned up over the weekend. So, at this point, there's not a panic in the system. Everyone who's got an H-1B visa understands their status and understands how it \u2013 how it's \u2013 how it's going to work. I actually think this is a good idea.",
      "If you understand the H-1B visa program in the United States, historically, it has been a lottery system. So companies have turned in for these visas, and then the U.S. government lotteries them off. If you're now telling a company, look, you need to spend $100,000 to get one of these visas, you're not just going to ask for a visa and put a name in the lottery unless that is a highly skilled person who you need who you cannot hire in the United States.",
      "This visa program is meant for high-skilled labor where you cannot hire that person in the United States. So if that's what it's used for, ultimately, we're going to bring high-skilled people into the United States. It's going to help grow our economy. And that's good for all of us.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this is a reckless decision. That's the word he used. He said, \"it gives Hamas little incentive to actually start diplomacy to release the hostages.\"",
      "Why do you disagree with that sequencing?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: I think probably this is an excessive word, and I disagree with this approach. Why? Because the objective of Hamas is absolutely not to create a Palestinian state. The objective of Hamas is to destroy Israel, to convince a maximum number of people that they have no chance to have peace and stability in precisely a Palestinian state, and \u2013 and to kill the maximum number of Israeli people. And this is why. If we \u2013 we want to stop this war, if we want to isolate Hamas, the recognition process and the peace plan which goes with this recognition process is a pre-condition.",
      "So, my first point is to say, I don't answer (INAUDIBLE). I don't mix the expectations of Hamas. Hamas is just opposite (ph) by destroying Israel. But I recognize the legitimacy of so many Palestinian people who want a state, who are a people, they want a nation, they want a state, and we should not push them toward Hamas. If we don't offer them a political perspective and such a recognition, the unique answer would be security, and they will be completely tapped by Hamas as a unique (ph) option.",
      "My second point is, thanks to the recognition, and thanks to the diplomatic move we launched, we started to isolate Hamas because we, at the New York declaration, which was voted, as you know, by 142 countries, we gathered all of (INAUDIBLE) states, all of the leaders of the regions to work closely with us to precisely dismantle and disarm Hamas. To know that we're not engaging in such a move.",
      "Now, we gathered all these states, all these people who work closely with us in this move. So, I think this is why we can create the condition of a concrete action first to give this right to the Palestinian people, second, to isolate Hamas from the rest of the Palestinians in the whole region and precisely build security.",
      "But let me tell you something which for me very important in this context. Israel had wonderful security results against Hezbollah, Hamas, top leaders, and they managed to \u2013 to \u2013 to neutralize (ph) a lot of top decision makers of (INAUDIBLE). They did it. This is their merit.",
      "But in terms of fighting against Hamas, this is a failure today. They start",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What is a failure?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: Because they \u2013 they killed all of the key leaders. This is a success. But at the beginning of this war, you had more or less 25,000 Hamas fighters. The Israeli army killed probably half of them. But Hamas managed to recruit the equivalent. You have as many fighters as at the very beginning, which is the best evidence of the fact, if we want to dismantle Hamas, the total war is not the answer because it's just killing the credibility of Israel. And, by the way, weakening and killing our own credibility if we don't make a move as the one we are organizing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you just pointed to something that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu would say, well this is why we need to continue until we get rid of every Hamas member. You're saying, you can't kill that idea. You need to provide a different idea?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: Exactly. But this is so \u2013 this is the whole perspective. And look at the situation, not just by the way in Gaza, but everywhere in the region. Hamas was clearly not backed by a lot of people before the 7th of October. If you took the pulse (ph) in Gaza, but in all the countries of the region, they were very low in all the polls (ph). Today, the level of support is much higher because they are making the mistake, in fact, to reduce all of the perspective of the Palestinians to Hamas. What we have to say is, we want the dismantling of Hamas. You had the success. There is no more top leaders. We want to isolate them. We want to \u2013 to bring everybody working with us to dismantle the Hamas, but recognizing this right to have a Palestinian state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: So, a diplomatic challenge. This is just giving another channel and \u2013 and offering a political way in isolating Hamas. So, I think there is no future with the option which would be just, let's kill the maximum number of Hamas people because they just recruit others and others because each time they launch this type of operations, they kill so many civilians that they are just destroying their own reputation and credibility and they are creating an unsustainable framework of security in the whole region.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But since October 7th, popular support in Israeli for a Palestinian state has also declined. Prime Minister Netanyahu has been opposed for a very, very long time. And now he says that, just look at those attacks that day. If you allow for any kind of Palestinian state, it will be a launchpad for terrorism. I mean that is his argument, that this shows you can't allow for the safety and security of Israel if there are two states. Why is he wrong?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: First, I want to \u2013 I want to say that the 7th of October was a total trauma for everybody in \u2013 in our country here because we had so many French people being killed during the 7th of October terrorist attack launched by Hamas. And \u2013 and it was, for us, one of the biggest terrorist attacks against our own fellow citizens. But we \u2013 we did share and we do share the pain and the suffer of the Israeli people and so many families. And for me, the top priority remains the release of hostages.",
      "And I met very regularly families of \u2013 of hostages. And I have to say that what they live is unbearable. And I \u2013 I had the opportunity to met with them. Yeta Hargiz (ph) mother and so many of them. And what they describe is \u2013 is absolutely unbearable.",
      "But I consider that if we want precisely to build a sustainable peace for Israel, it's a \u2013 and for the Israeli people, a political process and the recognition of a Palestinian state, if the state recognizes the right of Israel to leave and defend itself is demilitarized, has security forces with the vetting process by Israel, with obviously a proper governance and reformed governance, and \u2013 and is precisely \u2013 we have a series of reform, which are a part of the process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that that's it, right? You are talking about recognizing the Palestinian Authority, with some governance over the West Bank. Already was working with Israeli Security Forces. But Hamas came to power through the ballot box in the first place.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: Look, it's \u2013 if we are honest, it started (ph) different. And this is why I think \u2013 let's accept the fact that a lot of people have worked very hard to kill the credibility of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza years ago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Uh-uh.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: And Hamas appeared as a \u2013 precisely a sort of alternative option.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Uh-uh.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: But (INAUDIBLE) attacks were launched by Hamas, not by Palestinian Authority. And if we say all those living in Gaza, and all those backing the Palestinian state are de facto parts of Hamas, there is no end to this war, except that you will kill everybody. And this is \u2013 this is terrible.",
      "So, we have to recognize that the Palestinian Authority has to be reformed, the governance is not satisfactory today. We need a new \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The leader is nearly 90 years old.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: You have a new \u2013 we need a new Palestinian Authority. But let's just remark and please notice with me that thanks to the work of mission process (ph) we launched. For the first time for many years, we got 9th of June a series of clear commitments from the Palestinian Authority. They refused him (ph). Now, the \u2013 the reform, a new vice president being elected, a reform of the education program, (INAUDIBLE) of the (INAUDIBLE) program as well with the monitoring by a U.S. (INAUDIBLE).",
      "So, we launched a series \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they denounced the attack. They denounced October 7th.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: And for the very first time there were \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Twenty months later.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: This is true, but for what? Because we made this move.",
      "So, the recognition is the way (INAUDIBLE) to reengage and bring them back and to table. And my point is to say, let's isolate Hamas. And let's focus on the dismantling of Hamas from a military and a political point of view. In order to do so, we have to reengage with those who can be, I would say, a political achievement for the Palestinian people. And this is why the recognition is so important. And if we revert to West Bank, one of the key element which triggered my decision to announce in July the perspective of \u2013 as a recognition for the 22nd of September, is a vote of the Knesset. When the Knesset decided to start the (INAUDIBLE) again, in West Bank, it was the best evidence of the fact that they don't want to \u2013 to fight against Hamas. There is no Hamas in West Bank. They just want to destroy the existing political bodies and the possibility of two states. And I really believe this is a terrible mistake for Israel itself because, in doing so, they just kill any other perspective that (ph) war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. But when you \u2013 I understand the argument you are making, but it has put you at direct odds with the Trump administration, who argue that your decision to make this recognition announcement, along with all these U.N. members, that it, in fact, kills the diplomacy they had underway. They said they were working to get, for example, the tax money from the Israelis to hand back over to the Palestinian Authority. That they were doing practical things on the ground to help Palestinians.",
      "Secretary Rubio said that West Bank division you were talking about with the settlements, he drew a direct line to your recognition. Why do you think they're blaming you for that?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: We \u2013 we \u2013 we are closely coordinated with the U.S. administration when we speak about the ceasefire and the release of hostages. We were always in close coordination with the secretary of state or key \u2013 key \u2013 President Trump's advisers in order to work with Qatar, Egypt and Israel on the release of hostages, a ceasefire.",
      "But your administration is focusing on the day after. And what we propose is a full-fledged plan where we have first the emergency package. So, let's deliver the release of hostages, ceasefire and \u2013 and humanitarian access.",
      "The day we have that, we start the day after. And I think we are very convergent with the work which is being done by \u2013 by your administration. What we want is a de facto governance in Gaza with clearly a sort of transitional administration, including the Palestinian Authority, excluding, clearly, Hamas, but with a vetting process of Israel, and an association of all the neighbors. We have a security package in this \u2013 in this day after approach, which is, let's scale up the training of the policemen and security forces of the Palestinians. And \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who will do that?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: We \u2013 we are already are doing that \u2013 are doing so. Many country (INAUDIBLE). It does exist. But we need to scale up. And in parallel, we proposed, and we worked very closely with the United Kingdom and all the leaders of the region precisely to offer a military, I would say, an international force to be deployed in Gaza with a U.N. mandate, which is a unique framework to be defended, and \u2013 which could be legitimate to assist and \u2013 and back, I would say, this policemen and security forces. And \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know Israel does not trust the United Nations at all.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: No, I \u2013 this is a U.N. framework, but this \u2013 first they would have a vetting process for (INAUDIBLE), and it would involve Jordan, Egypt, and some others \u2013 some others are ready as well to finance. But, obviously, it needs to be made in close coordination with Israel.",
      "And in the second (ph) package of \u2013 is a core element is a dismantling of Hamas. There is no other option. If you want to fix the situation, to disarm Hamas, and precisely to demobilize so many fighters, to organize what we call a DDR (ph) process, which is very familiar to all the experts in this type of situation. And this is in this day after for Gaza, in the security package, as we can organize such a DDR vis-\u2026-vis Hamas and to be sure that Hamas will never be involved in the Golans (ph) but sets \u2013 Hamas will be disarmed, dismantled, with some key people to leave Gaza and some other to be deradicalized and the weapons to be taken.",
      "In order to do so, you need clear security forces here. You need international forces to be here. And, obviously, we have the (INAUDIBLE). On that, I think there is a strong alignment with the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: My point is the recognition and the process we launch with that is the only way to bring with us on this track all the neighbors and key countries in order to deliver such a package. And \u2013 and look at the situation. Today, when Egypt, when so many leaders of the region are not uncomfortable with what is being done, you need to re-engage them. And this is exactly what we are doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: But my point is to see, if we don't have this full package, the day after is impossible because today, de facto, you are accepting the displacement of population in Gaza City. How do you want the day after to be possible if you displace thousands of people?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, exactly on this point. When you say day after, that means when the war ends and some kind of rebuilding happens. What you're talking about with the Trump administration is this idea of having Palestinians leave Gaza, by choice, they say, but some would say that is a step towards ethnic cleansing. In fact, an independent commission set up by the U.S. concluded Israel has a, quote, \"intent to destroy Palestinians in Gaza as defined by the genocide convention.\" Does France agree with that report?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: No, we don't qualify as a genocide who's happening because it is not a political statement. This is judges (ph) or the end \u2013 or the historians to qualify a genocide by a series of evidence and a clear jurisprudence and \u2013 and clear elements.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you reject that report and that finding?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: No, I don't reject the report. This is not my point. My point is, it should not \u2013 it should not be a political debate. What's happening is clearly a lot of civilians are being killed de facto underground, and the project is to displace people. So, I think this is a big mistake. And this is where I try to convince your administration that if we agree on the day after, and we want this de facto authority, this security package, the dismantling of Hamas and the reconstruction (ph), let's work on the \u2013 on the current day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: If you accept de facto, Israel to displace its people, you will never see the day after. And by the way, I look very carefully at all the plans being shared by your administration or shared by experts working for your administration, they always reiterate, let's work and be together for Gazans. It means that they are ready to preserve and protect Palestinian people because Gazans are those who are living in Gaza. But if the precondition of such a plan is to push them out, this is just a craziness. So, we \u2013 we should not be, for the credibility of the United States, for the credibility of France, we cannot be implicitly or explicitly complacent with such a project because such a project, we know it. And by the way, all of the security expert, even in Israel, are very clear on the fact it will be a humanitarian disaster. And this project will kill the possibility of the day after.",
      "So, we have to be very explicit on the fact that attacking civilians just to get a few \u2013 a few terrorists and a few fighters is clearly not acceptable, but displacing people in order just to take a territory, which is not in the hands of \u2013 of \u2013 of Israel, in order to prepare the day after, is not just a tad crazy,, but unacceptable for all of us.",

Your own interior ministry reported anti-Semitic incidents, even at preschools.",
      "Do you accept this criticism as \u2013 as genuine and valid?",

And the matter about anti-Semitism is, for me, one of my top priority. I was the first president in France to adopt a definition of anti-Semitism, making it the equivalent of anti-Zionism (ph).

      "Kirk, the 31-year-old co-founder of Turning Point USA, was shot and killed as he spoke at an event at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10. A 22-year-old suspect has been charged with aggravated murder.",

      "Where did Charlie Kirk's memorial service taking place?",
      "The service was held at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, near Phoenix. The stadium, which is home to the NFL's Arizona Cardinals, can typically seat up to 63,400 people.",
      "Organizers planned\u00a0for tight security, with \"TSA-level screening\" for the crowd.",
      "Federal authorities designated the memorial service as a Special Event Assessment Rating (SEAR) Level 1 event, a senior Department of Homeland Security official said.

      "The president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., also addressed the crowd, as did right-wing media personality and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.",
      "Many of the speakers had extensive personal and professional ties with the slain activist.",
      "Kirk was a stalwart supporter of the president starting during his first campaign in 2016, and he remained allied with Mr. Trump after he left office under a cloud of controversy following the Capitol riot in January 2021. In last year's presidential race, Kirk's Turning Point USA was widely credited with assisting the Trump campaign with grassroots voter mobilization.",
      "Kirk was also close with Donald Trump Jr. and worked closely with the younger Trump as an aide during the 2016 campaign. \"Charlie wasn't just a friend \u2014 he was like a little brother to me,\" Donald Trump Jr. wrote on X.",
      "Vance has credited Kirk with introducing him to Donald Trump Jr. ahead of his 2022 Senate campaign, and with advocating \"in public and private\" for the president to choose Vance as his running mate last year. Kirk's body was flown from Utah to Arizona on Vance's jet, Air Force Two.",

      "He was a ubiquitous presence in politics: He hosted a daily talk radio show and podcast, and he visited scores of college campuses every year, where he was known for hosting rapid-fire debates with left-leaning students.",
      "Kirk frequently drew controversy for his views. He supported Mr. Trump's false claims of voter fraud after the 2020 election, and his group maintained a \"Professor Watchlist\" of college instructors accused of spreading \"leftist propaganda.\"",
      "Turning Point USA says it has chapters at thousands of high schools and colleges, and the group's political arm, Turning Point Action, engages in grassroots canvassing.",
      "Kirk was also a family man with two young children",

    "summary": "Gary Cohn, IBM vice chair and director of the National Economic Council in the first Trump term, said for companies in a \"very difficult environment,\" cutting down on the cost of labor is \"the one lever they can pull.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Gary Cohn, IBM vice chair and former National Economic Council director in President Trump's first term, said Sunday that \"we've seen the job market degrade,\" though he noted that it may be \"temporary.\"",
      "\"The Federal Reserve itself and the board of governors admitted that we are having a declining job market. And we see that,\" Cohn said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Last week, the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, in the first rate cut since December, amid slower economic growth and a stalling labor market. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has a dual mandate to ensure that both inflation and unemployment remain low, said \"what's different now is that you see a very different picture of the risks to the labor market.\" And though Powell noted that he didn't want to put \"too much emphasis on payroll job creation,\" he said \"it's just one of the things that suggests that the labor market is really cooling off.\"",
      "\"That tells you that it's time to take that into account,\" Powell said.",
      "Meanwhile the jobs numbers, which have shown an ongoing slowdown in the labor market, have been under scrutiny in recent weeks, as the administration has questioned the validity of the government data. Last month, President Trump fired former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after a disappointing July jobs report.",
      "Cohn pointed to job data on Sunday, saying, \"over the last three or four months, we have gone from creating well over 100,000 jobs a month to creating less than 50,000 jobs a month.\" And he noted that \"I do think that we have seen companies cut back on the amount of employees they have.\"",
      "The IBM vice chair outlined that when companies are put in a \"very difficult environment,\" with input costs going up due to tariffs and other reasons, and they're unable to raise prices on consumers, \"the one lever they can pull to make sure they keep their margins intact is they can cut down on the cost of labor.\"",
      "\"We came out of a tough situation in COVID where companies were actually afraid about being able to attract and retain people, so they were hoarding labor,\" Cohn said. \"So we went from a hoarding labor situation to a situation today where companies are being very aggressive about managing their expenses, and the one expense they can manage is the cost of labor.\"",
      "Cohn said companies are now \"letting their labor force decline naturally as people retire out of the labor system.\" He said in the data, \"I think it's clearly showing up, and the Federal Reserve recognized that in this week's action.\"",
      "Cohn said he didn't think this change is specific to tech, but \"across the board.\" He noted that he's \"heard it directly from corporate CEOs in every business line that they have gone out of their way to cut their human capital overhead.\"",
      "On the rate cut more broadly, Cohn said \"the Fed gave us a lot of important information this last week,\" pointing to the rate cut, along with Fed officials providing their outlook, with projections of where they think interest rates are going. And he also noted that \"what is also important is the committee was fairly unanimous,\" acknowledging concerns about the independence of the Fed that have come to a head in recent weeks.",
      "\"I think the Fed clearly showed themselves to be independent thinkers,\" he said. \"They took into account all of the economic data, and they came out with a projection that made sense based on what is going on in the economy today.\"",

      "At Rosh Hashanah, we count the years since God created the world, this year being the year 5,786 (give or take a few billion years!).",
      "While this is a season of joy and community gathering, the New Year also begins a season of atonement, where we take an accounting of who we are, and how we can do better. We believe that, with repentance, people \u2013 and societies \u2013 can change.",
      "This idea of taking stock as we approach a New Year may sound familiar. Many Americans make New Year's resolutions on January 1: Resolving to learn a new skill, lose 15 pounds, or call their mother more often.",
      "This examination happens on Rosh Hashanah, too, but magnified. Jews come together and reflect for hours in synagogue, literally beating our chests as we read through a scripted litany of ways we have fallen short: For spreading lies or hateful speech; for acting callously towards others; for selfishness and greed. The list goes on.",
      "But importantly, we don't confess individually. We do it communally. We take responsibility for one another, and hold each other accountable.",
      "Sounds like it could be an unpleasant way to celebrate a New Year! But it's a fundamentally hopeful message: There is joy in knowing we can change.",
      "This repentance in Hebrew is called Teshuvah, which literally means \"return.\" What are we returning to?",
      "To our better selves. To who we know we can be, as human beings, and as a society.",
      "Imagine if we, as a country, could make teshuvah together? Not pointing fingers to the other side, saying,\u00a0You're the problem. But collectively:",
      "We have ignored the vulnerable. We have normalized mass violence. We have celebrated the death of opponents. We have rewarded outrage over understanding. We have forgotten how to grieve, and how to hope together.",

      "Food prices grew by half a percent from July to August, marking the fastest monthly rate of change since the fall of 2022. Behind the rising cost of food items on store shelves are three main culprits, according to experts.",
      "The Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs, climate change and a shortage of agricultural workers in the U.S. are the leading causes of grocery inflation, Phil Lempert, a food industry analyst also known as the \"Supermarket Guru,\" told CBS News correspondent Jo Ling Kent.",
      "Price hikes, he added, have been steepest on goods that the U.S. imports from nations facing higher levies. For example, the U.S. imports about 35% of its coffee from Brazil, whose exports are taxed at a rate of 50%.",
      "The latest Consumer Price Index data shows that coffee prices rose 21% in August compared with a year ago.",
      "As companies see their costs rise, they pass along those burdens to consumers. In the case of tariffs, some businesses began raising prices on products even before the levies were in full force.",
      "\"There's no question that what we've seen is, we're seeing companies increased prices because of the impending tariffs,\" said Lempert.",
      "\"What they want to do is they want to protect themselves. A lot of these big food companies are public companies. So what they've gotta do is they've gotta report back to their shareholders on profit margins. So they've been hedging their bets,\" Lempert said.",
      "Sometimes, packaged-goods companies disguise price hikes by offering consumers less product for the same amount of money. The covert inflation strategy has been dubbed \"shrinkflation,\" Lempert explained.",
      "\"What they're doing is they're trying to put less in the package, hoping that you and I are not gonna observe that and keep that price either stable or just slightly increased,\" he said",
      "Climate change",
      "Increasing temperatures and\u00a0shifts in weather patterns have made conditions for growing some fruits and vegetables in the U.S. inhospitable. As a result, a lot of domestic production has been moved to Central and Latin America, according to Lempert.",

      "Labor shortage",
      "Additionally, Mr. Trump's immigration policies, including raids on workplaces that employ large numbers of immigrants, plus waning interest in agricultural work, have led to an industrywide labor shortage, Lempert explained.",

      "Lempert said a little planning can go a long way to ensure that consumers can buy what they need.",
      "\"The number one thing that people want to do if they want to save money \u2014 stop wasting food,\" Lempert said.",

      "Syrians who don't have another legal mechanism to remain in the U.S. once their TPS expires in roughly 60 days will be eligible to be arrested and deported by federal immigration officials. The Trump administration on Friday advised Syrians enrolled in the TPS program to self-deport from the U.S. using its CBP Home smartphone app.",
      "Syria's TPS designation dates back to the Obama administration, which in 2012 announced the program in response to the civil war that broke out there the year prior. The designation was extended multiple times, including by the first Trump administration. Government data indicates nearly 4,000 Syrians in the U.S. had TPS protections as of the end of March.",
      "Since its creation by Congress in 1990, TPS has been used by Democratic and Republican administrations to offer a temporary safe haven to foreigners from nations dealing with an armed conflict, environmental disaster or other crises. It allows recipients to work and live in the U.S. legally, but does not directly give them a path to permanent legal status.",

Pro-immigrant advocates have called the effort the largest de-documentation campaign in U.S. history, challenging the terminations in federal courts across the country.",

And this is why, if we want to stop this war, if we want to isolate Hamas, the recognition process and the peace plan which goes with this recognition process is a precondition.\"",
      "Critics, including the U.S. and the Israeli government, which has shown no interest in a two-state solution, have condemned the plans, saying it rewards Hamas for its attack on Oct. 7, 2023. As well as arguing that recognition is immoral, critics argue that it's an empty gesture given that the Palestinian people are divided into two territories \u2014 the West Bank and Gaza \u2014 with no recognized international capital.",

Forty-eight hostages remain in Gaza, with many released through ceasefires or other agreements. Israel believes about 20 are still alive, though the bodies of two hostages were recovered during a joint operation in late August.",

    "summary": "In an interview with CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" the French president pushed back on criticism for recognizing a Palestinian state.",
    "story": [
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said it was out of line for Charles Kushner, the U.S. ambassador to France and the father of President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, to publicly accuse him of taking insufficient action to combat antisemitism, and for him to link France's foreign policy positions to domestic incidents of violence against Jews in France.",
      "In a letter he published in the Wall Street Journal to Macron in August, Kushner wrote that he had \"deep concern over the dramatic rise of antisemitism in France and the lack of sufficient action by your government to confront it.\"",
      "\"Public statements haranguing Israel and gestures toward recognition of a Palestinian state embolden extremists, fuel violence, and endanger Jewish life in France,\" he wrote, urging Macron to \"enforce hate-crime laws without exception; ensure the safety of Jewish schools, synagogues and businesses, prosecute offenders to the fullest extent; and abandon steps that give legitimacy to Hamas and its allies.\"",
      "In an interview with \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan on Thursday in Paris, Macron called Kushner's criticism a \"mistake\" and an \"unacceptable statement for somebody who is supposed to be a diplomat.\"",
      "\"This is unacceptable,\" he said.",
      "Macron said a French ambassador would never be allowed to make similar public remarks about another country because it would risk diplomacy with those nations.",
      "\"So either you are a person who wants to express freely,\" Macron said. \"If you are a diplomat, you have to follow the rule of diplomacy. \u2026 The [American] taxpayer money is not properly used to finance this kind of statement.\"",
      "France's foreign ministry summoned the ambassador last month in a formal rebuke. The French ministry said Kushner's claims \"run counter to international law,\" citing the \"obligation not to interfere in the internal affairs of states\" in the 1961 Vienna Convention of Diplomatic Relations.",
      "Kushner also wrote that \"anti-Zionism is antisemitism \u2014 plain and simple.\"",
      "The State Department said at the time in a statement to the Associated Press, that Kushner \"is our U.S. government representative in France and is doing a great job advancing our national interests in that role.\"",
      "Macron acknowledged that at times people who criticize the state of Israel and its government may be motivated by hate of Jews, but rejected the idea that any of his criticism of the policies of the Netanyahu government is inherently anti-semitic.",
      "He told Brennan, \"I was the first president in France to adopt the definition of antisemitism, making it the equivalent of anti-Zionism.\"",
      "Macron firmly rejected the notion that his objections to the killing in Gaza or his call for the creation of a Palestinian state is inherently antisemitic or puts at risk French Jews. He argued \"it doesn't mean that you are not allowed to be in disagreement with the government of Israel.\" Disagreeing with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"doesn't make me an antisemitic,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu currently leads the most right- wing government in Israeli history, opposes the creation of a Palestinian state, and has waged a nearly two- year- long war in Gaza that succeeded in killing the Hamas leaders who carried out the bloody October 7th terrorist attack that killed 1200 of his people. The war since that time has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, and his policies including a blockade of humanitarian aid has led to famine in Gaza.",
      "Hamas still operates in Gaza, and Macron said Hamas continues to be able to recruit more fighters despite Israel killing the top echelons of the terror group. The failure to eliminate support for Hamas via military force is proof, Macron argues, that support is needed for an alternate government in the form of the Palestinian Authority.",
      "Netanyahu accused Macron of fueling antisemitism after the French president announced France would recognize Palestinian statehood this Monday at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.",
      "The high-level gathering of world leaders and their representatives, and other countries, including the U.K., Australia and Canada, also plan to join France in recognizing Palestinian statehood. The majority of the world's countries - 147 UN members - recognize the right of Palestinians to self-determination but the decision by Western powers including UN Security Council member France and UK is symbolically significant. It is also a sign of the increased isolation of the current Israeli government, which has refused to end the nearly two year war in Gaza.",
      "The plan developed by France and Saudi Arabia involves several phases, including a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, Hamas releasing the remaining hostages it's held since its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel and the restoration of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Those conditions would have to be met before France opens an embassy there, Macron said. The second phase involves Gaza's reconstruction and governance and the third phase focuses on a two-state solution.",
      "Macron succeeded in getting Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas, the 90-year-old leader who governs the Occupied West Bank, to publicly denounce Hamas and agree to reform the Authority and hold elections.",
      "\"Recognizing the Palestinian state today is the only way to provide a political solution to a situation which has to stop,\" Macron said.",
      "The position puts France in direct conflict with the Trump administration, which blocked Palestinian Authority members from obtaining visas to attend the diplomatic gathering. Despite President Trump's statements that starvation is happening in Gaza and Israel should end its war there, Netanyahu has brushed off any American urging to do so. Recently Trump said he 'wasn't thrilled' with Netanyahu's decision to bomb US ally Qatar while Hamas members were meeting to discuss a US proposal to end the Gaza war.",
      "The current U.S. administration also appears to oppose the creation of a Palestinian State, with Trump supporting a proposal to remove Gazans and send them to other countries. The U.S. remains a staunch supporter of Israel, as well as its main weapons provider.",

      "GARY COHN: So, look, I think the Fed gave us a lot of important information this last week. As you said, they started down the path of cutting interest rates, going to four to four and a quarter.\u00a0 They also gave us their outlook. So the 17 governors gave us their projections to where they think interest rates are going. So that plot that they put out shows that overall, they believe that interest rates will be cut two more times over the course of this year. Now it's not 100% clear, because the committee is divided. There are about seven members of the committee that do not want another cut this year, but there are 10 members of the committee that want at least two more cuts, and one wants more than two cuts. So that averages out to two cuts this year, which would take the federal funds rate, and it's important to understand the federal funds rate, would take that down to 3.6% for the- for year end. What is also important is the committee was fairly unanimous. I think people were worried about the independence of the Fed. I think the Fed clearly showed themselves to be independent thinkers. They took into account all of the economic data, and they came out with a projections that made sense based on what is going on in the economy today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when rates go lower, money gets cheaper to borrow, essentially. But what does it actually mean?",
      "GARY COHN: Yes and no. So, what the Federal Reserve sets is they set the federal funds rate. That's the overnight rates the banks charge each other to borrow on a secured basis. It has nothing to do where- with where American consumers borrow money. Unfortunately, American consumers borrow money on more of the five year, the seven year, the ten and the thirty year rates, because that's where automobile loans, credit card loans, student loans and mortgages are indexed to those. Interest rates are not determined by the Federal Reserve. They're determined by the open market. Those rates, in fact, after they cut rates earlier this week, went up a little bit that said they are down over the last few months. But those rates do not automatically go down when the Federal Reserve cuts rates. They have more to do with the market, and it's a supply demand situation that determines those rates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So one of the other things the Fed highlighted here is that the labor market is, quote, \"really cooling off.\" That's what Fed Chair Powell says.",
      "GARY COHN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The administration, the Treasury secretary, says, data's bad. They're not seeing that in the jobs numbers. So which is it? What's happening here?",
      "GARY COHN: Well, look, the chairman went out of his way to talk about the dual mandate that the Fed has. The Fed has two requirements that they're supposed to run interest rate policy off of, one is called stable prices, which means 2% inflation. The other is full employment. Full employment is exactly what it sounds like. The Chair said, look, we are going to have to deal with the full employment part of the equation, even though we still have inflation in the system. So, the Federal Reserve itself and the Board of Governors admitted that we are having a declining job market, and we see that, the data over the last three or four months, we have gone from creating well over 100,000 jobs a month to creating less than 50,000 jobs a month. It may be temporary, it may be quite temporary, but the reality is, we have seen the job market degrade. We've also seen companies announce an enormous amount of CapEx and capital expenditures that's going to come into the system. I think it's interesting to take a step back and look at what's going on in the world today. I do think that we have seen companies cut back on the amount of employees they have. You know, when you take companies and you put them in a very difficult environment and you increase the cost of input costs. And inputs have been going up because of tariffs. They've been going up be- other reasons, and they're not able to raise prices to the final consumer. The one lever they can pull to make sure they keep their margins intact is they can cut down on the cost of labor. We came out of a tough situation in COVID where companies were actually afraid about being able to attract and retain people, so they were hoarding labor. So we went from a hoarding labor situation to a situation today where companies are being very aggressive about managing their expenses, and the one expense they can manage is the cost of labor. So they're letting their labor force decline naturally as people retire out of the labor system, and we're seeing that in the data, and I think it's clearly showing up.And the Federal Reserve. Recognize that in this in this week's action,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you ask the administration about this point, let's say, well, productivity is going to increase, and there are these technological shifts that are happening. So this data is distorted. Are you-, speaking specifically about tech, or are you saying across the board?",
      "GARY COHN: I'm saying across the board. I mean, we are-- we have seen across the board, and we've seen anecdotal evidence of this. I've seen, and I've heard it directly from corporate CEOs in every business line that they have gone out of their way to cut their- their human capital overhead. So just the data for Q2 is pretty, pretty interesting. Corporate revenues rose about 6.3% for Q2 and corporate profits rose close to 12%. The way you do that, unless you're raising prices of the consumer, and we, and we haven't seen a lot of prices go up to consumer, is you have to cut something out of the expense bucket. The one thing they're cutting is they're cutting labor costs. We've seen it in the U.S. data. We've seen it in the private data, and we've seen it in the anecdotal data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the president signed an executive order on Friday that I want to ask you about, because you have this role at IBM, and some insight into tech. The order is going to impose a $100,000 one-time fee for visas granted to foreign workers, highly skilled workers, H-1B visas. The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that this caused, like, a panic, because there wasn't a lot of detail, at, like, Apple, and Google, and Microsoft. Did it cause a panic at IBM? I mean, what's going on?",
      "GARY COHN: The- the- I think it caused a panic over the weekend because people weren't sure what was going on with the existing H-1B visas. It's been cleaned up over the weekend, so at- at this point, there's not a panic in the system. Everyone who's got an H-1B visa understands their status and understands how it- how it's- how it's going to work. I actually think this is a good idea. If you understand the H-1B visa program in the United States, historically, it has been a lottery system. So companies have turned in for these visas, and then the U.S. government lotteries them off. If you're now telling a company, look, you need to spend $100,000 to get one of these visas, you're not just going to ask for a- a visa and put a name in the lottery, unless that is a highly skilled person who you need, who you cannot hire in the United States. This visa program is meant for high skilled labor, where you cannot hire that person in the United States. So if that's what it's used for, ultimately we're going to bring high skilled people in the United States. It's going to help grow our economy, and that's good for all of us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll see. Gary Cohn, thank you for your insights, as always. We'll be right back."

      "The following is the full transcript of an interview with French President Emmanuel Macron, a portion of which aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 21, 2025.",
      "The interview was taped on Thursday, September 18 at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in Paris. See previously released clips\u00a0here\u00a0and\u00a0here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, Mr. President, if you're ready, we'll dive right in.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for having us here. You know, most countries in the world recognize Palestinian statehood. It's 147 of 193 countries at the UN, but France is going to be the first western UN Security Council member to do so. What conditions are there for this?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Look, thank you, and thank you for being here and offering me the opportunity to have such a discussion. I think it was a necessity first to decide this recognition, and I will announce it on the 22nd of September at the United Nations, precisely because we are at the very moment where if we want peace and security for all in the region, we have to preserve the condition of a political perspective for everybody. So we will announce the recognition, but which is the beginning of a political process and a peace and security plan for everybody. So right after this- this recognition, we have a first phase, which is, I would say, the emergency phase, ceasefire, release of all hostages..and third, restoring the humanitarian roads and the stabilization of Gaza. We have a second package, which is the day after we will revert on that how to organize Gaza in terms of governance, security and reconstruction. And third package, the perspective of the two states.\u00a0 But recognizing the Palestinian state today is the only way to provide a political solution to a situation which has to stop.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you are not making the release of the hostages a condition before recognition--",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: \u00a0So this is a clear condition before we will open an embassy. This is the first series of conditions and requirements we will push-\u00a0 we will put in the peace process. But we will announce the 22nd this recognition of Palestinian state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this is a 'reckless decision.' That's the word he used. He said it gives Hamas little incentive to actually start diplomacy to release the hostages. Why do you disagree with that sequencing?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: So my first point is to say, I don't answer the Hamas with that. I don't meet the expectations of Hamas. Hamas is just obsessed by destroying Israel, but I recognize the legitimacy of so many Palestinian people who want a state, who are a people. They want a nation, they want a state, and we should not push them towards Hamas. If we don't offer them a political perspective and such a recognition, the unique answer will be security, and they will be completely trapped by Hamas as a unique option. My second point is, thanks to this recognition, and thanks to the diplomatic move we launched, we started to isolate Hamas because we- at the New York declaration, which was voted, as you know, by 142 countries. We gathered all the Arab League states, all the leaders of the regions, to work closely with us to precisely dismantle and disarm Hamas. Till now, they were not engaged in such a move. Now we gathered all these states, all these people to work closely with us in this move. So I think this is why we can create the condition of a concrete action, first, to give this right to the Palestinian people, second, to isolate Hamas from the rest of the Palestinians and the whole region, and precisely build security. But let me tell you something which is, for me, very important in this context, Israel had wonderful security results against Hezbollah Hamas top leaders, and managed to- to neutralize a lot of top decision makers of terrorist groups. They did it. This is their merit. But in terms of fighting against Hamas, this is a failure of today. They started--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What is a failure?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: --Because they- they killed all the key leaders- this is a success. But at the beginning of this war, you had more or less 25,000 Hamas fighters. The Israeli army killed probably half of them, but Hamas managed to recruit the equivalent. You have as many fighters at the very beginning, which is the best evidence of the fact, if we want to dismantle Hamas, the total war is not the answer, because it's just killing the credibility of Israel- and by the way, weakening and killing our own credibility if we don't make a move as the one we are organizing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you just pointed to something that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu would say, well, this is why we need to continue until we get rid of every Hamas member. You're saying you can't kill that idea, you need to provide a different idea?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Exactly. But this is so- this is the whole perspective. And look at the situation, not just by the war in Gaza, but everywhere in the region. Hamas was clearly not backed by a lot of people before the seventh of October. If you took the polls in Gaza, but in all the countries of the region, they were very low in all the polls. Today, the level of support is much higher, because they are making the mistake, in fact, to reduce all the perspective of the Palestinians to the Hamas. What we have to say is we want the dismantling of Hamas. You had this success, there is no more top leaders. We want to isolate them. We want to bring everybody working with us to dismantle the Hamas. But recognizing this right to have a Palestinian state through a diplomatic channel, this just giving another channel and offering a political way and isolating Hamas. So, I think there is no future with the option, which would be just, let's kill the maximum number of Hamas people, because they just recruit others and others. Because each time they launch this type of operation, they kill so many civilians that they are just destroying their own reputation and credibility, and they are creating an unsustainable framework of security in the whole region.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, since October 7th, popular support in Israel for a Palestinian state has also declined. Prime Minister Netanyahu has been opposed for a very, very long time, and now he says that just look at those attacks that day. If you allow for any kind of Palestinian state, it will be a launch-pad for terrorism. I mean, that is his argument, that this shows you can't allow for the safety and security of Israel if there are two states. Why is he wrong?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: First, I want to- I want to say that the seventh of October was a total trauma for everybody in our country here, because we had so many French people being killed during the seventh of October terrorist attack launched by Hamas. And- and it was, for us, one of the biggest terrorist attack against our own fellow citizen. But we- we did share, and we do share, the pain and the suffer of Israeli people and so many families. And for me, the top priority remains the release of hostages. And I met very regularly families of hostages, and I have to say that what they live is unbearable. And I had the opportunity meet with (unintel) Guy's mother and so many of them, and what they describe is absolutely unbearable. But, I consider that if we want precisely to build a sustainable peace for Israel itself and for Israeli people, a political process and the recognition of a Palestinian state, if the state recognizes the right of Israel to live and defend itself, is demilitarized, has security forces with the vetting process by Israel, with, obviously, a proper governance and reform governance and- and is precisely we have a series of reform which are part of the process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's it, right? You are talking about recognizing the Palestinian Authority, which has some governance over the West Bank, already was working with Israeli security forces. But Hamas came to power through the ballot box in the first place.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Look, it's- if we are honest, it's totally different. And this is why I think- let's accept the fact that a lot of people worked very hard to kill the credibility of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza years ago, and Hamas appeared as precisely as sort of an alternative option. But, terrorist attacks were launched by Hamas, not by Palestinian Authority. And if we say all those living in Gaza, and all those backing the Palestinian state are de-facto the support of Hamas, there is no end to this war except the you kill everybody. And this is this is terrible. So we have to recognize that the Palestinian Authority has to be reformed. The governance is not satisfactory today. We need a new- you have a new- we need a new Palestinian Authority. But, let's just remark, and, please notice with me, that thanks to the recognition process we launched, for the first time for many years, we got, the ninth of June, a series of clear commitments from the Palestinian Authority. They refused till now. The reform; a new vice president being elected, reform of the education program, a pay forcely, obviously, program as well, with the monitoring by a US audit structure. So we don't just theories --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they denounced October 7th--",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: -- And for the very first time --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --20 months later.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: This is true. But for what? Because we made this move. So the recognition is the way as well to re engage and bring them back in the table. And my point is to say, let's isolate Hamas, and let's focus on the dismantling of Hamas from a military and a political point of view. In order to do so, we have to re-engage with those who can be, I would say, a political achievement for Palestinian people. And this is why the recognition is so important. And if we revert to West Bank, one of the key elements which triggered my decision to announce in July, the perspective of the recognition for the 22nd of September is a vote of the Knesset. When the Knesset decided to start the settlements again in West Bank, it was the best evidence of the fact that they don't want to fight against Hamas. There is no Hamas in West Bank. They just want to destroy the existing political bodies, and the possibility of the two states. And I really believe this is a terrible mistake for Israel itself, because in doing so, they just kill any other perspective that war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you- I understand the argument you are making, but it has put you at direct odds with the Trump administration, who argue that your decision to make this recognition announcement, along with all these UN members, that it, in fact, kills the diplomacy they had underway. They said they were working to get, for example, the tax money from the Israelis to hand back over to the Palestinian Authority, that they were doing practical things on the ground to help Palestinians. Secretary Rubio said, that West Bank division you were talking about with the settlements, he drew a direct line to your recognition. Why do you think they're blaming you for that?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Look, first, I think we all work very hard in order to improve the situation of- of people on the ground. And let me tell you that France, a lot of French people, French doctors, French citizen, French members of NGOs, are working very hard with our administration as well to help Palestinian people. And during the past years, we worked very (UNINTEL) and financed a lot of actions as well being led by UNRWA. Second, I think my- my objective is precisely to- to provide another perspective. We- we- we are closely coordinated with the U.S. administration when we speak about the ceasefire and the release of hostages. We were always in close coordination with Secretary of State, or- or key- key President Trump's advisors, in order to work with Qatar, Egypt, and Israel on the release of hostages, of ceasefire. But your administration is focusing on the day after. And what we propose is a full-fledged plan, where we have first, the emergency package. So let's deliver release of all hostages, ceasefire, and- and humanitarian access. The day we have that, we start the day after. And I think we are very convergent with the work which is being done by- by your administration. What we want is a de facto governance in Gaza, with clearly a sort of transitional- transitional administration, including the Palestinian Authority, excluding, clearly, Hamas. But with a vetting process of Israel and an association of all the neighbors, we have a security package in this- in this day after approach, which is, let's scale up the training of the policemen and security forces of the Palestinians, and--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who will do that?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: We- we are already doing that, we're doing so. Many countries of the regions. It does exist, but we need a scale up, and in parallel, we proposed, and we work very closely with the United Kingdom, and all the leaders of the region, precisely to offer a military- I would say, an international force to be deployed in Gaza, with a UN mandate. Which is a unique framework to be defended, and which could be legitimate, to assist and- and back, I would say, this policemen and security forces. And--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know, Israel does not trust the United Nations at all.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: No- this is a UN framework, but this- first, they would have a vetting process of all the structure, and it would involve Jordan, Egypt, and some of- some others are ready as well to finance. But obviously it is to be made in close coordination with Israel. And in the security package, obviously, the core element is a dismantling of Hamas. There is no other option if you want to fix the situation, to disarm the Hamas, and precisely, to demobilize so many fighters, to organize what we call a DDR process, which is very familiar to all the experts in- in this type of situation. And this is in this day after for Gaza, in the security package, that we can organize such a DDR, vis a vis Hamas. And to be sure that Hamas will never be involved in the government, but that Hamas will be disarmed, dismantled, with some key people to leave Gaza and some other to be deradicalized, and the weapons to be taken. In order to do so, you need clear security forces here. You need these international forces to be here. And obviously we have the reconstruction. On that, I think there is a strong alignment with the United States. My point is, the recognition and the process we launched with that is the only way to bring with us, on this track, all the neighbors and key countries in order to deliver such a package. And- and look at the situation today, when Egypt, when so many leaders of the region, are not comfortable with what is being done. You need to re-engage them. And this is exactly what we are doing. But my point is to say, if we don't have this full package, the day after is impossible, because today, de facto, you are accepting the displacement of population in Gaza City. How do you want the day after to be possible if you displace thousands of people?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, exactly on this point, when you say, day after, that means when the war ends and some kind of rebuilding happens. What you're talking about with the Trump administration is this idea of having Palestinians leave Gaza, by choice, they say. But some would say that is a step towards ethnic cleansing. In fact, an independent commission set up by the UN concluded Israel has a, quote, \"intent to destroy Palestinians in Gaza, as defined by the Genocide Convention.\" Does France agree with that report?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: No, we don't qualify as a genocide what's happening because it is not a political statement. This is the judges or the, and or the historians to qualify a genocide by a series of evidence and a clear jurisprudence and clear elements.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you reject that report and that finding?",
      "And this is where I try to convince your administration that if we agree on the day after and we want this de facto authority, the security package, the dismantling of Hamas and the reconstruction, let's work on the current day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: If you accept de facto Israel to displace these people, you will never see a day after. And by the way, I look very carefully at all the plans being shared by your administration or shared by experts working for your administration. They always reiterate, let's work and build Gaza for Gazans. It means that they are ready to preserve and protect Palestinian people because Gazans are those who are living in Gaza. But if the precondition of such a plan is to push them out, this is just a craziness. So we, we should not be\u2014for the credibility of the United States, for the credibility of France\u2013we cannot be implicitly or explicitly complacent with such a project. Because such a project, we know it. And by the way, all the security experts, even in Israel, are very clear on the fact it will be a humanitarian disaster. And this project will, will kill the possibility of a day after. So we have to be very explicit on the fact that attacking civilians just to get a few, a few terrorists and a few fighters is clearly not acceptable. But displacing people in order just to take a territory, which is not in the hands of Israel, in order to prepare the day after, is not just totally crazy, but unacceptable for all of us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN : So France has one of the largest both Muslim and Jewish populations --",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: -- This is true. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- in all of Europe. The U.S. Ambassador to France, Charles Kushner, the father of the son-in-law to the President of the United States, Jared's father, he published an article, and I know you've you've read it, saying France is not dealing with antisemitism here in France. He said \"not a day passes without Jews assaulted in the street, synagogues or schools defaced, or Jewish-owned businesses vandalized. Your own Interior Ministry has reported antisemitic incidents even at preschools.\" Do you accept this criticism as genuine and valid?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Not at all. I think this is a mistake and an unacceptable statement for somebody who is supposed to be a diplomat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Unacceptable statement.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Yes, never a French Ambassador will be allowed to do so. So either you are a person who wants to express freely. Fine. If you are a diplomat, you have to follow the rule of diplomacy. And I'm not the one, this is you to pay the Ambassador of the United States in France, but the taxpayer money is not properly used to finance this kind of statement. So this is not a speech, a letter or a word of an ambassador. This is unacceptable. Now, the matter is much more important. And the matter about antisemitism is, for me, one of my top priority. I was the first president in France to adopt the definition of antisemitism, making it the equivalent of anti-zionism. And I've always been very engaged, again, antisemitism. We've worked very hard during the past few years in order to precisely re-engage, have faster sanctions and I never neglected this topic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know in the U.S. sometimes people hear criticism of Israel as antisemitic. --",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: No. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- But you're saying it's different. --",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: --No. My point is to say, you can, you cannot reject the existence of Israel. Ani, anti-Zionism is unacceptable and is antisemitism. But it doesn't mean that you are not allowed to be in disagreement with the Government of Israel. Otherwise we will become crazy. I'm sorry, but I want to fight very hard against anti, antisemitism. I am very against any anti-Zionist speech, but I do endorse to be in disagreement with Prime Minister Netanyahu and some of his ministers on many topics. It doesn't make me an antisemitic. Otherwise we are completely trapped in an impossible world. And this is precisely why the public debate makes this situation completely crazy. If we want peace and stability and unity, we have to be precise, sharp and respectful. So in this country, for many years, we had this problem with antisemitism like in a lot of other countries. What I disagree with is the argument made by your ambassador and the Prime Minister of Israel, in another public letter, making a link between the recognition and antisemitism. You have, you have a surge of antisemitism in the U.S. and you don't recognize. You have a surge of antisemitism in Germany. Nothing to do with recognition. Everywhere we have such a surge of antisemitism. It started before the seventh of October. A lot of these guys expressed their antisemitism the seventh of October itself. How, as awful it could be, but they did and it increased after. We have to fight against this phenomenon. We have to read - first, we have to sanction. We just passed a law for our high schools and universities to improve the regulations and to be in a situation to sanction all the antisemitism being expressed there. So we are very hard. We work very hard with the Jewish community in, in our country. And, and Jewish people are part of the DNA of the French Republic. So no chance anybody here will abandon the situation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Has this hurt your relationship with the U.S.?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: No, I don't think so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you do have a few other points of friction right now, or different views than the Trump administration.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: My objective on this- on this- on this issue, is- is very clearly to- to engage on the basis of the plan we will put on the table with, with the U.S. administration. And there is a work, an important work, which is made by Mr. Witkoff, Secretary Rubio, but as well Jared Kushner and Tony Blair. So we had many exchange with, with these people and and they work very hard on, on, on important ideas. So my objective is clearly to to engage with this administration, and to show that we can clearly articulate what they have in mind and a full-fledged peace and security plan for all.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what's happening here in Europe. In regard to Russia, NATO jets were scrambled twice within just the past few weeks because of these Russian drones that have been crossing into Poland and into Romania. It's the first time in NATO's history that they had to shoot down enemy crafts that had crossed in do you believe that these incursions could have been a mistake, as President Trump has suggested?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Very clearly, Russia is a destabilizing and aggressive power in Europe. They increased, during the past few weeks, the attacks against Kiev and killing a lot of civilians. They destroyed official buildings of the Ukrainian government, but as well premises of the UK Government, of the European Union. And at the same time, during the same weeks, they violated the Polish and the Romanian air. There is no mistake. There is just a project which is to destroy the maximum territories of Ukraine, to have a victory in Ukraine, and just to highlight what they want, the weakness of NATO.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: NATO says they're still investigating. They are not as certain as you seem to be--",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: --No. I'm not saying--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --that Russia did this intentionally.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: I just say this is not totally i- This is not a specific point. If we had a situation where they were declining or decreasing the attacks against Kiev and and on the battlefield. I could accept this argument. My point is to say it's largely beyond that. My point is to say, look at what they did during the past few weeks. So, I sincerely believe that your president was committed and is committed to to make peace in Ukraine, and he engaged, he took the risk to make a summit with President Putin in Anchorage and- and he asked for negotiations. And I think he's right. But at the same time, I have to, just to recognize that there is no clear willingness of President Putin to be sincerely engaged in such a move, because as we were working on a diplomatic way, as we were trying to organize bilateral, trilateral, quadrilateral summit, the Russians were increasing the assaults in Donbas, but not just in Donbas, intensified provocations on one side and attacks on Kyiv on the other side. So I just look at the facts, and your president is as well looking at the facts. So now, what do we do? We have to increase sanctions against Russia, but we have to find the way to precisely put more pressure on Russia to bring them back at the table. In parallel, let me insist on one point. When we came to Washington D.C., a series of European leaders with President Zelenskyy, we took a commitment, we will work to provide to Ukraine security guarantees, and we delivered. A few days ago here in Paris, we gathered what we call the coalition of the willing. You have 30 countries working together in order to provide the day after peace security guarantees to Ukraine. So we have all these elements now with an historical commitment of the Europeans who provide the security guarantees to Ukraine. What we need now is Ukraine to be at the table with Russia and negotiating what the peace agreement could be, on territory, on security guarantee, on the escalation, on recovery etc.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't see any eviden- evidence of Russian interest. I mean it's been more than--",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: --So now we have to step up, and we need political, military and economic surge in order to bring them back at the table and to negotiate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So to that point, because it's now more than a month since that Alaska Summit, that big risk you said President Trump took. When he's been asked, so why not put sanctions or secondary tariffs on Russia, he points back here at Europe and the consumption of Russian oil and gas that still takes place. I know Hungary and Slovakia, for example, continue to use it.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: This is true, and we are fixing it. And we had discussion with Ursula von der Leyen, and she made a great work with with her teams to fix that. But let's be honest, this is very marginal. This is not a key driver today. We decreased by more than 80% the consumption of oil and gas. And I can tell you, because we were not the most impacted as a country, because we were less dependent on this oil- oil- oil and gas coming from Russia. But we have to finalize- to finish the job. This is true, but now it's clearly much more that when we are to do- what we have to do. We- we have to step up our support to Ukraine, and we have to provide the way to better resist to the new attacks on Kiev and civilians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What's the delay on the sanctions or tariffs then?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: As soon as possible. If it depends just on me, tomorrow. But it doesn't just depend on me. So I hope, I think we have to react collectively if you want my- my strong view, I think it's very important. I think we all agree we want peace. We all agree the problem is Russia because they don't want peace. So now we have to increase the pressure to convince Russia to come back at the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: As the Trump administration has pointed to the idea that there are billions of dollars sitting in European bank accounts that could be seized, for example. Or that, you know, here you could put more tariffs on China or sanctions on China. Are these valid arguments by the administration, or are these--",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: --Look, regarding the frozen assets we are all very much attached to- to be compliant with international rules. And you cannot seize these assets from the central bank even in such a situation. And I think it's a matter of credibility, and it's very important that our countries remain [inaudible] and do respect the international laws. Because this is our problem everywhere. If we speak about Middle East, if we speak about the situation in Ukraine, when some countries start to disrespect international laws and when we are not sufficiently strong, this is the beginning of a total chaos. So we will respect international law. We are predictable, and we will not do all impossible things with these frozen assets. We already took them as, not as a collateral, but we took this frozen asset, and all the proceeds coming from this frozen asset were used to finance our efforts, part of our effort to Ukraine. This is the first point. As for your second point, it was sorry--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --I asked about the China aspect. That the administration would like you to push back on China more.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Look, I think we will have our own diplomacy on China, and we are very much attached to our independence, which is normal. And we have a de-risking strategy, but we are not in a decoupling strategy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So that's a no on the pressure from the administration to do that?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: My point is, let's focus on some secondary sanctions, if they make sense. I think what we- what we have to do is to engage a serious dialogue in order to see where and in which capacity Russia is helped by third countries, and to increase the pressure. So I think this approach is a good one, but it should be targeted and directly related to Russia. And I think- what I don't think what we- what we will do as Europeans with the US administration, it is working hard in all capacity by capacity, product by product, to see the key countries allowing Russia, sometimes to have a third way and to avoid sanctions or to benefit from the current situation. This is what we call the secondary sanction, because you don't sanction directly Russia, but a third country which is helping them, and this job has to be made, has already started technically. I'm totally in favor of this job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And just a final question here to ask you again about NATO. The US has not contributed fighter jets to that new effort that was just recently announced after the drone incursions. The Supreme Allied Commander is an American, but does that signal something to you? Does that concern you that the United States isn't more muscular here?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: No, I'm not concerned or worried about that. I want to say that the NATO Secretary General worked very hard, and we all gathered and exchanged information with the Polish Prime Minister and the Polish president in the hours right after this, what happened. And for instance, UK and France stepped up and we sent fighters. But it's fine. We were in a situation to do so, and we are totally credible. But at the same time, look at what the US is doing in on the Eastern flank of NATO. You are a very strong contributor and reliable partner. So I don't want to- to diminish this role and your commitment and- and I think your President was very clear about, as well, his commitment to NATO. But I- I'm totally in line with the fact that the Europeans have to step up. I've defended for years the fact that we need more independence, more strategic autonomy in- in Europe, and we need a stronger European pillar. This is why, by the way, right after my first election, I started to increase the budget of our army, and in 10 years, we will have doubled this budget. And- and I am already in favor of having all the Europeans increasing their budget, their defense expenditures, and as well building an actual industry research and development basis for defense and security, working together and building a strong, consistent European pillar in NATO. Because it's fair that the US wants to focus much more on its own security, or wants to work much more on the Pacific side, and asks Europeans to be more engaged and committed for their own security. I share this perspective, and this is one of the priority of the Europeans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. President. Thank you for your time today.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Thank you very much for being here and offering me this opportunity to explain our views. Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you."

      "Dr. Rami Mhanna, the managing director of Shifa Hospital, where some of the bodies were brought, said the dead included six people from the same family after a strike hit their home early Saturday morning. They were relatives of the hospital's director, Dr. Mohamed Abu Selmiya, he said.",

      "Palestinians have streamed out of the city \u2014 some by car, others on foot. Israel opened another corridor south of Gaza City for two days this week to allow more people to evacuate. But many Palestinians in the famine-stricken city are unwilling to be uprooted again, too weak to leave or unable to afford the cost of moving.",
      "Aid groups have warned that forcing thousands of people to evacuate will exacerbate the dire humanitarian crisis. They are urging for a ceasefire so aid can reach those who need it.",
      "The latest Israeli operation, which started this week, likely pushes any ceasefire farther out of reach. The Israeli military, which says it wants to \"destroy Hamas' military infrastructure,\" hasn't given a timeline for the offensive, but there were indications it could take months.",
      "The death count in Gaza has climbed over 65,100, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run government, since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists stormed into southern Israel and killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Over 250 people were also abducted as hostages. Forty-eight hostages remain in Gaza, with fewer than half believed to be alive.",
      "The Gaza Health Ministry does not say how many of the dead were civilians or militants. Its figures are seen as a reliable estimate by the U.N. and many independent experts.

      "French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday reopened Notre Dame's iconic towers in Paris for public visits, one of the final steps in the immense reconstruction following a devastating fire.",
      "The inauguration of the restored towers by Macron, who has spearheaded reconstruction efforts since the fire on April 15, 2019, comes a day before the opening weekend, when the public can finally climb the 424 stairs to enjoy unmatched views of Paris.",
      "Nearly 30,000 visitors a day have streamed through the doors of the cathedral since its\u00a0reopening in December 2024, to see for themselves the remarkable rebirth of the great Gothic church. Macron hosted world leaders and luminaries, among them Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Britain's Prince William and then President-elect Trump at the reopening.",
      "The landmark\u00a0reconstruction of Notre Dame to its former glory marks a major success for Macron, who is politically embattled at home. He can boast of fulfilling a promise made in the wake of the fire for the restoration to be finished within half a decade.",
      "Macron was given the honor of being the first person to be given a tour around the newly restored towers, which also allows a close view of the cathedral's famous gargoyles \u2014 grotesque sculptures of mythical beasts that adorn its exterior walls.",
      "\"The towers of Notre-Dame reopen to the public,\" Macron wrote on X. \"The cathedral is regaining all its splendour and once again offers its spectacular views of Paris.\"",
      "Visitors can enjoy an approximately 45-minute tour, which begins in the south tower with an ascent to the belfry.",
      "\"This route already existed before the fire, but it has been greatly improved in many ways,\" said Philippe Jost, Macron's pointman for the reconstruction, pointing to new viewpoints and spaces for visitors.",
      "Visiting the towers will be trickier and pricier than visiting the cathedral itself. Tickets, which cost 16 euros (roughly $19) rather than the free entry for the cathedral itself, must be bought online, with only 19 people allowed in at any one time.",
      "The tickets for the first two days over the weekend sold out in just 24 minutes.",
      "The total cost of restorations neared $1 billion, Jost previously told CBS News' \"60 Minutes.\" Workers had to\u00a0stabilize the 12th-century monument, encasing it in scaffolding after it was damaged in the fire. Hundreds of artisans then used 21st-century tools such as drones and computer animation to guide reconstruction.",
      "Safety measures meant to prevent future fires were also installed, and metal trusses divide the massive roof into three sections, making it less likely for a fire to grab hold and spread.",
      "While the opening of the towers marks the final major stage in the reconstruction process, there is still more work to be done. The apse at the eastern end of the cathedral is the next part to be renovated.",

This was the second time Russian athletes had participated under the neutral flag after being in the Unified Team of 1992.",

The limited presence of Russians and Belarusians at the 2025 Paris Games satisfied the Olympic body by bringing together athletes from around the world while avoiding a boycott by Ukraine and its closest allies.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have discovered prehistoric insects preserved in amber for the first time in South America, providing a fresh glimpse into life on Earth at a time when flowering plants were just beginning to diversify and spread around the world.",
      "Many of the specimens found at a sandstone quarry in Ecuador date to 112 million years ago, said Fabiany Herrera, curator of fossil plants at the Field Museum in Chicago and co-author of the study published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth and Environment. At least six types of arthropods were found preserved, according to the study.",
      "Almost all known amber deposits from the past 130 million years have been in the Northern Hemisphere, and it's long been \"an enigma\" that scientists have found few in southern regions that once comprised the supercontinent Gondwana, said David Grimaldi, an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History who was not involved in the discovery.",
      "This marks the first time researchers have identified ancient beetles, flies, ants and wasps in fossilized tree resin in South America, said Ricardo P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente, a paleoentomologist at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, who also was not involved in the new study.",
      "\"Amber pieces are little windows into the past,\" P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente said, adding that the discovery will help researchers understand the evolving interactions between flowering plants and insects that lived during the era of the dinosaurs.",
      "The researchers uncovered hundreds of fragments of amber, some containing ancient insects, pollen and tree leaves, at a sandstone quarry in Ecuador that's on the edge of what is today the Amazon basin.",
      "Two types of amber were discovered, according to the study: There was a more common form of amber found around the roots of resin-producing plants, and a rarer form of the material formed from resin exposed to air. The amber formed around the roots did not hold any specimens, the study said.",
      "\"A different kind of forest\"",
      "The discoveries provide evidence that the area was once a \"humid, resinous forest ecosystem,\" according to the study.",
      "But today's rainforest is much different from what dinosaurs roamed through, Herrera said. Based on an analysis of fossils in the amber, the ancient rainforest contained species of ferns and conifers, including the unusual Monkey Puzzle Tree, that no longer grow in Amazonia.",
      "\"It was a different kind of forest,\" said Herrera.",
      "The amber deposits were previously known to geologists and miners who worked at the Genoveva quarry. Study co-author Carlos Jaramillo at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute first heard of them about a decade ago and set out to find the exact location, aided by geology field notes.",
      "\"I went there and realized this place is amazing,\" Jaramillo said. \"There's so much amber in the mines,\" and it's more visible in the open quarry than it would be if hidden under dense layers of vegetation.",
      "Researchers will continue to analyze the amber trove to learn more about Cretaceous-era biodiversity \u2014 including the insects that contributed to evolution by feeding on flowering plants. \"Amber tends to preserve things that are tiny,\" said Grimaldi.",
      "\"It's the time when the relationship between flowering plants and insects got started,\" said P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente. \"And that turned out to be one of the most successful partnerships in nature.\"",

      "Despite the exoneration, the battle wasn\u2019t over. In 1993, a judge ruled that sole custody of Dylan and her brother, Satchel, was awarded to their mother, Mia. The decision marked a bitter turning point in Allen\u2019s personal life.",

      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "AI browsers are no longer just an idea; they're already here. Microsoft has built Copilot into Edge, OpenAI is testing a sandboxed browser in agent mode and Perplexity's Comet is one of the first to fully embrace the concept of browsing for you.",
      "This is agentic AI stepping into our daily routines, from searching and reading to shopping and clicking. Instead of simply assisting us, these tools are beginning to replace us.",
      "But with this shift comes a new era of digital deception. AI-powered browsers may promise convenience by handling shopping, emails and other tasks, yet research shows they can stumble into scams faster than humans ever could. This dangerous mix of speed and trust is what experts call Scamlexity, a complex, AI-driven scam landscape where your agent gets tricked, and you pay the price.",

      "Falling for the same old tricks",
      "AI browsers are not immune to classic scams. In fact, they can fall for them even faster. When researchers at Guardio Labs told an AI browser to buy an Apple Watch, it confidently completed the purchase on a fake Walmart store set up in minutes. It autofilled personal and payment details without hesitation. The scammer got the money, while the human never saw the red flags.",
      "AI browsers promise convenience, but security experts warn they can fall for online scams faster than humans. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Handling phishing emails from \"your bank\"",
      "Old phishing tactics also remain effective. In testing, researchers at Guardio Labs sent a fake Wells Fargo email to the AI browser. The browser clicked the malicious link with no verification and even helped the user fill out login credentials on the phishing page. By removing human intuition from the loop, the AI created a perfect trust chain that scammers could exploit.",
      "PromptFix: A modern AI injection scam",
      "The real danger comes from attacks designed specifically for AI. Researchers at Guardio Labs created PromptFix, a scam disguised as a CAPTCHA page. While humans would only see a checkbox, the AI agent read hidden malicious instructions in the page code. Believing it was \"helping,\" the AI clicked the button, triggering a download that could have been malware. This type of prompt injection bypasses human awareness and targets the AI's decision-making directly. Once compromised, the AI can send emails, share files or execute harmful tasks without the user ever knowing.",
      "The growing risks of AI browsers",
      "As agentic AI becomes mainstream, scams will scale at an alarming speed. Instead of fooling millions of people individually, attackers need only to compromise one AI model to reach millions at once. Security experts warn this is a structural risk, not just a phishing problem.",
      "Tips to protect yourself from AI browser scams",
      "AI browsers can save time, but they can also put you at risk if you rely on them too much. Use these practical steps to stay in control and reduce your chances of becoming a victim.",
      "Always double-check sensitive actions like purchases, downloads or logins. Keep final approval in your hands instead of letting the AI complete tasks on its own. This way, you prevent scammers from sneaking past your awareness.",
      "Scammers rely on exposed personal details to make their tricks more convincing. A trusted data removal service can help scrub your information from broker sites, reducing the chance that your AI agent hands over details that are already floating around online. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.",
      "These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.

    "published": "Sat, 20 Sep 2025 06:37:34 -0400",
    "summary": "Expert tips for buying refurbished electronics reveal what to check before purchase, including warranty policies and seller reputation.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt the CyberGuy joins 'Fox & Friends' to share his tips to stay safe from online scammers and recent warnings on how AI toys can harm children.",
      "Buying refurbished electronics sounds like a no-brainer. You get the latest gadgets at a fraction of the cost while giving devices a second life, which is better for the environment. It seems like the perfect solution for those on a budget, but it isn't always that simple. Not every refurbished device is equal, and the fine print matters more than you think.",
      "Some sellers do a fantastic job restoring products, while others barely touch them before reselling. If you're considering refurbished tech, here are important lessons I wish I knew beforehand. These insights will help you make smarter choices, avoid headaches and get real value for your money.",

      "AMAZON'S SECRET RENEWED STORE DEALS: SAVE ON APPLE PRODUCTS, NINJA AIR FRYERS, SHARK VACUUMS AND MORE",
      "Researching a seller\u2019s track record is more important than chasing after the lowest refurbished price point. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Imo/Photothek via Getty Images)",
      "1) Refurbished does not always mean like new",
      "In the tech industry, the label refurbished carries no uniform standard. From factory-certified devices that meet stringent quality checks to third-party refurbishments that address only surface-level defects, the range is vast. My experience shows that treating refurbished items as \"like new\" is a mistake. Many come with cosmetic blemishes or partially worn components, and some sellers stop at a basic reset and cleaning.",
      "The key is to scrutinize the seller's refurbishment process and request detailed specifications or photos to ensure the item is in good condition. Look for transparency about what has been repaired or replaced. A reputable refurbisher will disclose whether critical components such as screens, batteries or motherboards were replaced or simply tested.",
      "Pro tip: Many refurbishers use a grading system (A, B, C). Grade A means near new, Grade B usually has light scratches, while Grade C shows heavier wear. Knowing the grade helps set realistic expectations.",
      "2) Check the warranty and return policy",
      "One of the most overlooked yet critical aspects of buying refurbished electronics is the warranty and return policy. Through years of testing products, I've seen warranties vary wildly from generous 90-day coverage to none at all. A solid warranty is not just a formality; it's a reflection of the refurbisher's confidence in the quality of the product. Without it, you're taking a gamble.",
      "Industry best practices suggest opting for sellers who provide at least a 90-day warranty and a clear, no-hassle return window. I have consistently seen reliable refurbishers like Amazon Renewed, eBay Certified Refurbished and Back Market stand by their work with transparent policies.",
      "Also look at Apple Certified Refurbished and Dell Outlet, which are industry leaders for high-quality laptops, tablets and phones.",
      "3) Know the seller's reputation",
      "Not all sellers are equal when it comes to refurbished tech. My years covering consumer electronics have made it clear that choosing a reputable seller is more important than chasing the lowest price. Factory-certified refurbishers and authorized resellers tend to follow strict testing and quality control procedures. In contrast, independent sellers often vary in quality and reliability.",
      "I always emphasize researching the seller's history, reading verified customer reviews and ensuring they offer clear refurbishment guarantees. Established marketplaces and brand-certified stores provide additional layers of security, including dispute resolution mechanisms.",
      "Red flags include: vague warranty language, listings with only stock photos, \"open box\" items marketed as refurbished and any product sold \"as-is.\" If you see those, walk away.",
      "4) Don't forget accessories and packaging",
      "A less obvious but important consideration is the state of accessories and packaging. In industry practice, refurbished products rarely arrive in original packaging or with the full set of accessories. I've seen that some sellers ship devices with generic boxes and subpar third-party accessories or omit chargers and manuals altogether.",
      "If accessories are important to your workflow, don't assume they'll be included. Always verify the listing description and, when in doubt, ask the seller directly. Knowing exactly what comes in the box prevents surprises and ensures you don't have to hunt for compatible chargers or cables after the fact, potentially eroding any savings you initially gained.",
      "5) Battery life may not be the same",
      "A common misconception is that refurbished devices come with batteries that perform like new, but that's not the case. Batteries naturally degrade with use, and not all refurbishers replace them.",
      "Some sellers disclose battery replacement while others do not. It is critical to confirm whether the battery is new, tested or original. Otherwise, expect performance issues such as rapid discharge or failure to hold a charge. A device with a worn-out battery is rarely worth the lower upfront cost, as you'll likely need to replace the battery soon after purchase.",
      "SAVE UP TO 64% ON DYSON, DEWALT, ANKER, ADIDAS AND MORE DURING EBAY'S 30TH ANNIVERSARY SALE",
      "A good warranty and return policy are essential safeguards for choosing refurbished devices. (Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "6) Software updates and compatibility",
      "You should only use electronic items like phones, laptops, tablets and smartwatches as long as they're receiving software updates. Many might disagree with this, but the truth is that once software support ends, your device becomes vulnerable to all kinds of unpatchable security flaws. Some good brands known for reliable software support are Apple, Samsung, Google, MSI and Lenovo.",
      "Before purchasing, always verify that the device is still supported with regular updates. This information is often available on the manufacturer's website or through trusted tech resources.",
      "7) Test the device thoroughly after purchase",
      "Testing a refurbished device thoroughly upon arrival is a best practice I've recommended repeatedly in my writing. Even trusted sellers can occasionally miss a defect. I always advise checking every essential function, such as the screen, charging port, Wi-Fi, sound and camera, within the seller's return period. Many problems won't be obvious from photos or descriptions alone.",
      "Immediate testing ensures you catch issues early enough to return or replace the product without hassle. It's a small investment of time that prevents far bigger frustrations later.",
      "And don't forget to perform your own factory reset on\u00a0iPhone,\u00a0Android,\u00a0PC or Mac to ensure no old accounts, locks or data are lingering on the device. For Apple devices, make sure \"Find My iPhone\" has been disabled before purchase, or it may be unusable.",
      "8) Install strong antivirus software",
      "Refurbished devices can sometimes carry hidden risks, especially if the previous owner didn't wipe the device properly or if the seller missed deep software issues. Installing\u00a0 strong antivirus software is essential to protect your device from malware, spyware or other security threats that may be lurking.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "9) Use a password manager",
      "Security doesn't end with antivirus protection. Many refurbished devices come with pre-installed software or misconfigured settings that could expose you to risk. One of the smartest moves you can make is using a reliable password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "10) Know the real value of your savings",
      "Refurbished doesn't always mean a bargain. As a rule of thumb, expect to save 20-40% compared to new, depending on the brand, age and condition. If you're only saving 10-15%, the trade-off on warranty, lifespan or battery may not be worth it. Calculate the long-term cost, especially if you'll need to buy a new battery or accessories soon after.",
      "6 KITCHEN ITEMS THAT EXPERTS 'WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND' BUYING AT SECONDHAND SHOPS",
      "Refurbished products often arrive without original packaging or accessories, leaving buyers unprepared. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Bonus: The eco-friendly upside",
      "Every refurbished device purchased keeps one more gadget out of the landfill and reduces carbon emissions from manufacturing. Studies show buying refurbished can cut a product's carbon footprint nearly in half. That means you're not only saving money but also helping the planet.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Buying refurbished electronics can be a great way to save money and reduce e-waste. But it pays to be careful. By sticking with certified sellers, knowing what \"refurbished\" really means and insisting on warranties and clear return policies, you can protect both your wallet and your data.",

      "Opt for mobile boarding passes instead of printed ones. This removes the risk of discarded paper passes falling into the wrong hands.",
      "Avoid printing your full home address or primary phone number. Instead, use your name, a travel-only email and either a P.O. box or work address. You can even create a simple alias email just for travel, which forwards to your main inbox but keeps your real address private. This way, airlines and honest finders can still reach you without exposing sensitive personal details to scammers.",
      "For recommendations on private and secure email providers that offer alias addresses, visit\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Another way to protect yourself is by putting a small tracker inside your luggage, such as an\u00a0Apple AirTag or a\u00a0similar Bluetooth tracker. These devices connect to your phone and let you see where your bag is in near real-time. If your suitcase goes missing or ends up in the wrong place, you\u2019ll know faster than waiting for the airline to track it down.",
      "Place the tracker inside your bag rather than on the handle so it can\u2019t be easily removed. Check its location through your phone before leaving the airport, and keep an eye on it during layovers. While AirTags can\u2019t prevent someone from misusing an old luggage tag, they give you proof of where your bag actually is if you ever need to dispute a lost luggage claim or theft.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "While the luggage tag scam may not be widespread yet, it exploits a simple oversight that most travelers rarely consider. Until airlines and airports put better safeguards in place, the burden falls on passengers to protect their own information. That means treating something as ordinary as a bag tag like sensitive data.",

It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

The recommendation encourages patients to talk with their doctors about whether to get an updated shot instead of recommending it for everyone six months and older.",

    "story": [
      "One play after a Jalen Hurts fumble \u2014 and only three plays into the second half \u2014 the Philadelphia Eagles were trailing the Los Angeles Rams 26-7 in their NFC championship game rematch, with an offensive effort that was lustily booed by the home crowd.",
      "Whether it was the jeers or simply desperation, the deficit seemed to wake up the struggling Eagles\u2019 offense. After having averaged only 22 points a game in the first two weeks of the season, Philadelphia\u2019s offense scored 20 in the second half alone Sunday, en route to a 33-26 win.",
      "And the key to scoring explosion was simple: Get the ball to receiver A.J. Brown.",
      "Through their first 2\u00bd games, the Eagles\u2019 offense looked pretty mediocre despite their 2-0 record.",
      "Over the first two weeks of the season, quarterback Jalen Hurts threw for only 253 yards total, with zero passing touchdowns. Hurts\u2019 5.6 yards-per-attempt average through the first two games of this year was lower than Saquon Barkley\u2019s 5.8 yards-per-carry rushing average in 2024.",
      "As a result of the anemic aerial attack, Brown \u2014 a three-time Pro Bowler \u2014 was ineffective. Over the first two weeks, he had only six catches on 10 targets for 35 yards. After never having averaged fewer than 13.7 yards per reception in a season in his career, Brown was at 5.8 yards per catch through two games.",
      "In the first half on Sunday, Philly\u2019s offense somehow looked worse.",
      "Hurts was only 4-of-8 for 17 yards, and, including sacks, the Eagles had minus 1 yard passing. (Philly\u2019s 33 total yards were its lowest in at least 10 years, according to The Ringer\u2019s Sheil Kapadia.) And Brown was held to zero catches on only one target.",
      "But beginning with their second drive of the second half, even with star right tackle Lane Johnson out of the game because of injury, first-year offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo finally began to call some shots downfield, and the gamble paid off.",
      "Philly scored touchdowns on three of its final four possessions of the second half, all of which came via Hurts\u2019 arm. He threw for 209 yards and three scores in the third and fourth quarters, leading the Eagles to 20 consecutive points. (Philly\u2019s final touchdown came on a blocked field goal return as time expired.)",
      "\u201cWe got so many good players on this team, and at times you can feel like we\u2019re being conservative, and I don\u2019t think it should be like that,\u201d Brown told reporters after the game. \u201cI think it should [be] let your killers do they thing and play fast and play aggressive. I\u2019m not saying that we haven\u2019t been, but for me personally, that\u2019s what I would like.\u201d",
      "And after having thrown Brown\u2019s way only once in the first half, Hurts threw him the ball nine times in the second. Brown finished with six catches for 109 yards and a touchdown. He matched his season reception total while eclipsing his yardage total in one half.",

      "Commanders coach Dan Quinn bloodies nose after collision on sideline",
      "The key was finally pushing the ball upfield.",
      "According to NFL Next Gen Stats, through the first 10 quarters of the season, Hurts had attempted only seven passes over 10 air yards, completing two. In the second half against the Rams. he threw nine passes over 10 air yards, connecting on seven for 154 yards and two touchdowns.",
      "\u201cWe have pride in this win, as ugly as it was and as beautiful as it isn\u2019t,\u201d Hurts said after.",
      "Are the Eagles\u2019 offensive issues definitely fixed? One area of concern is the rushing attack, which is considerably less explosive than it was last season.",
      "Through its Super Bowl run, Philly averaged 5.0 yards per carry a year ago, with Barkley alone rushing for over 2,000 yards. This season, the Eagles were averaging only 3.9 yards per rush entering Sunday \u2014 20th in the NFL \u2014 and they managed only 3.2 yards per carry against Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cNo victory Monday for us; we\u2019re going to go back to work,\u201d head coach Nick Sirianni said in his postgame news conference. \u201cWe do have a lot of things to clean up.\u201d",
      "Part of the issue might have been the team\u2019s reluctance to test defenses deep through the air. If Philadelphia is finally committed to throwing the ball beyond the sticks \u2014 and getting it into the hands of one of its best players \u2014 the early season offensive lull may be coming to an end."

      "Philadelphia had taken the lead, 27-26, with 1:48 left, but the Rams still had a chance to win. They were lining up for a potential game-winning field goal with three seconds left when the Eagles blocked the kick and returned it for a touchdown to seal their 33-26 win. It was the Rams' first loss this season.",
      "Meanwhile, the Jets, who were trailing 26-20 with two minutes remaining in the fourth quarter in Tampa Bay, returned their own blocked kick for a touchdown \u2014 the first time since 2024 and only the fifth time since 2000 that multiple field-goal attempts were returned for touchdowns. It appeared enough to lift the Jets to their first win of the season \u2014 and possibly hand Tampa Bay its first loss.",
      "The Buccaneers (3-0), however, would get the last laugh after they made a game-winning field goal as time expired on a kick the Jets (0-3) could not get their hands on.",
      "Even the previously winless Browns, one of the biggest underdogs of Week 3, got in on the action, blocking a kick en route to stunning the previously undefeated Packers, who were trying to take a lead with just 27 seconds left in the fourth quarter.",

      "Reese Witherspoon says she was deterred from pursuing one particular type of role toward the beginning of her career, despite having firsthand experience in the subject matter.",
      "Witherspoon spoke to The New York Times in a recent interview, reflecting on the period of her career after she became a mother when she was 23.",
      "The actor welcomed two children with her then-husband, Ryan Phillippe: daughter Ava in 1999 and son Deacon in 2003.",
      "When asked if it was difficult to navigate motherhood while her peers were not in the same stage of life, Witherspoon shared the \u201cironic\u201d advice she was given about her career.",
      "\u201cI was always being told by people in the industry: \u2018Don\u2019t play a mom. It\u2019ll make you seem old,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018But, I am a mom.\u2019 There was so much about our business that desexualized you, so you couldn\u2019t be a movie star if you played a mom. And thank goodness, that\u2019s sort of going by the wayside.\u201d",
      "Witherspoon added, \u201cBut that was a big part of when I was in my 20s and 30s: Don\u2019t play a mom. No men will desire you, or nobody will want to go see that movie because nobody wants to see a movie about a mom.\u201d",
      "The \u201cLegally Blonde\u201d star also opened up about her experience becoming a mom in her early 20s.",
      "\u201cThere was so much I didn\u2019t know,\" she said. \"And maybe that na\u00efvet\u00e9 was good, because it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll just do that and have a career.\u2019\u201d",
      "Witherspoon said some people would tell her that becoming a mom would \u201cbe really hard on your career,\u201d adding, \u201cThere were roles I couldn\u2019t take. I had to have this immediate balance of family and career, being a mom and being a working actress.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why it was also scary when \u2018Legally Blonde\u2019 became such a big hit,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to beg for parts; parts were coming to me. And that almost made it scarier, because I wasn\u2019t picking and choosing what I would reach and strive for. It was more like, what will I not do?\u201d",
      "Witherspoon, who later welcomed son Tennessee with her ex-husband Jim Toth in 2012, has since portrayed a mom on screen several times, including in the movies \u201cHome Again\u201d and \u201cYour Place or Mine\u201d and the shows \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d and \u201cLittle Fires Everywhere.\u201d",
      "In recent months, Witherspoon has opened up about her role as a mom off-screen, including how she has raised three children in Hollywood.",
      "Witherspoon shared a post on Instagram in August that featured several throwback photos posing with her children over the years. On the first slide, she wrote, \u201cSomeone asked me what raising three kids and building a career in Hollywood looked like\u2026\u201d",
      "\u201cIt looked like spending a lot of time in trailers together,\u201d she added. \u201cIt looked like always being on the road together. It looked like my kids constantly giving me career advice!\u201d",
      "The actor also highlighted some of the difficult aspects, writing, \u201cIt looked really hard sometimes. I\u2019d cry working 14 to 17 hours, sometimes all night long and still woke up early for carpool. I was deliriously tired.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt looked like trying to say something positive about my work when I got home at night,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSo my kids would know that my work was meaningful to me and could be fun!\u201d",
      "Witherspoon said that while it could be \u201cchallenging at times,\u201d being a mom has given her \u201cperspective about what was important in life.\u201d",
      "\u201cNothing was better than getting to come home and hug them and hear about their day!\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "At the end of a recent appearance on TODAY, \u201cThe Paper\u201d stars Oscar Nu\u00f1ez, Gbemisola Ikumelo and Alex Edelman were asked to offer their best deadpan expression to the camera. Each actor stared into the camera, as if a mockumentary was being filmed right there in Studio 1A, pretending to show signs of sarcasm and disgust.",
      "That sense of humor that has served the trio so well in their new Peacock series, a successor of sorts to \u201cThe Office,\u201d carried over just minutes later when they settled into a dressing room at 30 Rock to chat with TODAY.com. When it\u2019s mentioned that \u201cThe Office\u201d is one of the most beloved comedies of all time, Edelman, with a straight face, replies, \u201cNever seen it. Not a fan.\u201d (Peacock is owned by TODAY.com\u2019s parent company, NBCUniversal.)",
      "Officially, Peacock has touted \u201cThe Paper\u201d as a comedy that is \u201cin the tradition of \u2018The Office.\u2019\u201d The two shows are connected in a variety of ways \u2014 for one, both were co-created by Greg Daniels. For another, both feature Nu\u00f1ez, who is reprising his role of Oscar Martinez as he moves on from the Dunder Mifflin paper company in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to the Toledo Truth Teller newspaper in Ohio. (Oscar does drop the occasional reference to his old life in \u201cThe Paper,\u201d including in a phone call to his puzzle-loving former co-worker, Stanley.)",
      "However, the cast has taken care to emphasize that \u201cThe Paper\u201d is not a remake or a spinoff of \u201cThe Office.\u201d In a May interview with Collider, Domhnall Gleeson, who plays Ned Sampson, the new editor-in-chief of the newspaper, said, \u201cThe people are going to have to take the show on its own merits because it\u2019s become something different. It\u2019s a whole new city. It\u2019s not like a remake.\u201d",
      "Nu\u00f1ez shares a similar perspective in the interview with TODAY.com, saying, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a spinoff. It was never presented as one. People want it to be. It\u2019s a different show. It is the same documentary crew visiting another place with new people, and so that part is brand new.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m the only glue, the sexy glue, that holds everything together,\u201d he quips.",
      "Edelman, who is a writer on the show in addition to his role as Adam, says that while \u201cThe Paper\u201d has the same \u201caesthetic\u201d of \u201cThe Office,\u201d with its camerawork and the return of directors who previously helmed episodes of the Emmy-winning NBC series, the \u201ccontent\u201d is what separates the two. He wasn\u2019t motivated to re-create the magic of \u201cThe Office,\u201d per se; he was motivated to make a good show with people he considers to be talented and funny.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m being honest, I\u2019m surprised by the questions now about the pressure that one would feel from \u2018The Office,\u2019 because, frankly, you just feel pressure from your really talented co-workers,\u201d he continues.",
      "Ikumelo, who co-stars as Adelola, sees the premise of the show \u2014 that of a failing newspaper \u2014 as something fresh and different.",
      "\u201cI just thought there was so much comedy that could be mined from that and also story, and it felt like a genuine, real, kicking-off point, rather than a, \u2018Oh, we need to create something from a show that\u2019s existed before.\u2019 It felt like, \u2018Oh, no, this is real meat and real story,\u2019 and something that feels like it\u2019s important in terms of what\u2019s happening today,\u201d she says.",
      "\u2018Instant Chemistry\u2019 on the Set",
      "While Gleeson is the on-screen boss of \u201cThe Paper\u201d and has numerous impressive credits to his name, ranging from \u201cHarry Potter\u201d to the Oscar-winning \u201cEx Machina\u201d to \u201cStar Wars,\u201d \u201cThe Paper\u201d is an ensemble comedy in the same way \u201cThe Office\u201d was. Nu\u00f1ez is the link between those two ensembles, but he\u2019s not so sure it was essential that he be included in the new show.",
      "\u201cI surely appreciated it,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s neat. I think it\u2019s cool. It\u2019s a little nod.\u201d",
      "Then, emphasizing the talent of a cast that also includes Sabrina Impacciatore, Chelsea Frei and Tim Key, he adds, \u201cIt\u2019s not really my show.\u201d",
      "Nu\u00f1ez and Edelman say the chemistry between the cast members is evident in the final product. Edelman saw from the beginning that the actors were jelling on the set.",
      "\u201cIt was really funny and good from the start, because Greg Daniels directed our pilot, so he knew what we wanted,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut I do think when you watch the show, you see the characters getting more and more comfortable with each other, which is really, really nice, because the narrative of the show is that this group is in sort of a new group.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the end of the season, I was like, man, we really feel like a unit in a way that really makes sense for the narrative, which is really, really nice,\u201d he says.",
      "Ikumelo recalls being in the room as the show was being cast, saying decisions were made meticulously and with intention.",
      "\u201cThat casting, I think, helped in terms of the temperaments and the kinds of funny that people bring to the table. I think that really helps in terms of just generating instant chemistry, because it was cast well,\u201d she notes.",
      "Finding New Fans With \u2018The Paper\u2019",
      "The day before \u201cThe Paper\u201d premiered on Peacock on Sept. 4, the streaming platform announced the show had been renewed for a second season. The first season will also get a run on broadcast TV, when \u201cThe Paper\u201d joins NBC\u2019s Monday-night lineup beginning Nov. 10.",
      "Nu\u00f1ez is hoping as \u201cThe Paper\u201d continues to find an audience that it attracts both fans of \u201cThe Office\u201d and new fans as well.",
      "Edelman chimes in that the show is already being discovered by viewers who may be less familiar with \u201cThe Office.\u201d",
      "By some measures, \u201cThe Paper\u201d is already a hit with viewers and critics. It\u2019s currently one of the most-watched shows on Peacock, and it has an 84% Tomatometer rating on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve made this really beautiful thing on its own terms that we\u2019re all really, really proud of,\u201d Edelman says. \u201cI think as you watch over the course of the season, it just gets funnier and funnier.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t wait to start shooting\u201d Season 2, Nu\u00f1ez responds."

      "\u201cI think it was a cyber Munchausen\u2019s case,\u201d said Bill Chillman, Lauryn\u2019s school superintendent, in the documentary. \u201cShe wanted her daughter to need her in such a way that she was willing to hurt her and this is the way she chose to do that.\u201d",
      "Kendra\u2019s cousin Melissa Perry agreed, saying in the documentary, \u201cI think that\u2019s exactly it.\u201d",
      "What is Munchausen by proxy? Could it explain Kendra's behavior?",
      "TODAY.com reached out to a Stanford psychologist with a clinical specialty in Munchausen by Proxy, plus a 30-year-old woman who experienced a similar type of abuse from her mother.",
      "Both had a lot to say about the documentary and the true story behind it.",
      "\"Unknown Number\": A Psychologist's Perspective",
      "Dr. Mary Sanders, a Stanford psychologist, tells TODAY.com that Munchausen by proxy is \"when someone falsifies illness on behalf of someone else, usually a parent on behalf of a child, and that behavior persists even though there is no external reward,\" she says. \"Basically, it's to meet their psychological needs.\"",
      "The presence of technology has added new opportunities for the disorder to present itself. Dr. Marc Feldman, a psychiatry professor at the University of Alabama and Munchausen expert, has noted the rise of \"Munchausen by internet.\"",
      "\"Even when your mom does the seemingly most evil things you could imagine, you still saw your mom laugh. You were still comforted when your mom hugged you. There was still this good mom that cared so much.\"",
      "Jordyn Hope, Munchausen by proxy survivor",
      "Neither Sanders nor Feldman have personally treated Kendra Licari; they spoke about the condition in general.",
      "\"Online is now another arena to get attention,\" Sanders says.",
      "Sanders says parents with the syndrome use defense mechanisms, rationalization and compartmentalization to inflict harmful behaviors on their child. Sometimes these parents have been lured by Make-a-Wish trips to Disneyland. Other times they simply get a rush from the excitement and admiration they get as the parent of a \"sick\" kid. Few understand the harm they cause.",
      "\"They crave being able to rush in and and be a hero or receive a lot of attention for caretaking,\" says Sanders.",
      "\"Certainly this is abusive, extremely emotionally abusive,\" Sanders says of Kendra's behavior after watching the documentary. \"You know, some might even say sexually abusive as well, and certainly intentional deception.\"",
      "She adds, \"It's so disturbing how much there was about the texts  encouraging her to kill herself.\"",
      "Sanders notes that Kendra claimed to have known that Lauryn wouldn't kill herself, \"but we certainly know of cases in which kids have with far less cyberbullying than this.\" (Sanders says she worked with a parent who spoke similarly to their child, who survived, but did did end up inflicting self-harm.)",
      "At the same time, Sanders says she wants viewers to understand that \"people are complex.\" She says, \"People like Kendra are more than the worst behavior they ever did.\"",
      "Together with UCLA psychologist Dr. Brenda Bursch, Sanders developed the ACCEPTS model for treatment and management of Munchausen by proxy. The acronym stands for ACknowledgement, Coping, Empathy, Parenting, Taking charge and Support.",
      "In the documentary, Kendra says that \"everybody\" breaks the law at some point. This leads Sanders to believe that even after serving time in jail, Kendra has still not truly acknowledged the gravity of her actions.",
      "\"Acknowledgement is first,\" Sanders says. \"So if we don't even get there, the rest don't even matter.\"",
      "\u201cUnknown Number\u201d: A Survivor's Perspective",
      "At the age of 22, Jordyn Hope (who uses they/them pronouns) realized while learning about Munchausen by proxy in college that they were actually a survivor of the disorder.",
      "Jordyn's mother, Donna, took Jordyn to the hospital as a child for reported seizures, iron deficiency, asthma, fevers, anorexia, neutropenia and other conditions.",
      "Now 30, Jordyn has spent years unraveling their childhood of abuse, digging through medical records, confronting pediatricians and even appearing on a televised episode of \"The Doctors\" with their mother.",
      "\"If I get triggered, I don't know if I need to go to the ER or just take a Tylenol,\" says Jordyn, who now works as an independent contractor for Munchausen Support. \"It's definitely a journey.\"",
      "As Jordyn watched \"Unknown Number,\" they say they remember thinking, \"Whoa. I relate to this.\" Seeing Lauryn\u2019s face freeze while learning that her mother was the source of the cyberbullying has haunted Jordyn.",
      "\"One of the big things that really, really struck me was this sense of identity and having believed this whole time that it's you and Mom against the world, that it's you and Mom that are best friends, that Mom is helping you through this really, really hard, scary thing ... and then to find out Mom was actually doing these things to you,\" Jordyn says.",
      "Like Kendra, Donna was present at many of Jordyn's activities, coaching gymnastics and cheerleading \u2014 even winning the \"Best Mom\" title at Jordyn's beauty pageant. Donna died last year, leading to a complicated grieving process for Jordyn, who still occasionally texted and called their mom until the end.",
      "Jordyn completely understands why Lauryn still loves her mom and wants to communicate with her.",
      "\"Even when your mom does the seemingly most evil things you could imagine, you still saw your mom laugh. You were still comforted when your mom hugged you. There was still this good mom that cared so much,\" Jordyn shares, their voice wavering.",
      "\"I imagine most people watch that documentary and think, how could Lauryn still love her mom?\" Jordyn says. \"I just want to tell her that anything she's thinking or feeling is OK. She didn't do anything wrong. When you're a victim to something like this, there's nothing that you could have done wrong.\""

      "M\u00e4rtha Louise is currently fourth in line for the Norwegian throne after her nephew Prince Sverre Magnus. She is also the host of the \u201cHeartSmart Conversations\u201c podcast and in 2021, she released a reality series about her life titled \u201cM\u00e4rtha.\u201d Verrett appeared in the series, per IMDb.",
      "M\u00e4rtha Louise has three children from her previous marriage with the late author and playwright Ari Behn, whom she divorced in 2017 after 14 years of marriage.",
      "Shaman Durek Verrett is a divorced \u201c6th generation shaman,\u201d who aims to redefine what wellness means \u201cby putting the power back into the hands of the people, so that they may live consciously, authentically, and in alignment,\u201d his official website reads.",
      "In an interview with Vanity Fair, Verrett defined \u201cshaman\u201d as a \u201cperson who\u2019s here to bridge back the spiritual world and the physical world in a tangible way that makes sense in the here and now. And also to give you tools so that you can be able to explore yourself, see yourself, know yourself, love yourself, and be who you truly came here to be.\u201d",
      "Verrett is also the host of the podcast \u201cAncient Wisdom Today\u201d and author of \"Spirit Hacking: Shamanic Keys to Reclaim Your Personal Power, Transform Yourself, and Light Up the World.\u201d",

      "M\u00e4rtha Louise, who once managed an alternative therapy center that taught clairvoyance and how to speak to angels, per Reuters, quickly became friends with Verrett.",
      "What have they said about their relationship?",
      "In an Aug. 14, episode of \u201cHeartSmart Conversations,\u201d the couple opened up about their relationship and revealed what they like about each other.",
      "\u201cI love Durek\u2019s wisdom and humor and his depth, and that we can talk about any topic under the sun and that he always sees me, and always wants to evolve. I love that about you,\u201d M\u00e4rtha Louise said, adding that he\u2019s also \u201cvery handsome as well.\u201d",

      "Why have they faced controversy?",
      "M\u00e4rtha Louise and Verrett have faced criticism through the years for their alternative beliefs and their relationship.",
      "Some of Verrett\u2019s beliefs have come under fire. For example, in his 2019 book, he made the claim that childhood cancer is caused by unhappiness. Following scandal, the Norwegian publisher attached to the project declined to publish it in Norway.",
      "In a post on Facebook, mayor of Oslo criticized Verrett for selling a $222 \u201cspirit optimizer\u201d on his website, which Verrett says can do things like \u201cenergize your food and drinks so they assimilate into your body more easily\u201d and \u201charmonize your space.\u201d",
      "In a joint interview with Vanity Fair, the couple said they receive hate online.",

      "\u201cPeople are very angry,\u201d M\u00e4rtha Louise added. \u201cThey think that he has put a spell on me, that he\u2019s an awful person. There\u2019s people writing like, \u2018I don\u2019t trust his eyes. Look at his evil eyes.\u2019 They write that a lot. \u2018It\u2019s shameful. It\u2019s terrible. You should never be a part of the royal family being with a Shaman. What is that? Everything he does is just phony and it\u2019s false. How don\u2019t you see through that? It\u2019s terrible. You\u2019re a disgrace.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd of course, with him being Black and I\u2019m being white, you get all that kind of hate as well,\u201d she continued.",
      "Speaking to Vanity Fair, M\u00e4rtha Louise said the relationship opened her eyes to racism in Norway. \u201cBefore I met him, I never thought that there was racism in Norway, because we\u2019re all an open, happy family. But basically, there are not that many people of color in Norway, so it was all a surprise to me,\u201d she said.",
      "The Royal House of Norway condemned racist backlash in a statement in its website, saying, \u201cWe deplore the racist attitudes that Durek Verrett has had to contend with, especially on social media. We consider it a strength that the Royal House reflects Norway\u2019s ethnic diversity.\u201d",
      "M\u00e4rtha Louise also provided a statement on the Royal House of Norway\u2019s website clarifying her beliefs in alternative medicine, saying she is \u201cgrateful\u201d for the country\u2019s health care system, but also thinks \u201cfor many people alternative methods can be an important supplement to help from the conventional medical establishment.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am aware that many people follow what I do and say very closely. My title entails a certain responsibility. It is therefore important to me, including in my business activity, to distinguish between myself as a private person on the one hand and as a member of the Royal Family on the other. Sometimes I stumble, and am grateful to receive supportive advice along the way,\u201d she wrote.",
      "What is the couple\u2019s status as royals?",
      "In November 2022, following controversy around their engagement, M\u00e4rtha Louise said she would no longer officially represent the Norwegian royal house, but would still retain her title.",
      "\u201cThe process with the family has been amicable and loving,\u201d the caption read. As part of her message, she also wrote, \u201cDurek has a right to his autonomy and to speak his mind like everyone else.\u201d",
      "In the same video, Verrett addressed controversy his beliefs stirred.",
      "\u201cI know that some of the things I have said and done have been seen as controversial in Norway. Some have said this has become a problem in Norway. I want to be clear this was never my intention. I wish Martha\u2019s family well and want to do my part to support them in their roles,\u201d he said, but maintained he has a \u201cright to autonomy.\u201d",
      "The Royal House of Norway, in a statement, explained the decision. \u201cThe objective is both to prevent misunderstandings regarding the Royal House and to allow the Princess and Durek Verrett greater freedom in their business activities and other parts of their lives,\u201d a statement read.",
      "The Royal House of Norway shared details about Verrett\u2019s specific role in the monarchy.",
      "\u201cWhen Durek Verrett and Princess M\u00e4rtha Louise are married, Mr Verrett will become a part of the Royal Family, the website said, as M\u00e4rtha Louise\u2019s last husband Ari Behn was. \u201cBut in accordance with tradition he will not have a title or represent the Royal House of Norway.\u201d"

      "\u201cToday, to revive the hope of peace for the Palestinians and Israelis, and a two state solution, the United Kingdom formally recognizes the State of Palestine,\u201d British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a statement.",

      "The move, which is largely symbolic, grants the Palestinians increased diplomatic standing and the potential for treaty-making.",

      "Britain's decision has angered its close ally Israel, as well as the United States, which argues that recognition emboldens extremists and rewards Hamas, the group that led the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks on Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and around 250 were taken hostage, marking a major escalation in the decadeslong conflict.",

      "\u201cAs you know, I did not, absolutely not, say the \u2018P word\u2019 about you but understand it was reported that I did,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI know you feel hellaciously let down by me. You have always been a steadfast, generous and supreme friend to me and my family.\u201d",
      "The duchess was \u201ctaken in\u201d by Epstein\u2019s lies, her spokesperson said Sunday.",
      "\u201cAs soon as she was aware of the extent of the allegations against him, she not only cut off contact but condemned him publicly, to the extent that he then threatened to sue her for defamation for associating him with pedophilia.\u201d",
      "The spokesperson said Ferguson stood by her public condemnation of Epstein. \u201cThis email was sent in the context of advice the Duchess was given to try to assuage Epstein and his threats,\u201d the spokesperson added",
      "Epstein was found dead by suicide in 2019 while he was awaiting a trial on sex-trafficking charges in New York.",
      "Andrew returned his military affiliations and royal patronages in January 2022 after his lawyers failed to persuade a U.S. judge to dismiss Giuffre\u2019s lawsuit.",
      "Andrew later paid a substantial sum to Giuffre, who alleged he abused her when she was 17. Andrew has repeatedly denied the allegation.",

      "President Donald Trump has said he hopes to see Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan returned to U.S. control, suggesting a renewed American presence in the country now again ruled by the Taliban.",
      "\"We're trying to get it back,\" Trump said of Bagram during a news conference Thursday alongside British Prime Minister Keir Starmer that capped a whirlwind state visit to the United Kingdom.",
      "Taking aim at the Biden administration's fraught withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan as a \"total disaster,\" Trump criticized the decision to relinquish Bagram Airfield, which quickly fell under the control of the Taliban as they swept back into power in 2021.",
      "\"We gave it to them for nothing,\" said Trump, who has long criticized the Biden administration's handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. \"We want that base back,\" he said.",
      "About an hour's drive north of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, Bagram served for years as a crucial hub in the war against the Taliban and Al Qaeda. At its peak around 2012, the sprawling airfield saw more than 100,000 U.S. troops pass through its compound.",
      "Late Thursday, Zakir Jalaly, an official at the Afghan Foreign Ministry, dismissed the idea of Bagram returning to the U.S.",
      "\u201cAfghanistan and the U.S. need to interact with each other and can have economic and political relations based on mutual respect and common interests,\u201d Jalaly said on the social platform X. \u201cThe Afghans have not accepted a military presence in history, and this possibility was completely rejected during the Doha talks and agreement, but the door is open for further interaction.\u201d",
      "Trump made clear at least one motivating factor for his interest in reclaiming Bagram, noting its proximity to rival superpower China.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons,\u201d Trump said during his comments Thursday, which came a day before he was spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping amid ongoing trade negotiations.",
      "Addressing journalists later on Air Force One, Trump said Bagram was \"one of the most powerful bases in the world in terms of runway strength and length,\" adding: \"You could land anything there.\" He emphasized again that the base was \"an hour away from where they make their missiles \u2014 China.\"",
      "Addressing Trump's comments Friday, Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that China \"respects Afghanistan\u2019s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.",
      "\"Afghanistan\u2019s future should be decided by its own people,\" Lin said, adding: \"Stirring up tension and creating confrontation in the region won\u2019t be popular.\"",
      "China, which has made strides in rapidly expanding its nuclear stockpile, is estimated to have accumulated about 600 warheads, according to the Chicago-based nonprofit Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.",
      "Of course, greater surveillance on China wouldn't be the only advantage to regaining Bagram.",
      "A presence at the base could also aid in regional counterterrorism efforts, among other factors that could appeal to Trump.",
      "It remains unclear to what extent, if any, the U.S. has been in talks with the Taliban on the future of Bagram.",
      "\u201cEven if the Taliban considered this, China most certainly would do everything it can to entice the Taliban to keep the U.S. out of Afghanistan and has far more leverage and enticements to make this happen,\" Bill Roggio, editor of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies\u2019 Long War Journal, cautioned in comments shared online Thursday.",
      "\"The Trump administration should be very careful not to grant the Taliban concessions only to be prevented access to Bagram in the end,\" he said.",
      "The Taliban have been working to rehabilitate their global standing, with the militant group freeing American George Glezmann, a Delta Air Lines mechanic, in March amid efforts to normalize relations between Afghanistan and the U.S.",
      "On Friday, the Taliban also released British couple Barbie Reynolds, 76, and her husband, Peter Reynolds, 80, who were detained by the Interior Ministry in February, according to Sky News, NBC News' sister outlet in the United Kingdom.",
      "Trump's comments came as the Pentagon continues to push ahead with a review into the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, during which 13 U.S. service members and 170 Afghans were killed at Kabul's airport in a bombing by the Islamic State terrorist group.",
      "Trump, who began the process for the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan during his first term, has been a fierce critic of the Biden administration's handling of the drawdown.",
      "The White House under President Joe Biden largely blamed the Trump administration for the chaotic withdrawal, with a National Security Council report released in 2023 arguing that Biden's options for executing the operation were \"severely constrained by conditions created by his predecessor.\""

    "summary": "A message from first Czech President Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk was sealed in an envelope before his death in 1937 and unveiled in a live broadcast Friday.",
    "story": [
      "\u201cIt is the end, but I\u2019m not afraid.\u201d",
      "That's the message delivered Friday to a nation on tenterhooks, sealed for nearly a century inside an envelope thought to carry its founding father's final words.",
      "The words of Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk \u2014 the first president of an independent Czechoslovakia, which has since split into Czechia and Slovakia \u2014 were unveiled in a live broadcast attended by current Czech President Petr Pavel.",
      "Speculation had gone into overdrive prior to the announcement, with experts wondering whether Masaryk may have conveyed a fateful warning before Europe's descent back into war. His words are believed to have been dictated to his son Jan, surviving both World War II and subsequent communist rule.",
      "Jan\u2019s former secretary handed the envelope to the National Archives in 2005 on the condition that it not be opened for another 20 years.",
      "Even the Masaryk family did not know what mystery the white envelope contained. But when it was opened early Friday, it still managed to surprise.",
      "Inside was another yellow envelope, containing five pages of handwritten notes in Czech and English (Masaryk's wife, Charlotte Garrigue, was born in the United States.)",
      "Rather than a final message before his death in 1937, experts assessed that the message was instead dictated three years earlier.",
      "\u201cI am ill, seriously ill \u2014 it is the end, but I am not afraid. You will continue the work, you know how, but you must be careful. You know how to behave; I don\u2019t need to tell you anything more,\u201d the letter read, according to the country's official broadcaster.",
      "At the time, Masaryk was gravely ill after a stroke, and those around him thought his days were numbered.",
      "Masaryk became the first president of Czechoslovakia in 1918 after it declared independence from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which was defeated in World War I. He served until 1935. Jan became foreign minister at the end of World War II, until his sudden death in 1948.",
      "In the envelope, Masaryk talked extensively about his death and subsequent funeral and reflected on the complex political situation in the ethnically diverse country.",
      "As well as derisive comments about a Slovak politician, he urged keeping the German minority part of the state. \u201cGive them what they deserve, but no more,\u201d he said of the Germans, according to the state broadcaster.",
      "\u201c[This was a] crucial time in Czechoslovakia with Hitler just coming to power in Germany,\u201d said Mark Cornwall, an emeritus professor of modern European history at the University of Southampton in England.",
      "\u201cIt was a very turbulent period in Europe about what was going to happen,\u201d said Cornwall, nodding to the Nazis' subsequent annexation of the Sudetenland, a Czech region that had a significant German-speaking population, and the later outbreak of World War II.",
      "\u201cMasaryk is still very revered\u201d in the country, Cornwall told NBC News in a telephone interview. \u201cI can\u2019t think of an American equivalent. Perhaps he\u2019s George Washington or Abraham Lincoln.\u201d"

      "Israel has emerged as \u201ca regional killer of journalists, with repeated incidents in Gaza, Lebanon, Iran, and now Yemen confirming Israel\u2019s longstanding pattern of labeling journalists as terrorists or propagandists to justify their killings,\u201d said CPJ's regional program director, Sara Qudah.",
      "CPJ, which distinguishes journalists from other media workers, said it has determined that at least nine of the 31 who worked for the two media outlets are journalists, and is still investigating details on other press members.",
      "Israel has repeatedly denied targeting journalists.",
      "When asked for comment on the killing of journalists and media workers, the IDF referred NBC News to a statement issued after the strike, in which it accused the Houthis' \"public relations department\" of leading \"propaganda efforts\" and \"psychological terror.\"",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said the strikes were a response to the repeated Houthi attacks and followed a drone launched by the Houthis that breached Israel\u2019s multilayered air defenses and slammed into an airport in the south.",
      "The Houthis, a religious and military group that controls most of Yemen\u2019s northwest including the capital, Sanaa, have been launching missiles and drones at Israel since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led terrorist attacks in Israel and the ensuing war in Gaza.",
      "The war in Gaza has been one of the bloodiest for media workers, and reporters across the Middle East have come under fire as tensions spill beyond the strip.",
      "Israeli strikes have killed at least 193 Palestinian journalists and media workers in Gaza since the war there began, alongside six in Lebanon, three in Iran, and now 31 in Yemen, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.",
      "\u201cIsrael is engaging in the deadliest and most deliberate effort to kill and silence journalists that CPJ has ever documented,\u201d its website reads.",
      "The Foreign Press Association, which represents international media in Israel and the Palestinian territories, has also called on Israel \u201cto halt its abhorrent practice of targeting journalists.\u201d",

      "The deadliest attack on the press recorded by the CPJ was the 2009 Maguindanao massacre in the Philippines, in which 32 journalists were among those killed when a convoy was ambushed."

      "Trump has also been unwilling to impose further sanctions on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine, despite repeated threats.",
      "The President said last week he was \"ready to do major sanctions on Russia,\" once NATO nations had \"agreed, and started, to do the same thing,\" and criticized allies for continuing to purchase Russian oil.",
      "Estonia and the United States are members of NATO, which at its core is a mutual defense pact formed after World War II to counter the threat posed by the Soviet Union, meaning an attack on one may be considered an attack on all.",
      "Friday's incident marked the third incursion into NATO airspace linked to Russia in ten days.",
      "On Sept. 10, Poland reported Russian drones entering its territory, triggering the first Article 4 request this month. Four days later, Romania scrambled jets to respond to a Russian drone breach. Romania did not invoke Article 4.",
      "Moscow downplayed the incident, saying it had \u201cno plans to target\u201d facilities in Poland, but Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said it was \u201cthe closest we have been to open conflict since World War II.\u201d",
      "Trump, again, offered a more muted response, saying the suspected incursion \"could have been a mistake.\"",
      "His acting U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Dorothy Shea, sought to reassure allies. Violating the airspace of a U.S. ally, \u201cintentionally or otherwise,\u201d showed \u201cimmense disrespect for good-faith U.S. efforts to bring an end to this conflict,\u201d she told the U.N. Security Council.",
      "\"Rest assured, we will defend every inch of NATO territory,\" she added.",
      "Moscow has not commented on the Romanian claims.",
      "Brett Erickson, a sanctions expert and adviser to Loyola University\u2019s Chicago School of Law, warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin was testing the West\u2019s resolve, and battlefield readiness.",
      "\u201cIf the West hesitates, Russia will keep testing, probing, and collecting data on our response,\u201d he told NBC News via email. \u201cEvery incursion is a rehearsal. Unless we act decisively now, we are training Moscow to believe NATO is predictable, divided, and slow.\u201d",
      "The divergence between Europe's urgent stance and Trump's restraint comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pressed Washington for stronger measures, who has urged Trump to take a clearer position on Moscow.",
      "\"If the war continues and there are no movements towards peace, we expect sanctions,\" he told reporters Friday evening, adding that he expects Trump to take such actions.",
      "Russian air strikes killed at least three people and wounded dozens more as it launched a large-scale missile and drone attack across multiple Ukrainian regions on Friday night.",
      "Poland said it scrambled jets overnight to ensure \"maximum readiness\" and safety in areas bordering the parts of Ukraine under attack.",
      "Loyala's Erickson said sanctions were essential, and must be \u201call-out\u201d and \u201call-together,\u201d urging Washington to align with its allies.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump must put his foot down,\u201d he said. \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d"

    "summary": "After it was barred from the Eurovision Song Contest Russia is reviving a Soviet-era version of the camp competition.",
    "story": [
      "Perhaps the Eurovision ban is starting to bite, because three years after Russia was booted from the beloved song contest following the country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, it is reviving a Soviet-era version of the camp competition.",
      "The Intervision Song Contest will see 23 artists from around the world \u2014 including one representing the U.S. \u2014 offer a heady mix of musical styles, from moody Belarusian pop to Colombian folk and high-energy Vietnamese rap at an arena in the capital of Moscow on Saturday night.",
      "Unlike the Eurovision Song Contest, which mainly includes European countries and a few others like Australia and Israel, Intervision bills itself as a truly global event by offering artists from countries around the world, including those in the Global South, a chance to compete for the top prize of 30 million rubles (roughly $360,000).",
      "\u201cBack in the Soviet times, the government would decide to promote a positive image of Russia abroad. We need to promote an objective image. We want to be known with all our merits and shortcomings,\u201d Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told a news conference this week in response to a presubmitted question from NBC News.",
      "Asked whether Russia was using the competition as an exercise in soft power, he replied, \u201cIf by soft power you mean the opportunity to let people know about us, then of course we\u2019re interested in this.\u201d",
      "A pop phenomenon drawing around 160 million viewers each May, Eurovision began at the height of the Cold War in 1956 as a technical experiment to try and broadcast a simultaneous program across the member stations of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).",
      "A divided continent had mirror organizations like the NATO defense alliance in Western Europe and the Warsaw Pact in Eastern Europe, and the EBU in the West matched by the International Radio and Television Organisation (OIRT) on the other side of the Iron Curtain.",
      "In answer to Eurovision came Intervision, which was broadcast by the OIRT on several occasions between 1965 and 1980, with contests held in what was then Czechoslovakia and later in Poland.",
      "But Dean Vuletic, who has written and edited books on Eurovision and led a research project on Intervision, says Russia is getting its history wrong with the relaunch, \u201cpresenting Intervision as something that was Russian- or Soviet-led, but it actually wasn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Instead, he said, the competitions \u201cweren\u2019t that focused on the Soviet participants,\u201d although they had to be invited. Having studied the archives of Czech and Polish TV stations, he said it was \u201castonishing how critical they are of the Soviet participants.\u201d",
      "He added that it was actually created during a period of liberalization in an attempt \u201cto promote East-West cooperation in popular music and television,\u201d and Western performers like Gloria Gaynor were invited to perform in the intervals. Performers from Eastern Europe were also hoping to be signed by Western labels, he added.",
      "Before it was kicked out in 2022 after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia was frequently a top-10 finalist at Eurovision, which Vuletic called \u201ca huge platform for cultural diplomacy for any country,\u201d big or small.",
      "The country\u2019s leaders \u201csaw it as a very prestigious cultural project and one which could reach a huge amount of people,\u201d he added.",
      "But Eurovision\u2019s embrace of LGBTQ rights drew the ire of conservative Russian lawmakers and the country\u2019s Orthodox Church, particularly after the 2014 victory of bearded drag queen Conchita Wurst.",
      "Saturday\u2019s Intervision contest is getting a full-court press promotion from organizers, who have drafted a series of celebrity \u201cambassadors\u201d to get the word out. Among them are Dima Bilan, a Russian singer who won Eurovision in 2008, and Alexander Ovechkin, the Washington Capitals hockey star, who holds the record for most goals scored in NHL history.",
      "The goal is to \u201cpromote universal, spiritual, family, cultural, ethical, and religious traditions of different nations,\u201d according to the competition\u2019s website, although that seems potentially at odds with the entrant representing the U.S., Vassy, who has a history of performing at Pride events and supporting LGBTQ rights.",
      "Vassy, an Australian-born singer living in Los Angeles, has been a vocalist on dance tracks from David Guetta and Ti\u00ebsto, while several of her own topped Billboard\u2019s Dance Club Songs chart in the 2010s.",
      "The 42-year-old, whose real name is Vasiliki Karagiorgos, was a last-minute addition to the contest after the previous selection pulled out due to \u201cunforeseen family circumstances.\u201d",
      "Her outlook is markedly different from that of Russia\u2019s entrant, Shaman, who mixes politics and pop and rose in popularity after he became a strident supporter of the war in Ukraine.",
      "So vocal is his backing of the Kremlin that he has ended up on Australian and European Union sanction lists.",
      "Russia will be hoping that Shaman\u2019s popularity can bring a younger audience to the contest as well as his fans, many of whom are based outside major Russian metropolises like Moscow and St. Petersburg, according to Yulia Yurtaeva-Martens, a researcher at the Free University of Berlin who has written a book on Intervision.",
      "With his fulsome embrace of Russian nationalism in his music and performances, Shaman is viewed by the government as \u201ca new political symbol for new audiences,\u201d according to Yurtaeva-Martens, adding that it was unlikely they would have chosen anyone else because he \u201cwas the best choice for the Russian government.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Kenya\u2019s Sanaipei Tande is competing with her song \u201cFlavour,\u201d an Afropop tune that mixes English and Kiswahili.",
      "In between rehearsals in Moscow, she said in a Zoom interview this week that she hadn\u2019t heard of Intervision before this year and was only really familiar with Eurovision because 2011\u2019s contest had featured Norwegian-Kenyan singer Stella Mwangi.",
      "For artists who may have had success at home, performing at Intervision is a chance to step onto a larger stage, she said. In her case, this is both metaphorically and literally true because \u201cthe live arena is so huge.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen any stage in my country that\u2019s this big,\u201d she said, adding that coming to the Russian capital \u201cto compete against other international artists \u2014 that, for me, has put me on a whole new level.\u201d",
      "The fact she had been selected and was representing Kenya was a victory in itself, she said.",
      "\u201cI mean, $300,000 wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing to add on to that,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cBut just being here and being able to perform on this stage and experiencing things on a whole new level, that already is a win.\u201d"

      "Trump summarized their conversation, which he said began at 8 a.m. ET, in a Truth Social post in which he said he appreciates \u201cthe TikTok approval,\u201d but stopped short of announcing any kind of finalized deal. As expected, the call also appeared to touch on the ongoing trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies.",
      "\u201cI just completed a very productive call with President Xi of China. We made progress on many very important issues including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal,\u201d Trump wrote.",
      "For more on this story, listen to \u2018Here\u2019s the Scoop,\u2019 a daily evening podcast that brings you a fresh take on the day\u2019s top stories in 15 minutes or less.",
      "Trump said that he agreed with Xi that they would meet at the Oct. 31-Nov. 1 APEC summit in South Korea, that Trump would go to China early next year, and that Xi would eventually come to the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe call was a very good one, we will be speaking again by phone, appreciate the TikTok approval, and both look forward to meeting at APEC!\u201d the president wrote.",
      "The White House is not disputing the characterization that there is no final TikTok deal. An announcement on a final deal would ultimately come from the president, a White House official said.",
      "Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office Friday afternoon, Trump offered some mixed messages on the status of TikTok talks. He said Xi \"approved the TikTok deal,\" and then said \"we look forward to getting that deal closed.\"",
      "Asked directly if the deal was fully approved, Trump said, \"Well, I think so. I mean \u2014 when you say fully approved, I don\u2019t know what that means. We have to get, we have to get it signed. I guess it could be a formality.\"",
      "He added that \"the TikTok deal is well on its way.\"",
      "Separately, Chinese state media said Trump and Xi had a \u201ccandid and in-depth exchange of views\u201d and that the call was \u201cpragmatic, positive, and constructive.\u201d Xi said the U.S. should avoid taking restrictive trade measures \u201cto prevent undermining the outcomes achieved through multiple rounds of consultations,\u201d according to a readout published by Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency.",
      "On TikTok, Xi said the Chinese government \u201crespects the will of companies and is pleased to see companies conduct business negotiations on the basis of market rules and reach solutions that comply with Chinese laws and regulations and balance interests,\u201d the readout said.",
      "\u201cWe hope the U.S. side will provide an open, fair, and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies investing in the United States,\u201d it said.",
      "In a statement, TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, thanked Xi and Trump \u201cfor their efforts to preserve TikTok in the United States\u201d and said it will \u201cwork in accordance with applicable laws to ensure TikTok remains available to American users through TikTok U.S.\u201d",
      "Friday's call was the first between Trump and Xi since June, when Trump said they had spoken for about 90 minutes in a discussion focused on trade.",
      "At the height of trade tensions in April, U.S. and Chinese tariff rates reached as high as 145%, in what amounted to a mutual trade embargo. Since then they have been lowered under another \u201cframework\u201d deal, with new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods capped at 30%, while China imposes a 10% additional tariff on U.S. goods.",
      "The lower tariff rates are set to expire on Nov. 10 unless a deal is reached or the trade truce is extended again.",
      "The two countries also continue to tussle over export controls on strategically important products such as rare earths, which China has a near-monopoly over, and U.S. chip technology.",
      "TikTok, which is estimated to have about 170 million active users in the U.S., faces a ban unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, agrees to sell the app\u2019s U.S. assets to U.S. owners. The sale is required under a law Congress passed last year, citing national security concerns.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump formally extended the deadline for a TikTok deal for a fourth time, until Dec. 16, a day after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Beijing and Washington had struck a \u201cframework\u201d for an agreement, without providing details such as who would be taking over TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations.",
      "Trump has gone back and forth on the ban, but he credits TikTok with helping him win last year\u2019s presidential election and has expressed concern about alienating its huge and youthful user base. He said Thursday during a visit to the U.K. that the app \u201chas tremendous value\u201d and that \u201cvery rich people and companies are going to be owning it.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials have said the TikTok sale is necessary because of Chinese laws that require Chinese companies to share data requested by the government. They also cite concerns about data collection and the algorithm the app uses to recommend content to users, which they say is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese officials.",
      "TikTok denies sharing user data with Chinese authorities and says the U.S. has never provided evidence of Beijing trying to manipulate the algorithm.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance say the powerful algorithm, which has helped fuel the app\u2019s global success, is proprietary and thus difficult to sell to a U.S. company under Chinese law.",
      "There are concerns that TikTok may continue to use the Chinese algorithm in the U.S.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., the committee\u2019s ranking member, have both expressed opposition to any deal that keeps the algorithm under Chinese control or allows ByteDance to maintain an operational relationship with the new American TikTok.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has all the leverage he needs to strike a deal that saves TikTok and complies with the law \u2014 which means making sure TikTok\u2019s data and algorithm are truly in American hands,\u201d Krishnamoorthi said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Any deal would most likely need to be approved by Congress as well as ByteDance\u2019s board.",
      "Compared with five years ago, when Trump first called for a ban during his first term, TikTok is more mature as a platform and less likely to keep growing, said Dimitar Gueorguiev, an associate professor of political science and director of Chinese studies at Syracuse University.",
      "\u201cTikTok is, I think, a less valuable bargaining chip from the Chinese perspective, and an easier concession,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, for the United States, it\u2019s as visible and kind of politically salient as ever.\u201d",
      "While the details of the TikTok deal remain unclear, Gueorguiev said, the broader question is \u201ccan the Trump administration, as well as their counterparts in Beijing, convert on whatever progress we observe today and keep it going\u201d to achieve a \u201clarger bargain\u201d between the U.S. and China.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re thinking about what is the ultimate outcome of this, and who wins and who loses, there\u2019s still a lot to be told,\u201d he said."

      "Hailing the \u201cunbreakable bond\u201d between the two nations, Trump said ties between America and the U.K. were \u201cpriceless\u201d and that the two governments were \u201cmaking those ties closer than ever before.\u201d",
      "Starmer has lavished Trump with praise and royal pomp in a bid to curry favor with Washington as Britain looks to deepen its economic ties with the United States, ease tariffs and hold difficult conversations on a range of thorny issues \u2014 including Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza and Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "The pair held a joint news conference in one of Chequers' grandest rooms Thursday ahead of Trump's return home and continued to emphasize their countries' long and close ties.

      "\"We need aid to get into Gaza at speed. And so it\u2019s within that context of a plan for peace, which we\u2019re working hard on ... that the question of recognition needs to be seen,\" he said. \"It\u2019s part of that overall package which hopefully takes us from the appalling situation we\u2019re in now to the outcome of a safe and secure Israel, which we do not have.\"",
      "They agreed that more pressure to end the war in Ukraine needed to be placed on Russian President Vladimir Putin, although neither committed to new sanctions.",
      "Falling oil prices would force Putin's hand, Trump said, adding that \"Putin is going to drop out\" of the war in Ukraine if that happened.",
