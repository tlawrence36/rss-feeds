    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 16:02:29 -0500",
    "summary": "William E",
    "story": [
      "William E",
      "NEW YORK -- William E. Leuchtenburg, a prize-winning historian widely admired for his authoritative writings on the U.S. presidency and as the reigning scholar on Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal, has died at 102.",
      "Leuchtenburg died Tuesday at his home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, according to his son, Joshua A. Leuchtenburg, who cited no specific cause of death.",
      "A professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina and a published author for more than 70 years, William E. Leuchtenburg was praised for his encyclopedic knowledge and rigorous, but accessible style. He received some of the top awards given to historians, including the Parkman and Bancroft prizes, was a political analyst for CBS and NBC and consulted on several of Ken Burns' PBS documentaries. In 2008, he was given the Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. Award for \"Distinguished Writing\" of American history.",
      "Leuchtenburg's notable books include \"Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal\" and \"The Perils of Prosperity,\" a history of the U.S. from World War I to the peak of the Great Depression. Although politically liberal, his expertise called upon by aides to Lyndon Johnson and other Democratic politicians, he was as willing to point out the New Deal\u2019s disappointments as its successes: His scholarship was closely studied by younger FDR historians, from Jonathan Alter to Burns collaborator Geoffrey Ward, who dedicated the 2014 book \u201cThe Roosevelts\u201d to Leuchtenburg. And he was otherwise known for his generosity with Ward and others who sought his expertise.",
      "His most influential work was likely the Bancroft-winning \u201cFranklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal,\u201d published in 1963. Leuchtenburg found that the impact of FDR's vast and unprecedented response to the Depression was limited by political calculation, especially the president's reluctance to challenge racial segregation in the South, and that \u201cIt never demonstrated that it could achieve prosperity\" until the U.S. entered World War II. But he also credited the New Deal with transforming the role of federal government and Roosevelt with reinventing the presidency, using the young medium of radio to convince millions that he knew them personally.",
      "\u201cNothing is glossed over at all,\u201d The New York Times\u2019 Charles Poore wrote upon the book\u2019s release. \u201cYou live here through years of tumult and disaster, triumph and ineptitude and daring.\u201d",
      "Leuchtenburg's books on Roosevelt covered his presidency and beyond. \"In the Shadow of FDR,\" published in 1983 and periodically updated, demonstrated how presidents from Truman to George W. Bush attempted to shun and/or embrace Roosevelt's legacy. Leuchtenburg wrote of Roosevelt's immediate successor, Harry Truman, gesturing in the White House to a portrait of FDR and admitting, \"I'm trying to do what he would like.\" He noted the frustration of Republican Dwight Eisenhower and Democrat John F. Kennedy in being compared, unfavorably, to Roosevelt, and how Jimmy Carter began his 1976 presidential run with a speech in Warm Springs, Georgia, where FDR often stayed. At the time of his death, Leuchtenburg was working on an edition that would have included the administration of Joe Biden, who kept a portrait of Roosevelt in the Oval Office.",
      "The 2005 book \"The White House Looks South\" featured sections on Roosevelt, Truman and Lyndon Johnson and told of how each embraced or distanced themselves from the South. Roosevelt, a native of New York, spent so much time in Warm Springs that the state's governor referred to him as our \"fellow-Georgian.\" Johnson, a Texan, alternately identified himself as a Southerner or a Westerner, depending on the intended audience.",
      "In the prologue, Leuchtenburg fondly noted his own journey, remembering visits to baseball spring training camps in Florida, marching with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in Montgomery, Alabama, and never failing on New Year's Day to partake of black-eyed peas and collard greens, \"even if they are eaten with a grimace.\"",
      "\"In sum, I am in, but not of, the South,\" he concluded.",
      "He was a popular and rigorous educator \u2014 sometimes referred to as \u201cThe Big L\u201d \u2014 who taught at Smith College, Harvard University and Columbia University before settling at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the early 1980s. A former president of the American Historical Association and the Organization of American Historians, he held such stature that he contributed to later editions of \"The Growth of the American Republic,\" a standard college textbook originally written by Henry Steele Commager and Samuel Eliot Morison. Historians studying under him ranged from Allan Brandt to Howard Zinn.",
      "Leuchtenburg was married twice, most recently to Jean Anne Leuchtenburg, and had three children.",
      "A postal clerk's son born in New York City in 1922, William Edward Leuchtenburg was so fascinated by politics that at age 12, he raised money tutoring neighborhood kids to fund a nine-hour bus ride to Washington, where he would recall his \"wide-eyed\" tour of the White House and the \"brand-new marble palace of the U.S. Supreme Court.\"",
      "His affinity for Roosevelt was lifelong and personal. When he was 10, he sat by the radio and counted delegates as FDR was elected to his first term as president. He was able to afford college with help from a job found through a New Deal program, the National Youth Administration.",
      "Leuchtenburg graduated from Cornell University, received a master's degree and a doctorate from Columbia and worked for a civil rights lobby and other political organizations before deciding to focus on history. His first book, \u201cFlood Control Politics,\u201d came out in 1953, followed five years later by \u201cThe Perils of Prosperity.\u201d",
      "In recent years, Leuchtenburg wrote a short, critical biography of FDR\u2019s predecessor, Herbert Hoover, and the 900-page \u201cThe American President: From Teddy Roosevelt to Bill Clinton.\u201d He continued to work every morning and, at age 101, completed \u201cPatriot Presidents,\u201d the first of a planned multi-volume history that he acknowledged in the book's preface \u201cmay be too ambitious.\u201d"

      "Superstar singer Rihanna has made her first appearance at the trial of her partner, rapper A$AP Rocky",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Rihanna appeared for the first time at the trial of her longtime partner A$AP Rocky, on the day of its most important testimony \u2014 the description by a former friend of the moment Rocky allegedly fired a gun at him.",
      "The singer superstar, who has two toddler sons with the rapper Rocky, sat out of view of the courtroom\u2019s cameras, between Rocky\u2019s mother and sister, in the downtown Los Angeles criminal courthouse. Security brought her in surreptitiously to avoid crowds Wednesday morning.",
      "Rocky, whose legal name is Rakim Athelston Mayers, has been standing trial on two felony charges that he fired a handgun at the former friend, who is known by the name A$AP Relli and was born Terell Ephron. If convicted, Rocky could get up to 24 years in prison.",
      "Rihanna watched Wednesday as Relli testified about the moment Rocky allegedly fired a gun at him on a Hollywood street in 2021.",
      "He had been shouting angrily at Rocky, who was walking away after an initial confrontation and scuffle, when Rocky pulled a gun from his waistband and held it in the air, Relli testified.",
      "\u201cHe turned around and then it was like BOOM!\u201d he told the jury. \u201cThe whole thing was like a movie, he kind of like pointed down and he shot the first shot.\"",
      "He said \u201cI felt my hand hot\u201d and later added, \u201cI was hit. Or I was grazed. I didn\u2019t have a hole or nothing.\u201d",
      "The trial's key witness said he grabbed one of their mutual friends who were with Rocky after the first shot was fired and stood behind him for protection. He said he did not see Rocky fire the second shot, and Rocky ran away moments later.",
      "When jurors were being selected, prosecutors asked them whether Rihanna\u2019s connection to the case, especially if she appeared in court, would affect their ability to deliver a guilty verdict.",
      "Nearly all those questioned had heard of her \u2014 far more than had heard of Rocky \u2014 and some described themselves as fans, but all said they felt it would not affect their decisions.",
      "It was not clear whether they could see Rihanna or were aware of her presence as they watched the testimony. She wore a long black dress with buttons on the front that resembled a winter overcoat, and had a pair of glasses on her head that she put on during the prosecution's questioning.",
      "Earlier in the trial, which began on Jan. 21, Relli said he and Rocky, members of A$AP, a crew of creators at a New York high school, had been close but their relationship eroded after Rocky became famous.",
      "He said their relationship had been strained for years and was getting worse in the days leading up to the incident, but he was still \u201cfurious\u201d when Rocky pulled a gun on him after a scuffle that began the moment the two met up near the W Hotel. He dared him to use it.",
      "When Rocky walked away, he testified that he followed and shouted after him, until the shots were fired.",
      "Rocky\u2019s lawyer says the shots he fired were not even from a real gun \u2014 they were blanks from a starter pistol that he carried as a prop. The lawyer said Relli knew this, and that was why he was so fearless walking after him.",
      "\u201cOh it was a real gun,\u201d Relli testified Wednesday, saying he knew because of his scraped hand.",
      "He said he felt free to follow and shout at Rocky because \u201cI felt like because he put it away and we\u2019re on a busy street in Hollywood. He\u2019s definitely not gonna shoot it.\u201d",
      "Since the shooting, and his decision to go to police and testify, he has gotten death threats and has been shunned as a snitch, he said, and the modest music management career he built fell apart.",
      "\u201cIt's been a living hell,\u201d Relli said.",
      "About an hour after the shooting, Relli returned to the scene and said he photographed and recovered two shell casings. Earlier, while responding to a report of a shooting, police did not find any.",
      "He sent a text to Rocky that was shown in court saying \"U try killing me.\"",
      "Rocky denied it in his reply.",
      "\u201cBro wtf is u talkin bout why u tell ppl I shot at u.\u201d",
      "He sent Rocky photos of the shell casings and his grazed hand.",
      "Rocky said he was making stuff up and speaking \u201call type of nonsense\u201d and was trying to \u201cextort\u201d him.",
      "The court day ended after just a few hours of testimony because of scheduling issues. Rihanna was shuffled out through a restricted exit by deputies, and Rocky left separately through the main courthouse doors.",
      "The defense will begin their cross-examination of Relli on Thursday.",
      "Raised in Harlem, Rocky\u2019s rap songs became a phenomenon in New York in 2011. He had his mainstream breakthrough when his first studio album went to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in 2013. The second one, in 2015, did the same.",
      "He\u2019s set to have his biggest career year as a multimedia star. This Sunday, he\u2019s nominated for a Grammy Award for best music video for his song \u201cTailor Swif,\u201d at the ceremony at Crypto.com Arena just two miles (3 kilometers) from the Los Angeles courthouse where his trial\u2019s being held.",
      "He\u2019s also set to headline the Rolling Loud Music Festival, to star opposite Denzel Washington in a film directed by Spike Lee, and to co-chair the Met Gala in May.",
      "But the prospect of a conviction and the possibility of a lengthy prison sentence casts a shadow over all of it.",
      "Rocky and Rihanna, both 36, have two sons together: 2-year-old RZA Athelston Mayers and 1-year-old Riot Rose Mayers. She revealed she was pregnant with the younger boy after headlining the Super Bowl halftime show in 2023 with a visible baby bump.",
      "The singer and the rapper, who are both fashion moguls, first became close when he provided a verse to her 2012 song \u201cCockiness (Love It)\u201d and they performed it at the MTV Video Music Awards. They became a couple in 2020.",

      "PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron announced Tuesday that the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d will get its own dedicated room inside the Louvre museum under a major renovation and expansion of the Paris landmark that will take up to 10 years.",
      "The renovation project, branded \u201cLouvre New Renaissance,\u201d will include a new entrance near the River Seine, to be opened by 2031, and the creation of underground rooms, Macron said in a speech from the Louvre room where Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece is displayed.",
      "Macron did not disclose an exact amount budgeted for the project to modernize the most visited museum in the world, plagued with overcrowding and outdated facilities. But it is estimated to reach up to 800 million euros ($834 million).",
      "The Louvre's latest overhaul dates back to the 1980s, when the iconic glass pyramid was unveiled. Now, the museum is not up to international standards anymore.",
      "A look at what's at stake:",
      "Macron said the expansion of the museum will allow the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d to be moved to a new, dedicated room accessible to visitors through a special ticket. That will make the visit simpler for those who want to see the painting and ease the life of other visitors in the rest of the museum, he said.",
      "The \u201cMona Lisa\u201d is now being shown behind protective glass in the museum\u2019s largest room, overcrowded with long, noisy queues of visitors eager to take a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s masterpiece. That makes some other paintings in the room by the greatest Venetian painters like Titian and Veronese go unnoticed by many.",
      "The museum\u2019s latest big renovation in the 1980s was designed to receive 4 million annual visitors.",
      "Last year, the Louvre received 8.7 million visitors, over three-quarters being foreigners mostly from the United States, China and neighboring countries Italy, the UK, Germany and Spain.",
      "Macron said a new entrance for the Louvre will be created near the River Seine by 2031, to be financed by ticket sales, patronage and licensing money from the museum's Abu Dhabi branch.",
      "A design competition is to be staged in the coming months, he said. In addition, some new underground rooms will be created to expand the museum.",
      "A French top official said the cost of the renovation is estimated at 700 to 800 million euros ($730 to 834 million) over the next ten years, including half for the creation of the new entrance. The official could not be named in line with the French presidency\u2019s customary practices.",
      "Macron said ticket prices will be raised for foreign visitors from outside the European Union, up from 22 euros ($23) now. He promised the museum will be safer and more comfortable for both the public and the staff.",
      "Half the Louvre's budget is currently being financed by the French state, including the wages of the 2,200 employees.",
      "The other half is provided by private funds including ticket sales, earnings from restaurants, shops and bookings for special events, as well as patrons and other partners.",
      "The renovation announcement comes after Louvre Director Laurence des Cars expressed her concerns in a note to Culture Minister Rachida Dati earlier this month saying the museum is threatened by \u201cobsolescence.\u201d",
      "According to the document first released by French newspaper Le Parisien, she warned about the gradual degradation of the building due to water leaks, temperature variations and other issues \u201cendangering the preservation of artworks.\u201d",
      "The pyramid that serves at the museum\u2019s entrance, unveiled in 1989 as part of late President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\u2019s project, now appears outdated. The place is not properly insulated from the cold and the heat and tends to amplify noise, making the space uncomfortable for both the public and the staff, des Cars stressed.",
      "In addition, the museum suffers from a lack of food offerings and restroom facilities, she said."

      "The Grammys will look a little bit different this year",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Grammy Awards will look a little bit different this week.",
      "Each year, the Recording Academy hosts a multitude of events to welcome the music industry during Grammy week and record labels do the same. However, many institutions have canceled their plans \u2014 Universal Music Group, Sony, Spotify, BMG and Warner Music Group among them \u2014 and instead are allocating resources to help those affected by the devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires.",
      "The Grammys will still take place on Sunday at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles but now will focus its attention on helping wildfire victims.",
      "Within days of fires ravaging the Pacific Palisades and Altadena neighborhoods, the Recording Academy and its affiliated MusiCares charity launched the Los Angeles Fire Relief Effort with a $1 million dollar donation. According to a letter sent to members on Jan. 13, thanks to additional contributions, they\u2019ve already distributed $2 million in emergency aid.",
      "Once the fund was set up, Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason jr. said they began focusing on reformatting what Grammy week would look like \u2014 many conversations conducted \u201con the road, mobile-y, virtually\u201d as staffers had evacuated their homes.",
      "\u201cThat process has really consisted of reaching out to just listen and learn from a lot of people \u2014 state officials, local officials, the governor\u2019s office, the mayor\u2019s office, the fire department. We talked to hotel managers, just really trying to get a grasp on what was happening currently. What did they project was going to happen in the next week to 10 days? Would be safe to have a show?\"",
      "Ultimately, the Recording Academy decided to condense its pre-Grammy week plans to just four events, each featuring a fundraising element.",
      "On Friday, MusiCares, an organization that helps music professionals who need financial, personal or medical assistance, will hold its annual Persons of the Year benefit gala\u2009celebrating the Grateful Dead.",
      "On Saturday, the Special Merit Awards Ceremony and Grammy nominees' reception will still take place, followed by Clive Davis' pre-Grammy fundraising event.",
      "Then the Grammys take the stage on Sunday.",
      "Events like the annual pre-Grammy Black Music Collective event, Grammy advocacy brunch, and others scheduled to take place at the immersive pop-up Grammy house have been canceled.",
      "\u201cWe thought consolidating the events would allow us to have more impact,\u201d Mason explains. \u201cAnd we just don\u2019t feel it was the right time to have social gatherings or places to party or schmooze and just hang out. We wanted to have our events be places that could be purposeful and impactful. Some of the party settings, we decided to fold down into our fundraising efforts.\u201d",
      "\u201cObviously, we can\u2019t have a normal show in the midst of people\u2019s belongings being burned or loss of life or other things like that. At the same time, canceling would not have helped,\u201d Mason says.",
      "\u201cWe needed to raise money. We needed to show unity and come together around music. We need to support the city of L.A. (Over) 6,500 people work on our shows and ancillary gatherings. So, once we decided to move forward, it was really a conversation with (Grammy producers) Ben Winston, Raj Kapoor and Jesse Collins and myself. And we started to think about, \u2018How do we make the show have the greatest impact?\u2019\u201d",
      "They decided the path forward was to still give out awards and host performances to give viewers and attendees a bespoke concert experience. But most importantly, the show could raise awareness, drive donations and resources to funds that benefit people in need.",
      "And the conversations are ongoing. \u201cWe have some great things in the show that will definitely help to raise funds,\" he assures. \"It will honor some of the heroes that have been protecting our lives and our homes. It will hopefully shine a light on some people that need more help and more services.\u201d",
      "Don't expect a traditional telethon, but he says the show will feature announcements and activations in the arena.",
      "\u201cHopefully we\u2019ll be talking about things that have been pledged from the sponsors or from the community,\u201d he adds.",
      "\u201cWe know right off the bat that we\u2019ve got almost 3,000 requests for help from our members or people in the music community,\u201d Mason says. \u201cSo that was just in the first few days.\u201d",
      "The immediate needs have been \u201cthe basics,\u201d as he explains. \u201cFood, water, shelter, the bare necessities to live.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe next phase will involve, you know, where they\u2019re going to live, how are they going to replace maybe damaged or destroyed instruments, studios. How will they make a living? I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be some mental health component that people may need assistance with. But it\u2019s really across the board. But the early, immediate relief is around just the bare necessities.\u201d",
      "There's no shortage of natural disasters, and they affect the music community too. Mason brings up the COVID-19 pandemic as a recent example. With MusiCares, they were able to contribute \u201cover $40 million to people who needed help.\u201d They have the infrastructure to provide assistance quickly.",
      "However, he notes, the Grammys are the first major award show taking place after the wildfires, which means \u201cthere's no playbook for this.\"",
      "\u201cBut I\u2019ve always said it all changes if the fires were to continue, or possibly got worse, or the winds changed. So, I always want to reserve that right. We\u2019re not going to go blindly forward if things are unsafe or if it feels inappropriate,\" he says.",
      "But consider the fundraising, the economic and financial impacts, and the possibility of unity, \u201cIt all makes sense for us to move forward.\u201d",

      "A federal judge has set a March 2026 trial date for actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni to resolve their claims stemming from their work on the movie \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- A New York judge set a March 2026 trial date on Monday and moved an initial conference from mid-February to next week as the public feud between Blake Lively and her \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d costar and director Justin Baldoni continued to grow and accelerate.",
      "And in a new and separate front in the series of legal battles surrounding the film that became a surprise hit last summer, Lively in a Texas court filed a request for a deposition of a man she says was central to turning online sentiment against her during its release and promotion.",
      "The New York federal judge, Lewis J. Liman, told both sides in an order late Monday to prepare for a March 9, 2026, trial.",
      "He also moved an initial conference from mid-February to next week and told lawyers to be prepared to address complaints about pretrial publicity and attorney conduct.",
      "Liman took the actions after Lively\u2019s lawyers claimed in a filing on Monday that an attorney for Baldoni was trying to taint potential jurors over lawsuits the actors have filed against each other.",
      "The lawyers said Baldoni\u2019s attorney was trying to wreck Lively\u2019s career and turn potential New York jurors against her by creating a website to release selected documents and communications between Lively and Baldoni.",
      "The lawyers said attorney Bryan Freedman, representing Baldoni, was \u201cengaging in this extrajudicial campaign to influence these proceedings and the public perception of legal filings to this Court, and there already is a serious risk that his misconduct is tainting the jury pool.\u201d",
      "They added: \u201cThe endless stream of defamatory and extrajudicial media statements must end.\u201d",
      "Freedman said in a statement in response to Monday's assertions that the \u201cirony is not lost on anyone that Ms. Lively is so petrified of the truth that she has moved to gag it.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will always respect the court; however, we will never be bullied by those suggesting we cannot defend our clients with pure, unedited facts,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cAll we want is for people to see the actual text messages that directly contradict her allegations, video footage that clearly shows there was no sexual harassment and all the other powerful evidence that directly contradicts any false allegations.\u201d",
      "In a letter to the judge on Thursday, Baldoni attorney Kevin Fritz accused Lively of a publicity campaign that left Baldoni and other defendants the \u201cobjects of public scorn and contempt.\u201d",
      "He said the actions had damaged those she sued so that they were \u201cexiled from polite society and suffered damages totaling hundreds of millions of dollars due to Ms. Lively\u2019s scorched-earth media campaign.\u201d",
      "In the separate filing in Hays County, Texas, a precursor to another potential lawsuit, Lively asks for an order for a deposition from Jed Wallace, a crisis management specialist she alleges was behind much of the social media manipulation surrounding the film that turned public sentiment against her through posts on Reddit and TikTok.",
      "Wallace and his Texas-based firm Street Relations were brought on as subcontractors by publicists working with Baldoni and his production company, the filing said.",
      "\u201cHe weaponized a digital army around the country, including in New York and Los Angeles, to create, seed, manipulate, and advance disparaging content that appeared to be authentic on social media platforms and internet chat forums,\u201d the filing alleges.",
      "Wallace is identified in Lively's federal lawsuit, but he is not a defendant.",
      "Freedman, who the filing says is Wallace's lawyer, did not respond to a request for comment on the issue.",
      "Lively sued Baldoni, his production company and others in New York in late December for sexual harassment and attacks on her reputation and asked for unspecified damages. Baldoni sued earlier this month, accusing Lively and her husband, \u201cDeadpool\u201d actor Ryan Reynolds, of defamation and extortion and seeking at least $400 million in damages.",
      "The judge said Monday that he'll likely combine the lawsuits for trial.",
      "\u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d an adaptation of Colleen Hoover\u2019s bestselling 2016 novel that begins as a romance but takes a dark turn into domestic violence, was released in August, exceeding box office expectations with a $50 million debut. But the movie\u2019s release was shrouded by speculation over discord between Lively and Baldoni.",
      "Lively came to fame through the 2005 film \u201cThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,\u201d and bolstered her stardom on the TV series \u201cGossip Girl\u201d from 2007 to 2012. She has since starred in films including \u201cThe Town\u201d and \u201cThe Shallows.\u201d",
      "Baldoni starred in the TV comedy \u201cJane the Virgin,\u201d directed the 2019 film \u201cFive Feet Apart\u201d and wrote \u201cMan Enough,\u201d a book pushing back against traditional notions of masculinity.",

      "Swift walked down the tunnel to her usual suite about 90 minutes before kickoff. And while she was decked out in Chanel for the divisional round against Houston, she opted for a sleek black-and-gold Louis Vuitton look for the AFC title game, including a jacquard knit jacket that retails for $5,000 and a stocking cap with a list price of $830.",
      "Modest fare compared to what suite prices for the Super Bowl will probably run.",
      "Swift will almost certainly be in New Orleans with her celebrity friends when the Chiefs go for an unprecedented third straight Lombardi Trophy against the Philadelphia Eagles on Feb. 9. They got a big game from Patrick Mahomes \u2014 no surprise there \u2014 and some key stops from their defense to get past the Bills.",
      "Swift began her high-profile romance with Kelce last season, when he invited the \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d singer to watch him in a September matchup with the Bears. And their relationship only seemed to blossom into the new year, with Swift eventually celebrating on the field with Kelce after the Chiefs had beaten the Ravens in Baltimore for the AFC championship.",
      "Then came the Super Bowl, and Swift's much-watched dash from a concert in Tokyo for kickoff of the big game in Las Vegas.",
      "She made it with plenty of time to spare, of course. And Swift became the focus of attention in her own right, winning what appeared to be a beer-chugging contest, partying with celebrity suite mates such as Blake Lively, Ice Spice and Lana Del Rey, and standing next to Kelce's mother, Donna, while he held aloft the Lombardi Trophy following the 25-22 win over the 49ers.",
      "The couple eventually locked lips again on the field at Allegiant Stadium.",
      "As confetti flew on the field, they kissed again in celebration at Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday night. Swift gave Chiefs coach Andy Reid a big hug, and she celebrated with Donna Kelce and the rest of some 80,000 fans.",

      "Hermes illuminated a gloomy Paris afternoon with its fall 2025 men\u2019s collection, as Veronique Nichanian turned to the racetrack for inspiration",
      "PARIS -- Hermes illuminated a gloomy Paris afternoon with its fall men\u2019s collection Saturday, as Veronique Nichanian turned to the racetrack for inspiration. Jockeys\u2019 vibrant racing silks became her muse, a dynamic counterpoint to the French maison\u2019s storied equestrian roots. \u201cI wanted this collection to be strong and energetic,\u201d Nichanian explained, her palette pivoting from deep browns and dark teals to flashes of tomato red and lemon yellow.",
      "The collection radiated warmth, both in spirit and texture. Fuzzy mohair coats, velvet varsity jackets and plush sheepskin outerwear wrapped models in an embrace that seemed designed to counter winter\u2019s chill. Layering was less pronounced this season, a deliberate move to retain sleek, streamlined silhouettes. Even gray pinstripe suits \u2014 pared back to essentials \u2014 eschewed bulk, echoing Nichanian\u2019s vision of men unencumbered as they race through life.",
      "Sweaters emerged as the collection\u2019s unsung heroes. Their bold chevrons and geometric patterns were lifted directly from the vibrant stripes of racing silks, a playful nod to Palais d\u2019I\u00e9na\u2019s soaring, angular architecture. A standout turtleneck, with its patchwork of triangles, rectangles, and squares in canary yellow, seemed to channel a nostalgic love for trigonometry. Elsewhere, a jacket with a shawl collar mirrored the same graphical bravado, rendered in cool tones of blue, black and white.",
      "Though grounded in classic tailoring, the collection celebrated irreverence. Nichanian\u2019s juxtaposition of tradition and innovation captured Herm\u00e8s\u2019 ethos with a quiet confidence. Here, functionality was imbued with a touch of whimsy, proving once again that the maison\u2019s refinement can still surprise and delight. In a season steeped in nostalgia and geometry, Herm\u00e8s delivered a collection that was, quite literally, off to the races."

She\u2019s faced with crisis after crisis, big and small \u2014 from the massive, gaping hole in their apartment ceiling that forces them to move to a dingy motel, to an escalating showdown with a parking attendant at a care center. The cracks in her psychological, emotional and physical wellbeing are become too much to bear.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d never seen a movie before where a mother is going through a crisis with a child but our energy is not with the child\u2019s struggle, it\u2019s with the mother\u2019s,\u201d Bronstein said at the premiere. \u201cIf you\u2019re a caretaker, you shouldn\u2019t be bothering with yourself at all. It should all be about the person you\u2019re taking care of, right? And that is a particular kind of emotional burnout state that I was really interested in exploring.\u201d",
      "Byrne and Bronstein went deep in the preparation phase, having long discussions about Linda with the goal of making her as real as possible before the quick, 27-day shoot. Byrne said she was obsessed with figuring out who Linda was before the crisis. The film was in part inspired by Bronstein\u2019s experience with her own daughter, but she didn\u2019t want to elaborate on the specifics.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s her story to tell,\u201d Bronstein said.",
      "Part of Linda\u2019s story involves her therapist, played by Conan O\u2019Brien, who joked that he didn\u2019t realize he was in a movie.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not looking out for movie scripts or anything. But when I got a call from A24 that they wanted me to read something, I\u2019m not stupid,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cI showed it to my wife, who is one of the smartest people I know, and she read through it and she said, \u2018I didn\u2019t know they made movies like this anymore.\u2019\u201d",
      "He was particularly in awe of his director and co-star, saying he felt like a fraud standing beside them.",
      "\u201cIt was an amazing experience, one of the best experiences of my life, just to be with them and watch them work,\u201d O'Brien said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how (Byrne) did that and not check into a hospital afterwards, because I haven\u2019t seen any actor, man or woman, sustain that level for an entire movie.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like I have to go to a hospital now, because this was the first time I watched it,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m a mess.\u201d",
      "A$AP Rocky also co-stars, as a man Linda meets at the motel, but was not in Park City for the premiere. He is currently on trial, charged with firing a gun at a former friend.",
      "The film is full of ambiguity, metaphor and just plain artistic expression that Bronstein hesitated to explain, from the name itself to the hole in the ceiling, which takes on a somewhat supernatural quality.",
      "\u201cWhen we have nothing left to give, we have an emptiness inside of us,\u201d Bronstein said. \u201cAnd that emptiness is actually not empty: It\u2019s filled with all the darkness and self-hate and doubt and fear and dread and regret and everything. \u2026 That to me is what the hole is.\u201d",
      "Some of it, she said, she doesn\u2019t even fully understand. The point is the experience, and critics and Sundance audiences are already fully on board.",
      "Bronstein, a bit of a cult figure in the film world, made her directorial debut in 2008 at the SXSW festival with \u201cYeast,\u201d which featured a pre-fame Greta Gerwig and was hailed by by New Yorker critic Richard Brody as a \u201cmumblecore classic.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You\u201d is only her second feature.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time that anybody else has paid for me to make art,\u201d Bronstein said. \u201cI\u2019m proud to say that this is the film that came directly from my head to the screen.\u201d",

      "The event had the feel of a costume party, rock concert and family reunion as fans clapped, laughed and shouted \u201cYes queen!\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- To celebrate an upcoming milestone, Alyssa Math could think of nothing more fitting than front-row tickets to \u201cOnyx Storm\u201d author Rebecca Yarros' appearance at The Town Hall in Manhattan.",
      "\u201cI'm getting married next weekend, so this is my bachelorette party,\u201d said Math, an accountant who traveled with friends from her home near Annapolis, Maryland. She has been one of millions of admirers of Yarros' work and a year ago drove two hours to Reston, Virginia, to see the author.",
      "\u201cIt's a huge cult following,\u201d said Math, wearing a white veil in homage to one of Yarros' characters. \u201cThe drama (of her books) keeps you on the edge of your seat.\u201d",
      "Friday night at The Town Hall had the feel of a costume party, rock concert and family reunion as a capacity crowd of around 1,500 clapped, laughed and shouted, \u201cYes, Queen!\" The \u201cEmpyrean\u201d series has made Yarros one of the country's most popular and obsessed-about leaders of romantasy, a newly branded genre combinging romance and fantasy.",
      "\u201cOnyx Storm\u201d is the much-awaited third installment of a planned five centered on the lovers Violet and Xaden, and the first since the million-selling \u201cIron Flame\u201d came out in 2023. In its first week of publication, \"Onyx Storm\" has already topped the bestseller lists of Amazon and sold more than 300,000 copies just through Barnes & Noble, according to a spokesperson for the superstore chain.",
      "Yarros, interviewed for some 75 minutes by Olympic gymnast and avowed fan Laurie Hernandez, shared a few insights about her writings (she already knows how the series will end), spoke lovingly of her husband (\"He's 6'4\" and hot as hell with a baby strapped to his chest\"), swore casually and joked that hers was the \u201conly profession where you can have imaginary fiends\u201d and not be considered insane.",
      "She expressed relief and pleasure over completing \u201cOnyx Storm,\" noting she had to block out her own popularity to get the writing done.",
      "\u201cAs much as I love you guys, I kind of pretend you don\u2019t exist,\u201d she said. \u201cI kind of ignore you, but I love you at the same time.\u201d",
      "\u201cOnyx Storm\u201d isn't quite a Harry Potter-level phenomenon \u2014 the final Potter book by J.K. Rowling, \u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\u201d sold more than 8 million copies in the U.S. in its first 24 hours \u2014 but it carries a similar feeling of obsession, identification and spontaneity.",
      "Like the Potter books, the release of \u201cOnyx Storm\u201d was welcomed with midnight store parties around the country, gatherings for which fans showed up in costume. Some fans at The Town Hall finished the 526-page \u201cOnyx Storm\u201d within hours of receiving it, others are in no hurry.",
      "\"This is a book I personally want to take my time with,\" said Scarlett Fuentes, who arrived with her friend Zy Bao-angan, both of them in black leather.",
      "\"I want to savor this moment,\" Bao-angan said.",
      "Like Potter, enthusiasm for the Yarros books extends well beyond any organized publicity campaigns. The Potter books helped inspire some of the first Internet fan sites for books. Yarros and such fellow romantasy authors as Sarah J. Maas have been favorites of the young readers on BookTok, a TikTok community that has emerged as publishing's most effective driver of sales. Countless fans on BookTok and other social media \u2014 some crying, some cursing in amazement \u2014 have been posting their responses to \u201cOnyx Storm.\"",
      "On Friday, Hernandez and the audience posed questions about her books as if gossiping about friends. If Violet and Xaden were at a bar, what would they order? Violet would go for a lavender lemon drop, Xaden is fine with a beer. And which music genres define them? Xenon is heavy metal, Violet harder to label.",
      "Asked what was the most important lessons she has learned from writing the books, Yarros reminded her fans that she wasn't only a writer or public figure.",
      "\u201cI can say plotting and I can say everything, but probably the most important thing I've learned is that real life is what happens in my house, and what happens around my kitchenette and what happens in my living room chairs and what happens when my kids are all together and my husband's together,\u201d she said. \u201cReal life is not what happens on the internet.\u201d",
      "\u201cI love you guys,\u201d she added. \u201cBut peace out.\u201d"

      "On Thursday night at The Ray Theater, \u201c20 Days in Mariupol\u201d filmmaker Mstyslav Chernov, who won the Oscar last year, debuted his latest dispatch from Ukraine, \u201c2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d a harrowing journey to the front lines of a 2023 counteroffensive. A few hours later, at the Eccles, Ahmir \u201cQuestlove\u201d Thompson, who won an Oscar for \u201cSummer of Soul\u201d in 2022, unveiled his Sly Stone portrait, \u201cSLY LIVES! (aka The Burden of Black Genuis).\u201d Earlier, \u201cOne Day in September\u201d filmmaker Kevin MacDonald also showcased his film \u201cOne to One: John & Yoko,\u201d which debuted last year at the Venice Film Festival and will get an IMAX release on April 11 before hitting Max later this year.",
      "Some critics reflected that \u201c2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d a joint production between The Associated Press and PBS Frontline, was even more powerful than \u201c20 Days in Mariupol.\u201d \u201cSLY LIVES!\u201d (on Hulu Feb. 13) was called \u201csublime\u201d and \u201cilluminating\u201d in its examination of an underappreciated, shapeshifting genius.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been coming here since 2000 and I thought the coolest thing you could do would be to DJ an after party,\u201d Thompson said before the screening. \u201cI never dreamt this for my future, so this is really humbling.\u201d",
      "It was a full-circle end to a day that began with a slate of documentary Oscar nominations all connected to the Sundance Institute in some way. Some were supported by the Institute, some debuted at the festival as recently as last year.",
      "\u201cBlack Box Diaries,\u201d in which a Japanese filmmaker investigates her own sexual assault, had its premiere in Park City last year and was supported by the Institute\u2019s doc film program. \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d made by a Palestinian-Israeli collective, was also supported by the film fund. \u201cPorcelain War,\u201d about Ukrainian artists in wartime, debuted at the festival in 2024, where it won the grand jury prize. \u201cSoundtrack to a Coup d\u2019Etat,\u201d about the assassination of Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba in 1961, also launched last year and won a special jury prize. And, finally, \u201cSugarcane,\u201d a 2024 festival premiere investing abuse and missing children at an Indian residential school, was supported by a Sundance grant.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really special,\u201d said Basil Tsiokos, a Sundance senior programmer. \u201cIt does speak to what Sundance brings to the artistic community and to the support that we show to artists out there.\u201d",
      "On Friday night, \u201cSugarcane\u201d filmmakers Julian Brave NoiseCat and Emily Kassie are also being given an award at the Institute\u2019s fundraising gala. Newly anointed Oscar nominees James Mangold and Cynthia Erivo are also being honored.",
      "It\u2019s not lost on those who program for the festival and run the artists programs how crucial that initial support can be for someone trying to make a documentary.",
      "\u201cThe funding landscape is challenging, particularly in the nonfiction space,\u201d Tsiokos said. \u201cGetting early support from the artists programs, from the documentary feature programs is sort of a stamp of approval, of encouragement that helps other funders come in later on to take a seed of an idea and bring it into fruition.\u201d",
      "The Oscars and Sundance have long been connected, especially in the documentary space. For the past 25 years, there has been at least one Sundance movie every year that goes on to get an Oscar nomination. Some that have won the statuette include \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth,\u201d \u201cMan on Wire,\u201d \u201cSearching for Sugar Man,\u201d \u201c20 Feet From Stardom,\u201d \u201cIcarus,\u201d \u201cAmerican Factory\u201d and \u201cNavalny.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe just provide a space for the films,\u201d Tsiokos said. \u201cThe films are from the artists. They\u2019re the ones with the vision to make these films possible. We provide them a platform to be able to meet their audiences. That\u2019s quite an important role that we take very seriously.\u201d",
      "This year, the festival has about 40 feature documentaries premiering across sections on everything from Marlee Matlin and Selena Quintanilla, to one about Nairobi women transforming a formerly whites-only library into a cultural hub, to another on Florida\u2019s stand-your-ground laws. While it\u2019s difficult to project what might be in the Oscar race next year, Tsiokos has observed one trend that might help audiences pick and choose.",
      "\u201cThe influence of the international voters is growing. In the last couple of years especially, most of the nominees for the Oscar race tend to be international titles,\u201d Tsiokos said. \u201cI would tell people to make sure to check out the World Cinema Documentary Competition. There are some real gems.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Prosecutors say they won\u2019t charge rocker Marilyn Manson after a years-long investigation into sexual assault and domestic violence allegations",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Prosecutors said Friday that they will not file charges against Marilyn Manson after a years-long investigation of allegations of sexual assault and domestic violence.",
      "Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said the allegations are too old under the law and the evidence is not sufficient to charge the 56-year-old shock rocker whose legal name is Brian Warner.",
      "\u201cWe have determined that allegations of domestic violence fall outside of the statute of limitations, and we cannot prove charges of sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d Hochman said. \u201cWe recognize and applaud the courage and resilience of the women who came forward to make reports and share their experiences, and we thank them for their cooperation and patience with the investigation.\u201d",
      "Nearly four years after the investigation began, then-District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said on Oct. 9 that his office was pursuing new leads that added to the \u201calready extensive\u201d file that authorities had amassed.",
      "LA County sheriff\u2019s detectives said early in 2021 that they were investigating Manson for incidents between 2009 and 2011 in West Hollywood, where Manson lived at the time. The probe included a search warrant that was served on his West Hollywood home. The case was initially turned over to prosecutors in September 2021, but the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office requested more evidence-gathering and the investigation resumed.",
      "\u201cWe are very pleased that, after a thorough and incredibly lengthy review of all of the actual evidence, the District Attorney has concluded what we knew and expressed from the start \u2014 Brian Warner is innocent,\u201d his attorney, Howard King, said in a statement.",
      "The identities of the women police and prosecutors spoke to were not revealed, but \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actor Esm\u00e9 Bianco \u2014 who sued Manson in a case that has been settled \u2014 said she was part of the criminal investigation. Before the decision not to prosecute, she criticized how long the process was taking at a rally for Hochman, who was elected soon after.",
      "\u201cAlmost four years ago, I did what victims of rape are supposed to do: I went to the police,\u201d she said on Oct. 10. \u201cI described to them in agonizing detail how the rock musician Brian Warner \u2014 better known by his stage name Marilyn Manson \u2014 had raped and abused me over the course of our relationship.\u201d",
      "Bianco said she gave investigators \u201chundreds of pieces of evidence, including photos of my body covered in bites, bruises and knife wounds, emails and text messages, threats to my immigration status.\u201d",
      "In her lawsuit, Bianco alleged sexual, physical and emotional abuse, and said that Manson violated human trafficking law by bringing her to California from England for non-existent roles in music videos and movies.",
      "\u201cWhilst I am deeply disappointed by the decision of the District Attorney to not bring charges in the case against Brian Warner, I am sadly not surprised,\u201d Bianco said in a statement released by her lawyer. \u201cOnce again, our justice system has failed survivors. Not the individual prosecutors and detectives who worked for years on this case, but the system that made them do so with one hand tied behind their collective backs.\u201d",
      "In 2021 Manson's former fianc\u00e9e, \u201cWestworld\u201d actor Evan Rachel Wood, named him as her abuser for the first time in an Instagram post.",
      "Wood and Manson\u2019s relationship became public in 2007 when he was 38 and she was 19, and they were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up.",
      "\u201cHe started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years,\u201d Wood said.",
      "Manson replied on Instagram that these were \u201chorrible distortions of reality.\u201d He sued Wood, saying she and another woman fabricated accusations against him and convinced others to do the same. A judge threw out significant sections of the suit, then in November, Manson agreed to drop it and pay Wood's attorney fees.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they\u2019ve been sexually abused, unless they come forward publicly as Bianco and Wood have done.",
      "Other women sued Manson in the months after Wood came forward. Wood's representative did not immedately return a message Friday.",
      "Manson emerged as a musical star in the mid-1990s, known as much for courting public controversy as for hit songs like \u201cThe Beautiful People\u201d and hit album\u2019s like 1996\u2019s \u201cAntichrist Superstar\u201d and 1998\u2019s \u201cMechanical Animals.\u201d"

      "What looked like classic Americana \u2014 thick denim jeans, caps, and check shirts \u2014 quickly morphed into something far less predictable. Exaggerated blown-up check pants in red with dramatic turn-ups injected a sense of whimsy, as did splashes of vivid color. A pale yellow jacket and a tactile padded coat in soft pastels softened the masculinity, reworking the rugged aesthetic into something gender-fluid.",
      "Flashes of bold hues, from vibrant red to bright blue checks, became a defining motif. The palette danced across reimagined hunting jackets and distinctly masculine silhouettes, which were disrupted by the designer\u2019s famed use of patchwork. Here, it wasn\u2019t just a technique but a conceptual statement \u2014 ideas and styles stitched together, creating contradictions.",
      "Hunting jackets might evoke tradition, but here they felt fresh, even irreverent, with their clever layering of fabrics and unexpected details. The collection demonstrated Watanabe\u2019s mastery in blending the familiar with the avant-garde, offering a \u201cbro\u201d aesthetic turned on its head by bursts of feminine color.",
      "The recurring themes of denim and disruptive tailoring felt polished yet safe, lacking the urgency or political edge that defined his earlier work."

      "Opening statements are beginning at the trial of rapper A$AP Rocky, who is accused of firing a handgun at a former friend",
      "A$AP Rocky is the celebrity in the room, but A$AP Relli will star at his trial.",
      "The hip-hop star, fashion maven and actor, whose legal name is Rakim Athelaston Mayers, is accused of firing a gun at his former friend Relli, born Terell Ephron, on whose testimony prosecutors are pinning their case.",
      "Opening statements are set to begin Friday at the trial after a jury of seven women and five men was selected over the course of three days. Rocky is charged with two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm.",
      "He took a major risk by turning down a prosecution plea deal offer of just six months in jail and instead choosing to go to trial. If convicted, he could be sentenced to a term of up to 24 years in prison.",
      "The defense plans to paint Ephron as a money seeker and point out he has sued Rocky in civil court, seeking financial damages for the incident.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s the witness that this case will rise and fall on, for sure,\u201d Rocky\u2019s lead attorney Joe Tacopina said after a recent pretrial hearing. \u201cWhether he\u2019s a star is something that remains to be seen.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s jealousy obviously, and he\u2019s made that clear. He became a hater,\u201d Tacopina said. \u201cThis is in large part about money, money, money.\u201d",
      "Rocky and Relli were part of a group of young creators in high school in New York who called themselves A$AP \u2014 for Always Strive and Prosper \u2014 and initially remained close as Rocky found wealth and fame through music. The relationship soured, coming to a head with the alleged shooting on Nov. 6, 2021, when Ephron says Rocky fired on him and grazed his knuckles.",
      "The defense plans to call witnesses to testify that a firearm seen on a security video is a starter pistol that Rocky carried as a prop for security.",
      "They likely will say that is why, despite a search of the spot by many police officers, no shell casings were found at the site near Hollywood and Vine. Police did not recover a gun in the case.",
      "Ephron went to the police two days later and brought 9 mm shell casings he had picked up himself, which are both points the defense will seize on. No fingerprints were recovered from the casings.",
      "The trial\u2019s celebrity goes beyond Rocky. The Grammy-nominated hip-hop star\u2019s longtime partner is Rihanna and the couple have two toddler sons together.",
      "Tacopina suggested it\u2019s unlikely Rihanna will show up in court and her name may not come up at all, though it did frequently during jury selection when many prospective jurors said they were fans.",
      "Rocky has been named one of the celebrity chairs of the Met Gala in May and has a major role in a Spike Lee-directed film with Denzel Washington to be released soon after. But his life could be upended with a conviction.",
      "In the deal from prosecutors he rejected, Rocky was to plead guilty to one of the two counts in exchange for a sentence recommendation of 180 days in jail, a seven-year suspended prison sentence and three years of probation.",
      "Beyond Ephron, the prosecution's witnesses primarily will be the police who worked on the case.",
      "They also will rely heavily on surveillance video that captured parts of the incident and the circumstances. Prosecutors at the 2023 preliminary hearing showed a still image taken from video with a man in a hooded sweatshirt whose face is not visible holding what appears to be a gun, along with another image showing the face of the man in the sweatshirt, with no gun visible. A detective testified that investigators established it was Rocky.",
      "Rocky himself could take the stand and his attorney has said he wants to, but the lawyers say they have not yet decided and he is legally allowed to avoid testifying."

      "Marlee Matlin gives an unflinchingly honest account of her experiences as a deaf actor in the funny and revelatory documentary \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore.\u201d",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- PARK CITY, Utah (AP) \u2014 Marlee Matlin gives an unflinchingly honest account of her experiences as a deaf actor in the funny and revelatory documentary \u201cMarlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore.\u201d The film kicked off the 41st Sundance Film Festival Thursday, as the first major premiere in the Eccles Theater in Park City, Utah.",
      "After the screening audiences in the theater, some wiping tears away, greeted Matlin with a standing ovation when she took the stage.",
      "The film delves into all aspects of her life, personal and professional: Her childhood and how her family handled learning she had become deaf at 18 months; her experience winning the best actress Oscar for her first movie role in \u201cChildren of a Lesser God\u201d and her allegedly abusive romantic relationship with her co-star, the late William Hurt, which he denied; and her experiences in an industry not equipped to accommodate deaf actors.",
      "The film was directed by Shoshanna Stern, who also is deaf. Matlin specifically requested that Stern take on the project when American Masters approached her about doing a documentary.",
      "Matlin has written about her experiences before, including her volatile relationship with Hurt and drugs, in a memoir, \u201cI\u2019ll Scream Later.\u201d But before the #MeToo movement, she felt her allegations were largely dismissed or glossed over.",
      "Interviews from the book's press tour show journalists were more interested in the \u201camazing sex\u201d she said she had with Hurt than the stories of the alleged physical and verbal abuse. One interviewer asked her why she waited \u201cso long\u201d to come forward with the claims.",
      "The documentary isn\u2019t just a portrait of Matlin, but a broader look at deaf culture and how Matlin was thrust into the spotlight at a young age as a de facto spokesperson for all deaf causes.",
      "In addition to being the first, and until Troy Kotsur won for \u201cCODA\u201d in 2022, only deaf actor to win an Academy Award, she helped lobby Congress for closed captioning and delved into the Gallaudet University protest about hiring hearing people to preside over the university, which is the subject of another Sundance documentary, \u201cDeaf President Now!\u201d",
      "Matlin also faced backlash when she spoke while presenting the best actor Oscar the year after she won, an experience that she said made her distance herself from deaf causes.",
      "It features moving interviews from her longtime translator and other important figures in her life such as Henry Winkler, who met her when she was a student at age 12.",
      "Winkler watched her perform a song during a school production after she wrote him a fan letter. Later, she stayed in his home for two years after her breakup with Hurt and had her wedding there. In the film, Matlin said she never would have pursued acting if it weren\u2019t for Winkler, although he disagreed.",
      "The film is closed captioned and includes verbal translations for hearing audiences. In a unique approach, the subjects were interviewed by Stern with an earpiece, allowing them to hear translations from another room.",
      "Matlin said she has struggled occasionally to convince the industry to let her play roles that aren\u2019t necessarily written for a deaf actor. Aaron Sorkin, who wrote a part for her in \u201cThe West Wing,\u201d dispelled the notion it is difficult to write for deaf actors.",
      "When \u201cCODA\u201d came around, the studio wanted to cast an A-list, hearing male star opposite Matlin. She threatened to walk if it weren\u2019t a deaf actor and was gratified when Kotsur won the Oscar, hence the \u201cnot alone anymore\u201d subtitle. Her big disappointment was not being able to say a few words on stage during the event.",
      "Asked why this moment was the right time for a documentary, Matlin said, \u201cIt\u2019s never really the right time. So, why not?\u201d",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 00:18:27 -0500",
    "summary": "Robert F",
    "story": [
      "Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s famous name, populist stances and loyal following have earned him President Donald Trump's support, but will that get him the votes he needs from the Republican-controlled Senate to become the nation's top health official?",
      "If approved, Kennedy will control a $1.7 trillion agency that oversees food and hospital inspections, hundreds of health clinics, vaccine recommendations and health insurance for roughly half the country.",
      "His confirmation hearings are set before the Senate finance committee on Wednesday and the Health, Education, Labor and Pension committee on Thursday.",
      "Here's what to watch during his confirmation hearings:",
      "Over many years, Kennedy has been clear about his beliefs on vaccines in dozens of interviews, podcasts and social media posts.",
      "He's headed up a nonprofit that has sued the government over its authorizations of vaccines. He's said there is \u201c no vaccine that is safe and effective,\" and repeatedly called for further study of routine childhood vaccinations, despite decades of research and real-world use that proves they've safely prevented disease.",
      "But more recently, Kennedy has tried to downplay his past remarks and work, saying he's not anti-vaccine and promising not to \u201ctake away\u201d the shots.",
      "The health committee chairman, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., also has expressed concerns about Kennedy's anti-vaccine work. A physician, Cassidy said earlier this month he \u201chad a frank conversation\u201d and \u201cspoke about vaccines at length\u201d with Kennedy. On Tuesday, Cassidy told reporters that he is still unsure if he is backing Trump\u2019s nominee.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still working through it,\u201d Cassidy said during a press availability with Louisiana reporters on Tuesday. \u201cI look forward to the hearings and I will allow that to guide my decision.\u201d",
      "The intensity of the questioning on vaccines over the next two days could provide clues for how other Republicans \u2014 like Sen. Mitch McConnell, a polio survivor who represents Kentucky \u2014 might consider Kennedy\u2019s nomination.",
      "Some of the country's most conservative lawmakers have been worried about how Kennedy will handle abortion as health secretary.",
      "Republican Sen. James Lankford, who sits on the finance committee, is expected to grill Kennedy, a longtime Democrat, on the issue during Wednesday's hearing. Lankford is seen as a possible \u201cno\u201d vote over Kennedy's past comments supporting abortion. Last month, the Oklahoma senator said he had a \u201cgood conversation\u201d with Kennedy but stopped short of endorsing.",
      "HHS can influence abortion and reproductive health access in a number of ways, including with millions of dollars in grants it sends to Planned Parenthood and regulations around abortion pills. Under the Biden administration, the agency also said hospitals were required to provide emergency abortions for pregnant women in medical distress.",
      "On Monday, acting HHS Secretary Dorothy Fink signaled the agency is prepared to adopt a tougher stance on abortion under Kennedy. She ordered the agency to investigate all of its programs to make sure no taxpayer money is going toward elective abortions.",
      "Kennedy needs to earn support from nearly all Senate Republicans, but he may also try to pick up a vote or two from the Democratic Party. His closest supporters and advisers have urged followers to call the offices of Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada.",
      "Another Democratic senator may also be in play: John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who met with Kennedy and has said he's open to supporting Trump's nominees.",
      "An area where Kennedy is trying to find common ground with Democratic senators: food regulations and access to healthier foods. Kennedy has said he supports Medicare and Medicaid helping people pay for healthier foods and gym memberships, an idea Democrats have lobbied for as well. He's also called for a ban on some of the ingredients used in foods, like dyes and additives.",
      "In a letter sent to U.S. senators on Tuesday, Caroline Kennedy shared shocking personal details about her cousin, saying he is not qualified for the health secretary job.",
      "Caroline Kennedy said RFK Jr.'s views on vaccines are a problem, but she also brought up her experiences growing up with him.",
      "A copy obtained by The Associated Press notes that while she admired him for overcoming a drug addiction, she said he has gone on to \u201cmisrepresent, lie, and cheat his way through life.\u201d In an extreme anecdote, she accused him of hosting drug-fueled gatherings in his basement, dorm and garage where he \u201cenjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in the blender to feed his hawks.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, another cousin, former Rhode Island congressman and Democrat Patrick J. Kennedy, threw his support behind the health secretary nominee in an opinion piece for The Washington Post on Tuesday. RFK Jr. helped pull him out of addiction, Patrick J. Kennedy said.",
      "\u201cBobby was the first family member to call and offer his personal and public support, even at a time when some in my family criticized me for breaking the so-called family code of silence,\u201d he wrote.",

    "story": [
      "Around 70 people were killed in an attack on the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher in Sudan",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Around 70 people were killed in an attack on the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher in Sudan, the chief of the World Health Organization said Sunday, part of a series of attacks coming as the African nation's civil war escalated in recent days.",
      "The attack on the Saudi Teaching Maternal Hospital, which local officials blamed on the rebel Rapid Support Forces, came as the group was experiencing apparent battlefield losses to the Sudanese military and allied forces under the command of army chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan. That includes Burhan appearing near a burning oil refinery north of Khartoum on Saturday that his forces said they seized from the RSF.",
      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s Foreign Ministry denounced the attack as \u201ca violation of international law.\u201d",
      "International mediation attempts and pressure tactics, including a U.S. assessment that the RSF and its proxies are committing genocide, and sanctions targeting Burhan, haven't halted the fighting.",
      "WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus posted the death toll in the hospital attack in El Fasher on the social platform X.",
      "Officials and others in the capital of North Darfur province had cited a similar figure Saturday, but Tedros is the first international source to provide a casualty number. Reporting on Sudan is incredibly difficult given communication challenges, the indiscriminate violence faced by civilians and exaggerations by both the RSF and the Sudanese military. Sudan's Foreign Ministry accused the RSF of launching a drone attack targeting the hospital's emergency ward, describing the assault as a \u201cmassacre.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe appalling attack on Saudi Hospital in El Fasher, Sudan, led to 19 injuries and 70 deaths among patients and companions,\u201d Tedros wrote. \u201cAt the time of the attack, the hospital was packed with patients receiving care.\u201d",
      "Another health facility in Al Malha also was attacked Saturday, he added.",
      "\u201cWe continue to call for a cessation of all attacks on health care in Sudan, and to allow full access for the swift restoration of the facilities that have been damaged,\u201d Tedros said. \u201cAbove all, Sudan\u2019s people need peace. The best medicine is peace.\u201d",
      "Tedros didn't identify who launched the attack, though local officials had blamed the RSF for the assault. U.N. official Clementine Nkweta-Salami, who coordinates humanitarian efforts for the world body in Sudan, warned Thursday that the RSF earlier had given \u201ca 48-hour ultimatum to forces allied to the Sudanese Armed Forces to vacate the city and indicated a forthcoming offensive.\u201d",
      "\u201cSince May 2024, El Fasher has been under RSF siege,\u201d she said. \u201cCivilians in El Fasher have already endured months of suffering, violence and gross human rights abuses under the prolonged siege. Their lives now hang in the balance due to an increasingly precarious situation.\u201d",
      "The RSF didn't immediately acknowledge the attack in El Fasher, which is more than 800 kilometers (500 miles) southwest of Khartoum. The city is now estimated to be home to more than 1 million people, many of whom have been displaced by the war.",
      "The U.N. said in December that the RSF siege had killed 782 civilians and wounded more than 1,140 others, warning that the figures likely were higher.",
      "The Saudi hospital, just north of El Fasher's airport, sits near the front lines of the war and has been repeatedly hit by shelling. Still, its doctors continue surgeries, sometimes by the light of cellphones while the hospital is hit.",
      "However, the RSF appeared in recent days to have lost control of the Khartoum refinery, the biggest in Sudan and crucial to both its economy and that of South Sudan. Burhan's forces also say they broke another RSF besiegement of the Signal Corps headquarters in northern Khartoum. The rebels claimed they were \u201ctightening the noose\u201d around that base.",
      "Sudan has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019. A short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when Burhan and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo of the RSF joined forces to lead a military coup in October 2021.",
      "Al-Bashir faces charges at the International Criminal Court over carrying out a genocidal campaign in the early 2000s in the western Darfur region with the Janjaweed, the precursor to the RSF. Rights groups and the U.N. say the RSF and allied Arab militias are again attacking ethnic African groups in this war.",
      "The RSF and Sudan\u2019s military began fighting each other in April 2023. Their conflict has killed more than 28,000 people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country.",
      "Other estimates suggest a far higher death toll in the civil war.",
      "On Sunday, Burhan traveled to the military's General Command headquarters in Khartoum, a building he hadn't been to since the fighting broke out in 2023. The headquarters is near Khartoum International Airport, which has seen fierce fighting during the war.",
      "\u201cThe armed forces are in their best condition and we will move forward with the determination of our people to eliminate the rebellion in all of Sudan,\u201d Burhan said, according to the state-run SUNA news agency.",

      "Weeks after the worst of the deadly fires tore through Los Angeles suburbs, families are grappling with the reality that toxic ash from burned cars and homes could be a health issue for awhile, especially for children",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Kelli Ferrone wiped blinds and window sills inside her daughters\u2019 elementary school, just a half mile from the devastating Palisades Fire that scorched the coastal enclave in Los Angeles. The cotton swabs and wipes came up black.",
      "There is scattered ash and soot at her feet. Outside, it's on the ground next to a playground.",
      "Ferrone, who recorded videos and shared them with The Associated Press, wanted to see for herself this week if Canyon Charter Elementary School had been adequately cleaned before the school reopens. She wasn't impressed.",
      "Weeks after the most intense days of fire across the Los Angeles area, parents are grappling with the reality that toxic ash from burned homes and cars could be harmful to their children. It's a risk that is becoming more common as wildfires burn in cities.",
      "In the Pacific Palisades, Canyon Charter could reopen as soon as Monday. School officials say staff are working hard to make sure schools are clean and safe and they're confident in their decision. But some parents feel the school is rushing to open. They're urging officials to temporarily relocate, while others try to transfer their students elsewhere.",
      "\u201cThe (Los Angeles Unified School District) has never experienced a disaster like this in their history,\" said Ferrone, who has two daughters at the school, one with asthma. \"And I do think people are trying really hard, but our school needs a new temporary home with classrooms and teachers teaching in-person. That is the only thing that is going to make people feel comfortable.\u201d",
      "In a statement, LAUSD said staff \u201chas worked diligently to prepare schools for a return to in-person instruction.\u201d That includes inspecting ventilation systems, replacing filters and installing air purifiers in classrooms and offices, and cleaning inside and outdoors. An environmental consultant is inspecting campuses. Staff monitors air quality. The district has an Office of Environmental Health and Safety and is following its protocols.",
      "Some schools are within a \u201cdo not drink water\u201d advisory, including Canyon Charter. That means fountains are turned off and bottled water is provided, the district said.",
      "Dr. Lisa Patel, a pediatrician and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, said the school is taking all the right steps. Yet, she said, \u201cthere\u2019s no zero risk.\"",
      "The ash is a toxic soup of incinerated cars, electronics, batteries, building materials, paints, furniture and every other kind of personal belonging. It contains pesticides, asbestos, plastics and lead, all of which children are more vulnerable to.",
      "\u201cChildren often have more hand-to-mouth behavior and their bodies are rapidly growing in these first few years, and so they can be more sensitive to this type of pollution,\" said Patel. \"There will be a risk for a while to come in terms of exposure.\u201d",
      "Some materials form reactive chemical compounds when they burn.",
      "Scientists still don't know the long-term health impacts of exposure to massive urban fire like this year's in California or the one in Maui, Hawaii in 2023. Three schools in Lahaina didn't reopen for two months after that. But some chemicals have been linked to heart disease and lung issues, while exposure to minerals like magnetite, which can form when fire burns iron, has been associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
      "In Pasadena, Emily Stough is trying to minimize the risks for her 11- and 14-year-old who returned to Blair High School, which includes a middle school, this week. She made sure they took masks. In an email to parents last week, the Pasadena Unified School District said some 38 tons of outdoor debris have been hauled away from campuses, and they will only open \u201cafter rigorous cleaning and sanitizing and environmental tests.\"",
      "Stough said she trusts the district to do its due diligence, but she wants more information.",
      "\u201cDid they test air quality? Did they test ash samples? Were the ash samples from inside the school, in the hallways, from outside the schools?,\" she wonders. \"Air quality both inside and outside the schools? I\u2019d like to see that. I\u2019d like to know what cleaning was done.\u201d",
      "The PUSD did not respond to questions from the AP.",
      "It\u2019s hard to know how long these fire toxins will stay in the environment, said Patel, but it could be a few months. Strong winds like the Santa Anas could also blow them distances where they could enter soil and groundwater.",
      "Plastics in particular could last a long time, said Dr. Ilan Shapiro, medical affairs officer for AltaMed and a fellow with the American Academy of Pediatrics. \u201cAnd we need to remember that the fires are still going. That we still have burn materials coming out.\" As communities recover and clean up, that ash will be moved again, he said.",
      "Longfellow Elementary School in Pasadena is set to reopen next week, but Tanya Reyes doesn\u2019t plan to send her kids back just yet. The school is about two miles from where the Eaton Fire burned down the home they rented. Even with the school's safety measures, \u201cmy gut is saying \u2018no,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be around that area. It\u2019s too soon.\u201d",
      "Her family is staying in West Hollywood, and she\u2019s looking for schools there, somewhere the kids can attend for a little while. She's considering home schooling, too, but still figuring it all out.",
      "It's hard for parents because they understand all the ways kids need school.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been through this in so many different ways, whether it\u2019s been wildfire smoke or the pandemic,\u201d Patel said. \u201cWhen kids miss school, that is also a detriment to their health. It impacts their learning, it impacts their socioemotional development, their sense of connection and community during a time of crisis.\"",

      "President Trump's first week in office included a flurry of executive orders with implications for Earth's climate and environment.",
      "While former President Joe Biden made climate change a hallmark of his administration and some of his policies remain, at least for now, Trump is quickly unraveling that.",
      "Experts say Trump's moves to step away from global climate action, ramp up domestic oil and gas production and remove incentives for electric vehicles are worrisome as the planet continues to heat up. 2024 was Earth's hottest year on record, and climate scientists say the rising heat is contributing to extreme weather affecting millions.",
      "\u201cThese orders will make our air dirtier, make people sicker, make energy more expensive, and make our communities less prepared for extreme weather,\" wrote Ayana Elizabeth Johnson, a marine biologist, policy expert and author who co-founded the non-profit think tank Urban Ocean Lab.",
      "Here are some of Trump's most notable moves affecting climate and environmental issues in his first week:",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday directing the United States to again withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement aimed at global cooperation on climate change.",
      "The agreement requires participating countries to come up with nationally determined contributions to the effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions that are heating the planet. Trump's move means the federal government won't be trying to meet emissions reductions goals, nor any financial commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.",
      "\u201cWalking away from the Paris Agreement won\u2019t protect Americans from climate impacts, but it will hand China and the European Union a competitive edge in the booming clean energy economy and lead to fewer opportunities for American workers,\u201d said Ani Dasgupta, president and CEO of the World Resources Institute.",
      "Trump declared an energy emergency via executive order earlier this week amid a promise to \u201cdrill, baby, drill.\u201d",
      "The order urges oil and gas expansion including through federal use of eminent domain and the Defense Production Act, which allow the government to use private land and resources to produce goods deemed to be a national necessity.",
      "Experts dispute his description of an \u201cinadequate energy supply\u201d as part of the basis for the order.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that the United States is well-supplied with energy in all of its forms,\u201d said Gary Dirks, senior director of the Global Futures Laboratory at Arizona State University. Dirks said he thinks the move is actually more targeted at bringing down prices at the pump.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the United States right now is the largest producer of oil of any nation in history. And we got to that point under the Biden administration, not because of the Biden administration\u2019s policies necessarily, but because of policies that have been ongoing for four decades,\u201d he said.",
      "One section of the order declaring an energy emergency states that the Endangered Species Act cannot be an obstacle to energy development.",
      "The Endangered Species Act has been a hurdle for the development of fossil fuels in the U.S. for decades, and weakening it would accelerate the decline and potential extinction of numerous endangered species, including whales and sea turtles, said Gib Brogan, a campaign director with conservation group Oceana.",
      "Trump also opened up areas in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling. Biden had previously both restricted and approved drilling in other parts of the Arctic, part of a long process mired in litigation and complicated by political battles.",
      "\u201cI would begin by pointing out that there was an attempt to lease for oil drilling recently and nobody bid,\u201d Dirks said. \u201cI don\u2019t actually think that the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge is an exciting place for oil and gas exploration.\u201d",
      "But he expressed concern about preserving biodiversity, something other scientists and environmental groups have highlighted.",
      "\u201cThe Arctic is a very fragile system,\u201d said Peter Schlosser, vice president and vice provost of global futures at Arizona State. Schlosser added that drilling there would disrupt the land and sea, and that potential contamination or oil spills are more difficult to clean up there due to low temperatures.",
      "Trump promised to eliminate what he incorrectly calls Biden's \u201celectric vehicle mandate.\"",
      "What that means in practice is that the order will revoke a non-binding goal set by Biden to have EVs make up half of new cars sold by 2030. He will also likely seek repeal of a $7,500 tax credit for new EV purchases approved by Congress as part of Biden\u2019s landmark 2022 climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "All of that is likely frustrating for automakers, who have to make long-term decisions, said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at auto-buying research firm Edmunds. As the rest of the world moves to electric cars, automakers have to decide how to factor in the global direction the industry is headed alongside the sudden lack of federal support.",
      "\u201cWe do think that the long-term end goal here is going to be electrification. It\u2019s just the timeline it seems is uncertain right now,\u201d she said.",
      "When the government reviews new facilities that emit pollution, officials are no longer likely to consider a concept known as environmental justice, or how that new pollution will add to the emissions that have tended to fall more heavily on poor and minority communities.",
      "Those are sweeping moves that Rena Payan, chief program officer at nonprofit Justice Outside, called \u201crolling back decades of progress in addressing environmental discrimination.\u201d",
      "That means more of a burden for state and local groups to fight to protect those communities. Trump\u2019s decision to cut off support will hurt, but many of these organizations are used to operating without federal support \u2014 they have done so for years, according to Peggy Shepard, co-founder and executive director of WE ACT for Environmental Justice.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019m grappling right now with is both the grief of these losses, and the fact that we were on an upward swing, if you will, just weeks ago,\u201d said Jade Begay, an Indigenous rights and climate organizer.",

      "Vaccination bills are popping up in more than 15 states as lawmakers aim to potentially resurrect or create new religious exemptions from immunization mandates, establish state-level vaccine injury databases or dictate what providers must tell patients...",
      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) \u2014 Vaccination bills are popping up in more than 15 states as lawmakers aim to potentially resurrect or create new religious exemptions from immunization mandates, establish state-level vaccine injury databases or dictate what providers must tell patients about the shots.",
      "Many see a political opportunity to rewrite policies in their states after President Donald Trump's return to the White House and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 's nomination as the next secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. The agency oversees virtually every aspect of vaccination efforts in the U.S., from funding their development to establishing recommendations for medical providers to distributing vaccines and covering them through federal programs.",
      "Childhood vaccination rates against dangerous infections like measles and polio continue to fall nationwide, and the number of parents claiming non-medical exemptions so their kids don't get required shots is rising.",
      "In 2024, whooping cough cases reached a decade-high and 16 measles outbreaks, the largest among them in Chicago and Minnesota, put health officials on edge. Most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "About half of Americans are \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d concerned that those declining childhood vaccination rates will lead to more outbreaks, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Yet only about 4 in 10 Americans oppose reconsidering the government\u2019s recommendations for widely used vaccines, while roughly 3 in 10 are in favor. The rest \u2014 about 3 in 10 \u2014 are neutral.",
      "Scott Burris, director of Temple University\u2019s Center for Public Health Law Research, has tracked public health legislation for years, and watched backlash against COVID-19 vaccines grow to include more routine vaccines as anti-vaccine activists take hold of powerful political pulpits.",
      "\u201cI think COVID and the politics gave standard vaccine denialists a lot of wind in their sails,\" he said.",
      "It's hard to predict what will pass into law in the states, Burris said, considering the vast majority of proposed bills in any state go nowhere. But the proposed legislation offers a glimpse into lawmakers\u2019 thoughts, and what else might follow.",
      "Religious exemptions for school vaccine requirements are among the most popular proposals so far. Lawmakers in New York, Virginia, Connecticut and Mississippi have introduced bills that would allow more people to waive routine shots. Indiana lawmakers will weigh religious exemptions for medical students.",
      "Earlier this month, West Virginia Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order on his first day in office that enabled families to receive religious exemptions from required school vaccinations.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a huge step,\" said Brian Festa, co-founder of the law firm We The Patriots USA, which works on vaccination-related cases throughout the country. \"That\u2019s a state that never had a religious exemption.\u201d",
      "Now, only four states allow just a medical exemption from childcare and K-12 immunization requirements: Connecticut, California, New York and Maine.",
      "Festa credited West Virginia's new religious exemption to Trump's nomination of Kennedy, as well as a 2023 federal court ruling that required Mississippi to allow residents to cite religious beliefs when seeking exemptions from state-mandated vaccinations for children.",
      "\u201cI think the writing\u2019s on the wall and they did feel the pressure,\u201d Festa said of West Virginia.",
      "In Connecticut, at least four Republican bills will try to revive the state's religious exemption for schools, colleges and daycares \u2014 something a contentious 2021 state law eliminated for students without an existing exemption.",
      "Connecticut health experts said at the time there was a slow but steady increase in the number of religious exemptions and declining vaccination rates in some schools. The state has historically maintained some of the highest childhood vaccination rates in the county, and in the 2023-2024 school year, more than 97% of kindergarteners protected against chickenpox, measles, tetanus, diphtheria, polio and more.",
      "Given that the U.S. Supreme Court last year rejected a challenge to the Connecticut law and the statehouse is controlled by Democrats, GOP state Sen. Eric Berthel said he\u2019s not optimistic legislative leaders will allow debate on his exemption bill, but does believe the broader cultural shift means \u201cmaybe there is a bit of an appetite to look at things like this again.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that we\u2019re not being fair to families who have a true faith-based reason to not vaccinate their child,\u201d he said.",
      "There's one outlier so far among statehouse trends on exemptions. Hawaii, where legislators are looking to move in the opposite direction with a bill to eliminate all non-medical waivers after struggling for years with high exemption rates.",
      "Other vaccine-related bills touch on some of the opposition that's been growing since the pandemic.",
      "Oklahoma and Alabama have proposals that would require parental consent for any vaccine given to minors. Bills in Wyoming, Oregon and Oklahoma would prohibit \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against people who aren\u2019t vaccinated against COVID-19 or other diseases.",
      "New York and Oklahoma have bills that would require providers to give people getting shots a full ingredient list, and Florida legislation would ban edible vaccines, though none are approved for use in the U.S. and research is still in early stages.",
      "Vaccine injury is also a popular topic, and bills in Indiana and North Dakota propose creating state versions of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System \u2014 a federal database that drew the attention of vaccine skeptics during the pandemic. Anyone can file a report about a potential issue after a vaccine, though the CDC\u2019s website notes a report doesn\u2019t prove the shot caused a health issue.",
      "North Dakota Republican state Sen. Dick Anderson said he's not against people getting vaccines \u2014 he got one COVID-19 shot himself \u2014 but proposed the bill because many people don't trust the CDC.",
      "\u201cWe have to do something to restore trust in the system,\" Anderson said.",
      "But experts note state databases are unnecessarily duplicative.",
      "\u201cA lot of these proposals, they're trying to fix something that's not broken and really working to counter the goal of preventing the spread of communicable disease,\u201d said Andy Baker-White, senior director of state health policy for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.",
      "Policy should be focused on getting rid of barriers to vaccination, not adding to them, said Dr. Susan Kressly, a pediatrician and president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Many families miss vaccinations not because of ideology, she said, but because of lack of transportation or not having primary care doctors or clinics nearby, among other things.",
      "But because most Americans are vaccinated, they haven't seen the effects of dangerous infections like bacterial meningitis that Kressly fielded calls about from fearful parents early in her career.",
      "\"Vaccines are really an American success story,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed 15 months ago that Israel would achieve \u201ctotal victory\u201d in the war in Gaza \u2014 by eradicating Hamas and freeing all the hostages",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed 15 months ago that Israel would achieve \u201ctotal victory\u201d in the war in Gaza \u2014 by eradicating Hamas and freeing all the hostages. One week into a ceasefire with the militant group, many Israelis are dubious.",
      "Not only is Hamas still intact, there\u2019s also no guarantee all of the hostages will be released. But what\u2019s really raised doubts about Netanyahu\u2019s ability to deliver on his promise is this week's return of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to their homes in northern Gaza. That makes it difficult for Israel to relaunch its war against Hamas should the two sides fail to extend the ceasefire beyond its initial six-week phase.",
      "\u201cThere is no war to resume,\u201d said Ofer Shelah, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies, a Tel Aviv think tank. \u201cWhat will we do now? Move the population south again?\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no total victory in this war,\u201d he said.",
      "Israel launched its war against Hamas after the militant group\u2019s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, in which some 1,200 people were killed and roughly 250 were taken hostage. Within hours, Israel began a devastating air assault on Gaza, and weeks later it launched a ground invasion.",
      "Israel has inflicted heavy losses on Hamas. It has killed most of its top leadership, and claims to have killed thousands of fighters while dismantling tunnels and weapons factories. Months of bombardment and urban warfare have left Gaza in ruins, and more than 47,000 Palestinians are dead, according to local health authorities who don\u2019t distinguish between militants and civilians in their count.",
      "But the \u201ctotal victory\u201d envisioned by Netanyahu remains elusive.",
      "In the first phase of the ceasefire, 33 hostages in Gaza will be freed, nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in Israel will be released, and humanitarian aid to Gaza will be vastly increased. Israel is also redeploying troops to enable over 1 million Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza.",
      "In the second phase of the ceasefire, which the two sides are expected to begin negotiating next week, more hostages would be released and the stage would be set for a more lasting truce.",
      "But if Israel and Hamas do not agree to advance to the next phase, more than half of the roughly 90 remaining hostages will still be in Gaza; at least a third of them are believed to be dead.",
      "Despite heavy international and domestic pressure to develop a postwar vision for who should rule Gaza, Netanyahu has yet to secure an alternative to the militant group. That has left Hamas in command.",
      "Hamas sought to solidify that impression as soon as the ceasefire began. It quickly deployed uniformed police to patrol the streets and staged elaborate events for the hostages\u2019 release, replete with masked gunmen, large crowds and ceremonies. Masked militants have also been seen along Gaza's main thoroughfares, waving to and welcoming Palestinians as they head back home.",
      "Despite the scale of death and destruction in Gaza \u2014 and the hit to its own ranks \u2014 Hamas will likely claim victory.",
      "Hamas will say, \u201cIsrael didn\u2019t achieve its goals and didn\u2019t defeat us, so we won,\u201d said Michael Milshtein, an Israeli expert on Palestinian affairs.",
      "The return of displaced Palestinians to northern Gaza is an important achievement for Hamas, Milshtein said. The group long insisted on a withdrawal of Israeli troops and an end to war as part of any deal \u2014 two conditions that have effectively begun to be realized.",
      "And Hamas can now reassert itself in a swath of the territory that Israel battled over yet struggled to entirely control.",
      "To enable Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, Israel opened the Netzarim corridor, a roughly 4-mile (6-kilometer) military zone bisecting the territory. That gives Hamas more freedom to operate, while taking away leverage that would be difficult for Israel regain even if it restarted the war, said Giora Eiland, a former Israeli general who had proposed a surrender-or-starve strategy for northern Gaza.",
      "\u201cWe are at the mercy of Hamas,\u201d he said in an interview with Israeli Army Radio. \u201cThe war has ended very badly\u201d for Israel, he said, whereas Hamas \u201chas largely achieved everything it wanted.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump could play an important role in determining the remaining course of the war.",
      "He has strongly hinted that he wants the sides to continue to the second phase of negotiations and shown little enthusiasm for resuming the war. A visit by his Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, to Israel this week and a visit to the White House next week by Netanyahu will likely give stronger indications of where things are headed.",
      "In announcing the ceasefire, Netanyahu said Israel was still intent on achieving all the war's goals. He said Israel was \u201csafeguarding the ability to return and fight as needed.\u201d",
      "While military experts say Israel could in practice relaunch the war, doing so will be complicated.",
      "Beyond the return of displaced Palestinians, the international legitimacy to wage war that it had right after Hamas\u2019 attack has vanished. And with joyful scenes of freed hostages reuniting with their families, the Israeli public's appetite for a resumption of fighting is also on the decline, even if many are disappointed that Hamas, a group that committed the deadliest attack against Israelis in the country\u2019s history, is still standing.",
      "An end to the war complicates Netanyahu\u2019s political horizon. The Israeli leader is under intense pressure to resume the war from his far-right political allies, who want to see Hamas crushed. They envision new Jewish settlements in Gaza and long-term Israeli rule there.",
      "One of Netanyahu's coalition partners already resigned in protest at the ceasefire deal and a second key ally has threatened to topple the government if the war doesn\u2019t resume after the first phase. That would destabilize the government and could trigger early elections.",
      "\u201cWhere is the total victory that this government promised?\u201d Itamar Ben-Gvir, the former Cabinet minister who quit the government over the ceasefire said Monday.",
      "Israel Ziv, a retired general, said restarting the war would require a new set of goals and that its motivations would be tainted.",
      "\u201cThe war we entered into is over,\u201d he told Israeli Army Radio. \u201cOther than political reasons, I don\u2019t see any reason to resume the war.\u201d"

      "Dutch authorities have arrested three suspects after the theft of a priceless ancient golden helmet that is considered a cultural icon of Romania",
      "BRUSSELS -- Dutch authorities on Wednesday arrested three suspects after the theft of a priceless ancient golden helmet that is considered a cultural icon of Romania and had been on display in a small museum in the Netherlands. There was no sign that the intricate helmet dating back some 2,500 years had been recovered.",
      "The theft of the helmet and three golden wristbands also on display sent shockwaves through the art world, and devastated Romanian authorities who thought they were loaning the items to a nation where security for museums was paramount.",
      "Dutch police said in a statement that the suspects were being interrogated and \"more arrests are not excluded.\u201d They did not elaborate.",
      "It gave a glimmer of hope to the Drents Museum, which has come under criticism, especially from Romania, for not applying sufficient security.",
      "\u201cWe are awaiting further developments with bated breath. The recovery without damage would be, for all, a fantastic next step. Not only for us, but also for the Romanian population,\" the museum said in a statement.",
      "The Cotofenesti helmet is one Romania\u2019s most revered national treasures from the Dacia civilization. It was on display on the final weekend of a six-month stint when it was stolen.",
      "Romanian President Klaus Iohannis called the artifacts of \u201cexceptional cultural and historical importance\u201d for Romanian heritage and identity, and that their disappearance had \u201ca strong emotional and symbolic impact on society.\u201d",
      "It was a heist that \u201ceven in our most pessimistic dreams, we would not have believed possible,\u201d said the director of Romania\u2019s National History Museum, Ernest Oberlander-Tarnoveanu.",
      "The helmet\u2019s fame and dramatic studded appearance mean it could never easily be sold, raising fears the thieves were after the gold itself. But melting it would reduce the treasure's cultural and historical value. Gold stands at about 85,000 euros ($89,000) per kilo, and the helmet is estimated to weigh slightly less than that."

      "Japan is to freeze voluntary funding for a United Nations\u2019 women\u2019s rights panel over its recommendation that Japan\u2019s male-only imperial succession rule should be revised from gender-equality perspectives",
      "TOKYO -- Japan on Wednesday said it will freeze voluntary funding for a United Nations\u2019 women\u2019s rights panel that called for an end to the country's male-only imperial succession rule.",
      "The unusual step comes in response to a report published in October by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, or CEDAW, urging Japan to revise the male-only succession rule under the Imperial House Law to allow a female emperor.",
      "The 1947 law, which largely preserves conservative pre-war family values, only allows a male to succeed to the throne and forces female royal members who marry commoners to lose their royal status.",
      "Japan on Monday informed the CEDAW that it will be excluded from a list of recipients of the country\u2019s annual voluntary contributions, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Toshihiro Kitamura said.",
      "The government sought the U.N.'s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, which manages CEDAW, not to use Japanese contributions for it activities. Japan will also suspend a visit to Japan by committee members planned by the end of March, Kitamura said.",
      "Japan\u2019s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi in October called the report \u201cregrettable\u201d and \u201cinappropriate,\u201d and said Japan had requested the removal of the reference from the report.",
      "On Wednesday, Kitamura reiterated Japan\u2019s position that the qualifications for the imperial succession is not part of basic rights and that the male-only succession under the Imperial House Law does not violate the basic rights of women and that it is not subject to discrimination against women.",
      "Japan\u2019s rapidly dwindling imperial family currently has only 16 members, including four men. The youngest male member of the imperial family, Prince Hisahito, is currently the last heir apparent, raising a concern for the system.",
      "Still, the conservative government is looking for a way to keep the succession stable without relying on women, such as allowing the family to adopt new male members from former noble families that lost their status after World War II."

      "ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkish authorities have detained a prominent investigative journalist and four of his colleagues and replaced an elected pro- Kurdish mayor with a state appointee on Wednesday, escalating a recent government crackdown on the opposition and dissenting voices.",
      "Critics say the crackdown follows significant losses by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s ruling party i n local elections in March as well as growing calls for early national elections. Government officials insist that the courts operate independently and reject claims that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated.",
      "Investigative journalist Baris Pehlivan was taken under custody late on Tuesday along with Halk TV television channel\u2019s chief editor Serhan Asker and presenter Seda Selek., the station said. The detentions came hours after Halk TV broadcast a recording of a phone conversation that Pehlivan held with an expert employed by courts to provide opinions. Critics accuse the court assessor of providing biased reports against mayors belonging to the country\u2019s main opposition party.",
      "Asker and Selek were released from custody on Wednesday on condition that they regularly report to the police. But almost simultaneously, authorities detained two other journalists from Halk TV \u2014 a station that is aligned with the opposition.",
      "The journalists face possible charges of disclosing a private conversation without permission and attempting to influence an expert witness.",
      "Earlier on Wednesday, the government removed Sofya Alagas, the elected mayor of the city of Siirt, from office and appointed the mainly Kurdish-populated region\u2019s governor in her place, citing her recent conviction over terrorism-related charges.",

      "A woman in South Africa has rescued more than 2,500 pugs over the years after she and her husband sold their house, lived in a trailer home for a while and generally reset their lives to help as many dogs in need as they could",
      "JOHANNESBURG -- Lots of hair shedding, tons of fun and a constant invasion of your personal space.",
      "That's what you're going to get with a pug, according to Cheryl Gaw, who has seen more than a few of the squashed-nosed pups in her time.",
      "Gaw has rescued more than 2,500 pugs in South Africa over the years after she and her husband sold their house, lived in a trailer home for a while and generally reset their lives to help as many dogs in need as they could.",
      "They eventually established their Pug Rescue South Africa in Johannesburg in 2010 because of an overflowing number of dogs in their house. It was \"never part of the plan\" when they looked ahead to their retirement, said Gaw, who is 63. \u201cOf course, the pugs won,\u201d she added.",
      "The center is currently home to nearly 200 pugs, the latest batch who have hit hard times and need a helping paw. Some of them were abandoned, some sick, and many were given up by owners who couldn't look after them anymore.",
      "Gaw's pug life started in 2008 when her husband, Malcolm, gave her one as a gift. At a pug club, someone asked if they'd be interested in providing a foster home for \u201ca couple\u201d of pugs. In the first year, the Gaws provided a temporary home to 60 pugs and had 19 in their home at one point \u2014 too much fur for one small house.",
      "\u201cThey are known as the clowns of the dog world, and they can make you laugh,\u201d said Gaw, giving her own breed guide. \u201cAlways in your space. They\u2019re just an amazing, lovable breed. And you always have hair on you.\u201d",
      "The rescue center's staff do their best to keep order. The routine is: 5.15 a.m., the dogs wake up and come out of the cottages where they sleep in groups according to their \u201cage and personality,\u201d said Gaw. Then there's breakfast, medication for those that need it, bathtime, playtime, grooming time, midday snacks, afternoon rest, more playtime, evening meal, more medication, and all pugs back in their rooms between 6-7 p.m.",
      "Fights occasionally break out. The veterinary bill for the center is nearly $40,000 a year, and it's a constant process of rescue, rehabilitation, and then trying to rehome them, with more pugs arriving all the time.",
      "\u201cThe operation doesn\u2019t stop,\u201d said Gaw.",
      "There is a reason why so many pugs need a new home. Their short muzzles, a mark of the breed, give rise to breathing problems and other health issues like eye and ear infections, she said. A pug\u2019s vet costs are not to be sniffed at and Gaw warns prospective owners to do their homework and get a good pet insurance policy: \u201cYou\u2019re going to need it.\u201d",
      "Many of the pugs have come to the Gaws because their owners can\u2019t afford those vet bills. Be prepared for their problems, she said, and also the hair, which she can't stress enough.",
      "\u201cThey shed an enormous amount of hair,\" she said. \u201dYou can brush them all day long, they still shed.\"",

      "The United Nations says Rwanda-backed rebels captured large parts of eastern Congo\u2019s largest city of Goma including its airport",
      "GOMA, Congo -- Rwanda-backed rebels captured large parts of Goma, the biggest city in eastern Congo, including its airport, the United Nations said, as Rwanda's president on Wednesday joined calls for a ceasefire in the decadeslong conflict amid mounting international pressure.",
      "Much of Goma was calm after a day during which thousands of fleeing people hunkered down by roadsides as missiles flew overhead, and injured people streamed to overwhelmed hospitals.",
      "While government forces still control pockets of Goma, residents who spoke to The Associated Press by phone on Tuesday said that the M23 rebel group was in control of much of the city.",
      "The M23 rebels, who said that they captured the city on Monday after a weekslong advance, are one of about 100 armed groups vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo. The conflict escalated with the rebels' advance into Goma, which left bodies on the streets and drove hundreds of thousands of already displaced people to flee once again.",
      "After clashing with government forces, the rebels took control of the airport, U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said at a briefing on Tuesday, warning of \u201crisks of a breakdown of law and order in the city given the proliferation of weapons.\u201d",
      "Rwandan President Paul Kagame said on X that he spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on \u201cthe need to ensure a ceasefire and address the root causes of the conflict once and for all.\u201d",
      "His government denies supporting M23, despite reports from U.N. experts who estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo. Rwanda has accused Congo of enlisting Hutu rebels and former militiamen whom it blames for the 1994 genocide.",
      "The East African Community, whose members include both Rwanda and Congo, are scheduled to discuss the conflict at a meeting on Wednesday. Congolese President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi won't be able to participate in the virtual summit, a spokesperson said, without providing further details.",
      "Pope Francis called for the cessation of hostilities and the protection of civilians.",
      "\u201cWe hope that all forms of violence against people and their property will cease as soon as possible (and) I invite local authorities and the international community to make every effort to resolve the conflict by peaceful means,\u201d Francis said at his weekly general audience.",
      "M23, made up primarily of ethnic Tutsis, has told the AP that it plans to set up an administration in the city so people can continue living normal lives and displaced people can return home.",
      "Analysts have warned that securing a rebel withdrawal could be more difficult than in 2012, when M23 first captured Goma but withdrew after days. Murithi Mutiga, program director for Africa at the Crisis Group, said that the group has become more emboldened by Rwanda, which feels Congo is ignoring its interests in the region and which has accused Congo of failing to meet demands of previous peace agreements."

      "Commercial fishing fleets have been playing a key role in the trafficking of parts of tigers poached in Malaysia, according to new research, information that could help enforcement efforts to save the critically endangered cat",
      "BANGKOK -- Commercial fishing fleets have been playing a key role in trafficking parts of tigers poached in Malaysia, according to research released Wednesday that could help enforcement efforts to save the critically endangered cat.",
      "The fishing boats are part of a network of routes used by sophisticated teams of poachers to move parts of illegally killed Malayan Tigers and other poached animals to Vietnam, according to the study by conservation organizations Panthera and ZSL in conjunction with Malaysia's Sunway University.",
      "Through interviews with more than four dozen people involved in the operations, including poachers and those who brokered sales of the illicit goods, researchers found that fishing boats were able to carry larger consignments, cheaper, and less likely to be checked by customs than land or air routes.",
      "\u201cTo really crack a problem and insert the right intervention that's going to have any impact you have to understand the thing inside out,\u201d said Panthara's Rob Pickles, the lead author of the study, in a phone interview from Kuala Lumpur. \u201cThat's what we hope that this study does \u2014 contribute to that depth of understanding of the problem to allow us to tailor the interventions.\u201d",
      "From a population estimated at some 3,000 tigers in the middle of the 20th century, the latest estimates are that there are only about 150 of the cats left in Malaysia and they have already gone extinct in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam over the last 25 years.",
      "In addition to poaching, tigers have lost much of their habitat to deforestation, and they have been falling victim in recent years to the canine distemper virus while a major source of food, the wild boar, has been decimated by the African swine fever virus.",
      "\u201cIt's their last gasp,\u201d Pickles said. \u201cThis is the last chance to turn things around.\u201d",
      "The tigers live in the forests of peninsular Malaysia, which is connected by land to Thailand to the north. They have also been targeted by poachers from Malaysia, Cambodia and Thailand, but researchers said the Vietnamese teams operate on a \u201cdifferent order of magnitude.\u201d",
      "Almost all from the poor, rural and rugged province of Quang Binh, where many took to the jungles to escape relentless American bombing during the Vietnam War, the poachers use well-honed bushcraft skills to live as small teams in the forests for three to five months at a time on poaching excursions.",
      "They capture wild tigers with heavy steel snares made of wires as thick as a person's index finger, as well as other animals.",
      "Once caught, the tigers are killed and processed largely for their bones, which are boiled for days until they become a gelatinous glue-like substance that is pressed into small blocks and sold for perceived medicinal benefits. Claws and teeth are used to make amulets.",
      "As Malaysia went on lockdown during the COVID pandemic, poaching operations came to a near standstill. The researchers were able to use the time to find and interview more than 50 individuals involved in the operations for the study, which was done in two phases concluding in 2024.",
      "Researchers learned that fishing boats were also used to carry bear paws and bile, live civets, wild boar tusks and meat, pangolins, monitor lizards and turtles.",
      "One person told researchers the fishing boats were ideal to send larger items like tiger skins.",
      "\u201cNobody checks,\u201d the interviewee was quoted as saying. \u201cIn addition, people can go back by boat so many things also can be brought back by this route.\u201d",
      "Malaysia and Vietnam have both been increasing maritime controls recently, making trafficking by fishing boats riskier.",
      "Malaysian authorities have also had success in catching poachers and have substantially increased punishments for wildlife crime in recent years, though the study also found that the managers who send the teams into the forests are rarely caught and can easily recruit replacements.",
      "Researchers also learned that many Vietnamese poachers take on significant debt to travel to Malaysia.",
      "They recommend that in addition to focusing more on fishing boats, authorities should target potential poachers in their home villages in Quang Binh with information about the increasing risks and diminishing returns to try and dissuade them from coming to Malaysia in the first place.",
      "Officials in Malaysia and Vietnam, both of which were celebrating public holidays this week, did not respond to requests for comment on the survey and its recommendations.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t arrest our way out of a problem or over-rely on the criminal justice system,\u201d said ZSL's Gopalasamy Reuben Clements, a co-author of the report.",
      "\u201cWe need to explore other approaches, such as highly targeted behavioral change interventions, that can run in parallel to arrests and prosecutions.\u201d"

      "For more than 470 days, Eitan Gonen publicly pleaded with his daughter to stay alive while in Hamas captivity",
      "RAMAT GAN, Israel -- For more than 470 days, Eitan Gonen publicly pleaded with his daughter to stay alive while in Hamas captivity. He didn't know if she would hear him, but he ended every interview he gave with the same hopeful message: Romi is coming home alive.",
      "When he finally got to speak to his daughter for the first time in 15 months after she and two other women were freed Jan. 19, he got his answer.",
      "\"She said, \u2019Dad, I came home alive,'\u201d Eitan Gonen told The Associated Press on Tuesday in his first interview with an international news outlet since her release.",
      "\u201cI know that my interview back then gave Romi a lot of strength, a lot of hope, something to cling on,\u201d he said.",
      "Romi Gonen, 24, was among the first hostages to be freed from Gaza and one of seven women so far released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners as part of the ceasefire, a long and uncertain process aimed at eventually ending the war. Some 250 people were kidnapped during Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. About 90 hostages remain in Gaza, although at least a third of them are believed to be dead.",
      "During the ceasefire's first phase, Hamas agreed to gradually release 33 hostages in exchange for Israel freeing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Six more hostages are expected to be released this week in exchange for hundreds of prisoners.",
      "Israel has been preparing for the hostages to return, with the expectation that after more than a year in captivity, many would likely be dealing with life-threatening health issues or other physical and psychological problems. This week, Dr. Ami Benov, who is working with the hostages, told reporters that the women were in poor physical condition and would face a lengthy recovery process, as they suffered from \u201cmild starvation\u201d and vitamin deficiencies.",
      "Sitting in a complex in central Israel where his daughter and some of the other freed hostages are staying, Eitan Gonen wouldn't comment on Romi's health but said there's a long road ahead.",
      "\u201cThe rehabilitation status just started,\u201d he said. Because she spent so long in captivity, the family isn't pressuring her to speak. Instead, they are trying to give her autonomy and control, and to let her take things at her own pace, he said.",
      "Like many others, Romi was taken captive at the Nova music festival. That morning, her sister and mother, Merav Leshem Gonen, spent nearly five hours speaking to Romi as militants marauded through the festival grounds. Romi told her family that she would try to hide in the bushes, as the roads being clogged with abandoned cars made escape impossible.",
      "For nearly two months, her family had no idea if she was dead. They only learned she was alive from other hostages who were freed during a weeklong ceasefire a month after the attack, Eitan Gonen said.",
      "Praising his daughter's strength, he said she survived in part by learning Arabic, as it was the only way to communicate with her captors.",
      "\u201cHuman beings will do anything to survive. Anything. And since the terrorists don\u2019t speak any other language other than Arabic, she didn\u2019t have any chance in order to communicate with them \u2014 to start learning their language,\u201d he said, noting that she has even spoken it at times since being freed, likely out of habit.",
      "Something else that helped her stay alive was the support from other hostages, Eitan Gonen said. For a period, Romi was held with Emily Damari, a British-Israeli hostage who was released along with her. \u201cI believe God set it up somehow that Emily and Romi ... had each other to survive. ... It\u2019s a dynamic duo,\u201d he said.",
      "Other released hostages expressed similar sentiments about their own time in captivity. Israeli soldier Naama Levy, who was released Saturday, wrote in an Instagram post that after spending 50 days mostly alone, she was given strength when she was reunited with other kidnapped soldiers.",
      "Being held hostage with someone can provide strength through a shared fight for survival in the face of unimaginable adversity, said Dr. Einat Yehene, a psychologist who specializes in trauma and loss and who is head of rehabilitation at the Hostages Families Forum.",
      "Even though he finally got his daughter back, Eitan Gonen is still urging the Israeli government to keep working to bring home all of the remaining hostages. And he urges the families of hostages to keep giving interviews in all languages and mediums, to maintain the pressure and let their relatives know they haven't been forgotten.",
      "But he's mostly focusing on spending time with his daughter.",
      "\u201cI just enjoy being with her even in silence, touching, hugging, watching her,\u201d he said. \u201cI missed it so much.\"",

      "The swift deportation Monday was disorienting for her and the 63 other migrants aboard and only possible because the Trump administration has enlisted the military to quickly scale up its deportation capacity, which usually relies on chartered flights.",
      "In the first week of U.S. President Donald Trump's second term, the Department of Homeland Security reported deporting some 7,300 people of various nationalities.",
      "The agent who apprehended Raymundo just a five-minute walk from the highway where a vehicle awaited to take her further into the U.S. told her that her deportation would be quick and warned that if she were to be caught again she\u2019d spend five years in prison, she said.",
      "The presence of U.S. military planes landing in Latin America raises concerns in a region with a history of U.S. military intervention, more so when they\u2019re carrying citizens of those countries in shackles.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro refused to let two U.S. military planes carrying deportees land in his country over the weekend. Instead, two Colombian air force planes were sent to the U.S. to pick up the Colombians and bring them home Tuesday, but only after a Trump tariff threat and a furious bout of diplomacy.",
      "Earlier this week, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum made a point of saying that four flights that had landed at a Mexico City airport in the past few days carrying deportees were all civilian.",
      "Guatemala has not publicly objected, and at least three U.S. military flights carrying deportees have landed there in the past week.",
      "\u201cWe cannot refuse them and it is our obligation (to receive the migrants),\u201d said Danilo Rivera, the director of Guatemala\u2019s Immigration Institute.",
      "Jorge Santos of the Human Rights Convergence, a Guatemalan coalition, said the deportations should be handled exclusively by civilians, without the use of military planes. He also criticized the practice of shackling deportees, although that occurs on civilian charter flights run by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "\u201cThe use of shackles must not be a condition of this situation, nor chaining their feet and hands and much less that a military authority have a role in the framework of an action that must be completely civilian,\u201d Santos said.",
      "Lesly Ram\u00edrez, who was on the same flight as Raymundo, said that her handcuffs were tight and hurt her hands. While the migrants were provided food on the plane, she said it was difficult to eat with their cuffed hands chained to their waists. Authorities on the plane removed them only shortly before landing, she said.",
      "Ram\u00edrez, 35, a single mother of two, had climbed the border fence and had been walking in the U.S. for two hours before the Border Patrol picked her up on Friday.",

      "More than 100 people were killed in a stampede in northern India in July 2024 following a Hindu religious gathering, making it one of the deadliest such accidents in years. Thousands had gathered at a makeshift tent for an event led by a Hindu preacher in Uttar Pradesh state. The victims were crushed to death as they rushed to leave. Video of the aftermath showed the makeshift structure appeared to have collapsed.",
      "A collapsing bridge caused a stampede that killed 115 people, mostly women and children, on Oct. 13, 2013. Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims had come to a Hindu temple in the remote town of Ratangarh in Madhya Pradesh state on the last day of the popular 10-day Navaratri festival.",
      "At least 168 people were killed and 100 injured when thousands of pilgrims stampeded at a Hindu temple in Jodhpur on Sept. 30, 2008. Severe overcrowding apparently caused the crush, as more than 12,000 people gathered at the temple to celebrate Navaratri, a Hindu festival.",
      "Dozens of women and children were among the 145 people who died on Aug. 3, 2008, when thousands of pilgrims stampeded at a remote mountaintop temple in northern India during celebrations to honor Shakrti, a Hindu goddess. The devotees attended a nine-day religious festival at the Naina Devi Temple in the Bilaspur district of Himachal Pradesh state. Rumors of a landslide apparently started the panic, according to a senior government official.",
      "A stampede during a religious procession to a hilltop temple on Jan. 25, 2005, killed at least 258 people and injured 200 in western India, near the village of Wai, some 150 miles (241 kilometers) south of Mumbai. The stampede was triggered after several Hindu pilgrims inside the temple fell on a slippery floor and were crushed to death by other pilgrims who apparently walked on them. Angered over the deaths, some pilgrims started a fire that gutted hundreds of makeshift shops along a narrow walkway leading to the temple and set off the deadly rush.",

      "That decision was made because of the possibility that more flights will follow the arrival of an initial flight to Brazil under the new Trump administration with 88 deportees on board this weekend. That followed dozens of flights during the Joe Biden administration.",
      "Local media reported that government officials were disturbed by the fact that Brazilians were kept handcuffed after an unscheduled stop in the Amazon\u2019s biggest city, Manaus, prompted by technical problems with the plane.",
      "A Brazilian military plane brought them to their destination, the city of Belo Horizonte in Minas Gerais, on Saturday afternoon.",
      "The next day, Brazil\u2019s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was seeking answers from Washington regarding the \u201cdegrading treatment\u201d of nationals during the recent flight. It cited \u201cthe use of handcuffs and chains, the poor condition of the aircraft, with a broken air conditioning system, among other problems.\u201d",

The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Brazil has permitted the use of handcuffs in exceptional circumstances, but not indiscriminately and there must be an evaluation of risk, the person said.",
      "Authorities are looking into how many were handcuffed. There have been passenger reports that the plane\u2019s air conditioning suffered problems, causing intense heat in the cabin, and they exited through the emergency door upon landing in Manaus.",
      "Commenting on the humanitarian center, Evaristo said the objective was to \u201censure that these passengers have good conditions for water, food and even temperature, which I think was the most damaging aspect\u201d in the first flight.",

The main draw are thousands of ash-smeared Hindu ascetics who make massive processions toward the confluence to bathe.",

    "story": [
      "U.K. Treasury chief Rachel Reeves says that the new Labour government is backing the construction of third runway at London\u2019s Heathrow Airport",
      "LONDON -- The U.K. government is backing the construction of a third runway at London\u2019s Heathrow Airport, Treasury chief Rachel Reeves said Wednesday.",
      "Another runway at the U.K.\u2019s main airport will bolster the country\u2019s long-term economic growth potential, Reeves said in a speech.",
      "\u201cWe cannot duck the decision any longer,\" she said. \u201cThe case is stronger than ever.\u201d",
      "Reeves said the government was inviting proposals over its construction by the summer and that it would then make a full assessment.",
      "\u201cThis will ensure that the project is value for money and our clear expectation is that any associated service transport costs will be financed through private funding,\u201d she said.",
      "For decades, campaigners, including from within her Labour Party, have opposed a third runway on environmental concerns. London Mayor Sadiq Khan, and John McDonnell, the lawmaker whose constituency contains Heathrow, have both voiced their opposition to the third runway.",
      "Reeves insisted the runway will be \u201cdelivered in line with our legal, environmental and climate objectives.\"",
      "Heathrow\u2019s plan to build a third runway received parliamentary approval in June 2018, but has been delayed by legal challenges and the coronavirus pandemic. Heathrow's chief executive, Thomas Woldbye, has said that he wouldn't continue developing the project without the government confirming that it wants expansion.",
      "Reeves' support for a third runway came in a wide-ranging speech on boosting U.K. growth rates, which have been historically low since the 2008 global financial crisis for a variety of reasons.",
      "The Labour government badly needs growth rates to increase over the coming years, so it can lift living standards following the cost-of-living crisis and to get money into ailing public services.",
      "Since taking office in July, Reeves and Prime Minister Keir Starmer have been criticized for talking down the economy and for increasing taxes on business, a combination that critics argue have led to a growth downturn in the past few months and the sharp downturn in the government's ratings in opinion polls.",
      "Though a third runway won't do much to bolster economic growth in the near-term as it would take up to a decade to build, Reeves hopes that the announcement itself will provide investors with a signal that the government is serious about turning the economy around.",
      "\u201cWe are not waiting for years into the future,\" she said. \u201cWe want to do things now, to turn around the performance, and we want to give businesses and investors confidence that this is a country to start doing things, to start making things in again.\u201d",
      "The construction of a third runway would require more than 700 houses to be demolished and sections of the M25 motorway, which encircles London, to be moved into a tunnel.",

      "GOMA, Congo -- Rebels backed by Rwanda captured more towns in eastern Congo on Wednesday as they moved beyond the key city of Goma in an apparent attempt to expand their control in the conflict-battered region.",
      "The rebels advanced toward the center of South Kivu province after taking several towns, including Kalungu, Kanyezire and Mukwinja, according to a local civil society leader and an aid worker in the area. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.",
      "U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the developments were concerning, and that the United Nations was taking measures to protect civilians and U.N. staff. The advance also raised fears of a prolonged occupation by the rebels, who have said they plan to set up a new administration in Goma, a city of 2 million people.",
      "\u201cLeft unchecked, the fighting could spread ... recalling the horrors of the late 1990s and early 2000s, when millions died,\u201d the Crisis Group said, citing the last, multi-country war there.",
      "Unlike now, the rebels captured Goma only briefly during their first rebellion in 2012, withdrawing after a few days under international pressure on Rwanda.",
      "Meanwhile, Congolese President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi was conspicuously absent from a summit of a regional East African bloc that began late Wednesday",
      "Faced with the rebel offensive, soldiers fighting for Congo \u2014 many of them mercenaries from other nations \u2014 were laying down their weapons at the border with Rwanda. Congo\u2019s army seemed to be in disarray, and those at the border appeared disorganized and ill-equipped for any major fighting.",
      "A rebel spokesman said nearly 300 mercenaries have surrendered their arms and returned to their countries.",
      "\u201cLet the people of Goma be calm, peace is here,\u201d said Willy Ngoma, a spokesman of the M23 group. Ngoma, who is on the U.N. Security Council\u2019s sanctions list for crimes committed by the rebels.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like you are fighting without command,\u201d said Jean Marie Ndahambaza, one of the surrendering soldiers.",
      "Armed groups have long vied for control of eastern Congo, which is rich in minerals critical to much of the world\u2019s technology, and has been the scene of proxy battles between Congo and neighboring Rwanda, as well as other powers. Fighting reignited this week, and the rebels backed by Rwanda, known as M23, announced Monday that they had captured much of the provincial capital of Goma.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of Goma residents were trying to get away from the fighting, with some retreating into Congo\u2019s interior to seek protection, and others crossing into nearby Rwanda. Rwandan border patrol agents thoroughly searched the belongings of the men, women and children crossing the border in waves, with suitcases and children in tow. The displaced people, looking exhausted but relieved, were then taken care of by the Rwandan Red Cross.",
      "Meanwhile, rebels took control of Goma's airport, said U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric, warning of risks of a breakdown of law and order in the city of 2 million people \"given the proliferation of weapons.\u201d Clashes with rebels continued in some parts of the city on Wednesday afternoon, including at the center of Goma in the neighborhoods of Katoyi and Kahembe. Other parts of the city were calm, with less fighting after a day during which thousands of fleeing people hunkered down by roadsides as missiles flew overhead, and injured people streamed to overwhelmed hospitals.",
      "Congolese President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi, expected to address the country later on Wednesday in his first public remarks since the incursion.",
      "The chaotic situation has its roots in ethnic conflict: M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled into Congo after the genocide.",
      "Analysts say the real fight is for control over the Congo\u2019s vast mineral deposits, estimated to be worth $24 trillion, and critical to much of the world\u2019s technology. M23 appears to be preparing to stay in Congo for good, telling the AP of their plans to set up an administration and return displaced people to their homes.",
      "Analysts have warned that securing a rebel withdrawal could be more difficult than in 2012, when M23 first captured Goma but withdrew after days. Murithi Mutiga, program director for Africa at the Crisis Group, said that the group has become more emboldened by Rwanda, which feels Congo is ignoring its interests in the region and failed to meet demands of previous peace agreements.",
      "While Rwandan leaders, mostly Tutsis, have denied backing the rebels, U.N. sources say some 4,000 Rwandan troops are in the Congo.",
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, whose troops are among the foreign peacekeepers in Congo, blamed the \u201cRwanda Defence Force (RDF) militia\u201d for the fighting and called for the withdrawal of the rebels.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 02:10:27 -0500",
    "summary": "Climate change and recent troubles with counterfeit seeds have challenged Kenya's agriculture efforts to improve food security",
    "story": [
      "Climate change and recent troubles with counterfeit seeds have challenged Kenya's agriculture efforts to improve food security",
      "KIKUYU, Kenya -- Tucked away in a lush, forested area of central Kenya's Kikuyu town, the National Seed Bank stands as a crucial safeguard for the future of the country's agriculture. Inside two chilly rooms of a government building, more than 50,000 seed varieties are cataloged and stored.",
      "The bank was established in 1988 after the realization that some traditional varieties of seeds were being lost, an occurrence that is becoming more common with climate change. It aims to conserve seeds for research and reintroduction to farms.",
      "\u201cWe realize that some of the traditional varieties that we had abandoned then are actually more resilient to climate change, so when you introduce them especially in marginal areas, those varieties outperform the improved varieties,\u201d said the director of the Genetic Resources Research Institute that operates the bank, Desterio Nyamongo, referring to hybrid seeds that must be bought every planting season.",
      "He said the some of bank\u2019s seeds also were found to be more resistant to diseases and pests and were high-yielding.",
      "This gives hope to a country that relies heavily on rain-fed agriculture instead of irrigation, leaving it more vulnerable to climate shocks like drought. The sector contributes a third of Kenya's GDP.",
      "Kenya is not alone facing food security pressures. According to a U.N Food and Agriculture and Organization report in 2023, over a billion people across the African continent are unable to afford healthy diets, and the number of hungry people is increasing.",
      "But in Kenya, another complication has emerged. Farmers in recent months suffered losses in the millions of shillings (tens of thousands of dollars) after planting counterfeit seeds bought from private sellers.",
      "Kenyan officials have acknowledged that the seed sector is critical.",
      "During the country\u2019s first international seed quality conference in August, the agriculture ministry\u2019s permanent secretary, Paul Rono, said Africa has limited capacity to produce high-quality certified seeds that are subjected to quality standards.",
      "The head of the Eastern Africa Farmers Federation, Stephen Muchiri, said the vigor of crops in Kenya has become low, and he believes that the main reason is a flawed seed breeding and propagation program.",
      "But some farmers say efforts to improve the seed system in Kenya have been limited by a 2012 law banning seed sharing, which is what millions of farmers did every planting season to cut their production cost.",
      "The government has said the law is meant to prevent the circulation of uncertified seeds and protects farmers, but it faces a court challenge from more than a dozen farmers across Kenya who say it's expensive having to buy new seeds every planting season. The next hearing in the case is in March.",
      "Francis Ngiri is one of the farmers who filed the case. He runs an indigenous seed bank for the local community on his five-acre farm in the semi-arid Gilgil area located 120 kilometers (74 miles) from the capital, Nairobi.",
      "His work has become a learning ground for farmers who have experienced disappointing yields from hybrid seeds.",
      "\u201cWe have seen that indigenous seeds are more resilient and perform better in our area even when there is reduced rainfall,\u201d he told The Associated Press.",
      "He passionately shares his knowledge on conserving the seeds using traditional methods such as covering them with wood ash \u2014 believed to repel weevils \u2014 or keeping them in earthen pots. He emphasized the use of locally available materials at no cost.",
      "Farmer Maximilla Onyura, who farms sorghum in the western county of Busia, said indigenous crops offer a food security solution. She isn't part of the legal challenge but collaborates with Ngiri through a Kenyan organization called the Seed Savers Network.",
      "However, \u201cinstead of our government encouraging those offering solutions through indigenous crops, they are now cracking down on those sharing seeds at community level,\u201d she said.",
      "Seed sharing in Kenya can bring two years in prison, a fine of up to 1 million Kenyan shillings ($7,700), or both. No farmer has been charged.",
      "The National Seed Bank occasionally distributes some of its collection to farmers at no cost in the hope that the varieties that had long adopted to local conditions will be more resilient.",
      "The director, Nyamongo, said farmers who cannot afford farm inputs like fertilizers required for hybrid seeds are better off planting the traditional varieties.",
      "\u201cIt would be wrong for farmers, especially farmers in marginal areas, to start thinking that using the indigenous seed is backwardness,\u201d he said. \u201cFar from it, because some of the indigenous varieties have adopted over time to the local conditions and therefore, they are more resilient.\u201d",
      "Nyamongo did not comment on the farmers' court challenge to the seed-sharing ban.",
      "The president of the Dutch-based climate change adaptation nonprofit Global Center on Adaptation, Patrick V. Verkooijen, said governments can invest in community-based seed programs to preserve a diversity of indigenous varieties.",
      "\u201cIndigenous crop varieties offer many benefits, particularly their genetic diversity, which helps farmers adapt to climate change, combat pests and diseases and manage poor soil fertility. However, they also come with challenges, such as potentially lower yields or susceptibility to new pests and diseases,\u201d he said.",
      "Kenyan proponents of indigenous seeds like Ngiri said lower yields and susceptibility to new pests and diseases only happen when a seed variety is taken from its native location.",
      "\u201cThe reason why they are indigenous is because they have adapted to the climatic conditions and the diseases found in the area they originally came from,\u201d Ngiri said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- On the campaign trail last year, President Donald Trump talked tough about imposing tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese goods and threatened to renew the trade war with China that he launched during his first term.",
      "But now that he's back in the White House, Trump appears to be seeking a more nuanced relationship with the country that both Republicans and Democrats have come to see as the gravest foreign policy challenge to the U.S. China is also a major trading partner and an economic powerhouse, and it has one of the world\u2019s largest military forces.",
      "\u201cWe look forward to doing very well with China and getting along with China,\u201d Trump said Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in comments that suggested Beijing could help end the war in Ukraine and reduce nuclear arms.",
      "As he moves forward with plans to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1, Trump has not set a firm date for China. He\u2019s only repeated his plan for a much lower 10% tax on Chinese imports in retaliation for China's production of chemicals used in fentanyl. On Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump was \u201cvery much still considering\" raising tariffs on China on Feb. 1.",
      "Trump, who spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping days before taking office, seems to be showing restraint and bowing to a more complicated reality than he described while running for office. Speaking of potential tariffs on China in a recent Fox News interview, he said: \u201cThey don\u2019t want them, and I\u2019d rather not have to use it.\u201d",
      "Liu Yawei, senior adviser on China at the Carter Center in Atlanta, said Trump has become \u201cmore pragmatic.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe signaling, at least from the election to the inauguration, seems to be more positive than has been expected before,\u201d Liu said. \u201cHopefully, this positive dynamic can be preserved and continued. Being more pragmatic, less ideological will be good for everyone.\u201d",
      "A Chinese expert on American foreign policy acknowledged that there are many \u201cuncertainties and unknowns about the future\" of U.S.-China relations. But Da Wei, director of the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing, also said Trump's recent change in tone offers \"encouraging signals.\u201d",
      "When Trump first became president in 2017, Xi and Trump got off to a good start. Xi was invited to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. A few months later, he treated Trump to a personal tour of the Palace Museum in the heart of Beijing, only to see Trump launch the trade war the following year.",
      "The U.S.-China relationship soured further over the COVID-19 pandemic, and it hardly improved during President Joe Biden's administration, which saw a controversial visit to the self-governing island of Taiwan by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a Chinese spy balloon aloft over U.S. territory.",
      "Biden kept Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods and intensified the economic and technological rivalry with export controls, investment curbs and alliance building.",
      "Now it will be up to Trump's top diplomat, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, to help chart a new path for the second term.",
      "During his confirmation hearing, Rubio said China has \u201clied, cheated, hacked and stolen\u201d its way to global superpower status \u201cat our expense.\" He called China \u201cthe most potent and dangerous near-peer adversary this nation has ever confronted.\u201d",
      "Hours after he was sworn in, Rubio met foreign ministers from Australia, Japan and India, sending signals that he would continue to work with the same group of countries that Biden elevated to blunt China\u2019s expanding influence and aggression in the Indo-Pacific region.",
      "Yet Rubio, who was twice sanctioned by Beijing and is known for his hawkish views on the Chinese Communist Party, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the U.S. should engage with China because \u201cit's in the interest of global peace and stability.\u201d",
      "In a Friday phone call, China's veteran foreign minister issued a veiled warning to Rubio, telling him to behave. Wang Yi conveyed the message in their first conversation since Rubio\u2019s confirmation.",
      "\u201cI hope you will act accordingly,\u201d Wang told Rubio, according to a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement that included a Chinese phrase typically used by a teacher or a boss warning a student or employee to be responsible for their actions. Rubio agreed to manage bilateral relations in a \u201cmature and prudent\u201d way, the ministry said.",
      "Members of Congress have noted Trump's seemingly softer attitude toward Beijing.",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut, wants to ensure \"that Trump does not let China off too easy.\u201d She urged the president to act now on measures that have won broad bipartisan support, including closing a tariff loophole on low-value packages, reviewing outbound investments and setting up a domestic industrial policy agenda.",
      "Beijing is seeking opportunities to create more breathing room in its relations with a U.S. president known for his transactional style. Chinese leaders are betting on engaging with Trump directly when his Cabinet members and advisers appear to hold clashing views.",
      "Trump \"is the most important person above all those different voices, and he can at least set the tone of future policy,\u201d Da said.",
      "The Tsinghua professor expects Trump and Xi to meet at some point. Effective communication channels will be crucial, Da said, to keep differences from spiraling out of control, as they did in Trump's first term.",

      "Lawyers representing victims of a deadly Hawaii wildfire have reached a last-minute deal, averting a trial to determine how to split a $4 billion settlement",
      "HONOLULU -- Lawyers representing victims of a deadly Hawaii wildfire reached a last-minute deal averting a trial Wednesday to determine how to split a $4 billion settlement.",
      "The agreement means victims and survivors will not have to testify, reliving in court details of the massive inferno in Lahaina that killed more than 100 people, destroyed thousands of properties and caused an estimated $5.5 billion worth of damage.",
      "Before the trial was scheduled to begin Wednesday morning, lawyers met in private with Judge Peter Cahill, who later announced that a deal had been reached late Tuesday. Lawyers are expected to file court documents detailing the agreement in a week.",
      "Some victims had been ready to take the witness stand, while others submitted pre-recorded testimony, describing pain made all the more fresh by the recent destruction in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cSome folks I\u2019m sure will be disappointed, because in their minds this was their time to share their story,\u201d Jacob Lowenthal, one of the attorneys representing individual plaintiffs, said Wednesday. \u201cOther folks are going to be relieved because they don\u2019t have to go in and testify.\u201d",
      "One of the individual plaintiffs is Kevin Baclig, whose wife, father-in-law, mother-in-law and brother-in-law were among the 102 people known to have died.",
      "Baclig said in a declaration that if called to testify he would describe how for three agonizing days he searched for them \u2014 from hotel to hotel, shelter to shelter. \u201cI clung to the fragile hope that maybe they had made it off the island, that they were safe,\u201d he said.",
      "A month and a half went by and the grim reality set in. He went to the Philippines to gather DNA samples from his wife\u2019s close relatives there. The samples matched remains found in the fire. He eventually carried urns holding their remains back to the Philippines.",
      "\u201cThe loss has left me in profound, unrelenting pain,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no words to describe the emptiness I feel or the weight I carry every day.\u201d",
      "Hawaii Gov. Josh Green announced the $4 billion settlement \u2014 agreed by the state, power utility Hawaiian Electric, large landowners and others \u2014 about a year after the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century devastated Lahaina in 2023. At the time, he touted the speed of the deal to \u201cavoid protracted and painful lawsuits.\u201d",
      "The trial was supposed to determine a percentage split between two groups of plaintiffs, including some who filed individual lawsuits after losing their family members, homes or businesses, and other victims covered by class-action lawsuits, including tourists who canceled trips to Maui because of the blaze.",
      "Only a nominal portion of the settlement should go to tourists whose trips were delayed or canceled, Lowenthal said.",
      "\u201cThe categories of losses that the class is claiming are just grossly insignificant compared to our losses,\u201d he said.",
      "Attorneys for the class have not responded to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment on the averted trial.",
      "In their trial brief, they challenged the idea that everyone who has a claim worth suing over had already done so. Many people held off hiring attorneys, the brief said, because of the fire's disruption to life, \"distrust in heavy attorney advertising, and a desire to see how the process plays out first.\u201d",
      "Separately, the state Supreme Court is considering whether insurers can sue the defendants for reimbursement for the $2 billion-plus they have paid out in fire claims, or whether their share must come from the $4 billion settlement. Oral arguments in that case are scheduled for Feb. 6.",
      "\u201cThat is the last big piece that needs to be decided before the global settlement can move forward,\" Lowenthal said."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has fired two of the three Democratic commissioners of the federal agency that enforces civil rights laws in the workplace, an unprecedented move aimed at implementing his crackdown on certain diversity and gender rights policies",
      "ARLINGTON, Va. -- President Donald Trump fired two of the three Democratic commissioners of the federal agency that enforces civil rights law in the workplace, an unprecedented move aimed at implementing his crackdown on certain diversity and gender rights policies.",
      "The two commissioners of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Charlotte Burrows and Jocelyn Samuels, confirmed in statements Tuesday that they were fired late Monday night. Both said they were exploring options to challenge their dismissals, calling their removal before the expiration of their five-year terms an unprecedented decision that undermines the agency's independence.",
      "In a similar move, National Labor Relations Board member Gynne A. Wilcox and General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo were also fired late last night, the agency confirmed. Wilcox was the first Black woman to serve on the Board since its inception in 1935, according to the NLRB website.",
      "The EEOC was created by Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act as a bipartisan five-member panel to protect workers from discrimination on the basis of race, gender, disability and other protected characteristics. The U.S. president appoints the commissioners and the Senate confirms them, but their terms are staggered and are meant to overlap presidential terms to help ensure the agency's independence.",
      "The two firings leave the agency with one Republican commissioner, Andrea Lucas, who Trump appointed acting EEOC chair last week, one Democratic commissioner, Kalpana Kotagal, and three vacancies that Trump can fill. Another Republican commissioner, Keith Sonderling, resigned after Trump appointed him Deputy Secretary of Labor.",
      "The EEOC panel investigates and imposes penalties on employers found to have violated laws that protect workers from racial, gender, disability and other forms of discrimination. The agency also writes influential rules and guidelines for how anti-discrimination laws should be implemented, and conducts workplace outreach and training.",
      "In recent years, the agency's Democratic and Republican commissioners have been sharply divided on many issues. Both Republican commissioners voted against new guidelines last year stating that misgendering transgender employees, or denying access to a bathroom consistent with their gender identity, would violate anti-discrimination laws. The Republican commissioners also voted against regulations stating that employers must give workers time off and other accommodations for abortions under the new Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.",
      "The firing of Burrows and Samuels appears aimed at positioning the EEOC to aggressively crack down on employers with diversity, equity and inclusion \u2014 or DEI \u2014 policies that the Trump administration believes veer into discrimination in their attempts to support racial minorities, women and other groups.",
      "Lucas, the new acting EEOC chair, issued a statement last week saying that she would prioritize \u201crooting out unlawful DEI-motivated race and sex discrimination; protecting American workers from anti-American national origin discrimination; defending the biological and binary reality of sex and related rights, including women\u2019s rights to single\u2011sex spaces at work.\u201d",
      "The three Democratic commissioners in contrast all issued statements last week condemning a slew of executive orders aimed at ending DEI practices in the federal workforce and private companies, along with protections for transgender workers. Their statements also emphasized that U.S. anti-discrimination laws remained intact despite Trump's orders and that the EEOC must continue enforcing them.",
      "Burrows, who has been an EEOC commissioner since 2015, said in her statement Tuesday that the dismissal of two Democratic commissioners before their terms ended \u201cundermine the efforts of this independent agency to do the important work of protecting employees from discrimination, supporting employers\u2019 compliance efforts, and expanding public awareness and understanding of federal employment laws.\u201d",
      "Samuels, who was appointed by Trump in 2020, said her removal \u201cviolates the law, and represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the EEOC as an independent agency \u2013 one that is not controlled by a single Cabinet secretary but operates as a multi-member body whose varying views are baked into the Commission\u2019s design.\u201d",
      "The firings drew swift condemnation from civil rights groups and organizations that promote the advancement of women in the workforce.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s outrageous firings send a cruel message that not all workers can count on the EEOC. Under the EEOC envisioned by Trump, the government will no longer have your back if you are a transgender or gay worker seeking fair treatment. And if you are a person of color or a woman, your success at work is evidence of \u2018illegal DEI,\u2019\u201d said Gaylynn Burroughs, vice president for education and workplace justice at the National Women\u2019s Law Center.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, condemned the firing of the EEOC commissioners and NLRB members. \u201cThese are yet more lawless actions by a president who thinks he is above the law and clearly could not care less about the rights of workers,\u201d she said in a statement.",

      "At 90 years old, the designer presented a collection diving into the archives of craftsmanship and moving some guests to tears as he took his bow at the end.",
      "\u201cHaute couture is fashion when it becomes art,\u201d Armani said, describing the ethos behind Priv\u00e9, the line he launched in January 2005. The name itself evokes rarity and exclusivity, serving as a platform for showcasing meticulous craft and timeless design, the house said.",
      "This spring 2025 collection revisited iconic elements from Armani Priv\u00e9\u2019s past \u2014 with unapologetically glamorous results.",
      "A segmented black gown shimmered with silver threads that gleamed like oil, Asian-inspired fitted jackets sparkled with intricate embroidery, and full skirts encrusted with crystals added both texture and weight, swinging heavily and noisily as the models walked.",
      "Pearls featured prominently throughout the collection, used as embellishments and symbolic references to serenity, a recurring Armani motif.",
      "The show\u2019s setting, within the palazzo Armani and beneath gold-gilded ceilings, provided an intimate yet majestic backdrop for the celebration. Guests, including Demi Moore and Jessica Biel, were seen to tap their feet to the booming music.",
      "While the collection embraced Armani\u2019s signature balance of creativity and restraint, some pieces leaned on familiar themes, reflecting the designer\u2019s adherence to his established aesthetic. Yet, this sense of continuity only heightened the timeless quality of the designs, reminding the audience why Priv\u00e9 remains a key part of the haute couture calendar.",
      "The emotional highlight of the evening came at the finale when Giorgio Armani himself emerged to take his bow. Slowly walking the runway, the nonagenarian designer received a standing ovation from some in the audience, many of whom were visibly emotional by the moment."

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 00:50:27 -0500",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump may want lower interest rates, but the Federal Reserve will almost certainly keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at its two-day policy meeting that ends Wednesday",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump may want lower interest rates, but the Federal Reserve will almost certainly keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at its two-day policy meeting that ends Wednesday",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump may want lower interest rates, but the Federal Reserve will almost certainly keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at its two-day policy meeting that ends Wednesday.",
      "It is likely to be a quiet start to an eventful year for the central bank. Trump said last week in Davos, Switzerland that he would bring down energy prices, then \u201cdemand\u201d that the Fed lower borrowing costs.",
      "Later, when asked by reporters if he expected the Fed to listen to him, he said, \u201cyes.\u201d Presidents in recent decades have avoided publicly pressuring the Fed out of deference to its political independence.",
      "Outside of a U.S. President bending norms, the Fed also faces challenges in achieving its economic objectives. Inflation remains above its 2% target: Its preferred measure is at 2.4%, though core prices \u2014 considered a better gauge of where inflation is headed \u2014 rose 2.8% in November from a year ago.",
      "Fed officials, led by Chair Jerome Powell, want to thread a moving needle: By keeping borrowing costs higher, the Fed hopes to slow borrowing and spending enough to reduce inflation, but without causing a painful recession.",
      "Powell said in December that the central bank has entered a \u201cnew phase,\u201d in which it expects to move more deliberately after cutting its key rate to 4.3%, from 5.3% in the final three meetings of 2024. In December, Fed officials signaled they may reduce their rate just twice more this year. Goldman Sachs economists believes those cuts won't happen until June and December.",
      "A cut in March is still possible, though financial markets' futures pricing puts the odds of that happening at just one-third.",
      "As a result, American households and businesses are unlikely to see much relief from high borrowing costs anytime soon. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage slipped to just below 7% last week after rising for five straight weeks. The costs of borrowing money have remained high economywide even after the Fed reduced its benchmark rate.",
      "That is because investors expect healthy economic growth and stubborn inflation will forestall future rate cuts. They recently bid up the 10-year Treasury above 4.80%, its highest level since 2023.",
      "Another reason for caution among Fed policymakers this year is that they will want to evaluate any changes in economic policy by the Trump administration. Trump has said he could slap tariffs of 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico as early as Feb. 1. During his presidential campaign he threatened to impose taxes on all imports.",
      "The Trump administration has also said it will carry out mass deportations of migrants, which could push up inflation by reducing the economy's ability to produce goods and services. At the same time, some economists say Trump's promises to deregulate the economy could lower prices over time.",
      "When Trump imposed tariffs on a limited number of imports in 2018 and 2019, Fed economists expected the biggest impact to fall on economic growth, with the inflationary impact being relatively minor. As a result, when growth did slow, the Fed ended up cutting its key rate in 2019, rather than raising it to fight off any inflationary impact.",
      "On Wednesday, Fed officials could also change the statement that they release after each meeting to upgrade their assessment of the labor market, a signal that rate cuts may be delayed.",
      "In December, the statement included a mildly pessimistic take: \"Labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low.\u201d In the summer and fall, employers slowed their hiring. The rise in the unemployment rate had unnerved Fed officials and was a big reason they reduced their key rate by an unusually large half-percentage point in September.",
      "Earlier this month, Fed governor Chris Waller cited weaker hiring as evidence that the Fed's key rate is \u201crestrictive,\u201d meaning it is acting as a brake on the economy and should bring down inflation over time. If rates are restrictive, that means the Fed would have more room to cut them if inflation were to decline further.",
      "Yet this month, just a few days after Waller's remarks, the December jobs report showed that hiring accelerated and the unemployment rate slipped to a low 4.1% from 4.2%.",
      "The healthier employment numbers suggested that hiring has at least levelled off. If it stays as strong as last month, the improved job gains would suggest the Fed's rate isn't restrictive at all, and few, if any, rate cuts are needed."

      "The Republican-controlled Wisconsin Legislature has asked that a liberal state Supreme Court justice step aside in a pending case that seeks to overturn a 2011 law that effectively ended collective bargaining for most state workers",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- The Republican-controlled Wisconsin Legislature on Tuesday asked that a liberal state Supreme Court justice step aside in a pending case that seeks to overturn a 2011 law that effectively ended collective bargaining for most state workers.",
      "If Justice Janet Protasiewicz agrees not to hear the case, the court would be deadlocked 3-3 between liberals and conservatives. The lawsuit has massive implications for union rights in the battleground state, the court would be deadlocked 3-3 between liberals and conservatives.",
      "A Dane County Circuit judge last month overturned the bulk of the law, saying it violates equal protection guarantees in the Wisconsin Constitution by dividing public employees into \u201cgeneral\u201d and \u201cpublic safety\u201d employees. Under the ruling, all public sector workers who lost their collective bargaining power would have it restored to what was in place before 2011.",
      "The judge put the ruling on hold pending the appeal. School workers unions that brought the lawsuit have asked the Supreme Court to take it directly, skipping the appeals court. The Wisconsin Supreme Court, controlled 4-3 by liberals, has not yet decided whether to take the case.",
      "Republicans enacted the law in the face of massive protests 14 years ago that made Wisconsin the center of the national fight over union rights. The debate also catapulted then-Gov. Scott Walker onto the national stage, sparked an unsuccessful recall campaign and laid the groundwork for his failed 2016 presidential bid. The law\u2019s adoption led to a dramatic decrease in union membership across the state.",
      "Protasiewicz is the court's newest member and ran in 2023 as an opponent of the union law, known as Act 10. Her victory gave liberals the majority on the court for the first time in 15 years. That majority is on the line again in the April 1 Supreme Court election to fill the seat of a retiring liberal justice.",
      "Protasiewicz said during the campaign that she believes Act 10 is unconstitutional. She also told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that she would consider recusing herself from any case challenging the law. Protasiewicz participated in protests against it and signed the petition to recall Walker.",
      "The Legislature's top Republicans, Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, said Tuesday that it would be \u201cright and ethical\u201d for her to step aside.",
      "Protasiewicz did not return an email from The Associated Press asking if she would recuse herself, a decision that is entirely hers.",
      "She is not the only justice on the court with a potential conflict.",
      "Conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn was Walker\u2019s chief legal counsel and had a role in drafting Act 10. During his successful run for the court in 2015, Hagedorn would not promise to recuse himself if a case challenging Act 10 came before the court.",
      "No request has been filed for Hagedorn to step aside.",
      "If both Protasiewicz and Hagedorn recused themselves, liberals would have a 3-2 advantage.",
      "The attorney for the unions that brought the lawsuit did not immediately return a message seeking comment.",
      "Supporters of the law have said it provided local governments more control over workers and the powers they needed to cut costs. Repealing the law, which allowed schools and local governments to raise money through higher employee contributions for benefits, would bankrupt those entities, backers of Act 10 have argued.",
      "Democratic opponents argue that the law has hurt schools and other government agencies by taking away the ability of employees to collectively bargain for their pay and working conditions."

      "Boeing posted a fourth-quarter loss of $3.8 billion on Tuesday as a machinists strike and other problems continued to plague the troubled aircraft manufacturer",
      "WASHINGTON -- Boeing posted a fourth-quarter loss of $3.8 billion on Tuesday as a machinists strike and other problems continued to plague the troubled aircraft manufacturer.",
      "Boeing has lost more than $35 billion since 2019 following the crashes of two then-new Max jets that killed 346 people. For the full year 2024, Boeing logged a loss of $11.8 billion.",
      "The numbers Boeing released are in line with what the company pre-reported last week, including nearly $3 billion worth of charges in the period due to the labor stoppage, job cuts and problems with a number of government programs.",
      "Boeing's loss per share was $5.46 per share, well above the $3.08 loss that Wall Street analysts expected, according to the data firm FactSet.",
      "The fourth quarter caps a rough year for Boeing. A strike by the machinists who assemble the best-selling 737 Max, along with the 777 jet and the 767 cargo plane at factories in Renton and Everett, Washington, halted production at those facilities and hampered Boeing\u2019s delivery capability.",
      "The walkout ended after more than seven weeks when the company agreed to pay raises and improved benefits.",
      "The company reiterated much of what it reported in last week's release, including that it took charges totaling $1.1 billion related to the 777 and 767 programs in the fourth quarter. Boeing took an additional $1.7 billion in charges related to a number of government programs including a military refueling tanker and Air Force One replacement jets.",
      "Boeing said revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $15.2 billion, below analysts\u2019 updated estimate of $15.7 billion, according to FactSet. Full-year revenue came in at $66.5 billion, a 14$ decline from 2023.",
      "As it also reported earlier this month, Boeing said it supplied 348 jetliners last year, more than a third fewer than the 528 the company finished for airlines and leasing outfits in 2023 and less than half the number of jetliners that Airbus delivered last year.",
      "Deliveries are an important source of cash for plane manufacturers since buyers typically pay a large portion of the purchase price when their orders are fulfilled.",
      "More than three-quarters of the planes that Boeing furnished were 737 Max jets, a reminder of how integral its best-selling airline model has been to the company\u2019s fortunes and challenges.",
      "The company had expected to ramp up production in 2024 until a panel called a door plug blew off a 737 Max shortly after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, in early January. In the wake of the incident aboard an Alaska Airlines flight, the Federal Aviation Administration capped production of Max jets until Boeing could convince federal regulators it had corrected manufacturing quality and safety issues.",
      "The hit to the company\u2019s finances and reputation extended to sales of new aircraft. Boeing received no 737 Max orders for at least two months and ended the year far behind Airbus in total net orders for commercial planes, an indicator that factors in cancellations.",
      "Shares of Boeing Co, based in Arlington, Va., nudged up less than 1% before the opening bell.",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 07:22:17 -0500",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump has already forced Colombia to accept deportees by threatening tariffs and is readying the same move against Canada and Mexico as soon as Saturday",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has already forced Colombia to accept deportees by threatening tariffs and is readying the same move against Canada and Mexico as soon as Saturday",
      "WASHINGTON -- Having already forced Colombia to accept deportees by threatening a 25% tariff, President Donald Trump is readying the same move against Canada and Mexico as soon as Saturday.",
      "But this time, the stakes are higher and many economists surveying the possible damage doubt Trump would be comfortable with what they say would be self-inflicted wounds from the tariffs.",
      "\u201cThe potential for such sizable economic impacts ought to act as enough of a deterrent that Trump will not end up implementing these higher tariffs,\u201d said Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics.",
      "Trump has repeatedly insisted that tariffs are coming on Canada and Mexico, despite both countries seeking to address his stated concerns about illegal border crossings and the smuggling of fentanyl. But the Republican president is also motivated by the idea that tariffs would force other countries to \u201crespect\u201d the United States.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to immediately install massive tariffs,\" Trump said in a Monday speech, adding, \u201cColombia is traditionally a very, very strong-willed country,\u201d but it backed down rather than face import taxes.",
      "Multiple economic analyses show that universal tariffs against Canada and Mexico risk more inflation and an economic slowdown. It's a much larger play than Trump's moves against Colombia, which accounts for roughly 0.5% of U.S. imports. By contrast, nearly 30% of all U.S. imports hail from Canada and Mexico, amplifying the risk that tariffs could fuel inflation and undermine Trump's campaign promises to get prices under control.",
      "Trump's director of the White House National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, dismissed these concerns. He said the skeptical analyses of tariffs don't look at the totality of Trump's promises.",
      "\u201cWhen the people who are trying to cause panic over President Trump\u2019s trade policy simulate what it\u2019s going to do, they don\u2019t account for all the other policies,\u201d Hassett said in a Monday interview on the Fox Business Network. \u201cSo President Trump is drill, baby, drill, and deregulate and tax cuts and reduce spending.\u201d",
      "After Trump\u2019s initial threat of 25% tariffs in November, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested Mexico could retaliate with tariffs of its own. Since then, she has been more measured, choosing to emphasize the strong bilateral relationship and willingness to engage in dialogue as the number of detentions at the U.S.-Mexico border has plunged.",
      "Sheinbaum pointed out in November that drugs were a U.S. problem, but in December the Mexican military seized more than a ton of fentanyl pills in two raids, calling it the biggest catch of synthetic opioids in Mexico\u2019s history.",
      "On Monday, Sheinbaum applauded the agreement reached by the Trump administration and Colombia.",
      "\u201cI believe the important thing, as I said on the first day, is to always act with a cool head, defending each country\u2019s sovereignty and the respect among nations and peoples,\u201d she said.",
      "Top Canadian ministers said last week that Canada was prepared to retaliate if Trump imposed import taxes, even as Canadian Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly said they \u201cwill continue to work on preventing tariffs.\u201d The working theory in Canada appears to involve being ready for anything that the U.S. president might do.",
      "On Monday, the economics division of the insurance company Nationwide estimated that Trump's proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico would increase inflation by as much as 0.5 percentage points and pull down growth by 0.7 percentage points.",
      "The analysis noted it did not \u201caccount for potential retaliatory tariffs from Canada or Mexico, which could amplify the deleterious impact on inflation and GDP growth.\u201d",
      "Trump has made lower gasoline prices one of his key strategies for tackling inflation, but tariffs on Canada could drive up prices at the pump unless Trump creates carveouts in his plan.",
      "\u201cFor example, 60% of oil and gas imports come from Canada,\" said Oxford Economics' Martin. \"A 25% tariff would lead to higher gasoline, diesel, and petroleum product prices for households and firms, especially in the Midwest and Rocky Mountain regions, where refineries are connected to Canada by pipeline.\u201d",
      "The tax services firm PwC looked at the possible impact of 25% tariffs and found that companies importing from Canada could have to pay $106 billion more annually in import taxes and those importing from Mexico could owe $131 billion more.",
      "\u201cWhen we think about hardest-hit industries, we think about transportation and automotive,\u201d said Chris Desmond, a principal at PwC's international trade practice. \u201cThe amount of companies that have operations in Mexico and Canada in that industry with components and parts as well, including even airplanes, that\u2019s going to be a huge hit.\u201d",
      "Desmond estimates that taxes paid on imports in the transportation sector from all of Trump's tariff plans, which include new taxes on China and other countries, could increase from $4 billion a year to $68 billion. It's unclear how companies would absorb those costs or possibly pass them along to consumers.",
      "None of those analyses is at the forefront of Trump's public thoughts. His argument is that tariffs would make the U.S. wealthy by sheltering it from competition and safer because they could be tools to force other countries to reduce illegal immigration.",
      "\u201cTariffs, I told you, most beautiful word in the dictionary,\u201d Trump said Monday as he recalled his campaign speeches praising the import taxes. He reminisced in that speech how he was criticized for praising the term, prompting him to conclude that tariff is, in fact, the fourth most beautiful word after \u201cGod, love, religion.\u201d"

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- An explosion struck a Hong Kong-flagged container ship Tuesday traveling north through the Red Sea, sparking a major fire that forced its crew to abandon the vessel, shipping industry officials said.",
      "The ship was drifting and ablaze some 225 kilometers (140 miles) off the coast of Hodeida, a port city in Yemen held by the country's Houthi rebels, said the Diaplous Group, a maritime firm. It did not name the vessel.",
      "Data from NASA satellites tracking wildfires showed the blaze burning Tuesday and Wednesday off Eritrea\u2019s Dahlak Archipelago corresponded to satellite-tracking data from MarineTraffic.com for the location of the ASL Bauhinia, a Hong Kong-flagged container ship. It had been traveling from the United Arab Emirates' Jebel Ali port in Dubai to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, before beginning to drift Tuesday.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear what caused the fire in the Red Sea, which has been repeatedly targeted by attacks from the Houthis. The rebels said last week they were limiting their assaults following a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. The Houthis did not immediately acknowledge the fire incident.",
      "The vessel was abandoned and the crew later rescued unharmed, another maritime industry official told The Associated Press. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as authorization hadn't been given to speak publicly about the incident.",
      "The official described the cargo aboard the vessel as \u201cdangerous,\u201d without immediately elaborating. The ultimate owner of the ASL Bauhinia, CSSC Hong Kong Shipping Co. Ltd., could not be immediately reached for comment Wednesday.",
      "The Red Sea is home to coral and marine life that previously has been threatened by burning ships from the Houthi campaign and the threat of wider oil spills.",
      "The Houthi attacks, which began in November 2023, have halved the number of ships passing through the Red Sea corridor, a crucial route for energy shipments and cargo moving between Asia and Europe. Despite the pledge by the Houthis to limit their attacks, shippers broadly are still shying away from the route over the risks.",
      "Some $1 trillion worth of trade passed through the region each year before the attacks."

The automaker is also taking a proactive approach with the United States government on regulations and doling out generous profit-sharing payouts to thousands of workers.",

      "It was unclear how much of Goma is controlled by the rebels, who marched into the city early Monday to both fear and cheers among residents. It was the culmination of weeks of fighting during which the rebels captured several towns in a shocking advance.",

      "The humanitarian situation in Goma \u201cis extremely, extremely worrying, with a new threshold of violence and suffering reached today,\u201d Bruno Lemarquis, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Congo, told reporters in a video news conference on Monday.

    "summary": "The Philadelphia Eagles can trace their run to the Super Bowl to an epic collapse last season",
    "story": [
      "The Philadelphia Eagles can trace their run to the Super Bowl to an epic collapse last season",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- The Eagles were indeed flying high as the best in the NFL, boasting a 10-1 record with a No. 1 seed, home-field advantage in the playoffs, and yes, a Super Bowl ring all ahead as credible goals.",
      "This season? On the way to the Super Bowl on Feb. 9 in a rematch from two years ago against Kansas City?",
      "No, try 2023, when coach Nick Sirianni and quarterback Jalen Hurts' run at a Super Bowl instead turned into one of the more epic meltdowns in Philly sports history \u2014 and there have been scores of them.",
      "The Eagles were 10-1 until they were clobbered by San Francisco at home by 23 points in an NFC championship game rematch. Dallas beat the Eagles by 20 points the next week and the losses \u2014 and finger pointing \u2014 snowballed from there. The Eagles limped to a 1-5 regular-season finish before they were put of their misery in a wild-card loss to Tampa Bay.",
      "Sirianni was on the hot seat despite three playoff appearances and a Super Bowl trip in three seasons. Changes were mandated \u2014 from the assistants to the game plan to drafting to repairing the loose connective tissue inside the locker room.",
      "The harsh lessons learned from last season fueled the Eagles on their way to a 14-win regular season and three more wins in the playoffs.",
      "Team owner Jeffrey Lurie and general manager Howie Roseman declined to move on from Sirianni and the Eagles made the moves needed to bring them back to the top of the NFL \u2014 and they are one win away from reaching the pinnacle.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been the story of the 2023 to the 2024 Eagles. As bad of a feeling we had about how last year ended, I think it makes you who you are,\u201d Sirianni said.",
      "Now, it's off to try to win just the franchise's second Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s pretty dope,\u201d Sirianni said. \u201cThat\u2019s all my focus is on.\u201d",
      "Perhaps a sign their rapport this season has turned more cohesive than taxing, Sirianni insisted Hurts was joking when the QB quipped after the NFC title game that he had been freed from the offense's \u201cstraitjacket.\"",
      "Hurts had six wins this season when he threw for less than 200 yards passing before he threw for 246 yards and accounted for four touchdowns in the NFC championship game win over Washington.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been winning a couple different ways this year. I think he was just having fun after the game,\u201d Sirianni said. \u201cI know this, and he\u2019s said this plenty of times: He doesn\u2019t care how we win. I don\u2019t care how we win, as long as we win. We do everything we can do to be able to win.\u201d",
      "The No. 1 storyline in training camp this season was just how thorny was Hurts and Sirianni's relationship last season and would any issues carry over into this one?",
      "Hurts offered a lukewarm endorsement of Sirianni in the aftermath of the playoff loss at Tampa Bay. He said days later his tepid response was only because he was caught off guard by questions about Sirianni\u2019s job status.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot together, right? A lot of wins, some down times,\u201d Sirianni said this week. \u201cThat\u2019s what kind of forges relationships.\u201d",
      "While some of the best Super Bowl winners in history have come with strained relationships between a QB and coach, Hurts has backed Sirianni publicly this season \u2014 even if it wasn't always a rousing endorsement. They are, through it all, only the first coach/QB pair in franchise history to make two Super Bowls.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s done a great job,\u201d Hurts said.",
      "One of the most distressing signs the Eagles were in free fall mode last season with no way out came when Sirianni made former Lions coach Matt Patricia the defensive play-caller and essentially stripped defensive coordinator Sean Desai of any true responsibility. Desai and Patricia were jettisoned in the offseason, as was offensive coordinator Brian Johnson. Johnson lasted only one season in Philadelphia and Hurts regressed, throwing a career-high 15 interceptions and with his passer rating dropping to 89.1 from 101.5.",
      "The new guys couldn't be better.",
      "Offensive coordinator Kellen Moore assumed play-calling responsibilities and has been one of the hottest head coaching candidates in the NFL. The Eagles jumped on hiring 66-year-old Vic Fangio to run the defense and he's made it the top-rated one in the league.",
      "The defense has allowed 10, 22 and 23 points and has 10 takeaways \u2014 including 21 points off three fumble recoveries against the Commanders \u2014 in the postseason.",
      "\u201cThe players have to play well to play great defense, so it\u2019s a combination of what Vic does and how he motivates the guys to get them to play to the highest level that they can,\u201d Sirianni said. \u201cJust got a ton of respect for him and sure glad he\u2019s here.\u201d",
      "A former backup QB who played behind Dak Prescott with Dallas in 2017 before becoming his position coach the next year, Moore directed a Philadelphia offense that featured Barkley as the ninth running back in NFL history to rush for 2,000 yards in the regular season.",
      "\u201cThere are different things that we\u2019ve been doing that have really helped us. There are some things that are similar to what we\u2019ve done in the past because we\u2019ve been good at those things,\u201d Sirianni said. \u201cAnd then there are things that are new to both what we\u2019ve done and Kellen\u2019s system as well. Kellen\u2019s done a phenomenal job of handling all those things, putting our offense in positions that we been successful in.\u201d",
      "Former Eagles running back Miles Sanders ran for a solid 1,269 yards in the 2022 Super Bowl season and Kenneth Gainwell was \u2014 and still is \u2014 a serviceable backup.",
      "Hurts was the team's leading rusher with 70 yards in the Super Bowl and the Eagles had just 115 yards rushing overall.",
      "The Eagles seem like a whole new franchise at times with Saquon Barkley.",
      "Barkley is near the top of the short list of all-time great Philadelphia sports free-agent signings. He ran for 2,005 yards, rips off 60-yard scoring runs with the ease of a Joel Embiid layup and has turned the offense into its most elite dual threat since the halcyon days of Donovan McNabb and Terrell Owens.",
      "The Eagles aren't going to have a chance at beating the Chiefs if Barkley isn't at his best \u2014 no small feat in a season that's earned him comparisons to Terrell Davis and Eric Dickerson as among the best for a running back in NFL history.",

    "story": [
      "It\u2019s a question Roger Goodell gets when he\u2019s in London: Would the NFL stage a Super Bowl internationally",
      "LONDON -- It\u2019s a question Roger Goodell gets when he\u2019s in London: Would the NFL stage a Super Bowl internationally?",
      "The usual answer is that America\u2019s biggest sporting event is reserved for cities that have NFL franchises. But as the commissioner noted in October, \u201c things change. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all if that happens one day.\u201d",
      "As the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles get set to square off in the Super Bowl in New Orleans on Feb. 9, here\u2019s a look at some key factors and possible venues if the league were to take its marquee event abroad in a bid to take the game to a truly global audience.",
      "It wouldn't be anytime soon. Super Bowl locations are set through 2028. And for international priorities, league officials are focused on increasing the number of regular-season games played abroad. Eight is the maximum number of league-operated games per season but they want to double that soon. This season, Brazil joined the list of countries to host a regular-season game. Spain is next. Ireland and Australia have been identified, and the league is considering the United Arab Emirates, too.",
      "Viewers \u2014 and advertisers \u2014 are accustomed to the 6:30 p.m. ET kickoff but with London five hours ahead and cities in Spain and Germany six hours ahead that would require flexibility on both sides. A game in Mexico City or Brazil would be easier from that perspective.",
      "Europe in February can be dreary weather-wise, but Real Madrid\u2019s newly renovated Santiago Bernabeu Stadium has a retractable roof. Even considering outdoor stadiums, Europe is the fastest-warming continent. The UK had its warmest February on record last year and was wetter than average, and Germany\u2019s weather service said the 2023-24 winter was the country\u2019s third-warmest and also one of the wettest.",
      "Goodell\u2019s comments in London also preceded the U.S. presidential election. President Donald Trump, who tried to buy the Buffalo Bills in 2014, has weighed in on NFL topics in the past.",
      "While U.S. cities are willing to bend to the NFL\u2019s considerable demands for Super Bowl week, their foreign counterparts may be less accommodating. In Europe, local governments are less likely to have the financial autonomy to underwrite a huge event, said Stefan Szymanski, a University of Michigan professor of sport management.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s also not clear why the NFL would wish to forego the much greater level of interest here in the US,\" Szymanski added. \"I think it would have to be far more popular in Europe for this to make any sense. But maybe one day.\u201d",
      "A look at some potential hosts:",
      "Pros: Time zone, proximity to U.S., weather. Azteca has hosted five regular-season NFL games, including the first one held outside the United States. Cool history \u2014 both Pele and Maradona won a World Cup at Azteca, site of the \u201c Hand of God \u201d goal by Maradona.",
      "Cons: Altitude. It is 7,200 feet above sea level (2,000 higher than any NFL stadium) Do you want to see players gasping for air by halftime? Not to mention thousands of American fans aren\u2019t traveling for a cardio workout. An NFL game in 2018 was pulled from Azteca on short notice because of field conditions.",
      "Pros: Basically, brand new and custom built with the NFL in mind, it boasts state-of-the-art infrastructure, dedicated NFL locker rooms and field. It has hosted games since 2019 and has a long-term contract with the league. Spurs chairman Daniel Levy got the stadium built and would be a key partner for such a big event.",
      "Cons: Time zone, weather, capacity (under 63,000).",
      "Pros: Wembley is the NFL's \u201cOG\u201d in Europe. It hosted the first regular-season game played outside North America \u2014 a mudfest between the New York Giants and Miami Dolphins in 2007, and it annually hosts a Jacksonville Jaguars game. At 86,000-plus capacity, it\u2019s significantly bigger than Tottenham. Jaguars owner Shad Khan tried to buy the stadium from the English Football Association in 2018.",
      "Cons: Time zone, weather.",
      "Pros: Home of Real Madrid soccer club, Bernabeu has a retractable roof, so no weather worries. Like Tottenham, there\u2019s a retractable soccer field that makes way for an American football field underneath. In 2025, the stadium will host the NFL\u2019s first-ever regular-season game in Spain. Real Madrid said the deal is for several years. Stadium capacity is more than 78,000.",
      "Cons: Time zone.",
      "Pros: A rebuilt Camp Nou with a capacity of 104,000 would offer the NFL the chance to stage the biggest Super Bowl ever. The record attendance is 103,985 at the Rose Bowl in 1980. Like Madrid, Barcelona also brings global brand power. Mediterranean climate. The league has already spoken to Barcelona about a regular-season game.",
      "Cons: Not in the NFL rotation yet. Time zone.",
      "Pros: The NFL has been eyeing a return to Berlin for years. \u201c Olympiastadion \u201d will host its first regular-season game in 2025 as part of a multiyear deal that involves the cooperation of the Berlin Senate. Playing in the capital likely gives Olympic Stadium an advantage over other German cities. Capacity is just over 74,000.",
      "Cons: Time zone, weather.",
      "Pros: A Super Bowl week amid iconic monuments and museums in the French capital might entice even some skeptics. Capacity is 80,000.",
      "Cons: The league and the stadium operators have discussed a regular-season game, but it hasn\u2019t happened yet because of uncertainty over the lease. Time zone, weather.",
      "Pros: One of the largest stadiums in Europe with capacity over 86,000. Dublin's proven ability to handle hordes of Americans who arrive each August for college football, though those games are at the smaller Aviva Stadium.",
      "Cons: Not in the NFL rotation yet, time zone, weather.",
      "Pros: Kickoff time. Enticing for traveling fans just weeks before Carnival. Capacity is 78,000.",
      "Cons: Not in the NFL rotation \u2014 Goodell has named Rio as a likely host but hasn't specified a venue. Sao Paolo's Corinthians Arena is too small. Might be too hot? February is Rio's hottest month with the average daily maximum temperature of 86 degrees and high humidity. The highest temperature at kickoff of a Super Bowl was in 1973 when it was 84 degrees.",

      "Jalen Hurts bucked decades of history just by getting back to the Super Bowl after losing his first trip there as a starting quarterback.",
      "Now Hurts will try to become the fourth quarterback to win the NFL's ultimate prize as a starting quarterback after losing his first Super Bowl start.",
      "Hurts came close two years ago when Philadelphia lost 38-35 to Kansas City in Glendale, Arizona. With a win next week in New Orleans, Hurts will be the first quarterback since John Elway 27 years ago to win a Super Bowl as a starter after losing in his first trip.",
      "Out of the 36 starting quarterbacks who lost their Super Bowl debuts, the only ones to end up on the victory stage as a starter are Kansas City's Len Dawson, who lost Super Bowl 1 and then won it three years later, and Miami's Bob Griese, who followed a loss in Super Bowl 6 with a win the following year.",
      "Just getting back to this stage is unusual for Hurts, who ended a string of 19 straight QBs who failed to return to the Super Bowl after losing their first trip as a starter. The last to get back was Buffalo's Jim Kelly, who lost four straight trips in the 1990-93 seasons.",
      "Hurts will one again face Patrick Mahomes, who will tie Elway for the second most Super Bowl starts at quarterback with his fifth next week, trailing only Tom Brady's 10. With a win, Mahomes will join Brady (six), Terry Bradshaw (four) and Joe Montana (four) as the only QBs with four rings.",
      "Mahomes will make his fifth Super Bowl start as a small group of QBs has had a stranglehold on the AFC's Super Bowl berths. In the last 22 seasons, only six AFC QBs have started a Super Bowl with Brady leading the way with eight, Peyton Manning having four and Ben Roethlisberger three. Joe Flacco and Joe Burrow each have one since the start of the 2003 season.",
      "It has been an entirely different case in the NFC with 19 quarterbacks combining for the 22 starts, including one for Brady with Tampa Bay. Hurts joins Russell Wilson and Eli Manning as the only quarterbacks to start two Super Bowls for an NFC team since the start of the 2003 season.",
      "The Philadelphia Eagles ran their way to the Super Bowl.",
      "The Eagles tied an NFL playoff record with seven touchdown runs in the NFC title game win over Washington, matching the mark Chicago set against Washington in the 1940 NFL title game.",
      "Hurts scored on three of the TD runs with Saquon Barkley adding three more \u2014 including his record seventh touchdown run of at least 60 yards this season. The only other teammates to each run for three touchdowns in a regular season or playoff game since at least 1940 came when Priest Holmes (four) and Derrick Blaylock (three) did it for Kansas City in a 56-10 win over Atlanta on Oct. 24, 2004.",
      "The Eagles also set a record for most yards rushing in a season with 3,731 in the regular season and playoffs. The mark before this season was 3,535 by Miami in its perfect 17-0 season in 1972. Baltimore also eclipsed that mark with 3,664 yards rushing.",
      "The Eagles have a chance to break their own record for most touchdown runs in a season. They have 39 heading into the Super Bowl \u2014 three shy of the mark they set in the 2022 season.",
      "Josh Allen once again came out on the short end of a playoff matchup against Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs.",
      "Allen is the first quarterback ever to lose four postseason starts against another QB, although little of the blame should be pointed in his direction.",
      "Allen has a 100.2 passer rating with 11 combined touchdown runs and passes and just one turnover in four playoff starts against the Chiefs and has lost all of them.",
      "Allen's 101.5 career passer rating in the playoffs ranks fourth best among the 74 quarterbacks with at least six playoff starts in the Super Bowl era, trailing only Super Bowl winners Mahomes (105.6), Kurt Warner (102.8) and Matthew Stafford (102.3). Allen's seven career playoff wins as a starter are the most for any QB who hasn't made the Super Bowl.",
      "The Bills became the first team to win at least 11 games in five straight seasons without reaching a Super Bowl, topping the previoius mark of four held by San Francisco (1995-98) and Philadelphia (2000-03).",
      "The coaching carousel is nearly filled with the New Orleans Saints the only team out of the seven who fired their head coach hasn't found a replacement.",
      "The new batch features four coordinators who got promoted into their first head coaching jobs and two retreads in former Tennessee coach Mike Vrabel getting the nod in New England and Pete Carroll getting hired in Las Vegas after previous stints with the Jets, Patriots and Seahawks.",
      "Carroll joins Bill Parcells and Marty Schottenheimer as the only coaches since 1940 who have had non-interim stints with four franchises.",
      "The addition of Carroll sets up a power-packed roster of coaches in the division, led by Kansas City's Andy Reid, who has 301 career wins and his going for his fourth career Super Bowl title.",
      "Denver's Sean Payton (179 wins) and Carroll (181) have combined for 360 additional wins with both winning Super Bowl titles. Jim Harbaugh of the Chargers has a .685 winning percentage in five seasons as an NFL head coach with one Super Bowl trip and a college national championship.",
      "He will try to join Carroll, Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer as the only coaches to win a title in college and the pros.",
      "The AFC West will be the first division to start a season with every head coaching having previously been to a Super Bowl. The 1999 NFC West came close with Atlanta's Dan Reeves, Carolina's George Seifert, New Orleans' Mike Ditka and St. Louis' Dick Vermeil all having gone with San Francisco's Steve Mariucci the outlier.",
      "Only two divisions didn't have any coaching changes with the NFC West and AFC North remaining stable. That's nothing new for the AFC North, which last had a coaching change following the 2019 season when Cleveland hired Kevin Stefanski to replace Freddie Kitchens.",
      "Next season will mark the sixth straight with the same four head coaches for the four teams. That's the longest stretch ever without a coaching change, topping the four straight seasons for the NFC Central in 1978-81 and the NFC West from 2019-22.",

      "Cricket Australia chief executive Nick Hockley praised the resilience of the players. He said it was a powerful moment when they were presented with their team shirts for the exhibition match.",
      "\u201cTo see their playing shirts for the first time with their names and numbers on the back, you can see how much it means to them,\u201d Hockley said. \u201cI\u2019m just inspired by their resilience, their love for the game.\u201d",
      "Hockley said CA would continue to \u201cadvocate\u201d for change at a global level through discussions with the International Cricket Council (ICC). He said Thursday\u2019s game represented an important first step.",
      "\u201cThis match shines the light on the fact that in places around the world, not every woman and girl has the chance to play,\u201d Hockley said. \u201cWe continue to advocate at the ICC and continue to engage with the ACB (Afghanistan Cricket Board).",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such a complex situation. It\u2019s bigger than cricket.\u201d",
      "Under Taliban rule, the Afghanistan Cricket Board cannot field a national women\u2019s team because the country\u2019s laws forbid women from playing sport, studying and medical education, moves that have been criticized by world groups including the International Criminal Court.",

      "England cricket captain Jos Buttler said last week that his side should not boycott a match against the Afghanistan men's team when they are scheduled to play in the Champions Trophy on Feb. 26 in Lahore. South Africa's sport minister, however, has urged the Proteas to boycott their match against Afghanistan in the same tournament.",
      "Asked why Australia was prepared to play a men\u2019s game against Afghanistan in an ICC event, but not in a bilateral series, Hockley said CA was \u201cduty-bound\u201d to play all its scheduled fixtures at ICC events.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really trying to do everything we can in our power to make a difference,\u201d Hockley said. \u201cWe\u2019ve played Afghanistan in other ICC events. You have to draw a line somewhere and I think we\u2019ve made our stance pretty clear.\u201d",
      "Mohammad Nabi and Rashid Khan from Afghanistan\u2019s men\u2019s national cricket team have posted support of women's education on social media after the Taliban closed training institutes for nursing and midwives.",
      "Hockley said he hoped Thursday's match, the format for which was not announced, would become an annual one and that it would \u201cpromote lots of conversations.\"",
      "\u201cYou need moments like this to prompt real change. The first piece is awareness,\u201d Hockley said. \u201cHopefully this game just raises awareness. I think it\u2019s a real beacon of hope.\u201d",

      "WNBA free agents can't sign contracts until Feb. 1.",
      "The 6-foot-9 Griner had spent her entire career with Phoenix since getting drafted No. 1 in 2013. Now 34, she decided this offseason to test free agency for the first time. Griner is signing for only one year because a new collective bargaining agreement featuring potentially massive salary increases is expected to take effect in 2026.",

      "Griner becomes the most prominent free-agent signing in Atlanta's history, and she joins a talented squad led by Rhyne Howard and Allisha Gray.

      "The 40-year-old Iguodala was the No. 9 overall pick in the 2004 NBA draft out of Arizona and played in 1,231 career games. He spent eight seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers, one in Denver, six with the Warriors, two in Miami and the last two back for Golden State. He was part of NBA champions in 2015, \u201817, \u201918 and 2022.",

      "Workers at a factory in rural Ohio were up all night churning out footballs for this year\u2019s Super Bowl",
      "As soon as this year's Super Bowl matchup was set, workers at the Wilson Sporting Goods football factory jumped into action.",

      "Here\u2019s a look at the footballs, by the numbers:",
      "The two teams will each get a shipment of 108, plus a dozen more for the kickers, all stamped with the Super Bowl logo and team names. Some of the balls will be for practices, while the best ones will be set aside by the quarterbacks. About 50 of those will be bagged and locked away for each team until it's time for kickoff.",
      "Wilson makes five different sizes for players of all levels, from the pros to youth leagues. Some have different patterns. NFL balls are notable for the lack of a stripe on the ends. They're also embedded with a chip that tracks the ball's position on the field, how far it travels and its trajectory.",
      "Normally it takes three days from start to finish. But the first batch of footballs must be sent to the Super Bowl teams Monday, within about 18 hours, so they have enough time to break them in for practices and the game. That's why the workers start production right away the night of the conference title games.",
      "It's a 20-step process, most of it by hand, from cutting out the four leather panels that are sewn together with 250 stitches to putting in the laces. For NFL footballs, the work goes to the factory's most experienced and skilled workers. \u201cCertain parts of the process require a handmade feel,\u201d said Kevin Murphy, general manager of Wilson Team Sports. \u201cIt's like making a beautiful, sculpted pair of shoes.\u201d",
      "Throughout production the balls are weighed, measured and inspected for flaws. Once finished, they're checked again. By the time they're packaged and ready for shipping, each one will have been touched by about 50 workers.",
      "It churns out roughly 500,000 footballs each year, or about 2,500 per day. NFL teams go through several hundred during a season. For the Super Bowl, Wilson will make between 10,000-20,000 commemorative balls that will be sold by retailers nationwide and at the game site. If there's high demand, the factory will keep producing the souvenir balls well after.",
      "Since 1941, Wilson has made every football used by the league. Its factory in Ada has been making the official game balls since 1955. This year the company opened a new plant in the village that allows for more production and a museum. Fans can tour the factory, too."

      "Five years after NBA great Kobe Bryant, 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others were killed in a helicopter crash in California, several women\u2019s basketball players reflected on what he meant to their game and how he championed it",
      "Dearica Hamby still smiles at the memory of Kobe Bryant sitting courtside at WNBA games.",
      "She had met him years ago. He came to see her old team, the Las Vegas Aces, play all the time.",
      "\u201cI think one of the first things he told me was that I could play defense,\" Hamby recalled. \"And I was kind of like \u2018Wha-at?\u2019 ... That's something I'll cherish with me forever.\u201d",
      "That epitomized the late NBA great's relationship with the women's game. After his 20-year playing career ended, Bryant turned his focus to the next generation, mentoring some of women's basketball's biggest stars, from WNBA champion and Olympic gold medalist Diana Taurasi to former Oregon star Sabrina Ionescu.",
      "He worked out with them, analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of their game and pushed for them to reach the same heights in popularity that he and his NBA peers did.",
      "For Hamby, now with the Los Angeles Sparks, Bryant saw an aspect of her game she didn't even know she had.",
      "\u201cIf Kobe tells you you can play defense, you can play defense,\" she quipped.",
      "Five years after Bryant, 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven others were killed in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California, several women's basketball players reflected on what he meant to their game and how he championed it. Many of them thought Bryant would be pleased with the overall progress of women's sports, which have skyrocketed in popularity and reach in recent years.",
      "That growth has been most prominent in the women's basketball arenas that Bryant and Gianna loved so much.",
      "The WNBA last season had its most-watched regular season in 24 years and its best attendance in 22 seasons. Some of the league's most popular players currently are competing in a new 3-on-3 league in South Florida called Unrivaled, founded by Olympic gold medalists Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart.",
      "\u201cWe carry this on for him,\u201d said Satou Sabally, a forward with the WNBA's Dallas Wings who plays for the Phantom squad in Unrivaled. \u201cHe would be so proud of this league. He would be proud of \u2019Phe and Stewie. I know that he\u2019s looking down and hopefully he\u2019s smiling and is proud of us.\u201d",
      "Sabally said she still gets emotional when she thinks of that day on Jan. 26, 2020. It reminds her of her playing days at Oregon, when she, Ionescu and their Ducks teammates connected over Bryant.",
      "\u201cI think about ... how we all bonded together over Kobe and how we bonded together for the rest of our lives because he was so impactful,\u201d Sabally added. \u201cHe was really a person that saw us women as the talents who we are. He came to the games, he was so outspoken and he really was really supportive.\"",
      "The shock of the superstar's death echoed throughout the sports and entertainment worlds, with many taking to social media to post emotional tributes to Bryant while expressing their disbelief.",
      "People were glued to their phones and TV screens as news of the crash spread. NBA players were in tears ahead of games that day.",
      "\u201cI still remember exactly where I was whenever we heard the news,\" said Kate Martin of the Golden State Valkyries, playing for Laces BC at Unrivaled, \"and no one really knew if it was fake or real. I think that\u2019s just one of those things where you\u2019re just always going to remember exactly where you were when you heard that.\u201d",
      "Martin never met Bryant but said she cherishes his mentality \u2014 he had a relentless competitiveness \u2014 and the way he elevated women's sports.",
      "Bryant became heavily involved with his daughters' hoops journeys and coached Gianna's youth team. He was often at women's basketball games, especially college ones, with Gianna, who was fascinated with the UConn Huskies. Gianna was in line to further Bryant's legacy on the court. The plan was for her to attend Connecticut, and surely the WNBA was next.",
      "Bryant was passionate about women's sports despite the belief of some that he should not have been involved with the women\u2019s game at all because of a 2003 charge accusing him of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old employee at a Colorado resort.",
      "Bryant had said the two had consensual sex, and the charge was eventually dropped when the woman declined to testify at trial. The woman later filed a civil suit against Bryant that was settled out of court.",
      "There's an image that still circulates in the sports world today: Kobe and Gianna sitting courtside at a 2019 game featuring his Los Angeles Lakers. He wore a bright orange pullover with a white WNBA logo on the front. Gianna sat beaming at his side.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of people started to follow behind Kobe because he recognized our gift and our talent and how special it really is,\" said former Chicago Sky head coach Teresa Weatherspoon, the current coach of Unrivaled's Vinyl BC. \"And his daughter was right there as well.\u201d",
      "That's who Bryant had become \u2014 a face of women's sports advocacy.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s greatly missed,\u201d Martin said. \u201cBut now his legacy will live on forever.\u201d",

      "Alexander Zverev says he is feeling down and emotional after once again coming within one win of earning his first Grand Slam title",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 Alexander Zverev described himself as \u201cquite down\u201d and \u201cquite emotional\" after once again coming within one win of earning his first Grand Slam title.",
      "And unlike his first two defeats in major finals \u2014 both of which he led, and both of which went five sets \u2014 Zverev did not come close to reaching the finish line Sunday in the Australian Open final, which ended with defending champion Jannik Sinner holding the trophy after his 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3 victory.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m doing everything I can. I\u2019m working as hard as I ever did. I think I\u2019m doing all the right things off-court. I think I\u2019m practicing the right things. But I lost in straight sets today. I mean, those are facts. That is a fact. I lost to Jannik in straight sets today,\u201d said Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany who is ranked No. 2 but did not seem anywhere near No. 1 Sinner on this occasion.",
      "\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t want to end my career as the best player of all time to never win a Grand Slam, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Zverev, whose post-match speech was interrupted by someone in Rod Laver Arena calling out the names of two women who have accused him of physical abuse in the past.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll keep doing everything I can,\" Zverev said, \"to lift one of those trophies.\u201d",
      "He is the seventh man in the Open era, which dates to 1968, to start a career with an 0-3 record in title matches at one of the sport's four most important events.",
      "Five of the other six went on to win at least one major championship. The only member of the group who hasn't is Casper Ruud, who is also the only one still active.",
      "Sinner offered support to Zverev during the trophy ceremony Sunday. That came in the form of an arm around the shoulder \u2014 and with his words.",
      "\u201cKeep believing in yourself,\u201d Sinner told Zverev. \u201cKeep working hard, because we all believe that you can lift one of these very, very soon.\u201d",
      "Simone Vagnozzi, one of Sinner\u2019s coaches, said about Zverev: \u201cI really hope, sooner or later, he wins a Slam, because he deserves it.\u201d",
      "Zverev's previous trips to the brink of achieving what he very badly wants came at the 2020 U.S. Open, where he built a two-set lead and even held a match point against Dominic Thiem before faltering, and at the 2024 French Open, where he led Carlos Alcaraz two sets to one before letting that slip away.",
      "This one never got to that sort of stage, and Zverev frequently showed his frustration by cracking rackets",
      "The nearest Zverev came to really making it close was when he was two points from taking the second set. But Sinner took the next four points and that, basically, was that.",
      "\u201cThat was a massive point. I think whoever wins that set, kind of can get a little bit of momentum. Being down two sets to love, especially, then his confidence goes up, mine goes down. It\u2019s a long way back then against someone like Jannik,\u201d Zverev said. \u201cIf it\u2019s one set all, maybe I have a chance. But ... I didn\u2019t stop fighting. I didn\u2019t stop believing. Then, in the third set, I thought he outplayed me more than in the other sets.\u201d",

      "The start of Sunday's race was delayed for 15 minutes as organizers needed more time to prepare the course after overnight snowfall and rain in the hours leading up to the race.",
      "Ariane Raedler had a nasty tumble when she came off the course and lost balance over a patch of softer snow, but the Austrian got up quickly and appeared to have avoided injury.",

    "story": [
      "A new report says advanced artificial intelligence systems have the potential to create extreme new risks, such as fueling widespread job losses, enabling terrorism or running amok",
      "LONDON -- Advanced artificial intelligence systems have the potential to create extreme new risks, such as fueling widespread job losses, enabling terrorism or running amok, experts said in a first-of-its-kind international report Wednesday cataloging the range of dangers posed by the technology.",
      "The International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI is being released ahead of a major AI summit in Paris next month. The paper is backed by 30 countries including the U.S. and China, marking rare cooperation between the two countries as they battle over AI supremacy, highlighted by Chinese startup DeepSeek stunning the world this week with its budget chatbot in spite of U.S. export controls on advanced chips to the country.",
      "The report by a group of independent experts is a \u201csynthesis\u201d of existing research intended to help guide officials working on drawing up guardrails for the rapidly advancing technology, Yoshua Bengio, a prominent AI scientist who led the study, told the Associated Press in an interview.",
      "\u201cThe stakes are high,\u201d the report says, noting that while a few years ago the best AI systems could barely spit out a coherent paragraph, now they can write computer programs, generate realistic images and hold extended conversations.",
      "While some AI harms are already widely known, such as deepfakes, scams and biased results, the report said that \u201cas general-purpose AI becomes more capable, evidence of additional risks is gradually emerging\u201d and risk management techniques are only in their early stages.",
      "It comes amid warnings this week about artificial intelligence from the Vatican and the group behind the Doomsday Clock.",
      "The report focuses on general purpose AI, typified by chatbots such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT used to carry out many different kinds of tasks. The risks fall into three categories: malicious use, malfunctions and widespread \u201csystemic\u201d risks.",
      "Bengio, who with two other AI pioneers won computer science\u2019s top prize in 2019, said the 100 experts who came together on the report don\u2019t all agree on what to expect from AI in the future. Among the biggest disagreements within the AI research community is the timing of when the fast-developing technology will surpass human capabilities across a variety of tasks and what that will mean.",
      "\u201cThey disagree also about the scenarios,\u201d Bengio said. \u201cOf course, nobody has a crystal ball. Some scenarios are very beneficial. Some are terrifying. I think it\u2019s really important for policymakers and the public to take stock of that uncertainty.\u201d",
      "Researchers delved into the details surrounding possible dangers. AI makes it easier, for example, to learn how to create biological or chemical weapons because AI models can provide step by step plans. But it\u2019s \u201cunclear how well they capture the practical challenges\u201d of weaponizing and delivering the agents, it said.",
      "General purpose AI is also likely to transform a range of jobs and \u201cdisplace workers,\u201d the report says, noting that some researchers believe it could create more jobs than it takes away, while others think it will drive down wages or employment rates, though there\u2019s plenty of uncertainty over how it will play out.",
      "AI systems could also run out of control, either because they actively undermine human oversight or humans pay less attention, the report said.",
      "However, a raft of factors make it hard to manage the risks, including AI developers knowing little about how their models work, the authors said.",
      "The paper was commissioned at an inaugural global summit on AI safety hosted by Britain in November 2023, where nations agreed to work together to contain potentially \u201ccatastrophic risks.\u201d At a follow-up meeting hosted by South Korea last year, AI companies pledged to develop AI safety while world leaders backed setting up a network of public AI safety institutes.",
      "The report, also backed by the United Nations and the European Union, is meant to weather changes in governments, such as the recent presidential transition in the U.S., leaving it up to each country to choose how it responds to AI risks. President Donald Trump rescinded former President Joe Biden\u2019s AI safety policies on his first day in office, and has since directed his new administration to craft its own approach. But Trump hasn\u2019t made any move to disband the AI Safety Institute that Biden formed last year, part of a growing international network of such centers.",
      "World leaders, tech bosses and civil society are expected to convene again at the Paris AI Action Summit on Feb 10-11. French officials have said countries will sign a \u201ccommon declaration\u201d on AI development, and agree to a pledge on sustainable development of the technology.",
      "Bengio said the report's aim was not to \"propose a particular way to evaluate systems or anything.\" The authors stayed away from prioritizing particular risks or making specific policy recommendations. Instead they laid out what the scientific literature on AI says \u201cin a way that\u2019s digestible by policymakers.\"",
      "\u201cWe need to better understand the systems we\u2019re building and the risks that come with them so that we can we can take these better decisions in the future,\u201d he said.",

      "A sleek white aircraft became the first independently developed jet to break the sound barrier Tuesday, tearing through the air tens of thousands of feet above the Mojave Desert and a crowd of delighted onlookers.",
      "The XB-1 aircraft accelerated to Mach 1.05 within about 11 minutes of taking off, according to Boom Supersonic and live video of the test flight.",
      "The flight at the Mojave Air & Space Port in Mojave, California, took place as the company works to revive supersonic passenger travel, which died with the grounding of the Anglo-French Concorde more than two decades ago.",

      "Chinese artificial intelligence startup company DeepSeek stunned markets and AI experts with its claim that it built its immensely popular chatbot at a fraction of the cost of those made by American tech titans.",
      "That immediately called into question the billions of dollars U.S. tech companies are spending on a massive expansion of energy-hungry data centers they say are needed to unlock the next wave of artificial intelligence.",
      "Could this new AI mean the world needs significantly less electricity for the technology than everyone thinks? The answer has profound implications for the overheating climate . AI uses vast amounts of energy, much of which comes from burning fossil fuels, which causes climate change. Tech companies have said their electricity use is going up, when it was supposed to be ramping down, ruining their carefully-laid plans to address climate change.",
      "\u201cThere has been a very gung ho, go ahead at all costs mentality in this space, pushing toward investment in fossil fuels,\u201d said Eric Gimon, senior fellow at Energy Innovation. \u201cThis is an opportunity to tap the brakes.\u201d",
      "Making AI more efficient could be less taxing on the environment, experts say, even if its huge electricity needs are not going away.",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s claims of building its impressive chatbot on a budget drew curiosity that helped make its AI assistant the No. 1 downloaded free app on Apple\u2019s iPhone this week, ahead of U.S.-made chatbots ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden we wake up Monday morning and we see a new player number one on the App Store, and all of a sudden it could be a potential gamechanger overnight,\" said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. \u201c It caused a bit of a panic. These were the hottest stocks in the world.\u201d",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s app competes well with other leading AI models. It can compose software code, solve math problems and address other questions that take multiple steps of planning. It's attracted attention for its ability to explain its reasoning in the process of answering questions.",
      "Leading analysts have been poring through the startup's public research papers about its new model, R1, and its precursors. Among the details that stood out was DeepSeek\u2019s assertion that the cost to train the flagship v3 model behind its AI assistant was only $5.6 million, a stunningly low number compared to the multiple billions of dollars spent to build ChatGPT and other well-known systems. DeepSeek hasn\u2019t responded to requests for comment.",
      "The $5.6 million number only included actually training the chatbot, not the costs of earlier-stage research and experiments, the paper said. DeepSeek was also working under some constraints: U.S. export controls on the most powerful AI chips. It said it relied on a relatively low-performing AI chip from California chipmaker Nvidia that the U.S. hasn\u2019t banned for sale in China.",
      "Data centers consumed about 4.4% of all U.S. electricity in 2023 and that's expected to increase to 6.7% to 12% of total U.S. electricity by 2028, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.",
      "It's been axiomatic that U.S. tech giants must spend much more on building out data centers and other infrastructure to train and run their AI systems. Meta Platforms, the parent of Facebook and Instagram, says it plans to spend up to $65 billion this year, including on a massive data center complex coming to Louisiana.",
      "Microsoft said it plans to spend $80 billion this year. And Trump last week joined the CEOs of OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank to announce a joint venture that hopes to invest up to $500 billion on data centers and the electricity generation needed for AI development, starting with a project already under construction in Texas.",
      "When there's an innovative technology that's useful to the general population and it's affordable, people will use it, said Vic Shao, founder of DC Grid, which delivers off-grid, direct current power to data centers and electric vehicle charging stations.",
      "That means data centers will still be built, though they may be able to operate more efficiently, said Travis Miller, an energy and utilities strategist at Morningstar Securities Research.",
      "\u201cWe think that the growth in electricity demand will end up at the lower end of most of the ranges out there,\u201d he said.",
      "If DeepSeek's claims hold true, some routine AI queries might not need a data center and could be shifted to phones, said Rahul Sandil, vice president and general manager for global marketing and communications at MediaTek, a semiconductor company. That would ease the computing need and give more time to scale up renewable energy sources for data centers.",
      "Bloom Energy is one of the AI-related stocks that took a hit Monday. KR Sridhar, founder and CEO, said it's imperative that the U.S. leads in AI because it can power data centers with clean energy, unlike other countries that still primarily rely on coal.",
      "\u201cWe can continue to make it better and we will continue to make it better,\u201d he said.",
      "Rick Villars, an analyst for market research group IDC, said the DeepSeek news could influence how AI researchers advance their models, but they\u2019ll still need plenty of data centers and electricity.",
      "\u201cWe think this actually could boost and accelerate the time frame for when AI becomes much more embedded into our lives, in the work sense, the living sense and in health care,\u201d Villars said. \u201cSo we still think the capacity is required.\u201d",

      "X is teaming up with Visa to soon offer a system for real-time payments on the social media platform",
      "NEW YORK -- X is teaming up with Visa to soon offer a system for real-time payments on the social media platform \u2014 signaling some progress in a yearslong vision from billionaire owner Elon Musk to create an \u201ceverything app.\u201d",
      "Visa is the first partner for the platform's \u201cX Money Account\" service, which is set to launch later this year, X CEO Linda Yaccarino said in a Tuesday post announcing the news. The offering, Yaccarino noted, will support an in-platform digital wallet and peer-to-peer payments connected to users' debit cards, with an option to transfer funds to a bank account.",
      "According to Visa, which also posted about the partnership on X Tuesday, these services will be powered by Visa Direct \u2014 the payment giant's instant money transferring service \u2014 and will be available to X Money Account users in the U.S.",
      "Whether X Money will become available to consumers in other countries, and perhaps through additional payment partners in the near future is still known. And an exact date for the U.S. launch has also not been announced yet.",
      "In her post Tuesday, Yaccarino called the partnership with Visa a \u201cmilestone for the Everything App\u201d and the \u201cfirst of many big announcements about X Money this year.\"",
      "The prospect of San Francisco-based X, formerly known as Twitter, becoming an \u201ceverything app\" has been floated around for some time. Before officially closing the deal to purchase the platform for $44 billion back in 2022, Musk expressed interest in creating his own version of something similar to China\u2019s WeChat \u2014 a \u201csuper app\u201d that does video chats, messaging, streaming and payments.",
      "And his fascination with such a platform began long before the Twitter deal was on the table. Musk has been toying with the idea of an \u201ceverything app\u201d since the late 1990s when he launched a startup called X.com that was later merged into what became X.com. He continued to push for PayPal to diversify but was rebuffed by company CEO Peter Thiel and other executives. PayPal was sold in 2002 to eBay for $1.5 billion \u2014 providing Musk with a windfall that he funneled into the creation of SpaceX and an investment in Tesla in its early days.",
      "The landscape is far more competitive today \u2014 with a handful of companies making similar efforts to expand their in-platform offerings. Other social media giants, such as Facebook parent Meta, have added shopping, games and even dating features.",
      "Consumers now have different platforms at their disposal for communications, payment services, entertainment and more. How X's coming \u201ceverything\u201d features will fare has yet to be seen. Since Musk's 2022 takeover, the platform has already alienated many users and advertisers over reports of rising hate speech and misinformation.",
      "X\u2019s ambitions could also thrust the company into the crosshairs of other powerful tech giants trying to fend off a perceived competitive threat. U.S. regulators have alleged that Apple, for example, has been illegally using its market power to stifle so-called super apps from making their way onto its iPhone since 2017.",
      "As part of an antitrust lawsuit filed last year, the U.S. Justice Department said it had uncovered evidence showing that Apple believed a super app would lessen consumers\u2019 usage of the iPhone\u2019s own software and services, including payment processing. The Cupertino, California, company has vehemently denied the allegations and is trying to persuade a federal judge in New Jersey to dismiss the entire case.",

      "BANGKOK -- The 40-year-old founder of China\u2019s DeepSeek, an AI startup that has startled markets with its capacity to compete with industry leaders like OpenAI, kept a low profile as he built up a hedge fund and then refined its quantitative models to branch into artificial intelligence.",

      "\u201cCurrently, neither tech giants nor startups have an unassailable lead. With OpenAI paving the way, everyone is working with published papers and open-source code,\u201d it quoted him as saying.",

      "DeepSeek is exploring what intelligence means, he said.",
      "\u201cPeople may think there\u2019s some hidden business logic behind this, but it\u2019s mainly driven by curiosity,\u201d Liang said.",
      "When DeepSeek was asked, \u201cWho is Liang Wenfeng?\u201d its first answer was to name a different Chinese entrepreneur with the same name, at least as spelled in English letters.",
      "When asked: \u201cWhere is Liang Wenfeng from and where did he go to university?\u201d it said that as of October 2023, the most recent knowledge cutoff for DeepSeek's R1 AI model, \u201cthere is no publicly available information about Liang Wenfeng\u2019s background, including his place of origin or educational history.\"",
      "\"If you are referring to the founder of DeepSeek, details about his personal life or academic background have not been disclosed publicly. For more information about DeepSeek, you can visit its official website,\u201d it said.",
      "Liang's focused approach fits in with his determination to push AI learning forward. After decades of relying on innovation from the West, he says China should be making its own contributions.",
      "\u201cWhat we see is that Chinese AI can\u2019t be in the position of following forever. We often say that there is a gap of one or two years between Chinese AI and the United States, but the real gap is the difference between originality and imitation,\u201d he said in another Waves interview in November. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t change, China will always be only a follower \u2014 so some exploration is inescapable.\u201d",

      "Chinese tech startup DeepSeek\u2019s new artificial intelligence chatbot has sparked discussions about the competition between China and the U.S. in AI development, with many users flocking to test the rival of OpenAI's ChatGPT",
      "HONG KONG -- Chinese tech startup DeepSeek \u2019s new artificial intelligence chatbot has sparked discussions about the competition between China and the U.S. in AI development, with many users flocking to test the rival of OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s AI assistant became the No. 1 downloaded free app on Apple\u2019s iPhone store on Tuesday afternoon and its launch made Wall Street tech superstars' stocks tumble. Observers are eager to see whether the Chinese company has matched America\u2019s leading AI companies at a fraction of the cost.",
      "The chatbot's ultimate impact on the AI industry is still unclear, but it appears to censor answers on sensitive Chinese topics, a practice commonly seen on China's internet. In 2023, China issued regulations requiring companies to conduct a security review and obtain approvals before their products can be publicly launched.",
      "Here are some answers The Associated Press received from DeepSeek's new chatbot and ChatGPT:",
      "For many Chinese, the Winnie the Pooh character is a playful taunt of President Xi Jinping. Chinese censors in the past briefly banned social media searches for the bear in mainland China.",
      "ChatGPT got that idea right. It said Winnie the Pooh had become a symbol of political satire and resistance, often used to mock or criticize Xi. It explained that internet users started comparing Xi to the bear over similarities in their physical appearances.",
      "DeepSeek's chatbot said the bear is a beloved cartoon character that is adored by countless children and families in China, symbolizing joy and friendship.",
      "Then, abruptly, it said the Chinese government is \u201cdedicated to providing a wholesome cyberspace for its citizens.\" It added that all online content is managed following Chinese laws and socialist core values, with the aim of protecting national security and social stability.",
      "It might be easy for many people to answer, but both AI chatbots mistakenly said Joe Biden, whose term ended last week, because their data was last updated in October 2023. But they both tried to be responsible by reminding users to verify with updated sources.",
      "The 1989 crackdown saw government troops open fire on student-led pro-democracy protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, resulting in hundreds, if not thousands, of deaths. The event remains a taboo subject in mainland China.",
      "DeepSeek's chatbot answered, \u201cSorry, that's beyond my current scope. Let's talk about something else.\u201d",
      "But ChatGPT gave a detailed answer on what it called \u201cone of the most significant and tragic events\u201d in modern Chinese history. The chatbot talked about the background of the massive protests, the estimated casualties and the legacy.",
      "DeepSeek's chatbot's answer echoed China's official statements, saying the relationship between the world's two largest economies is one of the most important bilateral relationships globally. It said China is committed to developing ties with the U.S. based on mutual respect and win-win cooperation.",
      "\u201cWe hope that the United States will work with China to meet each other halfway, properly manage differences, promote mutually beneficial cooperation, and push forward the healthy and stable development of China-U.S. relations,\u201d it said.",
      "ChatGPT's answer was more nuanced. It said the state of the U.S.-China relationship is complex, characterized by a mix of economic interdependence, geopolitical rivalry and collaboration on global issues. It highlighted key topics including the two countries' tensions over the South China Sea and Taiwan, their technological competition and more.",
      "\u201cThe relationship between the U.S. and China remains tense but crucial,\u201d part of its answer said.",
      "Again \u2014 like the Chinese official narrative \u2014 DeepSeek's chatbot said Taiwan has been an integral part of China since ancient times.",
      "\u201cCompatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are connected by blood, jointly committed to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,\u201d it said.",
      "ChatGPT said the answer depends on one's perspective, while laying out China and Taiwan's positions and the views of the international community. It said from a legal and political standpoint, China claims Taiwan is part of its territory and the island democracy operates as a \u201cde facto independent country\u201d with its own government, economy and military.",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 00:26:26 -0500",
    "summary": "NATO is deploying eyes in the sky and on the Baltic Sea to protect cables and pipelines that stitch together the nine countries with shores on Baltic waters",
    "story": [
      "NATO is deploying eyes in the sky and on the Baltic Sea to protect cables and pipelines that stitch together the nine countries with shores on Baltic waters",
      "ABOARD A FRENCH NAVY FLIGHT OVER THE BALTIC SEA -- With its powerful camera, the French Navy surveillance plane scouring the Baltic Sea zoomed in on a cargo ship plowing the waters below \u2014 closer, closer and closer still until the camera operator could make out details on the vessel's front deck and smoke pouring from its chimney.",
      "The long-range Atlantique 2 aircraft on a new mission for NATO then shifted its high-tech gaze onto another target, and another after that until, after more than five hours on patrol, the plane's array of sensors had scoped out the bulk of the Baltic \u2014 from Germany in the west to Estonia in the northeast, bordering Russia.",
      "The flight's mere presence in the skies above the strategic sea last week, combined with military ships patrolling on the waters, also sent an unmistakable message: The NATO alliance is ratcheting up its guard against suspected attempts to sabotage underwater energy and data cables and pipelines that crisscross the Baltic, prompted by a growing catalogue of incidents that have damaged them.",
      "\u201cWe will do everything in our power to make sure that we fight back, that we are able to see what is happening and then take the next steps to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. And our adversaries should know this,\" NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said this month in announcing a new alliance mission, dubbed \u201cBaltic Sentry,\u201d to protect the underwater infrastructure vital to the economic well-being of Baltic-region nations.",
      "Power and communications cables and gas pipelines stitch together the nine countries with shores on the Baltic, a relatively shallow and nearly landlocked sea. A few examples are the 152-kilometer (94-mile) Balticconnector pipeline that carries gas between Finland and Estonia, the high-voltage Baltic Cable connecting the power grids of Sweden and Germany, and the 1,173-kilometer (729-mile) C-Lion1 telecommunications cable between Finland and Germany.",
      "Undersea pipes and cables help power economies, keep houses warm and connect billions of people. More than 1.3 million kilometers (807,800 miles) of fiber optic cables \u2014 more than enough to stretch to the moon and back \u2014 span the world's oceans and seas, according to TeleGeography, which tracks and maps the vital communication networks. The cables are typically the width of a garden hose. But 97% of the world\u2019s communications, including trillions of dollars of financial transactions, pass through them each day.",
      "\u201cIn the last two months alone, we have seen damage to a cable connecting Lithuania and Sweden, another connecting Germany and Finland, and most recently, a number of cables linking Estonia and Finland. Investigations of all of these cases are still ongoing. But there is reason for grave concern,\" Rutte said on Jan. 14.",
      "At least 11 Baltic cables have been damaged since October 2023 \u2014 the most recent being a fiber optic cable connecting Latvia and the Swedish island of Gotland, reported to have ruptured on Sunday. Although cable operators note that subsea cable damage is commonplace, the frequency and concentration of incidents in the Baltic heightened suspicions that damage might have been deliberate.",
      "There also are fears that Russia could target cables as part of a wider campaign of so-called \u201chybrid warfare\u201d to destabilize European nations helping Ukraine defend itself against the full-scale invasion that Moscow has been pursuing since 2022.",
      "Without specifically blaming Russia, Rutte said: \u201cHybrid means sabotage. Hybrid means cyber-attacks. Hybrid means sometimes even assassination attacks, attempts, and in this case, it means hitting on our critical undersea infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Finnish police suspect that the Eagle S, an oil tanker that damaged the Estlink 2 power cable and two other communications cables linking Finland and Estonia on Dec. 25th, is part of Moscow\u2019s \u201cshadow fleet\u201d used to avoid war-related sanctions on Russian oil exports.",
      "Finnish authorities seized the tanker shortly after it left a Russian port and apparently cut the cables by dragging its anchor. Finnish investigators allege the ship left an almost 100-kilometer (62-mile) long anchor trail on the seabed.",
      "Several Western intelligence officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of their work, told The Associated Press that recent damage was most likely accidental, seemingly caused by anchors being dragged by ships that were poorly maintained and poorly crewed.",
      "One senior intelligence official told AP that ships' logs and mechanical failures with ships' anchors were among \u201cmultiple indications\u201d pointing away from Russian sabotage. The official said Russian cables were also severed. Another Western official, also speaking anonymously to discuss intelligence matters, said Russia sent an intelligence-gathering vessel to the site of one cable rupture to investigate the damage.",
      "The Washington Post first reported on the emerging consensus among U.S. and European security services that maritime accidents likely caused recent damage.",
      "The European Subsea Cables Association, representing cable owners and operators, noted in November after faults were reported on two Baltic links that, on average, a subsea cable is damaged somewhere in the world every three days. In northern European waters, the main causes of damage are commercial fishing or ship anchors, it said.",
      "In the fiber-optic cable rupture on Sunday connecting Latvia and Sweden, Swedish authorities detained a Maltese-flagged ship bound for South America with a cargo of fertilizer.",
      "Navibulgar, a Bulgarian company that owns the Vezhen, said any damage was unintentional and that the ship's crew discovered while navigating in extremely bad weather that its left anchor appeared to have dragged on the seabed.",
      "The alliance is deploying warships, maritime patrol aircraft and naval drones for the mission to provide \u201cenhanced surveillance and deterrence.\u201d",
      "Aboard the French Navy surveillance flight, the 14-member crew cross-checked ships they spotted from the air against lists of vessels they had been ordered to watch for.",
      "\u201cIf we witness some suspicious activities from ships as sea \u2013 for example, ships at very low speed or at anchorage in a position that they shouldn\u2019t be at this time \u2013 so this is something we can see,\u201d said the flight commander, Lt. Alban, whose surname was withheld by the French military for security reasons.",
      "\u201cWe can have a very close look with our sensors to see what is happening.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump says Microsoft is among the U.S. companies looking to take control of TikTok to help the popular app avert an effective ban that could kick-in in April",
      "President Donald Trump said Monday evening that Microsoft is among the U.S. companies looking to take control of TikTok to help the popular app avert an effective ban that could kick-in in April.",
      "\u201cI would say yes,\u201d Trump told reporters when asked if Microsoft was one of the companies interested in helping to bring about a new ownership of TikTok, a requirement set by Congress to keep the app functioning in the U.S.",
      "Trump added that other companies were also interested in purchasing TikTok, but wouldn\u2019t provide a list.",
      "\u201cI like bidding wars because you make your best deals,\u201d Trump said as he spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One while flying back to Washington from Miami, where Republican House members were holding a conference.",
      "Microsoft declined to comment. Representatives for TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In one of his first acts in office last week, Trump extended the deadline for TikTok to find new ownership that satisfies the government by 75 days, to April 4 from January 19.",
      "The president has said that he\u2019s looking for the ultimate purchaser to give the U.S. a 50% stake in the company, which is owned by China-based ByteDance. But the details remain murky, and its unclear whether he's proposing control of the app by the government or another U.S. entity.",
      "Last week, the artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI presented a new proposal to ByteDance that would allow the U.S. government to own up to 50% of a new entity that merges Perplexity with TikTok\u2019s U.S. business, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "Several other investors \u2014 including billionaire Frank McCourt and Trump's former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin \u2014 have spoken publicly about their desire to purchase TikTok's U.S. platform. Trump has also said he\u2019s spoken to \u201cmany people\u201d privately about the company.",
      "After the bipartisan law was signed by former President Joe Biden in April, ByteDance said it did not have plans to sell the platform and fought the statute in court for months. China also rebuked Washington over the divestment push, though more recently it appears to be softening its stance.",
      "In media interviews last week, Bill Ford, the chairman of the global investing firm General Atlantic and a ByteDance board member, said the company is prepared to engage with the Trump administration and Chinese officials to find a solution that keeps TikTok available. He also floated the idea that there could be a solution short of a full divesture by ByteDance.",
      "Lawmakers and officials in both parties have raised national security concerns about Chinese ownership and potential manipulation on the immensely popular platform, which is used by more than 170 million U.S. users.",
      "Trump was in favor of a TikTok ban before he reversed his position last year. He credits the platform with helping him win more young voters during the recent presidential election.",
      "Microsoft, along with Walmart, made a failed bid for TikTok during Trump\u2019s first term after Trump tried to ban the app. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella later described it as the \u201cstrangest thing I\u2019ve ever worked on.\u201d"

      "Workers at a Whole Foods Market in Pennsylvania have voted to unionize, becoming the first group of employees to pull off a labor win at the Amazon-owned grocery store chain",
      "Workers at a Whole Foods Market in Pennsylvania voted to unionize on Monday, becoming the first group of employees to pull off a labor win at the Amazon-owned grocery store chain.",
      "Employees at the Philadelphia store cast 130 votes \u2014 or about 57% of the ballots cast \u2014 in favor of joining a local chapter of The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union for the purposes of collective bargaining. According to the National Labor Relations Board, which oversaw the election, 100 workers rejected the motion.",
      "\u201cThis fight is far from over, but today\u2019s victory is an important step forward,\" said Wendell Young IV, the president of UFCW Local 1776. \"We are ready to bring Whole Foods to the bargaining table to negotiate a fair first contract that reflects the workers\u2019 needs and priorities.\u201d",
      "The results mark the first successful entry of organized labor into Amazon\u2019s grocery business, which includes Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh and the Amazon Go convenience stores. Amazon, which purchased Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion, has tried to fend off organizing efforts in its stores as well as by delivery drivers and warehouse workers.",
      "Nearly three years ago, Amazon warehouse workers in the New York City borough of Staten Island voted to be represented in labor negotiations by a fledgling union that has since affiliated with the Teamsters. But Amazon has refused to come to the bargaining table.",
      "Employees at the Whole Foods store, located in the center of Philadelphia, started organizing early last year, Young said. They teamed up with UFCW Local 1776 in the late summer, and in November petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to hold an official election.",
      "The local union said the store workers hoped a successful vote would help them secure higher wages, more affordable health care coverage, child care support, greater work-life balance and better working conditions.",
      "In a statement after the votes were counted Monday night, Whole Foods said it \u201cis proud to offer competitive compensation, great benefits, and career advancement opportunities to all Team Members.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are disappointed by the outcome of this election, but we are committed to maintaining a positive working environment in our Philly Center City store,\u201d the company added.",
      "The company said it provides store employees with a competitive average hourly wage and other benefits, such as 401(k) plans and \u201con-demand\u201d mental health support. It did not disclose its average hourly rate, but some online job postings show store employees can earn $16 per hour or higher.",
      "After the union filed the election petition, workers at the Philadelphia store were given free snacks, and the company repainted their break rooms, according to Young.",
      "Earlier this month, UFCW Local 1776 filed unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB against the company, accusing it of firing one worker in retaliation for union activities and alleging that supervisors told employees they would get paid more if they rejected the union bid. Whole Foods disputed the worker was fired in retaliation.",
      "The union has also accused Whole Foods of withholding region-wide wage increases from employees at the Philadelphia store because of the union activities.",
      "The company acknowledges it did not offer wage increases to workers at the store, even though it did so at a number of other stores as part of a quarterly review. Whole Foods maintains it would have been illegal to make wage adjustments in the lead-up to the union election, an argument Young disputed.",
      "The company said it was delaying the pay bumps until after the election to avoid the appearance of trying to influence the vote with raises.",
      "Seattle-based Amazon has resisted union organizing efforts by its workers. Amazon delivery drivers went on strike in a handful of U.S. cities before Christmas to exert pressure on the the company to recognize them as unionized employees or to meet demands for an inaugural labor contract.",
      "Workers at an Amazon warehouse in North Carolina are scheduled to vote next month on whether they want to be represented by an upstart union called Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment.",
      "The retail giant has challenged the structure of the National Labor Relations Board in court. Amazon accused the federal agency of tampering in the 2022 union election at the Staten Island warehouse, in part by bringing a lawsuit against the company to reinstate a fired organizer close to when voting began.",

      "Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said vaccines are not safe. His support for abortion access has made conservatives uncomfortable. And farmers across the Midwest are nervous over his talk of banning corn syrup and pesticides from America's food supply.",
      "The 71-year-old, whose famous name and family tragedies have put him in the national spotlight since he was a child, has spent years airing his populist \u2014 and sometimes extreme \u2014 views in podcasts, TV interviews and speeches building his own quixotic brand.",
      "A son of a Democratic political dynasty, Kennedy is seeking to become the nation's top health official under President Donald Trump. To get there, he's softening those long-held beliefs, hoping to win approval from the Republican Party.",
      "At stake is Kennedy's control of the nation's sprawling $1.7 trillion U.S. Health and Human Services agency, which oversees food and hospital inspections, health insurance for roughly half of the country and vaccine recommendations. The job would finally give him the kind of political power Kennedys have wielded for decades.",
      "He made a long-shot bid for the presidency last year, following uncles John, who won the White House in 1960, and Edward, who lost his bid in 1980, along with his father, Robert, a leading contender who was assassinated after winning the California primary in 1968.",
      "With a strong resemblance to his father and lawyer credentials to match, he found ardent followers who embrace the critiques he's lodged against unhealthy foods, pharmaceutical companies and chemicals.",
      "But he couldn't get Democrats on his side, with some of his relatives shunning him over his vaccine views. His has been a flexible ideological journey, part liberal Democrat, part libertarian, and now, an adherent of the MAGA agenda after dropping out of the race last year to back Trump.",
      "The president has since directed him to \u201cgo wild\u201d on health. Together, they've even hatched a new slogan: \"Make America Healthy Again.\u201d",
      "Kennedy's aspirations now rest with the Republican-controlled Senate, where he can lose only three GOP votes if all Democrats oppose him.",
      "As Kennedy's confirmation hearings approach this week, he faces a coordinated effort to stop his nomination. A television and digital ad campaign is highlighting his anti-vaccine work. And former Vice President Mike Pence, a stalwart of the conservative anti-abortion movement, is lobbying against him, too.",
      "Kennedy's closest supporters believe he'll prevail. He plans to focus on issues that have bipartisan consensus, like reducing food additives and increasing access to healthier foods. When concerns about his views on conservative priorities like abortion come up, he's promised to follow Trump's lead.",
      "Then there is Kennedy's biggest advantage \u2014 and maybe, too, his biggest liability for someone working under Trump \u2014 his star power.",
      "\u201cBobby K. is coming in with a bigger microphone than any HHS Secretary,\u201d said Calley Means, a close adviser to Kennedy.",
      "Kennedy's numerous remarks, anti-vaccine nonprofit and lawsuits against immunizations are likely to haunt him.",
      "He's rejected the anti-vaccine label, instead casting himself as a crusader for \u201cmedical freedom\u201d who wants more research. He and Trump have vowed not to \u201ctake away\u201d vaccines. To defuse criticism, he resigned from the Children\u2019s Health Defense, his nonprofit that has filed dozens of lawsuits against vaccines, including the government authorizations of some of them.",
      "But critics have argued that his work advocating against vaccine use has cost lives. Democrats are poised to home in on his social media campaigns and work in Samoa, the island nation in the Pacific Ocean where doctors say he and his anti-vaccine acolytes seized on a tragedy to campaign against childhood inoculations.",
      "In 2018, two Samoan children died from botched vaccinations, prompting the government to suspend the childhood vaccination program.",
      "Kennedy showed up with his wife, actor Cheryl Hines, to meet with the prime minister, health minister and other health officials in 2019. Kennedy says he promoted a \u201cmedical informatics system\u201d that would \"assess the efficacy and safety of every medical intervention or drug on overall health.\u201d",
      "Later that year, a measles epidemic killed dozens of infants and children.",
      "Democrat Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, an emergency room doctor who organized flights loaded with 50,000 vaccine doses, doctors and nurses to administer inoculations, has led the campaign to highlight Kennedy's role. He shared during one-on-one meetings with a handful of senators earlier this month what he witnessed there, including accounts from villagers who told them about Facebook posts that scared them away from vaccinations.",
      "\u201cHe went there and used celebrity status to scare the country away from vaccinating,\" Green said of Kennedy. \"You have to ask yourself, \u2018Why, RFK Jr., would you go to Samoa and do this to innocent people?\u2019\u201d",
      "Kennedy has denied playing any role in the outbreak.",
      "A Democratic group is running digital ads that accuse Kennedy of spreading misinformation in Samoa. The campaign is targeting senators in nine states, including Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and John Curtis of Utah, which boasts a significant Samoan population.",
      "Another they're targeting is Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, chair of the Health, Education, Labor and Pension Senate committee, which holds a hearing Thursday. Cassidy, who is also a doctor, stopped short of endorsing Kennedy after they met and is seen as swayable.",
      "Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who suffered from polio as a child, may also be in play. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, McConnell dipped into his own campaign funds to urge Kentucky residents to vaccinate against the virus.",
      "Last month, McConnell sent a warning about attempts to discredit the polio vaccine.",
      "\u201cEfforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed \u2014 they\u2019re dangerous,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cAnyone seeking the Senate\u2019s consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts.\u201d",
      "Other conservatives have question Kennedy's abortion views, after he said last year that it should be legal for full-term pregnancies. His campaign later clarified that he supports abortion rights until fetal viability, around 22 to 24 weeks.",
      "In meetings with some senators, he's promised to follow Trump's directive on the issue.",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for example, said he was convinced after talking to Kennedy that he would be a strong anti-abortion advocate.",
      "But skepticism remains, with Pence's advocacy group highlighting his abortion views in an ad campaign.",

      "The authorship of The Associated Press\u2019s renowned \u201cnapalm girl\u201d photograph is being called into question in the new documentary \u201cThe Stringer,\u201d which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- After a half-century of public silence, a freelance photographer from Vietnam has asserted he took one of the most renowned and impactful photos of the 20th century \u2014 the image of a naked girl fleeing a napalm attack in South Vietnam that has long been credited to a staff photographer from The Associated Press.",
      "Nguyen Thanh Nghe claimed authorship of the Pulitzer Prize-winning \u201cnapalm girl\u201d photograph in the new documentary \u201cThe Stringer\u201d and on the sidelines of its premiere Saturday night at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah.",
      "The AP conducted its own investigation and said it has no reason to conclude that anyone other than the long-credited photographer, Nick Ut, made the picture. The news agency said it was \u201csurprised and disappointed\u201d that filmmakers portrayed it as having reviewed the film\u2019s materials and being dismissive. The AP said it saw the film for the first time at Sundance.",
      "Nghe joined the filmmakers for the post-screening Q&A where he said, through a translator, \u201cI took the photo.\u201d The audience cheered enthusiastically. He did not say why he waited so long to make the claim.",
      "The AP said it was calling on the filmmakers to release their contributors from non-disclosure agreements for the film, including Nghe. It also called on the filmmakers to share a visual analysis they commissioned \u2014 and the film itself. \u201cWe cannot state more clearly that The Associated Press is only interested in the facts and a truthful history of this iconic photo,\" the agency said.",
      "Nguyen says he took the iconic photo of Kim Phuc on June 8, 1972. Nghe said he went to the town of Trang Bang that day as a driver for an NBC news crew and captured the image of Phuc running down the street, crying and naked with arms outstretched. He said he sold his image to the AP for $20, and they gave him a print of the photo that his wife later destroyed.",
      "Representatives for the AP, who saw the film for the first time Saturday at the premiere, are contesting the film's implication that the company reviewed their findings and dismissed them.",
      "\u201cAs recently as December, we reiterated our request to see the filmmakers\u2019 full materials and they did not respond, nor did they include AP\u2019s full response in the film,\" Lauren Easton, an AP spokesperson, said Sunday. \"We were surprised and disappointed that the film portrayed AP as having reviewed the film\u2019s materials and being dismissive of the allegations, which is completely false.\"",
      "The film\u2019s investigation was led by husband-and-wife team of Gary Knight, founder of the VII Foundation, and producer Fiona Turner. Bao Nguyen, a Vietnamese American filmmaker, directed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a journalist by any stretch of the imagination,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cI had a healthy skepticism, as I think anyone would, going against a 53-year-old truth. ... But as a storyteller and a filmmaker, I thought it was my both or my responsibility and my privilege to be able to uplift the story of individuals like Nghe.\u201d",
      "Before having seen the film, the AP conducted its own investigation over six months and concluded it had \u201cno reason to believe anyone other than Ut took the photo.\u201d Now, the AP is calling on the filmmakers to lift the non-disclosure agreements they placed on their subjects to allow the company to investigate more fully.",
      "\u201cAP stands ready to review any and all evidence and new information about this photo,\" Easton said.",
      "Knight and Turner met with AP in London last June about the allegations. According to the AP, filmmakers requested the news organization sign a non-disclosure agreement before they provided their evidence. AP would not. The film suggests that evidence was presented to the AP, which the AP says is not true.",
      "A primary source in the film is Carl Robinson, then an AP photo editor in Saigon, who was overruled in his judgment not to use the picture by Horst Faas, AP's Saigon chief of photos. Robinson says in the film that Faas instructed him to \u201cmake it staff\u201d and credit Ut for the photo. Both Faas and Yuichi \u201cJackson\u201d Ishizaki, who developed the film, are dead. Robinson, 81, was dismissed by the AP in 1978.",
      "On Saturday, a Sundance Institute moderator asked why he wanted to come forward with the allegations now. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to die before this story came out,\u201d Robinson told the audience after the screening. \u201cI wanted to find (Nghe) and say sorry.\u201d",
      "A variety of witnesses interviewed by AP, including renowned correspondents such as Fox Butterfield and Peter Arnett and the photo\u2019s subject herself, Phuc, say they are certain Ut took the photo.",
      "Robinson was one such person the AP attempted to speak to during their investigation but \u201cwere told we could only do so under conditions\" that they said would have prevented them from \u201ctaking swift action if necessary.\u201d",
      "The film\u2019s investigation took over two years. The journalists enlisted a French forensics team, INDEX, to help determine the likelihood of whether Ut had been in a position to take the photo. The forensics team concluded that it was highly unlikely that Ut could have done it.",
      "Ut's attorney, James Hornstein, had this to say Sunday after the premiere: \u201cIn due course, we will proceed to right this wrong in a courtroom where Nick Ut\u2019s reputation will be vindicated.\u201d",
      "Knight referenced AP\u2019s investigation Saturday, telling the audience that the company's statement is available online. \u201cThey said they\u2019re open always to examining the truth. And I think it was a very reasonable thing to say,\u201d Knight said. \u201cOur story is here and it\u2019s here for you all to see.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThings happen in the field in the heat of the moment. ... We\u2019re all stronger if we examine ourselves, ask tough questions, and we\u2019re open and honest about what goes on in our profession. Now more than ever, I would argue.\"",

      "The CIA now believes the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic likely originated from a laboratory",
      "WASHINGTON -- The CIA now believes the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic likely originated from a laboratory, according to an assessment released Saturday that points the finger at China even while acknowledging that the spy agency has \u201clow confidence\u201d in its own conclusion.",
      "The finding is not the result of any new intelligence, and the report was completed at the behest of the Biden administration and former CIA Director William Burns. It was declassified and released Saturday on the orders of President Donald Trump's pick to lead the agency, John Ratcliffe, who was sworn in Thursday as director.",
      "The nuanced finding suggests the agency believes the totality of evidence makes a lab origin more likely than a natural origin. But the agency's assessment assigns a low degree of confidence to this conclusion, suggesting the evidence is deficient, inconclusive or contradictory.",
      "Earlier reports on the origins of COVID-19 have split over whether the coronavirus emerged from a Chinese lab, potentially by mistake, or whether it arose naturally. The new assessment is not likely to settle the debate. In fact, intelligence officials say it may never be resolved, due to a lack of cooperation from Chinese authorities.",
      "\u201cCIA continues to assess that both research-related and natural origin scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic remain plausible,\u201d a spokesperson for the agency wrote in a statement about the agency's assessment.",
      "Instead of new evidence, the conclusion was based on fresh analyses of intelligence about the spread of the virus, its scientific properties and the work and conditions of China's virology labs.",
      "Lawmakers have pressured America's spy agencies for more information about the origins of the virus, which led to lockdowns, economic upheaval and millions of deaths.",
      "While the origin of the virus remains unknown, scientists think the most likely hypothesis is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses, before infecting another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats. In turn, the infection spread to humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019.",
      "Some official investigations, however, have raised the the question of whether the virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan. Two years ago a report by the Department of Energy concluded a lab leak was the most likely origin, though that report also expressed low confidence in the finding.",
      "Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence during Trump's first term, has said he favors the lab leak scenario.",
      "\u201cThe lab leak is the only theory supported by science, intelligence, and common sense,\u201d Ratcliffe said in 2023.",
      "The CIA \u201cwill continue to evaluate any available credible new intelligence reporting or open-source information that could change CIA\u2019s assessment,\u201d the agency spokesperson said."

      "Officials say they have recaptured the final four monkeys who escaped two months ago from a South Carolina compound that breeds them for medical research",
      "YEMASSEE, S.C. -- Authorities in South Carolina said Friday the last four of 43 escaped monkeys have been recaptured after two months living in the woods, weathering a rare snowstorm and being temped back into captivity by peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.",
      "The rhesus macaque monkeys, all females, made a break for it after police say an employee did not fully lock their enclosure at Alpha Genesis, a facility that breeds them for medical research \u2014 known to locals as \u201cthe monkey farm.\u201d",
      "The recaptured monkeys appeared to be in good health, Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard said in a statement relayed by Yemassee Police in a social media post, without further details.",
      "While they were on the loose, the area saw its first snow in seven years, accumulating up to 3 inches (8 centimeters).",
      "The rhesus macaques made a break for it on Nov. 6, and mostly hung around near the facility. They're about the size of a cat, weighing roughly 7 pounds (3 kilograms).",
      "It appears a worker unintentionally left the gates unlocked when the monkeys escaped, Westergaard said in November. Workers were supposed to lock and latch one gate before opening another, but all three gates and latches were left unsecure.",
      "The monkeys posed no risk to public health, said Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police.",
      "Alpha Guard employees kept an eye on the monkeys and set out humane traps. Most were lured back with food and were given peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and \"monkey biscuits\" \u2014 a high-protein Purina Monkey Chow specially formulated for the rhesus macaques.",
      "The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical facilities and other researchers. Humans have been using the monkeys for scientific research since the late 1800s.

      "Looking for a quick fix for their fast-growing electricity diets, tech giants are increasingly looking to strike deals that would let them plug directly into power plants",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Looking for a quick fix for their fast-growing electricity diets, tech giants are increasingly looking to strike deals with power plant owners to plug in directly, avoiding a potentially longer and more expensive process of hooking into a fraying electric grid that serves everyone else.",
      "It's raising questions over whether diverting power to higher-paying customers will leave enough for others and whether it's fair to excuse big power users from paying for the grid. Federal regulators are trying to figure out what to do about it, and quickly.",
      "Front and center is the data center that Amazon\u2019s cloud computing subsidiary, Amazon Web Services, is building next to the Susquehanna nuclear plant in eastern Pennsylvania.",
      "The arrangement between the plant's owners and AWS \u2014 called a \u201cbehind the meter\u201d connection \u2014 is the first such to come before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. For now, FERC has rejected a deal that could eventually send 960 megawatts \u2014 about 40% of the plant's capacity \u2014 to the data center. That's enough to power more than a half-million homes.",
      "That leaves the deal and others that likely would follow in limbo. It's not clear when FERC, which blocked the deal on a procedural ground, will take up the matter again or how the change in presidential administrations might affect things.",
      "\u201cThe companies, they\u2019re very frustrated because they have a business opportunity now that\u2019s really big,\u201d said Bill Green, the director of the MIT Energy Initiative. \u201cAnd if they\u2019re delayed five years in the queue, for example \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it would be five years, but years anyway \u2014 they might completely miss the business opportunity.\u201d",
      "The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems.",
      "That's spurred proposals to bring nuclear power plants out of retirement, develop small modular nuclear reactors and build utility-scale renewable installations or new natural gas plants. In December, California-based Oklo announced an agreement to provide 12 gigawatts to data center developer Switch from small nuclear reactors powered by nuclear waste.",
      "Federal officials say fast development of data centers is vital to the economy and national security, including to keep pace with China in the artificial intelligence race.",
      "For AWS, the deal with Susquehanna satisfies its need for reliable power that meets its internal requirements for sources that don't emit planet-warming greenhouse gases, like coal, oil or gas-fueled plants.",
      "Big Tech also wants to stand up their centers fast. But tech's voracious appetite for energy comes at a time when the power supply is already strained by efforts to shift away from planet-warming fossil fuels.",
      "They can build data centers in a couple years, said Aaron Tinjum of the Data Center Coalition. But in some areas, getting connected to the congested electricity grid can take four years, and sometimes much more, he said.",
      "Plugging directly into a power plant would take years off their development timelines.",
      "In theory, the AWS deal would let Susquehanna sell power for more than they get by selling into the grid. Talen Energy, Susquehanna\u2019s majority owner, projected the deal would bring as much as $140 million in electricity sales in 2028, though it didn't disclose exactly how much AWS will pay for the power.",
      "The profit potential is one that other nuclear plant operators, in particular, are embracing after years of financial distress and frustration with how they are paid in the broader electricity markets. Many say they have been forced to compete in some markets against a flood of cheap natural gas as well as state-subsidized solar and wind energy.",
      "Power plant owners also say the arrangement benefits the wider public, by bypassing the costly buildout of long power lines and leaving more transmission capacity on the grid for everyone else.",
      "A favorable ruling from FERC could open the door to many more huge data centers and other massive power users like hydrogen plants and bitcoin miners, analysts say.",
      "FERC\u2019s 2-1 rejection in November was procedural. Recent comments by commissioners suggest they weren't ready to decide how to regulate such a novel matter without more study.",
      "In the meantime, the agency is hearing arguments for and against the Susquehanna-AWS deal.",
      "Monitoring Analytics, the market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid, wrote in a filing to FERC that the impact would be \u201cextreme\u201d if the Susquehanna-AWS model were extended to all nuclear power plants in the territory.",
      "Energy prices would increase significantly and there's no explanation for how rising demand for power will be met even before big power plants drop out of the supply mix, it said.",
      "Separately, two electric utility owners \u2014 which make money in deregulated states from building out the grid and delivering power \u2014 have protested that the Susquehanna-AWS arrangement amounts to freeloading off a grid that ordinary customers pay to build and maintain. Chicago-based Exelon and Columbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power say the Susquehanna-AWS arrangement would allow AWS to avoid $140 million a year that it would otherwise owe.",
      "Susquehanna\u2019s owners say the data center won't be on the grid and question why it should have to pay to maintain it. But critics contend that the power plant itself is benefiting from taxpayer subsidies and ratepayer-subsidized services, and shouldn't be able to strike deals with private customers that could increase costs for others.",
      "FERC's decision will have \u201cmassive repercussions for the entire country\u201d because it will set a precedent for how FERC and grid operators will handle the waiting avalanche of similar requests from data center companies and nuclear plants, said Jackson Morris of the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "Stacey Burbure, a vice president for American Electric Power, told FERC at a hearing in November that it needs to move quickly.",

      "On Monday, the Office of Management and Budget ordered federal agencies to freeze any federal funding to activities that might be implicated by Trump's executive orders, causing states, local governments and nonprofits to scramble to determine if their funding would be cut off. Less than 24 hours after the policy was revealed, the White House attempted to clarify the policy in a memo, saying programs that provide direct benefits to Americans -- such as Social Security, Medicare and SNAP benefits -- would be excluded from the freeze.",

    "title": "What does Donald Trump's anti-DEI executive order mean for private companies?",
    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 15:40:57 -0500",
    "summary": "What does President Donald Trump's executive order directing federal agencies to \"encourage\" private companies to abandon DEI policies mean for businesses?",
    "story": [
      "Trump directed federal agencies to \"encourage\" companies to abandon DEI actions.",
      "Amid a flurry of executive actions President Trump is taking to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives within the federal government, the Trump administration is also turning its attention to private companies and institutions.",
      "President Trump signed an executive order the day after he was sworn in to his second term that not only rescinded DEI policies in the federal government, but also \"[encourages] the private sector to end\" what the order calls \"illegal DEI discrimination and preferences,\" claiming in part that DEI policies \"violate the text and spirit of our longstanding Federal civil-rights laws.\"",
      "\"Hardworking Americans who deserve a shot at the American Dream should not be stigmatized, demeaned, or shut out of opportunities because of their race or sex,\" the order said.",
      "Several legal experts who advise companies and institutions regarding their DEI policies told ABC News that while the Trump administration doesn't have the legal authority to mandate that private businesses abandon their DEI policies, the executive order's language uses the threat of potential legal action against certain companies with DEI policies to ostensibly force them to do so.",
      "'It's a powerful threat'",
      "Part of Trump's Jan. 21 executive order directs the attorney general, \"within 120 days of this order, in consultation with the heads of relevant agencies and in coordination with the Director of [the Office of Management and Budget],\" the latter of which oversees the performance of all federal agencies, to \"submit a report \u2026 containing recommendations for enforcing Federal civil-rights laws and taking other appropriate measures to encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI.\"",
      "The order instructs the federal agencies to \"identify up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of publicly traded corporations, large non-profit corporations or associations, foundations with assets of 500 million dollars or more, State and local bar and medical associations, and institutions of higher education with endowments over 1 billion dollars,\" as well as \"litigation that would be potentially appropriate for Federal lawsuits, intervention, or statements of interest.\"",
      "Those agencies are further directed to identify \"key sectors of concern\" and \"the most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners\" within each agency's jurisdiction, and to develop \"a plan of specific steps or measures to deter DEI programs or principles.\"",
      "The possibility of a legal battle with the federal government over DEI is already causing concern for many private businesses, experts told ABC News.",
      "\"It's a powerful threat that companies are responding to it by taking another very close look at their programs to make sure that they are comfortable with them,\" said labor attorney Jason Schwartz, a partner and co-chair of the Labor and Employment Practice at Gibson Dunn in Washington, D.C., and who leads the firm's DEI task force.",
      "\"Nobody wants to be on that Donald Trump DEI blacklist,\" Kenji Yoshino, a professor of constitutional law at NYU and the director of NYU's Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, and who also advises Fortune 500 companies on DEI matters, told ABC News. \"I worry that there's a very smart move and savvy move on the part of the executive branch to cast a fear through this kind of gesture of 'we are going to single you out,' or targeting so that a lot of companies are going to withdraw or pull back more than they needed to pull back, strictly legally.\"",
      "\"[Companies] just don't want to be one of those nine,\" Yoshino added, referring to the number of the executive order's \"potential civil compliance investigations.\"",
      "\"Until those nine are announced, it's going to cause others to be risk-averse,\" said Yoshino. \"So there's a kind of, you know, preemptive compliance, you know, or obedience going on.\"",
      "How companies are responding",
      "Schwartz told ABC News that since Trump signed his executive order, companies have been scrambling to seek legal counsel regarding their DEI policies and whether they need to be revised.",
      "\"The phone is literally ringing off the hook,\" he said, referring to the calls his firm is receiving. \"Companies are very concerned. They want to make sure, obviously, that they stay on the right side of the law.\"",
      "Yoshino said that the phones at NYU's Center for DEI likewise have been \"ringing off the hook\" with calls from companies seeking advice on how to proceed with their DEI initiatives. For now, he advises that concerned parties take a measured approach.",
      "\"The reflexive response is often to be like, 'Oh, if we shut it down, we will minimize risk,' and we regard that to be short sighted, both because there are smart ways to tweak these programs to lower the risk, or even lower to zero, eliminate the risk while still getting the same results,\" Yoshino told ABC News.",
      "\"And alternatively, if you eliminate all your DEI policies, you're then going to get sued from the other side,\" he cautioned, noting that marginalized groups could argue that rolling back DEI \"leads to a less inclusive, more discriminatory environment.\"",
      "Several large corporations \u2013 including Amazon, Meta, McDonalds, Walmart and Ford \u2013 announced before Trump was sworn in for his second term that they were ending, scaling back or otherwise reevaluating some of their DEI-related programs or initiatives.",
      "However, according to Yoshino, whose office has been tracking the impact of Trump's actions on DEI, even some companies who are stepping away from some DEI initiatives are retaining some policies or programs committed to inclusion, and that the majority of companies on the Fortune 500 list \"still have pro-DEI statements on their websites.\"",
      "Some companies also are publicly standing by their DEI commitments, with leaders at Goldman Sachs, Costco and JPMorgan Chase & Co recently speaking out in support of their diversity programs amid pressure from anti-DEI activist shareholders to roll back their policies.",
      "\"I do think that it's really important not to overreact,\" Yoshino told ABC News.",
      "What comes next?",
      "While it's unclear what might be \"litigation that would be potentially appropriate for Federal lawsuits, intervention, or statements of interest\" against private companies, as the executive order states, as well as what might be the outcome of any such actions, Yoshino and Schwartz both noted that anti-DEI litigation efforts in the U.S. have been escalating since the Supreme Court's June 2023 landmark ruling that effectively ended affirmative action in higher education.",
      "Since the Supreme Court decision, conservative legal advocacy groups have been ramping up litigation against private companies over their DEI initiatives, Schwartz said, noting that with Trump's executive order, those groups have now \"moved their operation into the White House.\"",
      "\"They now have the full force and power of the United States government where they can bring these cases,\" Schwartz added.",
      "Yoshino agreed, telling ABC News that the president is now putting the \"muscle of the executive branch behind the impact of that decision.\"",
      "Yoshino said that while the Supreme Court case addressed the higher education admissions process and was not about diversity and inclusion efforts in the private sector, \"it gave us such a clear window into how [the Supreme Court] was thinking about the issue of race discrimination.\"",
      "The Supreme Court ruled that \"in the same way that you can't discriminate against a person of color, you also can't discriminate against a white individual,\" according to Yoshino. \"That contrasts that with the previous jurisprudence that said you're allowed to use a [race] classification in narrow circumstances so long as your intent is to lift up a historically subordinated group.\"",
      "According to Schwartz, while the Trump administration is \"not creating new laws\" regarding the legality of DEI through his executive order, the Department of Justice is gearing up to bring cases against private companies by arguing that existing laws \"already prohibit many of the DEI programs that exist.\"",
      "Schwartz also pointed to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) as a federal agency that is likely to help advance the White House's anti-DEI efforts. The federal agency, which has the authority to investigate and prosecute cases of alleged employment discrimination, is now led by Trump appointee Andrea Lucas, who said in a statement upon being named EEOC acting chair Jan. 21 that her priorities are \"consistent with the President's Executive Orders,\" and include \"rooting out unlawful DEI-motivated race and sex discrimination.\"",
      "\"Our employment civil rights laws are a matter of individual rights. We must reject the twin lies of identity politics: that justice is measured by group outcomes and that civil rights exist solely to remedy harms against certain groups,\" Lucas' statement continued. \"I am committed to ensuring equal justice under the law and to focusing on equal opportunity, merit, and colorblind equality.\"",

      "President Donald Trump promised \"I am your retribution\" to his supporters in his 2024 campaign.",
      "His first week in the White House saw him turn that threat real.",
      "Within hours of taking the oath of office, Trump stripped security clearances from 51 former intelligence officials who had signed onto a letter describing the public release of emails from Hunter Biden's laptop as potentially part of a Russian information operation.",
      "He's removed security details for John Bolton and Mike Pompeo, despite threats against their lives from Iran because of their work in the first Trump administration, as well as for Dr. Anthony Fauci, who faced threats over the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic. When asked about removing the details, Trump told reporters \"you can\u2019t have a security detail for the rest of your life\" if you work in government and that he wouldn't feel responsible should anything happen to those individuals.",
      "Retired Gen. Mark Milley has also been informed his security detail is being pulled and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is moving to have him demoted.",
      "Meanwhile, a purge of officials is also taking place across the government.",
      "More than a dozen people who were part of former special counsel Jack Smith's prosecution were fired. Seventeen inspectors general at multiple federal agencies were terminated, with the administration flouting the 30 days advanced notice required by law.",
      "The White House defended the moves and said they'd do so in court if lawsuits are brought as is expected.",
      "Press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" Wednesday if revoking Milley's detail and other moves against the president's critics should be considered retaliatory.",
      "\"I would reject that,\" Leavitt responded. \"I think that President Trump has the right to make these decisions. And again, he doesn't think that taxpayers should be funding security for bureaucrats and for others who have served in our government for the rest of their lives.\"",
      "But some experts say the actions send a message that officials are expected to fall in line with the new administration.",
      "\"It's a shot across the bow,\" said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. \"It's intended to send to them that he's really serious about getting his agenda done.\"",
      "More attempts at retribution could be in store if Trump's picks for attorney general and FBI director are confirmed. He's nominated Pam Bondi to lead the Justice Department and Kash Patel to lead the FBI, both loyalists.",
      "Bondi in her confirmation hearing pledged to keep politics out of prosecutions, but raised eyebrows among critics when she notably did not directly answer questions about Trump's 2020 election loss and his desire to target political opponents.",
      "Patel will face senators for his hearing on Thursday. He's said in the past that \"thousands and thousands and thousands\" of federal employees need to be fired for aiding the so-called \"deep state.\" He's also threatened to go after journalists.",
      "Post-Watergate, the Justice Department and its agencies enacted internal policies aimed to bolster independence that presidents of both parties abided by.",
      "But Trump's taken a far more expansive view of executive authority, and could try to wield his influence directly over the DOJ and FBI.",
      "Already his administration's removed some career DOJ officials, sparking concern within the department's National Security Division, ABC News previously reported. Others were reassigned to a newly-formed task force to prosecute immigration violations in so-called \"sanctuary cities.\"",
      "\"The test will really be if President Trump asked the Justice Department to prosecute someone or investigate someone, will they do it?\" said Bruce Green, a Fordham Law ethics expert who examined this issue during Trump's first term.",
      "Backstops still remain if that were the case, experts noted: prosecutors could threaten revolt, courts could reject cases that lack proof of a crime or Congress could step in. But Trump is entering a second term with Republicans controlling the House and Senate, and a conservative majority on the Supreme Court that's agreed with him on some aspects of presidential power.",
      "\"It's a little early to know whether all of the guardrails are being obliterated,\" said Green. \"But sadly, all signs point in that direction.\"",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly singled out opponents he suggested be investigated or even jailed. They include former Rep. Liz Cheney and other members of the House Jan. 6 Committee as well as Biden and his family.",
      "Former President Joe Biden, in his final hours as commander in chief, issued preemptive pardons for his family, House Jan. 6 committee members, Fauci and Milley. Trump, in his first post-inauguration interview, suggested it was a mistake for Biden not to pardon himself.",
      "Biden's pardons, however, don't prevent Congress from launching inquiries into those individuals, experts said.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson signaled last week he would look into the Biden pardons. House Republicans are also establishing a new select subcommittee that will probe the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot and seek to undercut the findings of the bipartisan panel from when Democrats controlled the chamber.",
      "\"To us, it is disgusting. To us, it probably proves the point,\" Johnson said last week about the pardons for Biden's family members.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 18:54:29 -0500",
    "summary": "The takeaways after Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced questions from senators during his confirmation hearing to potentially lead the Department of Health and Human Services.",
    "story": [
      "Kennedy attempted to reinvent himself as a supporter of vaccines.",
      "In the first of two public sit-downs with the Senate that will decide his possible future as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced nearly four hours of questions about his decadeslong public record.",
      "Kennedy, a former Democrat from a legacy political family who threw his weight behind President Donald Trump in 2024 with the \"Make America Healthy Again\" movement, is a longtime environmental lawyer. He's perhaps most known for his work in questioning the safety and effectiveness of vaccines -- a topic on Wednesday that he repeatedly sought to placate senators on, without much apparent luck among Democrats.",
      "If confirmed, Kennedy would be in charge of overseeing a vast federal agency that manages the health care of some 170 million Americans, regulates access to drugs and vaccines, and tracks urgent outbreaks of diseases and foodborne illnesses.",
      "Kennedy returns to the Senate on Thursday for another hearing. Here are the key takeaways from day one:",
      "RFJ Jr. appears to change his stance on vaccines",
      "Kennedy said several times during his hearing on Wednesday that he supports vaccines, often in blunter terms and with more vigor than his previous public comments. But that rhetoric contradicted years of false statements he has made about the dangers of vaccines and misinformation about vaccines.",
      "\"News reports have claimed that I'm anti-vaccine or any industry. I am neither. I am pro-safety,\" Kennedy said in his opening statement. While Kennedy has, in the past, denied he is \"anti-vaccine\" and has said his children have been vaccinated, he has promoted views on vaccines that decades of evidence has refuted.",
      "He pledged, after a grilling Wednesday from Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, to \"do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult or discourages people from taking\" the measles and polio vaccines.",
      "\"I support the measles vaccine. I support the polio vaccine,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Kennedy has openly questioned the widespread administration of those vaccines, saying during a podcast interview last year that he would not take the measles vaccine himself and downplaying the deadliness of the disease by attributing measles-related deaths in Africa to \"malnutrition,\" not the disease itself.",
      "However, both measles and polio can be deadly. Before the measles vaccine was introduced in the United States, roughly 400 to 500 people died each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Before the polio vaccine was developed, the virus\u00a0killed\u00a0or paralyzed\u00a0nearly half a million people worldwide each year\u00a0in the mid-20th\u00a0century,\u00a0according to the World Health Organization.",
      "Kennedy also expressed support during the hearing for the childhood vaccine schedule, which suggests what vaccines children should get and when, despite the stream of criticism he has leveled in recent years.",
      "Kennedy has falsely linked the vaccine schedule to a rise in chronic disease, saying during a campaign event last year, \"What I'm focused on is the bigger issue of chronic disease, and that is linked to the vaccine schedule in some cases, the explosion of chronic disease.\"",
      "Kennedy has also been critical of the number of vaccines children receive.",
      "Childhood vaccines have steadily increased in recent decades as new shots have been approved following robust clinical trials on their safety and efficacy, increasing the number of diseases that are now preventable via vaccine, the CDC says.",
      "According to the CDC, even if babies receive several vaccinations in one day, their immune systems are under significantly more pressure from the bacteria and viruses they encounter daily in their environment.",
      "Picking up on Kennedy's shift on vaccines on Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., asked Kennedy about onesies sold on the website of an organization of which Kennedy is a founder, the nonprofit Children's Health Defense, which pursues anti-vaccine causes. The onesies were stamped with phrases such as \"Unvaxxed, Unafraid,\" and \"No Vax, No Problem.\"",
      "\"Can you tell us now that you will, now that you are pro-vaccine, that you're going to have your organization take these products off the market?\" Sanders asked.",
      "Kennedy said he had resigned from the board and holds \"no power over that organization.\"",
      "After shifting abortion position, RFK Jr. promises to \"implement [Trump's] policies\"",
      "When asked Wednesday about his views on abortion, which swung drastically throughout his campaign, Kennedy hemmed tightly to President Trump's position on the issue, saying he thinks \"the states should control abortion.\"",
      "Kennedy's own public stance on abortion has varied wildly throughout his presidential campaign, and he at times advocated for reproductive rights that would be in direct conflict with Trump's campaign promises.",
      "\"I agree with President Trump that every abortion is a tragedy. I agree with him that we cannot be a moral nation if we have 1.2 million abortions a year. I agree with him that the states should control abortion,\" Kennedy said on Wednesday.",
      "Kennedy said he would support Trump in working to \"end late-term abortions,\" a non-medical phrase used by the anti-abortion movement to describe abortions late in pregnancy, which the Guttmacher Institute says account for less than 1% of abortions and are frequently the result of complex medical issues.",
      "Kennedy also vouched to protect \"conscience exemptions,\" which would expand protections for health care providers who don't want to perform abortion procedures, allowing more providers to deny care.",
      "\"Forcing somebody to participate in a medical procedure as a provider that they believe is murder does not make any sense to me,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Kennedy also committed to looking into mifepristone, the abortion pill that is used in nearly two-thirds of abortions nationwide. He said he would direct the Food and Drug Administration to look into the safety of the pill and consider rolling back telemedicine access to the pill -- both actions that could have wide-ranging impacts on access to the drug, which the FDA has determined safe to use as indicated and directed.",
      "\"President Trump has asked me to study the safety of mifepristone. He has not yet taken a stand on how to regulate it. Whatever he does, I will implement those policies,\" Kennedy said.",
      "\"I'm going to -- I serve at the pleasure of the president. I'm going to implement his policies,\" Kennedy said.",
      "But as recently as March 2024, Kennedy told Reuters he thought it should be a woman's right to make a decision about abortion \"throughout the pregnancy.\" He has also said he supports the same access and limitations that were provided by Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in all U.S. states.",
      "Since Trump nominated him to lead Health and Human Services, Kennedy has faced stiff blowback from conservatives, notably former Vice President Mike Pence, who claim he is not sufficiently anti-abortion.",
      "Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., pushed Kennedy on his repeated shifts on the issue of reproductive rights.",
      "\"You have clearly stated in the past that bodily autonomy is one of your core values. The question is, do you stand for that value or not? When was it that you decided to sell out the values you've had your whole life in order to be given power by President Trump?\" she said.",
      "\"Senator, I agree with President Trump that every abortion is a tragedy,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Past comments come back to haunt RFK Jr.",
      "Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., read aloud alleged past comments made by Kennedy, including unfounded claims about transgender children.",
      "\"Did you say that exposure to pesticides causes children to become transgender?\" Bennet asked.",
      "\"No, I never said that,\" Kennedy replied.",
      "However, Kennedy has repeated an unfounded conspiracy theory suggesting endocrine disruptors, including phthalates -- which make chemicals more durable -- and pesticides, can influence sexual orientation or gender identity.",
      "\"I want to just pursue just one question on these, you know, the other endocrine disruptors because our children now, you know, we're seeing these impacts that people suspect are very different than in ages past about sexual identification among children and sexual confusion, gender confusion,\" Kennedy said during an episode of his podcast in June 2022. \"These kinds of issues that are very, very controversial today.\"",
      "Seemingly unclear understanding of Medicaid under HHS",
      "Kennedy seemed to stumble when discussing aspects of the agency he would be tasked with running if he were to be confirmed as HHS secretary.",
      "He claimed Medicaid, a federal health insurance program for disabled and low-income Americans, is \u201cnot working.\"",
      "\"Most people who are on Medicaid are not happy. The premiums are too high. The deductibles are too high,\" Kennedy said during his hearing.",
      "However, except in very narrow circumstances, there are no premiums or deductibles under Medicaid.",
      "Kennedy also claimed that \"almost nothing is studied\" at the National Institutes of Health about the etiology, or the cause, of \"our chronic disease epidemic.\"",

    "summary": "As Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faces his Senate confirmation hearings to lead the HHS, here's where he stands on health issues including vaccines and food dyes.",
    "story": [
      "Kennedy has vowed to crack down on food dyes and ultra-processed foods.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is facing Senate lawmakers on Wednesday in his confirmation hearings to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under President Donald Trump.",
      "Kennedy has frequently promoted views at odds with the consensus of public health researchers and the mainstream scientific community, including falsely claiming that certain vaccines cause autism and calling for fluoride to be removed from drinking water, claiming it harms adolescent development.",
      "The environmental attorney has vowed to crack down on dyes in the food industry and has called for restrictions on ultra-processed foods.",
      "During a charity dinner last year in New York City, Trump pledged Kennedy would \"go wild on health\" and that Kennedy \"wants healthy people, he wants healthy food.\"",
      "Here's a look at where Kennedy stands on several health issues:",
      "Questioning vaccine safety",
      "Although Kennedy has denied he is \"anti-vaccine\" and has said his children have been vaccinated, he has promoted views on vaccines that experts have refuted.",
      "During a 2023 interview on Fox News, Kennedy said he believes autism comes from vaccines, a myth born from a now-debunked paper from the U.K. in 1998 that claimed the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine caused autism.",
      "The paper has since been discredited by health experts, retracted from the journal in which it was published, and its primary author, Andrew Wakefield, lost his medical license after the paper was discredited and an investigation found he had acted \"dishonestly and irresponsibly\" in conducting his research. More than a dozen high-quality studies have since found no evidence of a link between childhood vaccines and autism.",
      "Kennedy has also spread what the medical community has considered to be vaccine misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic, falsely claiming the COVID-19 vaccine is dangerous.",
      "During a December 2021 Louisiana House of Representatives meeting discussing a proposal to require schoolchildren to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, Kennedy falsely called the vaccine the \"deadliest vaccine ever made.\"",
      "In the same year, Kennedy petitioned the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to revoke its authorization of all COVID-19 vaccines. The FDA denied the petition three months later.",
      "Health officials say COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective following clinical trials that involved tens of thousands of people, and have since helped save millions of lives.",
      "Removing artificial dyes from foods",
      "Kennedy has been vocal about his opposition to artificial dyes, calling for them to be removed from foods and beverages.",
      "\"The first thing I'd do isn't going to cost you anything because I'm just gonna tell the cereal companies: Take all the dyes out of their food,\" about actions he'd take as a member of the Trump administration, according to a social media post from the non-profit Children's Health Defense, of which Kennedy is a founder.",
      "Kennedy has frequently cited Froot Loops as an example of a food with potentially harmful dyes, saying the version of the Kellogg's cereal sold abroad is healthier and has fewer ingredients compared to the U.S. version.",
      "Kellogg's has insisted its products are safe for consumption, saying the ingredients meet the federal standards set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Kennedy was wrong about the number of ingredients -- Canadian Froot Loops have 17 ingredients compared to 16 in the U.S. However, the two cereals differ when it comes to the use of dyes.",
      "American Froot Loops contain artificial food dyes such as Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6 and Blue 1 while Canadian Froot Loops are colored with concentrated watermelon juice and blueberry juice.",
      "A 2018 report from New York University and the American Academy of Pediatrics' Council on Environmental Health and Climate Change found artificial food colors may affect children's behavior and exacerbate symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.",
      "Recently the FDA said it was moving to ban the use of Red 3 dye in food products, beverages and ingested drugs, in response to a 2022 petition from health groups and activists.",
      "Processed foods and chronic disease",
      "Kennedy has criticized the U.S. food industry and the proliferation of ultra-processed foods, blaming them as one reason for the rise of chronic disease in the U.S.",
      "\"Hundreds of these chemicals are now banned in Europe, but they're ubiquitous in American processed foods,\" he said during a September 2024 roundtable discussion on health led by Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc. \"We are literally poisoning our children systematically for profit.\"",
      "A 2021 joint study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the University of S\u00e3o Paolo in Brazil found that people who consumed more calories from ultra-processed foods had lower scores on tests measuring cardiovascular health.",
      "Kennedy has also railed against seed oils, calling them \"one of the driving causes of the obesity epidemic\" and has called on fast food restaurants to fry their products with animal fats instead.",
      "Seed oils contain certain types of healthy fats that are good for the heart when used in moderation, decades of research shows.",
      "Claims that fluoride affects children's development",
      "In an interview with NPR in November, Kennedy doubled down on his promise that the Trump administration will recommend that local governments remove fluoride from their water supplies.",
      "He has claimed that fluoride in drinking water affects children's neurological development and that other countries that have removed fluoride from their water supplies have not seen an increase in cavities. Some health professionals have expressed concerns about excessive fluoride intake and potential toxicity.",
      "However, high-quality studies show fluoride prevents cavities and repairs damage to teeth caused by bacteria in the mouth. Fluoride also replaces minerals lost from teeth due to acid breakdown, according to the CDC.",
      "ABC News' Youri Benadjaoud and Anne Flaherty contributed to this report.",

      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday that aims to find ways to cut federal funding to schools that teach certain topics related to race, sex, gender or politics.",

      "Trump's pick for secretary of Education, Linda McMahon, has yet to be confirmed by the Senate. The order will also rely on actions from newly confirmed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who oversees schools run by the Department of Defense.",
      "Federal funding makes up roughly 11% of K-12 public school funding, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.",
      "Similar Republican-backed legislation has been implemented across the country, at the state level, placing restrictions on acceptable usage and lessons related to these categories.",
      "Critics say these restrictions are \"censorship\" and that they will restrict educators' abilities to speak about certain historical, social or political concepts. These restrictions have led to lawsuits across the country over class cancellations, teacher firings, book restrictions and more.",
      "The forthcoming order also directs the attorney general to work with state and local authorities to pursue actions against school officials and teachers who \"sexually exploit minors\" or allow social transitioning \u2013 though the fact sheet does not state what those actions are.",
      "Social transitioning is when a transgender person begins \"using a different name, using different pronouns, dressing differently, starts or stops wearing make-up and jewelry,\" along with other factors, according to LGBTQ+ advocacy group GLAAD.",
      "Another order signed Wednesday seeks to fulfill Trump's campaign promise to expand school choice through Education Savings Accounts. It requires the secretaries of Education and Defense to evaluate how about how discretionary grant programs can be used to advance his \"education freedom\" mandate.",
      "ESAs and school vouchers have spurred debates at the local level for years.",
      "ESA programs allow families to divert a designated amount of per-student public school funding to instead pay for expenses related to private schools, micro-schools or homeschooling -- including tuition, books, tutoring, transportation and more. Similarly, school vouchers reallocate public funds to families so that they can pay for a student's private tuition.",
      "Trump plans to call on the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Defense, and the Secretary of the Interior to provide guidance on granting funds for families to use to \"educational alternatives, including private and faith-based options.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 17:59:45 -0500",
    "summary": "ABC News just spent two nights with members of one of the largest cartels in Mexico as they explained their operations in a town just across the border from the US.",
    "story": [
      "We spent two nights with members of one of the largest cartels in Mexico.",
      "If the Mexican cartels are concerned about President Donald Trump's plans for them, it sure didn't seem like it this night.",
      "If only because someone who was worried probably wouldn't show a reporter the guns he'd just smuggled from the U.S. nor the fentanyl he was about to ship back north. Not to mention a safe house filled with migrants about to be crossed illegally at the border wall.",
      "And yet that's what we saw, spending two nights with members of one the largest cartels in Mexico the week of Trump's inauguration.",
      "They asked us not to share which cartel, but safe to say you've heard the name, as has Trump.",
      "The president formally declared Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organizations via executive order and threatened to use the U.S. military against the groups. Deploying the U.S. military to the border is also meant as a deterrence to cartel smuggling.",
      "The goal of our time with the group was to understand how the cartel is reacting to being squarely targeted by this new administration. The collective response was a shrug.",
      "\"We're not worried. This is day to day,\" one cartel member told us. \"This is what we're going to do.\"",
      "It's business as usual, they say, as they unloaded two rifles and three handguns from hidden compartments in an SUV that had just driven across the border from the U.S. To be clear, they passed through an official port of entry, right past border guards.",
      "Every single one of the guns this group traffics, they say, is bought in the U.S. and then shipped south.",
      "The Mexican Department of Foreign Relations officially estimates that somewhere between 70% and 90% of guns in Mexico originated from and passed through the U.S.",
      "\"Because we all know that in the U.S. it is easy to find them. They sell them in stores and here in Mexico you don't find that,\" a cartel member said. \"You have to keep a very, very careful record [here]. Not everyone [in Mexico] is approved for these types of weapons and not just anyone is sold or given a license. In the U.S., yes.\"",
      "Trump is seemingly not worried about American guns being smuggled south but he is very concerned about fentanyl flowing to the north.",
      "Shortly after the cartel unloaded the guns, they loaded five sandwich-sized packages of fentanyl into that same SUV, stashed in a hidden compartment beneath the center console.",
      "With a total of 10,000 pills, the street value is $50,000 or more, contributing to an untold number of potential overdose deaths. The ease with which they can be smuggled has fundamentally changed the drug game, in horrific ways.",
      "The CDC estimates that the fentanyl trade has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans and tonight, it showed no signs of stopping.",
      "By designating cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, many speculate that Trump is taking the first step toward deploying U.S. special forces in Mexico. However, the cartel members tell me special operators have been here for years.",
      "\"They've been here for a long time. They've been working directly, they've trained personnel here,\" a cartel smuggler said. \"The U.S. military has sent people here to Mexico for that.\"",
      "The SUV took off shortly thereafter. We were told by the group later it made it across the border without incident.",
      "One night later, in another part of this Mexican border town, we were invited into a non-descript house in an otherwise unremarkable neighborhood.",
      "Inside, we were greeted by a half dozen armed men and two Indian families, taking the last step of being smuggled into the US.",
      "This is the second-most lucrative part of this organized crime group's portfolio\u2014human smuggling.",
      "\"There is a lot of demand,\" said one masked smuggler.",
      "Business has been good and he thinks it will be getting better, thanks to some of Trump's immigration policies.",
      "Mass deportations could lead to more customers, he says. Deploying the military to the border means the group can raise their prices.",
      "\"They'll need our services more,\" he told us. The pitch to migrants is that they won't be able to cross without the group's help.",
      "The U.S. government and independent experts say that human smuggling by cartels significantly increased during the Biden administration. Hundreds of thousands of people were transported to the border, often enduring terrible conditions, while cartels made billions in profits.",
      "Trump has promised to take action against them. However, for smugglers, little has changed.",
      "\"The demand is still there,\" a smuggler told me. \"The deal is already done. We can't do anything. Whatever they change there, we have to keep sending people [into the US].\"",
      "They all did admit a renewed focus on their illicit activities will likely make them harder to do. But the idea that it can be totally stopped, they said, is a joke for a simple reason. Demand.",
      "As long as the U.S. continues to consume massive amounts of drugs, and as long as migrants are desperate to get within its borders, they believe their business will continue. Attacking these issues simply from the supply side by targeting cartels is not going to make them stop.",
      "Who knows if this is all macho bravado, trying to sound tough in front of a reporter with a camera.",
      "But for now, whatever its worth, the drugs keep flowing and so do smuggled migrants. Whether Trump can change that remains to be seen."

      "The Selection La Habana hotel, managed by Spanish chain Iberostar, has yet to be inaugurated but it is already the target of criticism \u2014 and not only for its unusual shape. Cubans are questioning the government\u2019s allocation of millions of dollars towards luxury tourism while the island grapples with a severe economic crisis and tourism numbers plummet to historic lows.",
      "\u201cAll that money could have been spent to build hospitals and schools,\u201d lamented Susel Borges, a 26-year-old artisan, as she looked up to the towering edifice, known to locals as the \u201cK and 23 building\u201d because of its location.",

But in December, Cuban authorities said only 2.2 million tourists visited the island in 2024, a decrease of roughly 200,000 from 2023 and significantly lower than the 4.2 million tourists who visited in 2019.",
      "The government attributes the decline in tourism to a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of factors including supply shortages, a severe energy crisis causing massive blackouts and a lack of personnel, due to emigration and low wages. Furthermore, the island is grappling with a surge in U.S. sanctions, including restrictions on travel by U.S. citizens, a ban on cruise ships and other measures specifically designed to stifle the growth of Cuba\u2019s tourism industry.",
      "\u201cTourism is gone,\u201d said Julio Garc\u00eda Campos, driver of a shiny red 1951 Pontiac with an original engine. \u201cTourists used to line up to get on one of these!\u201d he said, recalling a bygone era when the island was bustling with American and European travelers following a removal of sanctions by then-President Barack Obama.",
      "The new Selection La Habana, like all other hotels in Cuba, is state-owned and operates under GAESA, a conglomerate belonging to the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces that has often been criticized because of the opacity of its businesses. As a military-run operation, it is exempt from audits by the Comptroller General\u2019s Office and has not disclosed the amount it invested in the 40-story hotel.",
      "Cuban economist Pedro Monreal notes the \u201cincongruity\u201d of investing capital in the tourism sector when very little is being allocated to strategic areas such as agriculture.",
      "\"With food insecurity a concern, it\u2019s troubling that agricultural investment lags significantly behind tourism investment, remaining 11 times lower,\u201d Monreal noted last year on social media.",
      "Architects also expressed little enthusiasm for the new hotel, pointing at its disruptive appearance within the environment, its excessive height violating urban regulations and tall glass windows that are ill-suited for a tropical climate.",
      "\u201cThis building serves as a perfect example in our classes of what should not be done in terms of bioclimatic design,\u201d said Abel Tablada, an architect and university professor, adding it's \"unforgivable\" that the little money available to the Cuban state has been allocated to a building that does not add value to the city.",

      "The mystery of what happened to a U.S. woman who was tried in three killings before disappearing from a Mexican prison more than 50 years ago is about to be solved.",
      "Authorities have planned a news conference for Thursday to discuss the case of Sharon Kinne, who was charged before her 25th birthday with killing her Missouri husband, her boyfriend\u2019s wife and a man she\u2019d picked up in a Mexican bar.",
      "Her whereabouts have been a mystery since she reportedly snuck out of the prison in Ixtacalapan on Dec. 7, 1969. And her story has been featured in the book, \u201cI\u2019m Just an Ordinary Girl: The Sharon Kinne Story\u201d as well as in podcasts and TV stories such as Discovery I.D.\u2019s \u201cDeadly Women.\u201d",
      "An FBI spokeswoman directed questions to the Jackson County sheriff's office in Missouri, which said it couldn't confirm any information before the news conference, including whether she had died. But a news release promised answers.",
      "\u201cWe hope that by bringing closure to this case, we can provide a sense of resolution not only to the friends and families of the innocent victims she murdered but also to those who were affected by her actions, including her loved ones,\u201d the sheriff's department said in announcing the news conference.",
      "Kinne, who married at 16, was living in a ranch home in the Independence, Missouri, area in March 1960 when her 25-year-old husband, James Kinne, was shot in the back of the head while napping. Independence is just outside of Kansas City.",
      "The mother of two told police she had heard her 2-year-old daughter ask, \u201cHow does this thing work, Daddy?\u201d Then there was a gunshot. Sharon Kinne said she ran into the bedroom and found the toddler holding her husband\u2019s .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol. The death was ruled accidental.",
      "But Kinne and her husband had been having marital problems, and she had been seeing other men, later court testimony revealed.",
      "According to press reports and interviews with investigators, Sharon Kinne then met car salesman Walter Jones when she went to buy a new car with money from her husband\u2019s life insurance and the sale of their home.",
      "A little more than a month later, Jones\u2019 wife, Patricia, was found shot to death.",
      "On June 1, 1960, Sharon Kinne was charged with Patricia Jones\u2019 murder. Police took another look at James Kinne\u2019s death and a Jackson County grand jury indicted Kinne for that crime as well.",
      "In June 1961, Sharon Kinne was tried in the death of Patricia Jones. And an all-male jury acquitted her to courtroom applause.",
      "In January 1962, Sharon Kinne was convicted of killing her husband. But, the Missouri Supreme Court later overturned the conviction because of improper jury selection. She was tried again, but jurors couldn't agree on a verdict.",
      "Sharon Kinne then headed to Mexico City. One evening, she picked up a man in a bar and went with him to a hotel. Around 3 a.m., gunshots were heard and Francisco Ordonez lay dead on the floor. Kinne got 13 years for killing Ordonez.",
      "Ballistics tests proved prosecutors\u2019 hunch that a gun found in Sharon Kinne\u2019s Mexican motel was the one that killed Patricia Jones.",
      "Sharon Kinne couldn\u2019t be tried again for that crime, so prosecutors closed the case.",
      "Before her apparent escape, she gave several interviews, and was known in Mexico as \u201cLa Pistolera,\" which translates as \u201cThe Gunslinger.\u201d",
      "In a 1965 Saturday Evening Post interview, Kinne said: ``I knew out there, out of Kansas City and Independence, that the world was going on its way someplace. And I wasn\u2019t going anywhere.\u2033"

      "Two dogs that survived an animal-rescue flight crash that killed the pilot last fall have found new homes",
      "Two dogs that survived an animal-rescue flight crash that killed the pilot have found new homes as the late aviator's friends work to honor him by helping more pets, a shelter director said Wednesday.",
      "The Nov. 24 crash in New York's Catskill Mountains killed Seuk Kim of Springfield, Virginia, a dedicated volunteer who transported cats and dogs from disaster areas and overcrowded shelters to rescue groups. He was bringing three dogs to an Albany, New York-area organization called the Animal Shelter of Schoharie Valley when his 1986 Mooney M20J went down.",
      "Kim told air traffic controllers that he hit moderate to heavy turbulence at 5,000 feet (1,520 meters), but then he descended to about 4,300 feet (1,311 meters) and reported that conditions improved to light to moderate turbulence, according to the National Transportation Safety Board's preliminary report on the crash. The report said he didn't contact air traffic control again or make any distress calls.",
      "Two of the dogs, a Labrador-mix puppy named Whiskey and a young Yorkshire terrier mix called Pluto, survived. Pluto was internally bruised, while Whiskey was found huddled in the snow with two broken legs. The Lab pup subsequently underwent surgeries at Pieper Memorial Veterinary emergency and specialty hospital in Middletown, Connecticut.",
      "After those procedures and lots of physical therapy, 6-month-old Whiskey is on his feet and playing at his foster home in Middletown, and the family that took him in has decided to keep him, said Maggie Jackman Pryor, the executive director of the Animal Shelter of Schoharie Valley.",
      "The foster family is set to adopt Whiskey formally this weekend.",
      "Pluto, meanwhile, recovered quickly and was adopted a few weeks into a home in Averill Park, a community near Albany, Pryor said.",
      "The remains of the third dog, a little one named Lisa, went to Kim's relatives at their request.",
      "The Animal Shelter of Schoharie Valley fielded inquiries from people around the country interested in adopting the canine survivors, said Pryor, who urged some callers to look closer to home.",
      "\u201cThese two dogs are amazing, but there are so many amazing dogs\" in shelters, she said in a phone interview Wednesday.",
      "Meanwhile, Kim's friends and fellow rescue pilots are forming an organization to further his legacy, Pryor said. She said plans include sponsoring mobile spay and neuter clinics and creating pet food pantries like one that he and his children started."

    "story": [
      "The Republican-controlled Senate has confirmed Lee Zeldin to lead the Environmental Protection Agency",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Republican-controlled Senate on Wednesday confirmed Lee Zeldin to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, a key role to help President Donald Trump fulfill his pledge to roll back major environmental regulations, including those aimed at slowing climate change and encouraging use of electric vehicles.",
      "The vote was 56-42 in Zeldin's favor.",
      "Zeldin, a former Republican congressman from New York, is a longtime Trump ally and served on Trump\u2019s defense team during his first impeachment. He voted against certifying Trump\u2019s 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden.",
      "Zeldin, 44, said during his confirmation hearing that he has a moral responsibility to be a good steward of the environment and pledged to support career staff who have dedicated themselves to the agency's mission to protect human health and the environment.",
      "Zeldin repeatedly declined to commit to specific policies, however, promising instead not to prejudge outcomes before arriving at EPA. When asked by Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska whether he would roll back programs that promote electric cars \u2014 a program Trump has repeatedly criticized \u2014 Zeldin stayed vague but acknowledged he has heard Republican complaints.",
      "Trump led efforts to dismantle more than 100 environmental protections during his first term and has promised to do so again, targeting what he falsely labels an electric vehicle \u201cmandate\u201d and \u201cgreen new scam\u201d approved by Democrats.",
      "Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, has vowed to overturn former President Joe Biden\u2019s biggest climate accomplishments, including tailpipe regulations for vehicles and slashed pollution from power plants fired by coal and natural gas. Trump has already moved to oust career staff at EPA and other agencies, remove scientific advisers and close an office that helps minority communities that disproportionately struggle with polluted air and water.",
      "Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island called Zeldin the wrong man for the job.",
      "\u201cWe need an EPA administrator who will take climate change seriously, treat the science honestly and stand up where necessary to the political pressure that will be coming from the White House, where we have a president who actually thinks (climate change) is a hoax, and from the huge fossil fuel forces that propelled him into office with enormous amounts of political money and who now think they own the place,\" Whitehouse said in a Senate speech.",
      "Trump is \u201cunder the thumb of the fossil fuel industry,\u201d Whitehouse said, adding that the EPA administrator \u201chas to be truthful and factual and support and defend our environment and our safety from climate change.''",
      "He has nothing against Zeldin personally, Whitehouse added, \u201cbut the likelihood of him standing against that fossil fuel bulldozer that is coming at him is essentially zero. And in that context, this is very much the wrong guy.\u201d",
      "Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said Zeldin will return the EPA to its original mission of protecting America\u2019s air, water and land \u2014 without \u201csuffocating the economy.\u201d",
      "Barrasso called Zeldin \u201ca lifelong public servant\u201d and a seasoned lawyer with a sharp legal mind and over 20 years of military service.",
      "Zeldin will continue Trump\u2019s \u201cmission to roll back punishing, political regulations\u201d at the EPA, \u201ccut red tape\u201d and oversee \"a new wave of creativity and innovation,'' Barrasso said.",
      "\u201cFor the last four years, the so-called experts at the Environmental Protection Agency went on a reckless regulatory rampage,'' Barrasso said, referring to the Biden administration. \u201cThey saddled American families and businesses with higher costs and heavy-handed restrictions. They bowed to climate extremism and ignored common sense.\"",
      "Zeldin \u201cwill right the ship and restore balance at the EPA,'' Barrasso said, citing likely actions to repeal Biden-era rules on tailpipe emissions and power plants, along with eliminating federal subsidies for electric vehicles.",
      "The League of Conservation Voters, a national environmental advocacy group, has panned Zeldin\u2019s lifetime environmental record, giving him a 14% score. Like all Republicans at the time, he voted against the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act aimed at boosting renewable energy and manufacturing and fighting climate change.",
      "Zeldin supported a bill to reduce harmful forever chemicals, called PFAS, that would have required the EPA to set limits on substances in drinking water. He also was a leading proponent of the 2020 Great American Outdoors Act, which used oil and gas royalties to help the National Park Service tackle its massive maintenance backlog. He\u2019s also supported local conservation efforts on Long Island.",
      "Zeldin said at his Jan. 16 hearing that he wants to collaborate with the private sector \u201cto promote common-sense, smart regulation that will allow American innovation to continue to lead the world.\"",
      "The EPA under his leadership \u201cwill prioritize compliance as much as possible,\" Zeldin said. \u201cI believe in the rule of law and I want to work with people to ensure they do their part to protect the environment.\""

    "summary": "South Carolina Treasurer Curtis Loftis says calls for him to resign over an accounting error that left the state sorting out what happened to a $1.8 billion fund amounted to a witch hunt",
    "story": [
      "South Carolina Treasurer Curtis Loftis says calls for him to resign over an accounting error that left the state sorting out what happened to a $1.8 billion fund amounted to a witch hunt",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- South Carolina Treasurer Curtis Loftis said Wednesday that calls for him to resign over an accounting error that left the state trying to figure out what happened to a $1.8 billion fund amounted to a witch hunt.",
      "A House budget subcommittee asked Loftis about the complex problem his office and two others knew about for roughly six years before it was reported to the General Assembly. The leaders of two other agencies who were aware of the problem subsequently resigned and the accounting error was only reported by one of their replacements.",
      "Most of the $1.8 billion was mistakes involved in assigning the money to accounts and didn't involve actual cash. But it took millions of dollars and a private forensic audit to untangle the mess.",
      "Loftis said the potential damage to South Carolina's credit rating and a federal investigation into the state's accounting practices aren't the fault of his agency. Rather, he said, the fallout is to blame on Republican state senators and others aggressively pursuing the Republican treasurer and making a public spectacle of the mistake.",
      "\u201cNobody can understand it. It's a political witch hunt,\u201d said Loftis, who several times blamed the mistakes on now retired members of his staff or on the Comptroller General and Auditor offices who help him with state finances.",
      "Lawmakers, especially in the Senate, aren't so sure. Republican Sen. Larry Grooms is calling for Loftis to resign and the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday passed a resolution to pay a private accounting firm to \u201cbabysit\u201d the Treasurer's Office \u2014 as Grooms said \u2014 until lawmakers are confident the state's accounts are back in order.",
      "The problems started as the state changed computer systems in the 2010s. When the process was finished, workers couldn't figure out why the books were more than $1 billion out of whack. A fund was created to cover the accounting error and over the years more was added on paper to keep the state's books balanced.",
      "The error came to light after Comptroller General Richard Eckstrom resigned in March 2023 over a different accounting mistake and his replacement reported the mystery account.",
      "State Auditor George Kennedy resigned last week after the private audit by AlixPartners found he did not review audits that failed to report the $1.8 billion discrepancy.",
      "The questioning of Loftis in the House was less confrontational than the Senate's. But members of the House budget subcommittee were especially upset why Loftis didn't report the problems as soon as they cropped up, instead of waiting for years.",
      "\u201cI don't know how to explain to my neighbors, to my constituents that we could have solved this problem for thousands of dollars but now the taxpayers of this state are forced to spend millions of dollars,\u201d Republican Rep. Micah Caskey said.",
      "Loftis repeated the mistakes were made from outside his agency and his staff was trying to fix them.",
      "\u201cThey are trying to do the right things. Decision were made. They weren't the best,\u201d Loftis said.",
      "Loftis also suggested the damage to South Carolina's borrowing power has already been done. He said the state now can only get loans and financing on a year-to-year basis at unfavorable terms and laid the blame on the Senate and others who have been aggressively scapegoating him for the accounting problems.",
      "Later Wednesday Grooms showed reporters a memo from Senate Finance staff that said the state can borrow and assume debt and no projects have been held up.",
      "During part of Loftis' presentation, Grooms sat in the back of the meeting room in the House. Grooms left before Loftis once the meeting concluded, but said afterward that the treasurer caught up to him in a hallway.",
      "\u201cHe asked me if I was happy that I\u2019m the reason our schools and hospitals aren\u2019t being built in South Carolina,\u201d Grooms said.",
      "A reporter asked how he responded and Grooms said, \"I know catfish that are more slippery than you are.\u201d",
      "Loftis' office didn't respond to give the treasurer's version of the encounter."

      "Tulsi Gabbard is expected to face tough questions about her past comments about Russia, Syria and a key government surveillance program as lawmakers vet her to lead the nation\u2019s intelligence service",
      "WASHINGTON -- As an unconventional pick to lead the nation's intelligence service, Tulsi Gabbard is expected to face tough questions about her past comments on Syria, Russia, foreign surveillance and President Donald Trump when she goes before lawmakers at her confirmation hearing Thursday.",
      "The former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii is Trump's nominee to be the next director of national intelligence, a job created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that oversees and coordinates the work of more than a dozen intelligence agencies.",
      "Gabbard, a lieutenant colonel in the National Guard who served two tours in the Middle East, has alarmed some intelligence and national security officials in the U.S. and elsewhere with comments sympathetic to Russia and criticism of a critical surveillance program.",
      "Here's a look at Gabbard in her own words:",
      "Gabbard traveled to Syria in 2017 to meet with then-President Bashar Assad, a visit that angered lawmakers from both parties who said she helped legitimize an accused war criminal and key ally of Russia and Iran.",
      "Gabbard has defended the trip and her belief that meeting with adversaries can result in dialogue and peace. Assad fled Syria in December after being ousted following his country's brutal civil war.",
      "\u201cWhen the opportunity arose to meet with him, I did so because I felt that it\u2019s important that if we profess to truly care about the Syrian people, about their suffering, then we\u2019ve got to be able to meet with anyone that we need to if there is a possibility that we can achieve peace,\u201d Gabbard told CNN at the time.",
      "She later said she was \u201cskeptical\u201d that Assad's regime used banned chemical weapons to strike his own people, despite that being the repeated conclusion of U.S. authorities and independent analysts.",
      "\u201cI have not seen that independent investigation occur and that proof presented showing exactly what happened and there are a number of theories of exactly what happened that day,\" Gabbard said of Assad's attack during a CNN appearance in 2017.",
      "In a 2019 interview on MSNBC, she said, \u201cAssad is not the enemy of the United States because Syria does not pose a direct threat to the United States.\u201d",
      "Following Assad's ouster, Gabbard has echoed Trump, who has said Assad fell because Russia pulled its support during its war in Ukraine, a conflict Trump has said he hopes to resolve.",
      "\u201cI stand in full support and wholeheartedly agree with the statements that President Trump has made,\u201d she told reporters in December. \u201cMy own views and experiences have been shaped by my multiple deployments and seeing firsthand the cost of war.\"",
      "Trump, she said, \u201cis fully committed as he has said over and over to bringing about an end to wars, demonstrating peace through strength.\u201d",
      "Gabbard has repeated Russia's arguments about its invasion of Ukraine, suggesting Moscow had justification to send troops into the neighboring country. She also endorsed Russian claims that the U.S. and Ukraine were involved in dangerous biological research before the war.",
      "She has criticized the government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a \u201ccorrupt autocracy\u201d and has expressed sympathy for Russia\u2019s position, given Ukraine\u2019s desire to join NATO, the Western military alliance.",
      "\u201cThis war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden Admin/NATO had simply acknowledged Russia\u2019s legitimate security concerns,\u201d she posted on Twitter at the start of Russia\u2019s invasion in 2022.",
      "Soon after the war started, Russian state media advanced the false claim that the U.S. was involved in clandestine bioweapons research in Ukraine. The conspiracy theory relied on the existence of U.S.-funded labs that weren't secret and were involved in traditional public health research and efforts to prevent pandemics.",
      "Gabbard did not make that distinction when she suggested that the labs could \u201crelease and spread deadly pathogens\u201d \u2014 echoing similar Russian conspiracy theories about the labs.",
      "\u201cThese labs need to be shut down immediately, and the pathogens that they hold need to be destroyed,\u201d she said. Her comments drew a sharp rebuke from lawmakers, including some Republicans, who said she was parroting Russian propaganda.",
      "Gabbard later said she had only been referring to traditional public health research, and not secret biolabs. But her comments were taken seriously in Russia, where the state-controlled media has often praised Gabbard. One article last year called her \u201csuperwoman.\u201d",
      "Gabbard has praised Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor who fled to Russia after he was charged in 2013 with illegally exposing government surveillance methods. Considered a traitor by many security officials, Snowden has been hailed as a heroic whistleblower by others.",
      "Gabbard sponsored legislation to end Snowden's prosecution, putting her at odds with Senate Republicans who have criticized Snowden's actions. Snowden received Russian citizenship in 2022.",
      "\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Snowden, the American people would never have learned the NSA was collecting phone records and spying on Americans. As president, I will protect whistle-blowers who expose threats to our freedom and liberty,\u201d Gabbard wrote on social media in 2019.",
      "As a member of Congress, Gabbard tried to repeal a surveillance program used to spy on suspected terrorists and foreign agents overseas \u2014 a program she now says she supports as she seeks Senate confirmation.",
      "The program, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, permits the U.S. government to collect without a warrant the communications of non-Americans located outside the country for the purpose of gathering foreign intelligence. National security officials say 702, which was first authorized in 2008, has saved lives by preventing terror attacks, while also helping the government stay ahead of foreign cyberattacks or espionage.",
      "Gabbard introduced legislation in 2020 that would have repealed the law, which she said made it too easy to obtain the private communications of Americans without a warrant.",

      "Gabbard\u2019s loyalty to Trump represents an about-face from just a few years ago, when she ran for president as a Democrat and ended up endorsing her party\u2019s 2020 nominee, Joe Biden.",

      "A lawyer for Karl P. Loucks, 42, entered the plea to a first-degree murder charge during a hearing in Shelby County Criminal Court. Loucks also pleaded not guilty to an aggravated assault charge in the stabbing of another homeless man in downtown Memphis, where Loucks lived in an apartment.",
      "Loucks is being held in jail without bond. He was arrested May 31 in the killing of Shaun Rhea. Loucks\u2019 lawyer has suggested that he acted in self-defense.",
      "During a hearing in July, a security guard and a police investigator testified that Loucks attacked Rhea in the early morning hours of the day he was arrested. Tony Perry, a security guard at a downtown Memphis hotel, testified that he saw Loucks use pepper spray on Rhea while he was sleeping.

      "The VH1 Save the Music Foundation never had any problem getting attention in the late \u201990s when it launched with a party featuring Aretha Franklin, Celine Dion and Mariah Carey",
      "With a launch party that included Aretha Franklin, Celine Dion and Mariah Carey, the VH1 Save the Music Foundation never had any problem getting attention in the late '90s.",
      "But a lot has changed since the music education nonprofit's early years, with the glitzy, star-studded cable TV specials slowly giving way to a decidedly more grassroots focus on establishing and sustaining music programs in elementary and secondary schools nationwide. To expand its work, the foundation needs to broaden its donor base, especially as MTV and VH1 \u2014 and their parent company Viacom, and now, Paramount \u2014 continue their pivot away from music.",
      "On Wednesday, the foundation, now known only as Save the Music Foundation, announced its intention to \u201cgo indie\u201d \u2014 rocker-speak for becoming an independent organization. The nonprofit will cut ties with Paramount and seek donations from various sources, including individual donors.",
      "\u201cIt was pretty clear, from a Save the Music perspective, that it would be helpful for us to be viewed as a music industry initiative as opposed to a corporate social responsibility initiative for just one player in the industry,\" said Henry Donahue, the foundation's executive director. \"The way MusiCares is for health care in the industry, we wanted to be that same kind of national, first-call organization for music education. So any artist, label, streaming service, talent agency, festival, concert promoter who thought about engaging the community around music education \u2014 we wanted to be the go-to for that.\u201d",
      "\u201cGoing indie\u201d has been a long process for the foundation, one that has already been supported by billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott with a $2 million grant in 2021. It has launched a $10 million endowment fund, with $4 million already secured.",
      "But the shift will allow Save the Music to focus more on students like 17-year-old Ja\u2019Marion Hulin, from Daniel McLaughlin Therrell High School in Atlanta, where he is president of the school\u2019s record company, Panther Records, and is learning to use equipment provided by the foundation to make music.",
      "\u201cHaving our own equipment, I think, allows us to be more passionate about our abilities \u2014 there\u2019s not really anything that\u2019s holding us back,\" Hulin said. \"All kids might not have the same music tastes. Some might be more into pop or rap or alternative rock. So having that equipment allows us to fluctuate doing sounds.\u201d",
      "Samuel Davis, who teaches music at Therrell High, said that without support from Save the Music's J Dilla Music Technology Grant, the students would have had to share equipment and software in the class. The grant, which the school has received for the past four years, also supports teachers in creating a strong music technology program to help aspiring producers.",
      "\u201cThe program is extremely valuable to students,\" Davis said. \"It increases their attendance. They\u2019re more willing to come to school. They feel more connected to the school. They have more connections with their peers and students and staff. It just builds onto our whole child education program where they feel like they belong and they\u2019re more committed to their education.\u201d",
      "As much as Hulin enjoys DJing in the high school cafeteria, mixing R&B tracks like Lauryn Hill's \u201cEx-Factor\u201d and Jill Scott's \u201cGolden\u201d together to create a vibe for other students, his dream is to create music for videogame soundtracks, maybe bringing neo-soul to the Persona series.",
      "Lonnie Hampton, a teacher at P.S. 20 in Brooklyn, New York, carries the torch for the more traditional programs of Save the Music. He has received funding from the foundation off and on since 2006, allowing him to purchase saxophones, clarinets, trumpets, and two bass guitars for students at his elementary school.",
      "The additional instruments meant that students could each have their own instrument, rather than sharing with other students each week. \u201cIt gives kids a chance to have an instrument at home,\" Hampton said. \u201cIt gives them a chance to play and to see that hard work matters. When they see the joy of practicing and practicing and practicing and practicing, which I preach every day, and then they get it, it just nurtures your life.\u201d",
      "John Sykes, who founded the VH1 Save the Music Foundation in 1997 as an executive with MTV, said he was thrilled at how the current leadership of the nonprofit had taken the organization to a new level.",
      "\u201cThe way music wires the brain allows a young child not only to become the next Bruce Springsteen or Jay-Z, but also a teacher, a doctor, a lawyer, a public service worker,\" he said. \"Any position benefits from music education.\u201d",
      "Sykes, now chairman of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, said he looks forward to supporting Save the Music and its new structure. Though he hopes that music education funding will be safe from any potential government cuts, Sykes says Rock Hall inductees may offer their own backing where needed.",
      "\u201cMusic education is not just an art; it's a science,\" said Sykes. \u201cWhile it is a wonderful way to express your creativity, it is actually teaching you math. In the early days with VH1, we actually went to right-wing conservative governors who, when they saw the power and impact of music education on test scores, they jumped on board because they understood that this was really a cornerstone of the learning process.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Victims of a deadly 2023 Hawaii wildfire that decimated the town of Lahaina are expected to testify in court during an unusual trial to determine how to divide a potential $4 billion settlement",
      "HONOLULU -- When Hawaii Gov. Josh Green announced a $4 billion settlement about a year after the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century devastated Lahaina in 2023, he touted the speed of the deal to \u201cavoid protracted and painful lawsuits.\u201d",
      "Five months later, however, an unusual trial starting Wednesday will delve into difficult questions about survivors\u2019 losses as a judge decides how to divide the settlement. Some victims will take the witness stand, while others have submitted pre-recorded testimony, describing pain made all the more fresh by the recent destruction in Los Angeles.",
      "The trial won't determine fault. Defendants blamed for the blaze including the state, power utility Hawaiian Electric and large landowners have already agreed to the settlement amount.",
      "At issue is how much money various groups of plaintiffs might receive, including some who filed individual lawsuits after losing their family members, homes or businesses, and other victims covered by class-action lawsuits, including tourists who simply had to cancel trips to Maui following the inferno.",
      "Lawyers for the two groups failed to come to an agreement, leaving it up to Judge Peter Cahill to determine how the $4 billion should be shared.",
      "\u201cA class action is everybody suffering the same loss,\u201d said Damon Valverde, whose Lahaina sunglasses company burned. \u201cAnd I suffered quite a bit more than others, and others suffered quite a bit more than me.\u201d",
      "Valverde isn't expected to testify; the focus should be on victims who lost family members, he said.",
      "Those include Kevin Baclig, whose wife, father-in-law, mother-in-law and brother-in-law were among the 102 people known to have died.",
      "Baclig said in a declaration that if called to testify he would describe how for three agonizing days he searched for them \u2014 from hotel to hotel, shelter to shelter. \u201cI clung to the fragile hope that maybe they had made it off the island, that they were safe,\u201d he said.",
      "A month and a half went by and the grim reality set in. He went to the Philippines to gather DNA samples from his wife\u2019s close relatives there. The samples matched remains found in the fire. He eventually carried urns holding their remains back to the Philippines.",
      "\u201cThe loss has left me in profound, unrelenting pain,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no words to describe the emptiness I feel or the weight I carry every day.\u201d",
      "The class action includes some people who lost homes and businesses, but also tourists whose trips were delayed or canceled. Only a nominal portion of the settlement should go toward that group, said Jacob Lowenthal, one of the attorneys representing victims \u2014 like Baclig \u2014 who have filed their own lawsuits, known as the \"individual plaintiffs.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe categories of losses that the class is claiming are just grossly insignificant compared to our losses,\u201d Lowenthal said.",
      "Attorneys representing the class didn't respond to messages from The Associated Press. In their trial brief, they challenged the idea that everyone who has a claim worth suing over has already done so. Many people have held off hiring attorneys, the brief said, because of the fire's disruption to life, \"distrust in heavy attorney advertising, and a desire to see how the process plays out first.\u201d",
      "Further complicating the matter are questions before the state Supreme Court, which is considering whether insurers can separately sue the defendants for reimbursement for the $2 billion-plus they have paid out as a result of the fire, or whether their share must come from the $4 billion settlement.",
      "If the court says insurers can sue separately, that will likely torpedo the entire deal. Preventing insurers from going after the defendants is a key settlement term, and allowing them to do so would drain the money available for fire victims and lead to prolonged litigation, lawyers for the individual plaintiffs say.",

      "It\u2019s an increasingly common issue: After-action reports and investigations revealed issues with alert systems in other California blazes: in the 2017 Tubbs Fire, which killed 22 people in Santa Rosa; the 2018 Camp Fire, which killed 85 people in Paradise; the Woolsey fire, which started the same day and killed three in Malibu; as well as in Colorado's 2021 Marshall Fire, which destroyed more than 1,000 homes outside Denver; and in Hawaii's 2023 Lahaina Fire, which decimated that historic town and killed 102.",
      "It could take months to know why some evacuation orders lagged in the Los Angeles fires.",
      "Several residents who lost homes in the Eaton Fire told The Associated Press they received no notifications about their neighborhoods. For others, the first warning was an urgent text message in the middle of the night.",
      "Susan Lee, who signed up for the alert app Nixle, did not get any alerts specific to her west Altadena neighborhood before she and her family left of their own accord around 10 p.m. after losing power and cell reception.",
      "\u201cIf we had even been informed that houses and other structures were burning down, we would have known better what was happening,\u201d she said. \u201cWe almost went to sleep that night with two kids and a dog and two cats in the house.\u201d",
      "Only after 3 a.m. did an alert hit her phone. Destroyed along with the house are the Christmas ornaments she saved for her children, and countless other family keepsakes.",
      "\u201cWe lost everything, everything,\u201d Lee said, breaking into tears.",
      "Tricia Wachtendorf, director of the Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware, said alerts have to be specific and clear. Research has shown that for them to be effective, people have to hear, understand, believe, personalize and confirm them before they react.",
      "\u201cJust because you send the message at 3 a.m. doesn\u2019t mean someone is hearing it,\u201d Wachtendorf said.",
      "The hours between midnight and 3:30 a.m. appear to have been particularly challenging for first responders in Los Angeles County, based on an AP review of scanner traffic recordings and data from CalFire, the state's chief fire agency; the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA; and the Watch Duty app.",
      "Resources were stretched thin, and hurricane-force winds had grounded air support, limiting authorities' ability to get a top-down perspective on the flames.",
      "Calls reporting burning homes were flooding in as embers blew onto roofs and yards. During one half-hour period, 17 new addresses were relayed to firefighters, even as some crews ran low on fuel.",
      "By 12:07 a.m., CalFire records show, dozens of neighborhoods had been ordered to evacuate because of the Eaton Fire, all of them east of Altadena's North Lake Avenue. None of the neighborhoods to the west \u2014 where all of the 17 confirmed fatalities occurred, as first reported by the Los Angeles Times \u2014 had received evacuation warnings or orders, despite house fires being reported there more than an hour earlier.",
      "Over the next three hours, fire crews would go from begging for resources on the eastern flank of the blaze to radioing the command center to make sure it knew the fire was spreading west along the foothills near Sunset Ridge.",
      "Just before 3:30 a.m., evacuation orders expanded significantly, with residents in 12 areas of Altadena and elsewhere told to \u201cleave now.\u201d",
      "Jodi and Jeff Moreno first heard about the fire from a neighborhood app. But the first official warning only came around 2:30 a.m., when authorities yelled through a bullhorn to evacuate. The couple grabbed their three daughters, their dog and some important papers, and fled.",
      "There were no text alerts until after they were gone.",
      "\u201cOn the neighborhood apps, some people were going, some people were staying. It was a wide variety of responses. We were navigating it on our own,\u201d Jodi Moreno said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for us to gauge where exactly is that fire, where are the embers blowing. ... Those are things I would rely on people who are monitoring it\u201d for information.",
      "Desperate for more information, both the Morenos and Lee downloaded the Watch Duty app, which maps evacuation zones and consolidates information from multiple sources into a single stream. Launched in 2021 and today covering 22 states, it became a lifeline for them.",
      "\u201cThe ideal system for warning people is informing them, right?\u201d said Nick Russell, vice president for operations at Watch Duty.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s certainly diligence necessary in the execution of official evacuation warning and orders or shelter in place, whatever the condition might be,\u201d he said. \"But telling people why that discussion is taking place between law enforcement and fire is important. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d",
      "The process of issuing evacuation notices starts with firefighters or other personnel on the ground recommending action, Russell said. It then moves up the chain of command to sheriffs, who ultimately put out any order.",
      "During major emergencies that communication can be hampered by issues such as limited radio connectivity, wind noise or other technical problems. Incident command stations may have trouble synthesizing the large amounts of information they are getting from different agencies, something that is critical for understanding the scope of an emergency like a fire.",
      "In Los Angeles County, residents who sign up for emergency notifications through the AlertLACounty website are then directed to a list of 57 links to other specific neighborhood or city alert system signups, as well as a general one covering 19 other cities. The city of Los Angeles and the Sheriff's Department also have alert systems.",
      "It is not clear how the overlapping systems, which use different software programs, work together, or whether officials coordinate.",
      "A 2024 Hazard Mitigation plan directed the city's Emergency Management Department to assess gaps in alert and warning systems in areas with poor cellphone connectivity and then implement a solution to ensure alerts reach people. But that goal was given a \u201cmedium\u201d priority level and a long-term timeline, with completion expected sometime in the next 10 years.",
      "Meanwhile the county's Hazard Mitigation Plan, last updated in 2020, did not include a focus on emergency alerts or public notifications. Instead its high-priority goals had to do with educating people about wind's impact on wildfire risk and with community wildfire protection.",
      "Officials at the County\u2019s Coordinated Joint Information Center declined to comment other than to say that an independent review of evacuations and emergency notifications is planned and the Office of Emergency Management, County Fire Department and Sheriff\u2019s Department plan to fully engage with it."

      "New results from a national exam find that America\u2019s children have continued to lose ground on reading skills in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and have made little improvement in math",
      "WASHINGTON -- America\u2019s children have continued to lose ground on reading skills in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and have made little improvement in math, according to the latest results of an exam known as the nation\u2019s report card.",
      "The findings are yet another setback for U.S. schools and reflect the myriad challenges that have upended education, from pandemic school closures to a youth mental health crisis and high rates of chronic absenteeism. The national exam results also show growing inequality: While the highest-performing students have started to regain lost ground, lower-performing students are falling further behind.",
      "Given every two years to a sample of America\u2019s children, the National Assessment of Educational Progress is considered one of the best gauges of the academic progress of the U.S. school system. The most recent exam was administered in early 2024 in every state, testing fourth- and eighth-grade students on math and reading.",
      "\u201cThe news is not good,\u201d said Peggy Carr, commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics, which oversees the assessment. \u201cWe are not seeing the progress we need to regain the ground our students lost during the pandemic.\u201d",
      "Among the few bright spots was an improvement in fourth grade math, where the average score ticked up 2 points on a scale of 500. It\u2019s still 3 points lower than the 2019 pre-pandemic average, yet some states and districts made significant strides, including in Washington, D.C., where the average score increased 10 points.",
      "For the most part, however, American schools have not yet begun to make progress.",
      "The average math score for eighth grade students was unchanged from 2022, while reading scores fell 2 points at both grade levels. One-third of eighth grade students scored below \u201cbasic\u201d in reading, more than ever in the history of the assessment.",
      "Students are considered below basic if they are missing fundamental skills. For example, eighth grade students who scored below basic in reading were typically unable to make a simple inference about a character's motivation after reading a short story, and some were unable to identify that the word \u201cindustrious\u201d means \u201cto be hard working.\u201d",
      "Especially alarming to officials was the divide between higher- and lower-performing students, which has grown wider than ever. Students with the highest scores outperformed their peers from two years ago, making up some ground lost during the pandemic. But the lowest performers are scoring even lower, falling further behind.",
      "It was most pronounced in eighth grade math: While the top 10% of students saw their scores increased by 3 points, the lowest 10% decreased by 6 points.",
      "That could reflect investments by families in high-performing students' recovery from the pandemic. \u201cFamilies that had the resources, they hired extra tutors, they got extra support to build on what was going on in the classroom,\" said Eric Mackey, superintendent of education in Alabama. \"Families that either could not afford that or didn't have the opportunity or resources for that continued to struggle.\u201d",
      "The latest setbacks follow a historic post-pandemic backslide in 2022. In that year's exam, student achievement fell across both subjects and grade levels, in some cases by unprecedented levels.",
      "This round of testing again featured students whose lives were disrupted by the pandemic. When COVID hit in 2020, the fourth graders were in kindergarten. The eighth graders were in fourth grade.",
      "But Carr said poor results can no longer be blamed solely on the pandemic, warning the nation's education system faces \u201ccomplex challenges.\u201d",
      "A survey done alongside the exam found in 2022 that fewer young students were reading for enjoyment, which is linked to lower reading scores. New survey results found students who are often absent from class \u2014 a persistent problem nationwide \u2014 are struggling the most.",
      "The results provide fresh fuel for a national debate over the impact of pandemic school closures, though they're unlikely to add clarity. Some studies have found that longer closures led to bigger academic setbacks. Those slower to reopen were often in urban and Democratic-led areas, while more rural and Republican-led areas were quicker.",
      "The new results don't show a \u201cdirect link\u201d on the topic, Carr said, though she said students clearly do better when they're in school.",
      "Among the states that saw reading scores fall in 2024 are Florida and Arizona, which were among the first to return to the classroom during the pandemic. Some big school systems that had longer closures made strides in fourth grade math, including Los Angeles and New York City.",
      "The success of big urban districts \u2014 14 of which saw notable improvement in fourth-grade math when the nation overall saw only minor gains \u2014 can be credited to academic recovery efforts funded by federal money, said Ray Hart, executive director of the Council of Great City Schools. Investing in efforts like intensive tutoring programs and curriculum updates is \u201creally proving to make a difference,\u201d he said.",
      "Pandemic-era changes in childhood outside the classroom may have impacted scores as well.",
      "\u201cWe should be looking at what social media and the rise of the screen-based childhood is doing for reading skills,\u201d said Marty West, academic dean at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.",
      "Parents should be reading with their kids, and listening to them read, Mackey said. \u201cWe are concerned that students are spending ... too much time on the phone and not enough time reading books,\u201d Mackey said.",
      "Even in school, West pointed out, students are reading and writing less. A majority of eighth graders last year said their teachers asked them to write several sentences about reading assignments fewer than six times a year.",
      "\u201cThere's no way around the fact that relationships, high-quality teachers and really engaging and high-expectation classrooms matter the most for kids,\u201d said Robin Lake, director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education.",
      "The U.S. Education Department said the results are \u201cheartbreaking\u201d and reflect an education system that's failing students despite billions of dollars in annual funding and more than $190 billion in federal pandemic relief.",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration is committed to reorienting our education system to fully empower states, to prioritize meaningful learning, and provide universal access to high-quality instruction,\u201d the department said in a statement. \"Change must happen, and it must happen now.\u201d",
      "Republicans in Congress were quick to blame former President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., chair of the House Education and Workforce Committee, said the decline is \u201cclearly a reflection of the education bureaucracy continuing to focus on woke policies rather than helping students learn.\u201d",
      "Compared with 2019 results, eighth grade reading scores are now down 8 points. Reading scores are down 5 points in both grades. And in fourth grade math, scores are down 3 points.",
      "Yet officials say there's reason to be optimistic. Carr highlighted improvement in Louisiana, where fourth grade reading is now back above pre-pandemic levels, and in Alabama, which accomplished that feat in fourth grade math.",
      "Carr was especially laudatory of Louisiana, where a campaign to improve reading proficiency resulted in both higher- and lower-performing students exceeding 2019 scores.",
      "She drew attention to the state's focus on the science of reading \u2014 a research-backed approach that focuses on teaching phonics, or the building blocks of words, as children build toward literacy. The concept has been embraced by both Republicans and Democrats and has been credited for gains in some states.",
      "\u201cI would not say that hope is lost, and I would not say that we cannot turn this around,\u201d Carr said. \u201cIt's been demonstrated that we can.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump has launched his second bid to oust all transgender troops from the military, and once again it will be headed to the courts to sort it out",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has launched his second bid to oust all transgender troops from the military, and once again it will be headed to the courts to sort it out.",
      "Although the new order will affect only a tiny fraction of America's 2.1 million service members, it has taken on oversized importance to Trump and his administration, who see transgender forces as a sign the military is \u201cwoke\u201d or not focused on training and winning wars.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, before he took the job, wrote in his book \u201cWar on Warriors\u201d that \u201cfor the recruits, for the military, and primarily for the security of the country, transgender people should never be allowed to serve. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d",
      "Trump's order to push out transgender troops, issued late Monday night, was instantly condemned by an array of activist groups as exceptionally egregious and ultimately harmful to military readiness. They say transgender people have been serving successfully for years, including openly on and off for the past decade.",
      "Here's a look at what it all means and the confusing duel over the ban for the past decade.",
      "Trump's order essentially says that anyone who is diagnosed with gender dysphoria \u2014 the unease someone has when their assigned sex and gender identity don\u2019t match \u2014 cannot serve in the military. It gives the defense secretary 60 days to update the medical standards for enlistment and re-enlistment to reflect that change. And it gives Hegseth 30 days to lay out how he plans to implement it all.",
      "According to the order, \u201cexpressing a false \u2018gender identity\u2019 divergent from an individual\u2019s sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\u201d It says the hormonal and surgical needs involved in taking on a different gender identity \u201cconflicts with a soldier\u2019s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle.\"",
      "It concludes that, \u201cA man\u2019s assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.\u201d",
      "The order also zeroes in on the heady bathroom issue.",
      "On his first day in office Trump issued an executive order that he said would \u201crestore biological truth\u201d to the federal government by eliminating the word \u201cgender\u201d and replacing it with \u201csex.\u201d He said the federal government will only recognize people based on their sex at the time of conception based on their \u201creproductive cell.\u201d",
      "His latest order expands on that, saying the military will \u201cneither allow males to use or share sleeping, changing, or bathing facilities designated for females, nor allow females to use or share sleeping, changing, or bathing facilities designated for males.\u201d",
      "The Pentagon has said in recent years that it is impossible to count the total number of transgender troops. The military services say there is no way to track them and that much information is limited due to medical privacy laws.",
      "Estimates have hovered between 9,000 and 12,000. But it will be very difficult for officials to identify them, even as service members worry about the hunt to root them out.",
      "\u201cThis casts an enormous shadow on people that are getting ready to go on a deployment for six months overseas or, you know, getting ready to go on a combat mission,\u201d said Sasha Buchert, counsel for Lambda Legal. \u201cThis is going to be extremely disruptive. And they\u2019re going to have to look over their shoulder in fear of when the next shoe will fall.\u201d",
      "Since transgender troops have been able to serve openly for a number of years, it\u2019s possible their fellow unit members or commanders know who some of them are. That triggers worries about people identifying them in order to get them pushed out \u2014 and raises parallels to the Clinton administration's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, which allowed gays to serve in the military as long as they didn't \u201ctell.\u201d",
      "In March 2018, then-Defense Secretary James Mattis released a memo with unprecedented details on the number of transgender forces and how many of them had sought mental health help or were planning to seek surgery.",
      "It said, at that time, there were 8,980 service members who identified themselves as transgender, and 937 had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. The report said data collected by the military health system revealed that 424 of those service members diagnosed had gotten treatment plans approved and for at least 36 of them those plans didn't include \u201ccross sex hormone therapy or sex reassignment surgery.\u201d",
      "In 2015, then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter broached the idea of lifting the ban on transgender troops and allowing them to serve openly, which raised concerns among military leaders. He set up a study, and then about a year later, in June 2016, announced the ban was ended.",
      "A year after that, just six months into his first presidential term, Trump suddenly announced via tweet he was not going to allow transgender people to serve in the military \u201cin any capacity.\u201d The tweets caught the Pentagon by surprise and plunged leaders into what became a roughly two-year struggle to hammer out the complex details of who would be affected by the ban and how it would work, even as legal challenges poured in.",
      "By March 2019, as courts ruled against the ban, the Pentagon laid out a policy that allowed those currently serving to continue with plans for hormone treatments and gender transition if they had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. But it barred new enlistments of anyone with gender dysphoria who was taking hormones or had transitioned to another gender. And it said in the future those diagnosed with gender dysphoria must \u201cserve in their birth gender\u201d and were barred from taking hormones or getting transition surgery.",
      "Soon after President Joe Biden took office in 2021, he overturned Trump's ban and the Pentagon also announced it would cover transition medical expenses for troops.",
      "The chiefs of all four military services told members of Congress in 2018 they were seeing few problems as transgender troops began serving openly.",
      "The Navy chief at the time, Adm. John Richardson, said the Navy was dealing with the issue the same way it handled the integration of women sailors on submarines.",
      "And the Marine commandant then, Gen. Robert Neller, said there were no unit cohesion or discipline problems. His only concern, he told a Senate committee, was that some commanders were saying they had to spend \u201ca lot of time\u201d with transgender people as they worked through medical requirements involving their transition to their preferred gender.",
      "Sarah Klimm, a transgender Marine who served for 23 years, retired just as the end to the ban was announced in 2016, so was never able to serve openly.",
      "\u201dTrans military members that are out there right now are dropping bombs, pulling triggers, fixing all the weapons systems,\u201d she said Tuesday. \u201cAnd now you\u2019re looking to keep them away.\u201d",
      "Klimm, who is now a policy analyst for Minority Veterans of America, said it\u2019s an especially precarious time to remove thousands of service members as recruiting has been a struggle.",
      "Emily Shilling, who has been openly transgender since 2019, is currently serving as a commander in the Navy with more than 19 years of service, including as a combat pilot who flew 60 missions in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.",
      "\u201cI just want to continue serving my country, using the skills this nation invested in me as a fighter pilot and leader,\u201d she said, stressing that she was speaking in her personal capacity. \"For nearly two decades, I\u2019ve upheld the highest standards of excellence, leading teams in combat and peace. All I ask is the opportunity to keep using my training and experience to serve this country with honor, courage and dedication.\u201d",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 22:50:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Florida lawmakers have passed a sweeping immigration bill, setting aside half a billion dollars in public funds to help carry out President Donald Trump&rsquo;s crackdown on people in the country illegally",
    "story": [
      "Florida lawmakers have passed a sweeping immigration bill, setting aside half a billion dollars in public funds to help carry out President Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on people in the country illegally",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida lawmakers passed a sweeping immigration bill Tuesday, setting aside half a billion dollars in public funds to help carry out President Donald Trump 's crackdown on those in the country illegally.",
      "In a state where roughly one in every five residents is an immigrant, the legislation would require every level of government \u2014 as well as government contractors \u2014 to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement \u201cto the fullest extent possible.\u201d",
      "Following more than four hours of deliberations on Tuesday, Florida's Republican-dominated Legislature passed the measure largely along party lines. The passage sets up a showdown between Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and state legislative leaders, who have sparred over whose proposals would better carry out Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown. DeSantis has called the bill \u201cweak.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe whole goal of this bill is to help President Trump do his job,\u201d said Republican Sen. Gruters, one of the bill sponsors and a Trump ally who said he spoke with the president while shepherding the measure. \u201cHe wants maximum coordination with local government.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers pushed the 80-plus page bill \u2014 titled the Tackling and Reforming Unlawful Migration Policy, or TRUMP Act \u2014 through in a special session, when it's harder for the public to engage in the legislative process. Republican lawmakers filed the bill after rejecting immigration proposals by DeSantis, a rebuke to the lame duck governor who was once floated as Trump's successor.",
      "Notably, one Republican in the House and six in the Senate voted against the measure, leaving the bill short of a veto-proof majority.",
      "\u201cI appreciate the attempt,\u201d said Republican Sen. Blaise Ingoglia, an ally of the governor. \u201cI cannot vote for this because it is nowhere near strong enough for my taste.\"",
      "Ahead of the floor debate on Tuesday, Senate President Ben Albritton and House Speaker Daniel Perez announced additional provisions, after they \u201crequested and received technical assistance from the Trump Administration\u201d, the leaders said.",
      "The amendments included enhancing penalties for all crimes committed in the state by people in the country illegally, and requires that those convicted of capital offenses receive the death penalty. But the Republican sponsors declined to include some of DeSantis' provisions, like restrictions on people in the country illegally sending money overseas and a measure that would have created a legal presumption that people in the country illegally are a flight risk.",
      "Now DeSantis must weigh whether to sign a proposal he's bashed in public as \u201ctoothless\u201d and \u201cwatered-down\" or veto it. He could also decline to sign the bill, allowing it to become law.",
      "The measure passed by lawmakers Tuesday would create a new state immigration enforcement office with more than 140 employees under the direction of a newly minted chief immigration officer, a post to be taken by the state's commissioner of agriculture, and would cede emergency immigration enforcement powers from the governor to the state immigration officer.",
      "The bill allocates $100 million for grants to local law enforcement agencies for training, equipment and reimbursement for leasing detention facilities to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It allocates another $375 million to fund the state's cooperation with the federal government, including efforts related to a program that deputizes local law enforcement for duties typically performed by ICE agents. It also sets aside $25 million to give $1,000 bonuses to local law enforcement officers who cooperate with the federal government.",
      "Democrats repeatedly pressed the bill sponsors on the language requiring government employees to \u201ccooperate to the fullest extent possible\u201d with federal immigration enforcement.",

      "Gruters said the bill is aimed at requiring more cooperation from local officials running jails and detention facilities, not \u201cstreet-level\u201d enforcement. But he acknowledged that could change with federal priorities.",
      "The bill would also repeal a decade-old state law allowing Florida students who are in the country without legal permission to qualify for in-state tuition at public colleges and universities, which as of the 2023-2024 fiscal year benefitted about 6,500 students. In a sign of how much the state's immigration politics have changed in recent years, the tuition measure was sponsored in 2014 by the state's now-lieutenant governor, a Republican from Miami.",
      "\u201cI implore you today to remember the haunting yet challenging words of our lieutenant governor when she said, 'It's the right thing to do',\" Democratic Sen. Darryl Rouson told his colleagues on the Senate floor. \"And what has changed since then except an attitude towards immigrants?\u201d",
      "Democratic Rep. Jose Alvarez, who was born in Cuba and was brought the U.S. by his parents, was more forceful.",
      "\u201cYou all should be ashamed of yourself,\" he told lawmakers during a hearing on the bill, adding \"This is not what this country was meant for.\u201d",
      "The provision empowering the state's agriculture commissioner as chief immigration officer has rankled DeSantis, who said \u201cit\u2019s almost like the fox guarding the hen house\u201d because the agriculture industry hasn\u2019t \u201cbeen known for immigration enforcement.\u201d",

      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- A U.S. Air Force pilot was reported to be safe after a single-seat F-35 fighter jet crashed Tuesday during a training exercise at a base in Alaska.",
      "The pilot experienced an \u201cinflight malfunction\u201d but was able to eject from the aircraft, Col. Paul Townsend, commander of the 354th Fighter Wing, told a news conference. The plane crashed during the landing phase of the flight at Eielson Air Force Base, he said.",
      "The pilot had declared an inflight emergency prior to the crash and was in stable condition and being evaluated at a medical facility, he said.",
      "The crash, which occurred early Tuesday afternoon, caused significant damage to the aircraft, the Air Force said in a statement.",

      "Eielson was selected in 2016 to host 54 F-35s, spawning an expansion that cost more than a half-billion dollars that was to include 36 new buildings and dozens of housing units. The expansion included about 3,500 new active duty airmen and their dependents.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has heard competing testimony over a request to block the nation's fourth execution using nitrogen gas",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- The state of Alabama urged a federal judge Tuesday to allow the nation's fourth execution with nitrogen gas to proceed next week, but a doctor who witnessed an earlier execution by the new method told the judge the inmate appeared to be in distress and awake minutes longer than officials predicted.",
      "Alabama has carried out all three of the nation's executions using the gas and has set a Feb. 6 execution date for Demetrius Terrence Frazier, 52. But attorneys for Frazier, who was convicted of the 1991 rape and murder of a woman in Birmingham, sought the hearing asking the court to intervene.",
      "Frazier\u2019s attorneys urged the judge to block the execution unless the state makes changes to its protocol, such as giving the inmate the same sedative used at the start of lethal injections before the gas begins flowing. Separately Tuesday, Frazier's mother and death penalty opponents asked Michigan's governor to bring Frazier back there to finish a life sentence in the state for a separate murder conviction in the killing of a 14-year-old girl. Michigan has no death penalty.",
      "Alabama's method involves placing a respirator gas mask over the face to replace breathable air with pure nitrogen gas, causing death by lack of oxygen. The state maintained Tuesday that the method brings swift death.",
      "Dylan L. Mauldin, assistant solicitor general for Alabama, called Frazier\u2019s legal maneuver a tactic to delay his execution and said the court should deny his request for a preliminary injunction. Mauldin noted the U.S. Supreme Court has never ruled the method unconstitutional.",
      "Meanwhile, a lawyer for Frazier, argued that inmates executed with the gas appeared to be conscious for some minutes, instead of the 30 to 40 seconds he said the state predicted.",
      "U.S. District Judge Emily Marks questioned Frazier\u2019s attorney about why she should intervene when the courts have previously let nitrogen executions go forward.",
      "\u201cSomething is going wrong. Every inmate who has been executed by nitrogen gas has exhibited signs of consciousness beyond the 40 seconds,\u201d Spencer Hahn, an attorney for Frazier, responded.",
      "Dr. Brian McAlary, an anesthesiologist who witnessed the November execution of Carey Dale Grayson, testified that he observed clear \u201cevidence of distress\u201d in the prisoner. He noted Grayson moved his head back and forth, had rapid eye movements and struggled against his restraints.",
      "McAlary said he believed Grayson\u2019s last voluntary movement occurred after about three minutes when he simultaneously raised both legs and held them in the air before letting them fall down. McAlary said he believed the movement was voluntary because \u201cboth legs were moved at exactly the same time, direction and distance.\u201d",
      "The testimony was the first time a medical doctor had testified about observations during a nitrogen execution. The court was previously given news accounts from journalists and the observations of prison staff.",
      "Dr. Joseph Antognini, an anesthesiologist hired by the state as an expert witness, gave competing testimony that such movements did not necessarily indicate Grayson was conscious. Antognini did not witness Grayson\u2019s execution.",
      "\u201cMovement can happen in the absence of pain,\u201d Antognini said. He gave examples of instances when he saw patients move involuntarily during surgery while unconscious. But he acknowledged he had never seen movements like a double leg lift during surgery.",
      "Frazier was in the courtroom throughout, shackled and taking notes in handcuffs on a legal pad.",
      "Alabama Corrections Commissioner John Hamm testified that Grayson was combative at the start of his execution, cursing the warden and raising his middle fingers as he was strapped to the gurney. Hamm testified that he thought Grayson\u2019s head movements were an effort to knock the mask loose.",
      "Frazier's supporters had also argued he should be in a Michigan prison instead of Alabama's death row.",
      "Frazier was first convicted in Michigan and sentenced to life in prison for the 1992 murder of a 14-year-old girl. Prosecutors said Frazier while in police custody in Michigan, confessed to raping and shooting Brown in Alabama after stealing about $80 from her purse. He was convicted in Alabama and given the death penalty. The then governors of Alabama and Michigan agreed in 2011 to place him on Alabama's death row.",
      "Frazier's attorneys had filed a separate appeal to have him sent to Michigan to finish his life sentence there but dropped the request after Michigan\u2019s attorney general wrote in a court filing that Michigan doesn't seek his return.",
      "Death penalty opponents and Frazier\u2019s mother made a last-minute plea to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to intervene and request that Frazier be sent back to Michigan.",
      "\u201cPlease bring my son back to Michigan. Please don't let Alabama kill my son if you can stop it,\u201d Carol Frazier wrote in the letter to Whitmer.",
      "Whitmer\u2019s office declined to comment.",

      "The department's accusation that the move may violate of Title IX, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, appears to be unprecedented, and it marks a sharp departure from the department's investigations under former President Joe Biden.",
      "The Democrat's administration interpreted Title IX to include LGBTQ+ protections, though the policy was later overturned by a federal judge.",
      "\u201cLet me be clear: it is a new day in America, and under President Trump, (the Office for Civil Rights) will not tolerate discrimination of any kind,\u201d said Craig Trainor, the acting assistant secretary for civil rights, in a news release.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration announced Tuesday that it is offering buyouts to all federal employees who opt to leave their jobs by next week \u2014 an unprecedented move to shrink the U.S. government at breakneck speed.",
      "A memo from the Office of Personnel Management, the government\u2019s human resources agency, also said it would begin subjecting all federal employees to \u201cenhanced standards of suitability and conduct\u201d and ominously warned of future downsizing. The email sent to millions of employees said those who leave their posts voluntarily will receive about eight months of salary, but they have to choose to do so by Feb. 6.",
      "President Donald Trump has built a political career around promising to disrupt Washington, and vowed that his second administration would go far further in shaking up traditional political norms than his first did. Still, the repercussions of so many government workers being invited to leave their jobs were difficult to calculate.",
      "Katie Miller, who serves on an advisory board to the Department of Government Efficiency, a special Trump administration department headed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and tasked with shrinking the size of government, posted on X, \u201cThis email is being sent to more than TWO MILLION federal employees.\u201d",
      "The federal government employed more than 3 million people as of November last year, which accounted for nearly 1.9% of the nation\u2019s entire civilian workforce, according to the Pew Research Center. The average tenure for a federal employee is nearly 12 years, according to a Pew analysis of data from OPM.",
      "Even a fraction of the workforce accepting buyouts could send shockwaves through the economy and trigger widespread disruptions throughout society as a whole, triggering wide-ranging \u2014 and as yet unknowable \u2014 implications for the delivery, timeliness and effectiveness of federal services across the nation.",
      "Untold numbers of front-line health workers in the Veterans Affairs Department, officials who process loans for homebuyers or small businesses, and contractors who help procure the next generation of military weaponry could all head for the exits at once. It could also mean losing experienced food inspectors and scientists who test the water supply \u2014 while disrupting everything from air travel and consumer product protections.",
      "In response, American Federation of Government Employees union President Everett Kelley said it should not be viewed as voluntary buyouts, but pressuring workers not considered loyal to the new administration to vacate their jobs.",
      "\u201cPurging the federal government of dedicated career federal employees will have vast, unintended consequences that will cause chaos for the Americans who depend on a functioning federal government,\u201d Kelley said in a statement. \"Between the flurry of anti-worker executive orders and policies, it is clear that the Trump administration\u2019s goal is to turn the federal government into a toxic environment where workers cannot stay even if they want to.\u201d",
      "In its emailed memo detailing its plan, OPM lists four directives that it says Trump is mandating for the federal workforce going forward \u2014 including that most workers return to their offices full-time.",
      "\u201cThe substantial majority of federal employees who have been working remotely since Covid will be required to return to their physical offices five days a week,\u201d it reads. That echoes Trump, who said of federal employees over the weekend: \u201cYou have to go to your office and work. Otherwise you\u2019re not going to have a job.\u201d",
      "The memo also says Trump \u201cwill insist on excellence at every level,\u201d and while some parts of the government's workforce may increase under his administration, \u201cThe majority of federal agencies are likely to be downsized.\"",
      "Finally, it says, the \u201dfederal workforce should be comprised of employees who are reliable, loyal, trustworthy, and who strive for excellence in their daily work.\"",
      "\u201cEmployees will be subject to enhanced standards of suitability and conduct as we move forward,\u201d the memo reads.",
      "The emailed message includes a \u201cdeferred resignation letter\u201d for federal employees to begin leaving their posts.",
      "\u201cIf you resign under this program, you will retain all pay and benefits regardless of your daily workload and will be exempted from all applicable in-person work requirements until September 30,\u201d it says.",
      "The email even includes instructions on how to accept, stating: \"If you wish to resign: Select \u2018Reply\u2019 to this email. You must reply from your government account.\" It adds: \u201cType the word \u2018Resign' into the body of this email and hit \u2018send.\u2019\"",
      "Meanwhile, OPM has released guidance for an executive order Trump signed on the first day of his second term known as \u201cSchedule Career/Policy.\u201d It replaces Schedule F, an order Trump signed late in his first term that sought to reclassify thousands of federal employees and make them political appointees without the same job security protections.",
      "President Joe Biden rescinded Trump\u2019s Schedule F order almost immediately upon taking office in 2021, and under his administration, OPM issued a new rule last year designed to make it more difficult to fire many federal employees.",
      "That move was seen as a safeguard against using a new Schedule F order to help carry out the key goals of Project 2025, a sweeping plan by a conservative Washington think tank to dismiss large swaths of the federal workforce in favor of more conservative alternatives while also cutting back on the overall size of government.",

      "The founder of a Florida-based neo-Nazi group is on trial for conspiring to attack Maryland\u2019s power grid",
      "BALTIMORE -- As the founder of a Florida-based neo-Nazi group goes on trial for conspiring to attack Maryland\u2019s power grid, his abhorrent beliefs aren\u2019t really the point, federal prosecutors said Tuesday.",
      "They said it is his willingness to act on those beliefs that jurors must consider during the trial, which is expected to last about two weeks in Baltimore federal court.",
      "Brandon Russell, 29, encouraged his then-girlfriend, Sarah Beth Clendaniel, to carry out the power grid attack, hoping to cause chaos in furtherance of their shared white supremacist views, according to prosecutors. The two were arrested in February 2023 \u2014 before their plans were executed.",
      "\u201cMr. Russell was at war. He was at war for his race, the white race,\u201d prosecutor Michael Aubin said during opening arguments Tuesday afternoon.",
      "According to prosecutors, the pair was planning a series of \u201csniper attacks\u201d on electrical substations around Baltimore that could have caused significant damage to the regional power grid. Their goal was to create chaos in the majority-Black city and ultimately spur a \u201crace war,\u201d prosecutors say.",
      "But Russell\u2019s defense attorney argued his participation in the plot was minimal, calling the case \u201ca setup from the very beginning.\u201d While downplaying Russell\u2019s role, attorney Ian Goldstein pinned the conspiracy on Clendaniel and a confidential informant she connected with through Russell.",
      "Clendaniel, 36, pleaded guilty to plotting the attack and was sentenced in September to 18 years in prison.",
      "Russell appeared in court Tuesday wearing a light blue jacket and glasses. He conferred regularly with his attorney, looking cheerful and engaged.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t put people in jail for their beliefs or the things they say,\u201d said Goldstein, who also called his client\u2019s views \u201crepulsive to most people.\u201d",
      "Russell apparently wasn\u2019t on law enforcement\u2019s radar until police responded to a 2017 double homicide at a Tampa apartment building and found him outside crying, dressed in military fatigues. One of his roommates had killed the other two, officials said.",
      "Police concluded Russell had nothing to do with the deadly shootings. But while detectives investigated, they discovered a stash of highly explosive materials and a cache of neo-Nazi signs, posters, books and flags. Russell was in the Florida National Guard at the time and had attended the University of South Florida.",
      "Investigators said Russell co-founded the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division, which is German for \u201catomic weapon.\u201d They found flyers in his possession that said, \u201cDon\u2019t prepare for exams, prepare for a race war.\u201d Russell also kept a framed photo of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh in his room and read books like \u201cMein Kampf\u201d and \u201cThe Turner Diaries,\u201d both reading staples of white supremacist extremists.",
      "Devon Arthurs, who later pleaded guilty to killing his roommates, told detectives he shot them for teasing him about his recent conversion to Islam. He also said it was to thwart a terrorist attack by Atomwaffen and claimed Russell had materials in the house \u201cto kill civilians and target locations like power lines, nuclear reactors, and synagogues,\u201d prosecutors said.",
      "Goldstein also represented Russell in that case, when the attorney argued that possessing explosives didn\u2019t mean Russell intended to use them to cause harm. Goldstein said his client was traumatized by the deaths of his roommates and already suffered from mental health issues. Family members said Russell was just a follower looking for community and trying to please his friends.",
      "Russell ultimately pleaded guilty to possession of an unregistered destructive device and improper storage of explosive materials. He was sentenced in 2018 to serve five years in prison. During the sentencing hearing, a federal judge in Tampa expressed explicit concern that Russell could fall in with the wrong crowd behind bars.",
      "Several years later, federal investigators discovered his relationship with Clendaniel.",
      "She and Russell began exchanging letters around 2018 while they were incarcerated in different facilities. They developed a romantic relationship that continued after they were released from prison, court records show.",
      "Clendaniel\u2019s defense attorney argued that her abusive childhood and adolescent struggles with addiction made her acutely vulnerable to the influence of people like Russell and other white supremacists. She spent hours on the phone with a confidential informant, discussing how she would obtain a gun and shoot at five electrical substations situated in a ring around Baltimore, according to prosecutors.",
      "When given a chance to address the court during her sentencing hearing last year, Clendaniel affirmed her racist ideology: \u201cIt\u2019s true, your honor, I do still hold National Socialist beliefs,\u201d she said in September.",
      "But she claimed there was a line she wouldn\u2019t cross by acting on them. She said she was struggling with severe mental and physical health problems when she participated in the plot, including a diagnosis of kidney failure that she believed was terminal.",
      "During Russell\u2019s trial Tuesday, his attorney pointed to Clendaniel\u2019s mental state as evidence she had been desperate enough to carry out the attack. Russell, meanwhile, was \u201cmany miles away\u201d in Orlando with no plans to travel to Maryland and help, Goldstein argued."

      "HONOLULU -- A fifth person has died from injuries suffered during a massive explosion of illegal fireworks at a Honolulu home over New Year's that prompted Hawaii authorities to reevaluate how they enforce the state's fireworks laws, police said Tuesday.",
      "The 29-year-old man was one of six people flown to a hospital in Arizona for treatment earlier this month because Hawaii's only burn care facility hit capacity with other patients from the same blast.",
      "The Maricopa County medical examiner's office identified him as Kevin Vallesteros. The office has not yet determined his cause and manner of death. Honolulu police said he died Tuesday morning.",
      "The explosion also killed a 3-year-old boy and three women and injured more than 20 people.",
      "The blast set off fresh calls for a crackdown on illegal fireworks that have become increasingly more common in Hawaii. Contraband explosives rock neighborhoods year-round, but grow in frequency around the year-end holidays and Lunar New Year, which is celebrated on Wednesday this year.",
      "Hawaii Gov. Josh Green proposed imposing $300 tickets that police could issue to those who shoot off fireworks and potential class A felony charges and decades in prison for those whose use of fireworks leads to serious injury or death. The state Department of Law Enforcement has asked the Legislature for $5.2 million to hire eight people and expand a forensic lab to counter rampant fireworks smuggling.",
      "Lawmakers were expected to consider these measures during the current legislative session ending in May.",
      "Hawaii authorities have said existing laws are difficult to enforce, in part because the evidence is often incinerated when fireworks are lit. Residents are also often reluctant to testify against their neighbors, making cases difficult to prove in court. Police wouldn't need to collect evidence to issue the $300 citations Green proposed and a police officer could serve as a witness.",

      "There were plenty of numbers in the speech.",
      "But the one number that matters above all here is 156 - the size of the PM's majority. The chancellor's speech communicated that she will deploy that near total executive power to flatten the sort of opposition that has prevented or critically delayed these sorts of plans in the past.",
      "Indeed, I understand that the cautious, even lukewarm response from Heathrow so far, has been countered in meetings with government with a promise that they will indeed use that bumper majority.",
      "Farmers noisily protested after the Budget changes to inheritance tax. There will be many more groups with placards beeping their horns outside airports and in the Fens, if this agenda is actually delivered. In many ways that is an early test of the government's seriousness of trying to transform investment in the country.",
      "Short-term pain",
      "The other test is how visible and how quickly changes will materialise. Ministers say especially in the Oxford-Cambridge Silicon Valley of Europe plan, this will be seen within the parliament.",
      "But that hoped-for long term gain has been built on some short-term pain in the economy. Consumer and business confidence fell around the Budget decisions. The chancellor has indicated there will be further tough decisions on welfare and benefits as the government aims to cut back the ballooning costs of supporting people out of work or in work but also receiving benefits.",
      "Businesses in hospitality and retail are bearing a disproportionate burden of the Budget tax rises. From April they will pay more in national insurance as well as a higher minimum wage. Runways in west London, and laboratories in Oxford may not compensate those businesses.",
      "The other big challenge here is just how nimble the government is going to be. The government's AI strategy released earlier this month might already have been overtaken by events in Hangzhou at DeepSeek. Will all these data centres that Reeves has planned now actually be needed? Strategies for industry, infrastructure and trade are also now on the way.",
      "Timing here is everything. The question is whether the fruits of long-term growth will come through quickly enough."

      "Boeing lost nearly a billion dollars a month in 2024, as it grappled with a safety crisis, quality control issues and a damaging strike.",
      "The aerospace giant lost $11.8bn across the year, its worst result since 2020, when the aviation industry was grounded by the Covid pandemic.",
      "In the three months to the end of December, when strikes were affecting the business, it lost $3.8bn.",

      "Chief executive Kelly Ortberg said the company was focused on what he called the \"fundamental changes\" needed to restore its fortunes and restore trust.",
      "Boeing has had a dreadful year by any measure. In January 2024, a door panel fell off a brand new 737 Max shortly after take-off, leaving a gaping hole in the side of the plane. Investigators said it had not been bolted on properly.",
      "The incident highlighted serious quality control failings at the company \u2013 and at its main supplier, Spirit Aerosystems. It also reignited concerns about Boeing's attitude towards safety.",

      "It also delayed the entry into service of the 777X. A new version of the long-haul workhorse, it was already years late but had been expected to start operating in 2025. It will not now carry passengers until 2026.",
      "In total, Boeing delivered 348 commercial aircraft last year. Its great rival Airbus delivered 766.",
      "Problems at Boeing's defence business have been less visible, but no less damaging. The unit lost more than $5bn, largely thanks to rising costs on fixed price military contracts.",

      "The government is proposing to ease restrictions on how some pension schemes are managed, as part of efforts to boost economic growth.",
      "The Treasury said defined benefit pension schemes have a total surplus of \u00a3160bn, but under current rules much of the money is trapped and cannot be invested in the wider economy.",
      "The government has made improving growth its main priority in order to boost living standards, but recent figures indicate the economy is struggling to expand.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told company bosses on Tuesday that the government's \"growth mission\" would be the key factor behind policy decisions.",
      "Sir Keir was speaking after he and Chancellor Rachel Reeves met bosses of firms including Tesco, BT and Unilever as part of their efforts to get more investment to the UK.",
      "The meeting came ahead of a speech by Reeves on Wednesday where she is expected to focus on measures to boost growth amid speculation the government will back a third runway at Heathrow Airport.",
      "Sir Keir said he was \"hard-wiring growth into all the decisions of the cabinet\".",
      "He said he would not speculate about Heathrow, but added: \"What I will say is that growth is the number one priority, wealth creation, making sure that people are better off.",
      "\"Of course, we also have climate commitments, but growth is really important too.\"",
      "'No easy routes' to growth, Reeves tells Labour MPs",
      "Reeves hints at support for Heathrow expansion",
      "On Monday, the chancellor told Labour MPs there were \"no easy routes\" to economic growth. She added ministers must start saying \"yes\" to new projects and go \"further and faster\" to boost the economy.",
      "Official figures show that between July and September the economy had zero growth and the latest monthly figure for November showed just a small uptick.",
      "The consultation on pensions reform hopes to unlock billions of pounds within certain defined benefit schemes for alternative use in the economy, the pension schemes or the company.",
      "The previous Conservative government launched a similar consultation last year.",
      "Defined benefit pensions, sometimes known as a final salary scheme, are directly linked to a worker's salary and length of service.",
      "Three-quarters of the funds that pay out these pensions are in surplus - which means they effectively have more money in them than needed to meet those pension payments.",
      "However, just a few years ago, many schemes were in deficit when interest rates were lower - prompting some companies to reduce their pension offer, and a reversal could occur again.",
      "'Bit of a damp squib'",
      "Some pensions experts have warned there are risks around redeploying surplus funds, but The Pensions Regulator (TPR) has expressed its support for the government's plans.",
      "\"Where schemes are fully funded and there are protections in place for members, we support efforts to help trustees and employers consider how to safely release surplus if it can improve member benefits or unlock investment in the wider economy,\" said Nausicaa Delfas, chief executive of TPR.",
      "Many of these pension schemes are closed, so are invested relatively safely in order to ensure they meet their obligations to members, when no extra contributions are coming in.",
      "Pension scheme trustees would need to agree that releasing money will not put members' pensions at danger.",
      "There is no guarantee that companies would use the money to invest - a move that would require confidence in the wider outlook. That would need to happen at scale for economic growth to improve.",
      "Workers might also want the surplus to be used to improve the pension offer made to all staff - including those on more common defined contribution, rather than defined benefit, pensions.",
      "Independent pension consultant John Ralfe said the chancellor was looking for a \"quick win\" in her quest for growth, but doubted the latest proposed reforms would deliver it.",
      "\"The idea that there is a queue of companies waiting to do this is wishful thinking,\" he said, due to most firms looking to offload their pension liabilities altogether to specialist insurance companies.",
      "For those companies that do want to withdraw surpluses , they would need to agree changes with trustees, which would likely be \"long drawn-out process\",\" he added.",
      "\"It will all be a bit of a damp squib,\" Mr Ralfe said.",
      "Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, Daisy Cooper, said workers needed a \"cast iron guarantee\" from the government \" that none of these changes will put peoples pensions at risk, especially smaller pensions\".",
      "\"We also need guarantees that any unlocked funds will go to productive investment - not into shareholders' pockets,\" she added.",
      "The proposals follow plans announced last year by the chancellor to create pension \"megafunds\" by merging the UK's 86 council schemes, based on the model used in  Canada and Australia.",
      "The government has also suggested pension schemes need to reach a certain size or pool together. The idea behind this is that larger funds are cheaper to run and are more able to invest in UK infrastructure projects."

    "story": [
      "The speed at which the new Chinese AI app DeepSeek has shaken the technology industry, the markets and the bullish sense of American superiority in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has been nothing short of stunning.",
      "Venture capitalist Marc Andreessen may have said it best. \"DeepSeek-R1 is AI's Sputnik moment,\" he posted to X on Sunday, referring to the satellite which kicked off the space race.",
      "DeepSeek was the most downloaded free app on Apple's US App Store over the weekend. By Monday, the new AI chatbot had triggered a massive sell-off of major tech stocks which were in freefall as fears mounted over America's leadership in the sector.",
      "Shares of AI chip designer and recent Wall Street darling Nvidia, for example, had plunged by 17% by the time US markets closed on Monday. Or to put it in even starker terms, it lost nearly $600bn in market value which, according to Bloomberg, is the biggest drop in the history of the US stock market.",
      "This extraordinary, historic spooking can largely be attributed to something as simple as cost. And a claim by DeepSeek's developers which prompted serious questions in Silicon Valley.",
      "While ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has been haemorrhaging money - spending $5bn last year alone - DeepSeek's developers say it built this latest model for a mere $5.6m.",
      "That is a tiny fraction of the cost that AI giants like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic have relied on to develop their own models.",

      "EXPLAINED: What is DeepSeek and why did it cause stocks to drop?",
      "HANDS ON: Is DeepSeek as good as it seems?",
      "As this dramatic moment for the sector played out, there was a palpable silence in many corners of Silicon Valley when I contacted those who are usually happy to talk. Many observers, investors, and analysts appeared stunned.",
      "Some wondered if this marked a buying opportunity. Others questioned the information DeepSeek was providing.",
      "\"I still think the truth is below the surface when it comes to actually what's going on,\" veteran analyst Gene Munster told me on Monday. He questioned the financials DeepSeek is citing, and wondered if the startup was being subsidised or whether its numbers were correct.",
      "The chatbot is \"surprisingly good, which just makes it hard to believe\", he said.",
      "Regardless, DeepSeek's sudden arrival is a \"flex\" by China and a \"black eye for US tech,\" to use his own words.",
      "It was just last week, after all, that OpenAI's Sam Altman and Oracle's Larry Ellison joined President Donald Trump for a news conference that really could have been a press release.",
      "The event represented peak American bullishness on AI.",
      "They announced Stargate, a joint venture that promises up to $500bn in private investment for AI infrastructure: data centres in Texas and beyond, along with a promised 100,000 new jobs.",
      "The US seemed to think its abundant data centres and control over the highest-end chips gave it a commanding lead in AI, despite China's dominance in rare-earth metals and engineering talent.",
      "Some have even seen it as a foregone conclusion that America would dominate the AI race, despite some high-profile warnings from top executives who said the country's advantages should not be taken for granted.",
      "The US may still go on to command the sector, but there is a sense that DeepSeek has shaken some of that swagger.",
      "Trump's words after the Chinese app's sudden emergence in recent days were probably cold comfort to the likes of Altman and Ellison. He called this moment a \"wake-up call\" for the American tech industry, and said finding a way to do cheaper AI is ultimately a \"good thing\".",
      "It is also worth noting that it was not just tech stocks that took a beating on Monday. Energy stocks did too. DeepSeek's arrival on the scene has upended many assumptions we have long held about what it takes to develop AI.",
      "Maybe that nuclear renaissance - including firing up America's Three Mile Island energy plant once again - won't be needed. Maybe it does not take so much capital, compute, and power after all.",
      "For now, the future of semiconductor giants like Nvidia remains unclear.",
      "DeepSeek says its model was developed with existing technology along with open source software that can be used and shared by anybody for free.",
      "But WIRED reports that for years, DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfung's hedge fund High-Flyer has been stockpiling the chips that form the backbone of AI \u2013 known as GPUs, or graphics processing units.",
      "The company has said its models deployed H800 chips made by Nvidia. US policy restricting sales of higher-powered chips to China might get a second-look under the new Trump administration.",

      "\"We will obviously deliver much better models and also it's legit invigorating to have a new competitor!\" he wrote.",
      "It was Sputnik that truly ushered in the space age. There, too, the US was caught off guard. How its tech sector responds to this apparent surprise from a Chinese company will be interesting - and it may have added serious fuel to the AI race.",

    "summary": "Shell companies were used to charter the sanctioned oligarch\u2019s yachts to himself, evading VAT, BBC reveals.",
    "story": [
      "It was Christmas 2011, a year after Roman Abramovich had taken delivery of his new superyacht, Eclipse. But it seemed the oligarch would not be using it over the festive period - records show it had been chartered by a company based in the British Virgin Islands.",
      "And yet photographs from Christmas Day that year show Mr Abramovich in the Caribbean sunshine, standing on the swim platform at the rear of the yacht, with Eclipse's large letter-E logo behind him.",
      "Charter records such as this were part of a decade-long scheme to mislead tax authorities, now uncovered in an investigation by the BBC and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.",
      "The scheme falsely presented the Russian oligarch's fleet of yachts as a commercial leasing operation, to dodge millions of euros in VAT on their purchase and running costs.",
      "\"There has been tax evasion,\" Italian tax lawyer and professor Tommaso Di Tanno told the BBC. \"This is criminal.\"",
      "In a statement, lawyers for Mr Abramovich - who now reportedly divides his time between Istanbul, Tel Aviv and the Russian resort of Sochi - said he had \"always obtained independent expert professional tax and legal advice\" and \"acted in accordance\" with it.",
      "The billionaire, who was sanctioned by the UK in March 2022 over his connection to Vladimir Putin's regime, bought five luxury yachts over the course of the 2000s that were involved in the tax scheme.",
      "Among them was the 115m (377ft) Pelorus, which he reportedly lent to Chelsea footballer John Terry for his honeymoon in 2007 - and Eclipse, which at 162.5m (533ft) was once the largest private yacht in the world and worth an estimated $700m (\u00a3559m).",
      "The scheme to dodge tax on the yachts - and other secrets of the sanctioned oligarch's corporate empire - is laid bare in over 400,000 files and 72,000 emails leaked from a Cypriot corporate service provider, MeritServus.",
      "They show how MeritServus administered the oligarch's businesses through a global network of companies owned by a series of trusts of which Mr Abramovich was the beneficiary.",
      "The BBC and its media partners, including the Guardian, have been reporting on the leaked files since 2023 as part of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists' Cyprus Confidential investigation. We previously revealed Mr Abramovich's financial links to one of Mr Putin's closest associates, accused of holding the president's wealth.",
      "The files reveal how Mr Abramovich's advisers helped him avoid paying huge tax bills on the yachts' running costs in EU waters by using companies to hire them out to himself or other companies he controlled.",
      "Documents show how the five yachts were leased to a company in Cyprus called Blue Ocean Yacht Management, which chartered them on to a handful of companies in the British Virgin Islands that appeared independent - but which were all in fact controlled by Mr Abramovich.",
      "'Aware of the risks'",
      "The scheme to dodge VAT in Cyprus was set out in a revealing 2005 memorandum on the proposed \"Operating Structure\" for the management of Mr Abramovich's yachts.",
      "\"We want to avoid paying VAT on the purchase price of the yachts and where possible to avoid paying VAT on goods and services provided to the yachts,\" wrote the memo's author, Jonathan Holloway, then a director of Blue Ocean.",
      "Although Blue Ocean and the companies hiring the yachts were all owned by Mr Abramovich's trusts, they were intended to appear unconnected \"so that an investigator checking on our operation would see it as a legitimate structure\", Mr Holloway wrote in the memo he sent to some of Mr Abramovich's closest associates.",
      "Mr Holloway warned them they should be \"aware of the risks\". He wrote: \"We all have to recognise that a determined investigator could eventually discover this is an in-house structure with the possible consequences that would entail.\"",
      "Mr Holloway wrote that Blue Ocean, the companies to which it leased the yachts, and the ultimate \"customer\" should not have the same shareholders, directors or registered addresses, to avoid any \"common link\" that might arouse suspicion.",
      "As the memo noted, Mr Abramovich's lawyer had agreed to put the ownership of Blue Ocean into an entirely separate trust - apparently distancing it from the other companies.",
      "Sure enough, ownership of the yacht management company Blue Ocean was subsequently transferred from the oligarch's main trust to a new one, the Neptune Trust.",
      "'Hide the reality'",
      "The way Mr Abramovich's companies leased the yachts to each other, Prof Di Tanno told the BBC, was an \"artificial structure\" that evaded tax - a criminal offence.",
      "\"My conclusion is that in the case, there has been a tax evasion\u2026 because all the parties know exactly what to do in order to hide the reality,\" he said.",
      "Tax expert Rita de la Feria told the BBC she had seen in the yacht scheme \"indications\" that they \"may be misrepresenting information\".",
      "\"If that is the case, then we are now in the realm of evasion,\" she added.",
      "Mr Holloway, who stepped down as a director of Blue Ocean about 15 years ago, told the BBC that he \"joined Blue Ocean 20 years ago and was there for a relatively short period of time\".",
      "He said he had \"managed literally hundreds of vessels from many different locations around the world\". \"I can't be expected to remember the individual circumstances of every vessel I have ever managed,\" he said, adding that he \"used structures others in the industry were using\".",
      "Lawyers representing Mr Abramovich told the BBC he denied \"any allegation that he had any knowledge\" or was \"personally responsible\" or liable for \"any alleged deception of any government authority\" to evade tax.",
      "His lawyers said that just as Mr Abramovich sought professional legal and tax advice and acted on it, he expects that \"similar advice was sought at the relevant times by those with responsibility for the day-to-day running\" of the companies involved in the scheme.",
      "If this were a real superyacht leasing business, substantial profits might be expected. However Blue Ocean's accounts show that from 2005 to 2012, its expenses almost matched its income.",
      "This meant almost no corporation tax was due as the company's profits were tiny.",
      "A note from the Blue Ocean director suggests the close matching of expenses and income was no accident and the company would generate charters when the scheme needed to cover expenses.",
      "\"At the beginning of each week we will have a meeting in Blue Ocean where we will look at our current bank balances and our cash needs for the next 1~2 weeks [sic]. If we see a need for a cash injection we will raise an appropriate time charter and invoices,\" he wrote.",
      "There is also evidence in the leaked files that charter agreements were backdated. This includes a time charter agreement supposedly signed in July 2005 by Blue Ocean and another Abramovich company in the BVI called Eyke Services. However, records show Eyke Services did not exist at that point - it was not incorporated until a month later.",
      "In another case, a director of Blue Ocean requested the production of a backdated and signed time charter in order to obtain delivery of duty-free fuel for Mr Abramovich's 86m (282ft) yacht Ecstasea - which could accommodate 15 guests in eight suites - saving the billionaire $44,000 (\u00a335,000) in tax.",
      "In the documents, tax consultants from Deloitte in Cyprus wrote to Mr Holloway, the Blue Ocean director, saying if the ships were pleasure vessels, they would have to pay VAT. But if the vessels were classified as commercial, they would not.",
      "A leading superyacht lawyer Benjamin Maltby told the BBC the type of contracts used for many of Mr Abramovich's luxury yacht charters were actually designed for commercial ships carrying dry cargos such as grain or steel.",
      "This gives us more evidence that the whole commercial \"look\" of the operation was a sham.",
      "'Lawyers got onto it'",
      "Mr Abramovich's superyacht scheme came under legal scrutiny twice, with varying levels of success, the BBC and Bureau of Investigative Journalism has learned.",
      "Richard Bridge captained two of Mr Abramovich's yachts for almost six years from 2006 to 2012, including the Pelorus, and the giant Eclipse, the pride of Abramovich's fleet. A couple of years after he finished working for Mr Abramovich, the captain was stopped and questioned at Amsterdam's Schipol Airport.",
      "Italian prosecutors had started proceedings against three of Mr Abramovich's captains - including Mr Bridge - for unpaid excise duties on refuelling and tax evasion.",
      "But Mr Bridge told the BBC he had contacted Blue Ocean and \"their lawyers got onto it\", telling him a few months later the case had been dropped.",
      "Italian court records seen by the BBC show proceedings were halted after the lawyers \"produced documentation\" proving Pelorus was \"entered in the registers as a commercial boat as it is used for commercial purposes or for hire\".",
      "Mr Bridge said he was unaware Mr Abramovich also controlled the companies that were chartering the yachts.",
      "In Cyprus, tax officials were separately investigating Blue Ocean over up to \u20ac17m (\u00a314.3m) in unpaid VAT, disputing the company's claim to be \"zero-rated\" for VAT because it was a commercial operation.",
      "Blue Ocean's lawyers said demands to provide evidence the vessels had been used commercially by the companies chartering them were \"unreasonable and oppressive\", but they had asked its clients anyway and received no response.",
      "We now know that Blue Ocean's clients were, of course, Mr Abramovich's other companies.",
      "According to an appeal judgement in 2018, VAT investigators found Blue Ocean had failed to present any evidence the companies chartering the yachts were \"engaged in economic activity\" and its claim that the boats were used for commercial purposes was rejected.",
      "In the end, Cyprus pursued Blue Ocean for the lower figure of \u20ac14m (\u00a311.8m).",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 17:02:20 GMT",
    "summary": "A Chinese startup has built a low-cost AI model using less technologically advanced chips.",
    "story": [
      "A Chinese-made artificial intelligence (AI) model called DeepSeek has shot to the top of Apple Store's downloads, stunning investors and sinking some tech stocks.",
      "Its latest version was released on 20 January, quickly impressing AI experts before it got the attention of the entire tech industry - and the world.",
      "US President Donald Trump said it was a \"wake-up call\" for US companies who must focus on \"competing to win\".",
      "What makes DeepSeek so special is the company's claim that it was built at a fraction of the cost of industry-leading models like OpenAI - because it uses fewer advanced chips.",
      "That possibility caused chip-making giant Nvidia to shed almost $600bn (\u00a3482bn) of its market value on Monday - the biggest one-day loss in US history.",
      "DeepSeek also raises questions about Washington's efforts to contain Beijing's push for tech supremacy, given that one of its key restrictions has been a ban on the export of advanced chips to China.",
      "Beijing, however, has doubled down, with President Xi Jinping declaring AI a top priority. And start-ups like DeepSeek are crucial as China pivots from traditional manufacturing such as clothes and furniture to advanced tech - chips, electric vehicles and AI.",
      "So what do we know about DeepSeek?",
      "Be careful with DeepSeek, Australia says - so is it safe to use?",
      "DeepSeek vs ChatGPT - how do they compare?",
      "China's DeepSeek AI shakes industry and dents America's swagger",
      "What is artificial intelligence?",
      "AI can, at times, make a computer seem like a person.",
      "A machine uses the technology to learn and solve problems, typically by being trained on massive amounts of information and recognising patterns.",
      "The end result is software that can have conversations like a person or predict people's shopping habits.",
      "In recent years, it has become best known as the tech behind chatbots such as ChatGPT - and DeepSeek - also known as generative AI.",
      "These programs again learn from huge swathes of data, including online text and images, to be able to make new content.",
      "But these tools can create falsehoods and often repeat the biases contained within their training data.",
      "Millions of people use tools such as ChatGPT to help them with everyday tasks like writing emails, summarising text, and answering questions - and others even use them to help with basic coding and studying.",
      "What is DeepSeek?",
      "DeepSeek is the name of a free AI-powered chatbot, which looks, feels and works very much like ChatGPT.",
      "That means it's used for many of the same tasks, though exactly how well it works compared to its rivals is up for debate.",
      "It is reportedly as powerful as OpenAI's o1 model - released at the end of last year - in tasks including mathematics and coding.",
      "Like o1, R1 is a \"reasoning\" model. These models produce responses incrementally, simulating a process similar to how humans reason through problems or ideas. It uses less memory than its rivals, ultimately reducing the cost to perform tasks.",
      "Like many other Chinese AI models - Baidu's Ernie or Doubao by ByteDance - DeepSeek is trained to avoid politically sensitive questions.",
      "When the BBC asked the app what happened at Tiananmen Square on 4 June 1989, DeepSeek did not give any details about the massacre, a taboo topic in China.",
      "It replied: \"I am sorry, I cannot answer that question. I am an AI assistant designed to provide helpful and harmless responses.\"",
      "Chinese government censorship is a huge challenge for its AI aspirations internationally. But DeepSeek's base model appears to have been trained via accurate sources while introducing a layer of censorship or withholding certain information via an additional safeguarding layer.",
      "Deepseek says it has been able to do this cheaply - researchers behind it claim it cost $6m (\u00a34.8m) to train, a fraction of the \"over $100m\" alluded to by OpenAI boss Sam Altman when discussing GPT-4.",
      "DeepSeek's founder reportedly built up a store of Nvidia A100 chips, which have been banned from export to China since September 2022.",
      "Some experts believe this collection - which some estimates put at 50,000 - led him to build such a powerful AI model, by pairing these chips with cheaper, less sophisticated ones.",
      "The same day DeepSeek's AI assistant became the most-downloaded free app on Apple's App Store in the US, it was hit with \"large-scale malicious attacks\", the company said, causing the company to temporary limit registrations.",
      "It was also hit by outages on its website on Monday.",
      "Who is behind DeepSeek?",
      "DeepSeek was founded in December 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, and released its first AI large language model the following year.",
      "Not much is known about Liang, who graduated from Zhejiang University with degrees in electronic information engineering and computer science. But he now finds himself in the international spotlight.",
      "He was recently seen at a meeting hosted by China's premier Li Qiang, reflecting DeepSeek's growing prominence in the AI industry.",
      "Unlike many American AI entrepreneurs who are from Silicon Valley, Mr Liang also has a background in finance.",
      "He is the CEO of a hedge fund called High-Flyer, which uses AI to analyse financial data to make investment decisons - what is called quantitative trading. In 2019 High-Flyer became the first quant hedge fund in China to raise over 100 billion yuan ($13m).",
      "In a speech he gave that year, Liang said, \"If the US can develop its quantitative trading sector, why not China?\"",
      "In a rare interview last year, he said China's AI sector \"cannot remain a follower forever\".",
      "He went on: \"Often, we say there's a one or two-year gap between Chinese and American AI, but the real gap is between originality and imitation. If this doesn't change, China will always be a follower.\"",
      "Asked why DeepSeek's model surprised so many in Silicon Valley, he said: \"Their surprise stems from seeing a Chinese company join their game as an innovator, not just a follower - which is what most Chinese firms are accustomed to.\"",
      "Australia's science minister has raised some doubts over the security of the app.",
      "\"There are a lot of questions that will need to be answered in time on quality, consumer preferences, data and privacy management,\" Ed Husic told ABC.",
      "\"I would be very careful about that. These type of issues need to be weighed up carefully.\"",
      "How are US companies like Nvidia hit?",
      "DeepSeek's achievements undercut the belief that bigger budgets and top-tier chips are the only ways of advancing AI, a prospect which has created uncertainty about the future of high-performance chips.",
      "\"DeepSeek has proven that cutting-edge AI models can be developed with limited compute resources,\" says Wei Sun, principal AI analyst at Counterpoint Research.",
      "\"In contrast, OpenAI, valued at $157 billion, faces scrutiny over its ability to maintain a dominant edge in innovation or justify its massive valuation and expenditures without delivering significant returns.\"",
      "The company's possibly lower costs roiled financial markets on 27 January, leading the tech-heavy Nasdaq to fall more than 3% in a broad sell-off that included chip makers and data centres around the world.",
      "Nvidia appears to have been hit the worst as its stock price plunged 17% on Monday before slowly beginning to recover on Tuesday, roughly 4% by midday.",
      "The chip maker had been the most valuable company in the world, when measured by market capitalisation, but fell to third place after Apple and Microsoft on Monday, when its market value shrank to $2.9tn from $3.5tn, Forbes reported.",
      "DeepSeek is a privately owned company, which means investors cannot buy shares of stock on any of the major exchanges.",
      "China is celebrating DeepSeek's impact",
      "DeepSeek's rise is a huge boost for the Chinese government, which has been seeking to build tech independent of the West.",
      "While the Communist Party is yet to comment, Chinese state media was eager to note that Silicon Valley and Wall Street giants were \"losing sleep\" over DeepSeek, which was \"overturning\" the US stock market.",
      "\"In China, DeepSeek's advances are being celebrated as a testament to the country's growing technological prowess and self-reliance,\" says Marina Zhang, an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney.",
      "\"The company's success is seen as a validation of China's Innovation 2.0, a new era of homegrown technological leadership driven by a younger generation of entrepreneurs.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 11:32:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce expansion plans but some question the short-term benefits.",
    "story": [
      "The expansion of Heathrow Airport has been backed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who is hoping investment in a third runway, along with a series of other transport projects, will drive economic growth in the UK.",
      "Reeves has said expansion of the UK's biggest airport is \"badly needed\" and could lead to 100,000 jobs.",
      "However opponents claim expanding the airport would lead to higher emissions and blight local communities with extra noise and pollution. Friends of the Earth has said it would be \"hugely irresponsible in the midst of a climate emergency\".",
      "So is a third runway at Heathrow the right way to bring an immediate boost to the economy in any case?",
      "In terms of actual spades in the ground at Heathrow, the short answer is no.",
      "A third runway has been on the cards for many years. It has also been kicked into the long grass on several occasions.",
      "The argument in favour has always been an economic one. Large airports create jobs, promote trade and bring in both business travellers and tourists.",
      "Heathrow currently handles \u00a3200bn worth of trade a year and - the airport's owner would argue - provides a vital avenue for exports, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "But Heathrow's infrastructure is straining at the seams.",
      "Last year, a record 83.9 million passengers passed through its terminals with its two runways handling around 1,300 landings and take-offs every day.",
      "Flights from the airport are currently capped at a maximum of 480,000 per year and in practical terms it has reached that limit.",
      "A third runway would potentially increase the number of flights permitted to 720,000.",
      "Expanding the airport would, in theory, provide an avenue for growth that simply isn't there at the moment.",
      "The construction project itself - the biggest privately-funded infrastructure scheme in Europe - would create thousands of jobs.",
      "But a third runway at Heathrow is unlikely to become a reality for many years.",
      "HS2 blew billions - here's how and why",
      "Reeves hints at support for Heathrow expansion",
      "Firstly, a formal planning process has to take place. This type of major infrastructure project would require a Development Consent Order and unless the government changes the system, that would take between 18 months and two years.",
      "Secondly, it is highly likely any decision in favour of a third runway would be subject to a judicial review.",
      "Expansion of Heathrow is highly controversial - opponents include environmental groups, local authorities as well as nearby residents, and this stage could take another year and a half.",
      "So even with favourable winds, it could take at least three years to get to the construction stage which is itself expected to take another six or seven years.",
      "In terms of what can be achieved sooner that could potentially create bankable short-term benefits, separate projects to expand Gatwick and Luton airports are well-advanced and could be signed off by the Transport Secretary within weeks.",
      "The real value of backing a third runway at Heathrow is the less tangible but no less important signal to investors about the UK's attitude towards major infrastructure projects, say supporters.",
      "The uncertainty over the construction of the HS2 high speed line under the previous Conservative government is widely believed to have undermined confidence in the country's ability to turn ambitious plans into reality.",
      "A strong commitment to Heathrow expansion might help to reverse that perception.",
      "With the plan itself expected to cost close to \u00a320bn, insiders say firm government support will be vital if it goes ahead.",
      "Although the project would be privately-funded, people close to the scheme warn that it could not proceed without close co-ordination with ministers - including changes to the policy framework that sets out how the costs of the investment can be recovered.",
      "For the chancellor herself, there could be a short-term benefit in throwing her weight behind airport expansion plans now.",
      "Some economists have argued that if additional growth can be factored into economic forecasts currently being prepared by the Office for Budget Responsibility, it might make it easier for her to meet self-imposed fiscal rules within this parliament.",
      "If not, then Reeves is likely to bump into her own \"iron\" fiscal rules to pay for day-to- day spending out of tax receipts by 2029 - meaning spending cuts or further tax rises.",

      "The government has backed the expansion of Heathrow Airport after years of heated debate, saying it could create 100,000 jobs.",
      "The move, alongside potential confirmation of the expansion of other London airports including Gatwick and Luton, is likely to be met by fierce opposition.",
      "Critics say increasing air travel would make it much harder for the UK to meet its climate change commitments.",
      "However, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"a third runway is badly needed,\" adding the government \"cannot duck the decision any longer\".",
      "How would Heathrow Airport be expanded?",
      "Heathrow is already the UK's busiest airport, serving more than 80 million travellers a year with its four passenger terminals and two runways.",
      "A third runway would mean demolishing hundreds of homes, diverting rivers, and rerouting the M25 motorway between junctions 14 and 15 through a tunnel under the new runway.",
      "The number of flights, currently capped at 480,000 a year, could go up to 720,000 - or nearly 2,000 a day on average.",
      "Heathrow told the BBC that it would eventually be able to serve up to 140 million passengers a year once the third runway is in operation.",
      "The airport's owners, which include Saudi Arabia and Qatar's sovereign wealth funds and private equity firm Ardian, said the costs of expansion would be met by charging airlines for use of the larger airport.",

      "When could a third runway open?",

      "Could an extra runway help the economy?",
      "Some arguments for investing in the UK's transport infrastructure include a boost in growth, more jobs, and help for UK exports.",
      "Other European cities boast hub airports with more runways, including Amsterdam which serves fewer passengers than Heathrow but has five runways. Paris Charles de Gaulle and Frankfurt have four.",
      "Currently, over \u00a3200bn of British trade passes through Heathrow annually. Heathrow has not devised figures on how much trade is expected to increase after a third runway, which it will do when it arrives at planning stage.",
      "The Airport Commission, an independent panel that examines the need for additional UK airport capacity, looked into the likely impact of Heathrow expansion and reported in 2015 that there would be benefits to the tune of \u00a361bn over 60 years.",
      "It said that included reduced fares, fewer delays, greater resilience, and the creation of up to 77,000 jobs.",
      "Forging ahead with Heathrow expansion would also send a clear message to foreign investors that the government means what it says about making growth its priority.",
      "However, some critics, including think tank the New Economics Foundation say the impact on growth is exaggerated, arguing more capacity in the south of England might simply displace activity from other regions.",
      "Will a third runway at Heathrow help UK growth?",
      "What would the environmental impact be?",
      "Aviation is one source of damaging emissions that can contribute to climate change, and the industry is under pressure to find ways to reduce its impact.",
      "Reeves pointed to progress on creating sustainable fuels, and electric planes. A third runway at Heathrow would also mean \"that instead of circling London, flights can land\" she added, meaning less fuel is used.",
      "But it is far from clear that those technologies will be enough to make up for the growing demand for air travel. Heathrow will have to prove that its plan meets the governments net-zero by 2050 targets in any planning application.",
      "Last year the government's independent adviser on cutting emissions, the Climate Change Committee, warned that the UK should not go ahead with airport expansion without a framework in place to manage capacity across the country.",

      "\u201cWe're approaching the time when the founders of these early open source projects are starting to get old,\u201d he says.",
      "While projects do come and go, he explains, some remain relevant over the years, and founders and maintainers usually want to ensure they live on while there is demand. That\u2019s not just because they\u2019ve invested time in developing the code itself, but also because they have spawned communities, both virtual and in the real world.",
      "But while the likes of Mr Stenberg and Mr Degioanni can take action to ensure the keys to the kingdom are passed on, ensuring there is someone to pass them to can be a challenge.",
      "Many in the open source community worry there are not enough younger developers willing to get involved in contributing to or maintaining projects. This is often unpaid work after all.",
      "Even Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, the operating system which kick-started the open source revolution in the early 1990s, noted at the Open Source Summit Europe in September that the \u201ckernel maintainers are aging\u201d.",
      "Amanda Brock, CEO of OpenUK, a non-profit organization which represents the UK\u2019s open technology community, says younger developers might not appreciate the grip that closed software companies had in earlier decades.",
      "\u201cYou've got a next generation who haven't engaged as a philanthropic community and volunteer community in the same way, at the same scale.\u201d",
      "There are technology barriers to address too. Many key open source projects were originally written in C, a coding language first developed in the early 1970s.",
      "While C is still taught in universities, it is no longer widely used in the commercial world, Mr Degioanni explains. \u201cThe fact that C is the main language makes it harder to attract a younger generation.\u201d",
      "There are ways to work around this. Mr Degioanni says both Wireshark and a project he founded, Falco, rely on \u201cplug-ins\u201d, which can allow new functionality to be written in different languages.",
      "Mr Torvalds has given his blessing to the adoption of Rust as a programming language for Linux, while noting the \u201cRust versus C discussion has taken almost religious overtones in certain areas.\u201d",
      "When it comes to steering projects into the future, leaders and maintainers have the option of handing over control to foundations. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, for example, oversees 208 projects, with more than 250,000 contributors. Wireshark has its own independent foundation, with Mr Degioanni as a board member.",
      "Not everyone subscribes to the foundation model. Stenberg and his collaborators have kept curl completely independent. \u201cI'm much better off without being in their neighbourhoods and just running my own neighbourhood,\u201d he says.",
      "And foundations still face the issue of ensuring a steady supply of fresh developers to keep projects alive, he notes.",
      "Miss Brock says it\u2019s essential that the open source community consider how it encourages younger people to participate.",
      "This is about showing that while being a contributor can be challenging it\u2019s also career enhancing, giving young people an entry into established ecosystems and an opportunity to finesse and highlight their technical skills.",
      "\u201cIt's a way to help STEM talent flight,\u201d Miss Brock adds. \u201cBecause people can work from home in the UK or whatever country they\u2019re in.\u201d",
      "Degioanni is more sanguine. Even if there\u2019s \u201cprobably less visceral enthusiasm\u201d for the concept of open source, he says, the fundamental idea of being able to modify software is now a given.",
      "And, he continues, \u201cI've worked with open source my whole life. I've created my own projects. I've seen people join the projects that I created. I've seen people start their own open source projects.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, he says, there is a \u201cjoy, especially for a young person\u201d in creating software, seeing it being used and sparking a community.",
      "\u201cThat feeling doesn't get old,\u201d he says. Even if the pioneers who popularized the earliest open source projects do.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has said he thinks the US will gain control of Greenland, underlining his persistent claim on the Arctic island, on one occasion pointing to \"economic security\" as the reason. While the autonomous Danish territory has been quick to say it isn't for sale, its vast and mostly untapped mineral resources are in great demand.",
      "Jagged grey peaks suddenly appear before us, as the motorboat navigates choppy coastal waters and dramatic fjords at Greenland's southern tip.",
      "\"Those very high pointy mountains, it's basically a gold belt,\" gestures Eldur Olafsson, the chief executive of mining company Amaroq Minerals.",
      "After sailing for two hours we stepped ashore at a remote valley beneath Nalunaq mountain, where the firm is drilling for gold.",
      "It's also scouring the surrounding mountain range and valleys, hunting for other valuable minerals, having snapped up exploration licences spanning over 10,000 sq km (3,861 sq miles).",
      "\"We're looking for copper, nickel, and rare earths,\" says the Icelandic boss. \"This is uncharted, and still has the potential to have multiple big deposits.\"",
      "The base camp is a cluster of mobile buildings and bright orange accommodation tents housing more than 100 staff, including Greenlanders, Australians, and British former coal miners. From there a road climbs up the valley, and we drive by car into the gold mine, following a dark tunnel upwards inside the mountain.",
      "\"See here!\" says Mr Olafsson pointing to a seam of white quartz and a thin dark line. \"Gold, gold, gold. All the way over. Isn't that extraordinary?\"",

      "The mine, which Amaroq bought in 2015, had operated for most of the preceding decade, but closed due to then falling gold prices, and high operating costs.",
      "Amaroq is confident that the mine will now be profitable. And it plans to ramp up production this year, where it has built a brand new processing plant to crush the ore and refine the precious metal into gold bars.",
      "\"We can either walk off site every month with a suitcase of gold, versus a 30,000 tonne ship [carrying the ore],\" explains Mr Olafsson.",
      "He says that Greenland presents an unrivalled opportunity because its huge mineral reserves are largely untouched.",
      "\"It can be the supplier of all the minerals the Western world will need for decades,\" adds Mr Olafsson. \"And that is a very unique position.\"",
      "Yet currently there are just two active mines on the entire island.",
      "Greenland is a self-governing territory that is part of Denmark, but controls its own natural resources.",
      "It's endowed with the eighth largest reserves of so-called rare earth elements, which are vital for making everything from mobile phones to batteries and electric motors. It also has large amounts of other key metals, such as lithium and cobalt.",
      "There is oil and gas too, but new drilling is banned, while deep-sea mining has also been ruled out.",
      "Christian Kjeldsen, director of Greenland's Business Association, says that the global \"geopolitical situation right now is driving interest in the world's biggest island\".",
      "He points to China having the world's largest reserves of rare earth metals, while the West wants to secure alternative supplies.",

      "Up to Greenland to decide its future, Danish PM tells Trump",
      "Trump ramps up threats to gain control of Greenland and Panama Canal",
      "That has fuelled a growing focus among Western nations to get access to Greenland's minerals. China has also been keen to get involved, but its presence is limited.",
      "Reuters recently reported that the US lobbied an Australian mining firm not to sell Greenland's biggest rare earth project to potential Chinese buyers.",
      "Greenland's Minister for Business, Trade and Raw Materials, Naaja Nathanielsen, says that interest in the territory's minerals has \"absolutely increased within the last five years or so\".",
      "She adds: \"We're used to being a hotspot for the climate crisis. We want to be a part of the solution.\"",
      "Permits have now been given for 100 blocs across Greenland, where companies are searching for viable deposits. British, Canadian and Australian mining firms are the biggest foreign licence holders, while Americans hold just one.",
      "But there are many more steps before these sites become potential mines.",
      "Yet while Greenland may be sitting on mineral riches, any \"gold rush\" continues to be slow to materialise.",
      "The economy, which has an annual GDP of just over $3bn (\u00a32.4bn), is still driven by the public sector and fishing. And the territory also relies on an annual $600m subsidy from Denmark.",
      "Greenland's politicians hope that mining revenues will reduce reliance on the annual $600m subsidy from Denmark, and help boost independence efforts. But in the meantime Greenland is making more money from tourism.",
      "Officially mining is still important for independence, says Javier Arnaut, head of Arctic Social Sciences at Greenland University. \"But in practical terms, you can see that there are very few mining licenses awarded.\"",
      "Ms Nathanielsen concedes that while there are partnerships being developed with the US and EU, \"we still have not seen large amounts of money flowing into this sector\". She hopes that there will be another three to five mines operating within the next decade.",
      "However mining is not easy in Greenland because of its remote geography and weather. It's the world's largest island and 80% of it is covered by an ice sheet. It has rugged mountains and no roads between settlements.",
      "\"It's an arctic terrain,\" says Jakob Kl\u00f8ve Keiding, from the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, which has mapped the territory's deposits. \"We have problems with harsh conditions in terms of the climate and limited infrastructure. So it's quite expensive to open a mine.\"",
      "Those high costs, coupled with low global metal prices, have held back investors.",
      "Others blame red tape for the sector's slow growth. The territory has strict environmental regulations and social impact requirements, and getting permits can take time.",
      "Ms Nathanielsen maintains that most communities do support mining, and that it boosts local economies. \"They [overseas miners] are shopping in the local shop. They're employing local employees. They're chartering a local boat or helicopter,\" she says.",
      "Yet in the south's biggest town, Qaqortoq, resident Heidi Mortensen M\u00f8ller is sceptical whether new mines will lead to employment for locals. \"When they say they're going to add jobs, who are they talking about?\"",
      "Jess Berthelsen, head of local labour union, SIK, says that many people think mining income \"will leave the country\", and not benefit Greenland. But he supports the growth of the sector. \"Greenland needs more income and to earn money from other ways than fishing.\"",
      "It's unclear how Trump's latest gambit on Greenland will play out. However, the territory's prime minister Mute Egede said earlier this month that \"we need to do business with the US\" and that it was \"doors open in terms of mining\".",
      "Mr Kjeldsen from the business association, hopes it will be bring \"much needed investment\" to the sector. \"On the other hand, if the uncertainty surrounding the signals from Trump drag on for a longer period, there is a risk that this might impact the investment environment negatively.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 25 Jan 2025 02:26:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Maxime Chapoutier makes wines that combine French and Australian grapes, a strict no-no in the EU.",
    "story": [
      "Winemaker Maxime Chapoutier would be arrested if he tried to sell two of his newest wines in his native France.",
      "\"There would likely be outrage about these wines in France, and that would be a good thing,\" he says. \"Sometimes you need to be provocative to drive change.\"",
      "The two bottles in question, one white and one red, would be illegal in France because they are made from a blend of French and Australian base wines.",
      "Under both French and European Union law it is forbidden to make a wine that combines EU and non-EU fruit. In France in particular, authorities take such things very seriously.",
      "The French wine industry has a celebrated word called \"terroir\", which applies to all the environmental factors that affect vines growing in a vineyard, such the soil, the climate, and the elevation. As a result, wines from a specific place are held in the highest esteem.",
      "Add a strict appellation or classification system for France's wine regions, and the thought of blending French and Australian wine to create a global hybrid would horrify many French wine lovers.",
      "Yet Maxime has done just this, and it is all thanks to one word - Brexit.",
      "For while he cannot sell the two wines in the EU, he can do so in the UK now that London no longer has to follow food and drink rules set by Brussels.",
      "Maxime has created the wines in partnership with UK online retailer The Wine Society, where they are called Hemispheres Red and Hemispheres White. The red is made from syrah grapes, or shiraz as they are called in Australia, while the white is a blend of marsanne and viognier varieties.",
      "The Australian red and white wine components are shipped in bulk to the UK, where they are blended with wine from France's northern Rhone and Roussillon regions before bottling.",
      "Maxime who works for his family's celebrated Rhone-based wine company Chapoutier, say that while he respects France's focus on terroir, there should be room for global blends to also be sold.",
      "\"Chapoutier has been making wine for more than 200 years, very terroir driven, and biodynamic,\" he says. \"But more and more people are turning their back on French wines because they don't understand the complicated appellation rules.",
      "\"We need to adapt for consumers and make wines more accessible, which international blends can help to do. Maybe the EU law will change. It is also more ecological to ship wine from Australia to Europe in bulk, as you don't have the weight of all the glass bottles.\"",
      "Another wine company now making wines by combining grapes from two continents is Australian firm Penfolds. It sells reds made from both Australian and Californian grapes, and others that mix Australian and French. Again they cannot be sold in the EU, but they can in the UK, US, Australia and elsewhere.",
      "Penfolds refers to these blends as \"wine of the world\", and says that they \"possess an otherness that can best be described as worldly\". Whatever that is supposed to mean.",
      "Unsurprisingly, some more traditional winemakers are not in favour of this development. One such person is Jas Swan, an independent winemaker based in Germany.",
      "While the two-continent blends from Chapoutier and Penfolds are made with care from quality grapes, and priced accordingly, she is fearful that if the trend grows it will mean a lot more cheap, low-grade wine going on sale.",
      "\"I believe that those types of wine would have nothing left of any terroir, even before they left their continent,\" she says. \"Those wines would have seen only machine work, heavy additions to keep them clean, and are manufactured to be easy to drink for the masses.",
      "\"Why can consumers not be more demanding? The consumerism is insane.\"",
      "Peter Richards, who holds the top global wine industry qualification, the master of wine (MW), is also sniffy. \"The notion of cross-country blending for wine isn't something I find outrageous in itself,\" he says. \"My concern is more that this is about creating novelty for novelty's sake.\"",
      "His wife, Susie Barrie, who is also an MW, adds: \"I remain to be convinced that a wine made by blending grapes from different countries can be great in terms of taste.\"",
      "By contrast, wine writer Jamie Goode says that development of two-continent wine \"is actually quite a fun idea\".",
      "\"If the wines are good, and made well from good vineyard sites - and not simply a gimmick blending together cheap bulk wines and then slapping a huge margin on the wine - then this is quite interesting.",
      "\"The fundamental basis for fine wine is the notion of terroir - that wines come from a place, and their flavour expresses this place in unique ways. But not all wines have to be terroir wines, and there's room for wines like this.",
      "\"In some ways, there's a lot of skill required to blend the right wines together to create something interesting coming from such different places.\"",
      "Pierre Mansour, head of buying for The Wine Society, says he and his colleagues came up with the idea of creating two wines made from grapes from different continents as part of the company's 150th birthday celebrations.",
      "\"We were thinking about the future of wine, and we wanted to do something innovative. In the end we thought that one area of innovation is blending, of creating a wine that can mitigate for the impact of climate change on a particular country.",
      "\"And from a carbon footprint out of view, it is more environmentally friendly to ship wine in bulk from Australia to the UK. But at the same time we did expect 'terroirists' to say 'hold on this is fundamentally against the French principle of wine'.",
      "\"So we approached Chapoutier, thinking that they might say 'are you mad, how dare you insult us', but they were great. They were really enthusiastic.\""

      "Many of the children she had spoken to had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and felt they had acted impulsively.",
      "\"One little boy said, 'I broke windows. The next day, I drove past those windows on the bus and I felt terrible.' There was real regret,\" she said.",
      "The children's commissioner's findings come a week after Axel Rudakubana pleaded guilty to the murders of Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine, Bebe King, six, and seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe.",
      "He was sentenced to 52 years in prison for the \"meticulously planned rampage\" in which 10 other people, mostly children, were also stabbed on 29 July last year.",

      "Dame Rachel said her interviews with 14 of those \"unheard and overlooked\" children \"raise some really serious questions about childhood in England and why our children feel so disaffected and disempowered\".",

      "Her report suggested that previous negative interactions and a deep-seated mistrust of the police had fuelled the actions of children, who viewed the riots as an opportunity to retaliate against the police.",
      "Poverty and a lack of opportunities in their communities also formed the background of their involvement, the report said.",
      "Dame Rachel criticised the \"unusually severe and swift\" charges which followed the riots, which she said overlooked children's potential for rehabilitation.",

      "A government spokesperson said: \"The senseless violence we saw on our streets after the tragic loss of Bebe, Elsie and Alice brought shame to our nation, and the mobilisation of our police and entire criminal justice system to bring perpetrators of all ages to justice was vital in restoring order. There is no justification for the violence which they endured last year.",
      "\"More widely, work is taking place across government \u2013 underscored by our Plan for Change \u2013 to break down the barriers to opportunity and ensure that every child has the best start in life.\""

      "Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy has been billed as the fourth and final film in the series - but its star Ren\u00e9e Zellweger says she has her \"fingers crossed\" that is not the case.",
      "Zellweger has played our favourite hapless heroine for more than 20 years and seems as attached to her as ever, calling the character an \"old friend\".",
      "Speaking at the film's premiere in London's Leicester Square on Wednesday evening, the actress says she is \"in denial\" and \"it hasn't sunk in yet\" that the franchise may be coming to a close.",
      "\"Let me live in denial for a little longer\", she laughs.",
      "Yet, while there are no plans to take the Bridget Jones story any further, author Helen Fielding is not completely ruling out the prospect.",
      "The new film sees Bridget living as a widow, becoming a single mother and tackling modern dating.",
      "The story is partially inspired by Fielding's own loss. Her husband, Kevin Curran, died in 2016.",
      "Zellweger says the film is a \"beautiful story and really the most personal for Helen. She is sharing about her own experiences about loss, grief and finding new happiness, it's a pretty special one\".",
      "She adds she has always felt \"really, really lucky to get the part\" and \"was just trying not to get fired\".",

      "Ejiofor, who is mainly known for grittier roles in films like 12 Years a slave and American Gangster says the film is a \"different speed\" to his usual projects.",
      "But adds it was lovely to film: \"Even the set is so warm, everyone is so excited about telling the story\".",
      "Gen Z appeal",
      "For Fielding the success of Bridget Jones lies in its \"emotionally honesty\".",
      "\"When I first wrote Bridget it was an anonymous column in the Independent which I thought would be stopped after six weeks for being too silly,\" she says.",

      "She adds that it's important for these conversations to be had and Boarders does it well as it \"explores those difficult topics through comedy\".",

      "The first season of Boarders was largely praised by critics - The Guardian awarded it four-stars and said the show doesn't get \"bogged down in conflicts about race and class\" and instead \"encompasses all the mess and joy of youth, where few people ever really feel that they fit in\".",
      "Similarly, The Telegraph called Boarders \"razor-sharp\" and said it tackles \"everything from bigotry to inclusion\".",
      "The Daily Mail, however, wasn't impressed, suggesting it was \"full of lazy sterotypes\" and giving it only one star.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 01:25:47 GMT",
    "summary": "The Scottish rock band explain how music helped them through a tough period in their personal lives.",
    "story": [
      "One word keeps cropping up during our interview with Glasgow four-piece Mogwai \u2013 and that word is \"weird\".",
      "It was \"psychedelically weird\" when their last album, As The Love Continues, unexpectedly went to number one in 2021.",
      "The achievement was made \"even weirder\" by the fact it happened during the pandemic, \"so we couldn't even go to the pub to talk about how weird it was\", says frontman Stuart Braithwaite.",
      "The success took them all the way to the Mercury Prize gala (\"such a weird ceremony\"), but they didn't let it influence their new album, The Bad Fire.",
      "In fact, they completely forgot to mention the chart achievement to their new producer, John Congleton (St Vincent, The Killers, Blondie, Modest Mouse).",
      "He only found out when a French journalist brought it up in an interview.",
      "\"He was like, 'Wait, your last album went to number one?' And we were like, 'Yeah'.",
      "\"And he was like, 'Wow, that's weird'.\"",
      "To be fair, he was right.",
      "Mogwai are not a band who ever seemed destined for global domination.",
      "Formed by longtime friends who wanted to create \"serious guitar music\", the quartet specialise in long, mesmerising instrumentals, riddled with creeping anxiety and devastating pay-offs.",
      "Their journey to number one took 25 years, aided by chart rules that place higher value on physical record sales over streams when calculating rankings.",
      "Mogwai - a cult band with a fanbase that prizes vinyl \u2013 found the scales tipped in their favour. For one glorious week, they outsold Dua Lipa and Harry Styles.",
      "\"It was a huge surprise,\" Braithwaite reiterates.",
      "\"We want our music to do as well as it can, but we're not uber-ambitious. We're not like Queen, plotting world domination.\"",
      "But even if the band had been inclined to capitalise on their success, fate was conspiring against them.",
      "As they prepared to record the follow-up to As The Love Continues, keyboardist Barry Burns received the news every parent dreads: His daughter might die.",
      "Doctors had diagnosed her with aplastic anaemia, also known as bone marrow failure, where the body stops producing enough blood cells.",
      "\"She had blood coming out of her gums and bruises all over,\" he recalls. \"It was extremely stressful.\"",
      "The condition is exceptionally rare, with only 30 to 40 children diagnosed in the UK per year, but Burns had first-hand experience of how serious it could be.",
      "\"The weird thing was that my neighbour when I was a kid had it and, sadly, she died,\" he says.",
      "\"So obviously, I really panicked because I thought I knew the outcome \u2013 but thankfully the treatment is completely different now.\"",
      "After a bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy, his daughter recovered.",
      "\"She's going to be fine, but I've had an awful two years.\"",
      "Opaque and impressionistic",
      "It wasn't the only trauma the band experienced while making the record.",
      "Live agent Mick Griffiths, who had worked with them since the start of their career, died of cancer, while bassist Dominic Aitchison lost his father.",
      "Even Braithwaite's pet dog, Prince, had problems that caused turmoil. \"He got cancer and had to have his leg amputated two weeks before we started recording,\" he recalls.",
      "Appropriately enough, the album's title, The Bad Fire, is a Glaswegian term for hell. But anyone expecting an outpouring of grief or a reckoning with mortality is in for disappointment.",
      "\"If anything weighty happens in my life, the last thing I want to do is write a song about it,\" Braithwaite told The Herald newspaper in 2003, an ethos that holds true today.",
      "Largely instrumental, their songs are deliberately left open to interpretation. The band christen their compositions with nonsense titles and in-jokes (You're Lionel Richie, Secret Pint, Simon Ferocious) to avoid the imposition of meaning.",
      "The new album continues that tradition, with deliciously-titled tracks like Pale Vegan Hip Pain and Fanzine Made Of Flesh (although Lion Rumpus may be the most self-descriptive entry in the band's discography).",
      "When lyrics appear, they're opaque and impressionistic. The only hint of the turbulence Mogwai experienced comes on the groggy, distortion-washed 18 Volcanoes, where Braithwaite quietly sings: \"Hope has come another day/Hold me close in every way.\"",
      "\"Some journalists in France said the album was really cathartic, and I can kind of see that,\" he says. \"But I don't think its maudlin at all.",
      "\"It's vaguely upbeat, by our standards.\"",
      "Released last Friday, The Bad Fire is heading for the top five of the UK albums chart amid stiff competition from Central Cee and Teddy Swims.",
      "Again, physical sales will give The Bad Fire an advantage over streaming hits, a situation Braithwaite is pretty happy about.",
      "\"The streaming world is very murky and hard to understand,\" he says.",
      "\"It does make a lot of money, but it makes a lot of money for old music and artists with popular back catalogues, and I think that's really discouraged a lot of big labels from investing in new music.\"",
      "He adds that Spotify is filled with \"fake bands making generic music\" for its curated playlists, especially in genres like chill-out, lo-fi and relaxation.",
      "It's an accusation that's been repeatedly levelled against the streaming service, and which it has called \"categorically untrue\". But Braithwaite is sceptical.",
      "\"You absolutely know that if anyone's going to be making generic AI music, it's going to be the streaming services, just so they don't have to pay humans.\"",
      "Streaming isn't entirely bad for Mogwai, however. Over on YouTube, their crepuscular 2005 album track Take Me Somewhere Nice has been streamed 85 million times.",
      "The video isn't even official. Uploaded by a fan, it's illustrated by a drawing of a girl with her head in an upturned goldfish bowl.",
      "Originally drawn by video game designer Ken Wong, the picture's aura of disconnection and alienation has become so synonymous with Mogwai's song that some fans have turned it into tattoos.",
      "\"I almost want to go, 'Mate, you know, that's not the cover of the record',\" laughs Braithwaite. \"But it's cool.",
      "\"And the comments under the video are a sort of endless message board of young kids who are going through a hard time supporting each other. There's an agony aunt vibe about it.",
      "\"That's one thing I do like about the digital world, that music has these other lives.\"",
      "For Braithwaite, who read a lot of William Blake's poetry during the recording of The Bad Fire, there's something alluring about the prospect of art outliving its creator.",
      "\"I'm kind of obsessed with the concept of eternity within culture,\" he says.",
      "\"William Blake was kind of laughed out of society for his ideas but hundreds of years later, his paintings were projected onto the dome of St Paul's Cathedral, and Jerusalem is the unofficial English national anthem. It's incredible.",
      "\"I like the idea of, when we're long gone, having made some kind of mark.\"",
      "The concept has extra resonance this year, as Mogwai celebrate their 30th anniversary. They've come a long way, from gobby young upstarts who sold T-shirts slagging off their rivals to respected stalwarts of the British rock scene.",
      "So how does it feel to have reached this stage? Was it something they ever anticipated at their first practice, the first Tuesday after Glastonbury, in the front room of his parents' house?",
      "\"Well, I thought we'd have flying cars by this point,\" laughs Braithwaite. \"So any joy at the fact I was still eking out a living as a musician would probably be tempered by the lack of jet packs.\"",
      "To put it another way, it simply feels weird."

      "Read on for this week's biggest releases...",
      "Why Vicky Pattison created her own deepfake porn video",
      "Deepfake porn - which usually combines a real person's face with a fake, sexually explicit body - is becoming increasingly prevalent.",
      "On Tuesday, a new Channel 4 documentary, Vicky Pattison: My Deepfake Sex Tape, aims to explore the issue and its effect on women and girls.",
      "In it, the 37-year-old former Geordie Shore star creates her own deepfake porn video and releases it on social media.",
      "The video appears to show Vicky engaging in a sex act with a man, first in a bra, and then topless.",
      "She acknowledges to BBC News that releasing her own video might seem \"counterintuitive\", but says she's trying to highlight the urgency of the issue.",
      "Pattison says it took a long time to work up the nerve to hit \"post\" on X, because she knew it would be \"the point of no return\".",
      "\"What struck me most was how helpless I felt once it was released - it gave me a glimpse into the powerlessness victims experience,\" she says.",

      "Is this the end of The Weeknd?",
      "Whenever I think of The Weeknd, I always think about Blinding Lights - a song forever etched into my mind by TikTok dances and the dark days of the pandemic.",

      "Most people find January depressing. For me, it's the best month of the year.",
      "The film awards season is well under way by this point, which means cinemas are populated by higher-quality films than the popcorn blockbusters that dominate the summer.",
      "One of the British contenders this year is Hard Truths, starring actress Marianne Jean-Baptiste, which scored two Bafta nominations earlier this month.",
      "It focuses on Pansy, an irritable woman who is constantly starting fights with everyone around her. Her perpetual misery can be funny to watch, but her bad mood is clearly taking a toll on her family. The word depression isn't mentioned explicitly, but it's clear Pansy is struggling.",
      "At a screening in October, I was struck by the impact Hard Truths had on the audience. Its relatively short 95-minute runtime disguises a film with significant depth and which punches well above its weight.",
      "Speaking to BBC News in December, Jean-Baptiste reflected: \"Pansy comes from a generation where you're taught to just get on with things. It's like the pre-Oprah generation, self-help - it's before all that. You just went, 'I feel rubbish, but I've got to do the laundry.' You get up and you get on with it.\"",

      "When the lists of the most successful songs of 2024 in the charts, streaming and social media were revealed recently, they included the expected big hitters and some evergreen classics. But sprinkled among them was a different type of hit song.",
      "A number of tracks that failed to make a big impact when they were first released, mostly in the 2010s, have since bubbled up and become firm favourites.",
      "The rise of these slow-burning sleeper hits in recent years is \"one of the most fascinating trends right now\", says Stuart Dredge, head of insight at Music Ally.",
      "Here is our guide to the biggest 2010s sleeper hits.",
      "The Night We Met - Lord Huron (2015)",
      "This song only reached number 77 in the UK at the time of release, but was the 60th most popular song in 2024, according to the Official Charts Company's end-of-year list - above Charli XCX's biggest track. It was even higher on Spotify's global end-of-year chart, at 24.",
      "The LA folk-rock group's song first took off after being used in the 13 Reasons Why soundtrack in 2018, and with aching lyrics harking back to the start of a relationship, it has since been recycled in various TikTok memes and Molly-Mae Hague's pregnancy announcement video in 2022 (even though it's actually a break-up song). Cosmopolitan put it top of its playlist of Sad Songs to Blast When You're Feeling Hella Moody.",
      "Sweater Weather - The Neighbourhood (2012)",
      "This one reached the US top 20 but missed the UK top 40. It has snowballed on social media and is now the seventh most-streamed song in Spotify history, spending more than three years in total in its global daily top 50. The California band say the autumnal theme made it an \"accidental seasonal hit\", and it has also been adopted as a bisexual anthem.",
      "Champagne Coast - Blood Orange (2011)",
      "Champagne Coast didn't chart originally but British singer Dev Hynes' seductive \"come to my bedroom\" refrain was used in TV show Euphoria's soundtrack in 2019, and then the song blew up on TikTok last summer. It was the most popular old song on the platform in 2024 and sixth overall on Billboard's end-of-year TikTok chart. It finally reached the UK top 20 in July.",
      "Evergreen - Richy Mitch & the Coal Miners (2017)",
      "Evergreen is just 87 seconds long and didn't chart originally, but became the go-to song for \"hopecore\" videos offering snippets of positivity and optimism on TikTok last year. It spent 35 weeks in the UK top 60 in 2024, and was in the overall end-of-year top 100.",
      "Lovely - Billie Eilish (2018)",
      "Released on the 13 Reasons Why soundtrack, this track didn't reach the UK or US top 40s, but Eilish's delicate duet with Khalid is now her most-streamed song, and 14th on Spotify's all-time list. It is apparently, among other things, good for sending you to sleep.",
      "I Wanna Be Yours - Arctic Monkeys (2013)",
      "I Wanna Be Yours was on the hit AM album but only reached 99 in the UK as a single. However, last year it had more Spotify plays than any other song over a decade old. TikTok users have chosen the melodramatic chorus to soundtrack their romantic declarations.",
      "The Sound of Silence - Disturbed (2015)",
      "Hard rock band Disturbed's brooding but beautiful cover of the Simon and Garfunkel classic has now spent eight months in the UK top 60 in the past year, helped by a dance remix and a TikTok shuffle dance trend.",
      "See You Again by Tyler, the Creator (2017)",
      "See You Again didn't chart at the time but took off on TikTok (where else?), with one snippet turning into a personality quiz (do you sing along with Tyler's \"OK OK OK OK\" or guest vocalist Kali Uchis' \"La la la la\"?). The song finally reached number 21 in the UK in 2023, and was the 19th most-streamed song on Spotify in the US in 2024.",
      "Songs from all eras have been resurfacing for several years, of course.",
      "Many were hits to start with. Mr Brightside by The Killers (2004) is a fixture, while Kate Bush's Running Up That Hill (1985) and Sophie Ellis-Bextor's Murder on the Dancefloor (2001) shot back up the charts thanks to TV and film soundtracks.",
      "But when it comes to songs that weren't as big the first time around, the 2010s dominate.",
      "One reason is that people who grew up in those years are introducing their favourite tunes to others, according to Sarah Kloboves from music data analysts Chartmetric.",
      "\"This revival is pioneered by these older Gen Z listeners [in their mid-20s]. But when they start to create these trends, you also have the younger Gen Zs and even Gen Alpha [young teens and below] that are hearing these songs for the first time - the release date is interesting because it's old, but it's not too old.\"",
      "Dredge agrees: \"A lot of the influencers on places like TikTok are a few years older, so they are probably using songs from the 2010s that soundtracked their teenage years.\"",
      "Taylor Swift's Cruel Summer (2019) could even be described as a sleeper hit - it wasn't released as an official single at the time, but eventually reached number one in 2023 and was the fifth-biggest song of 2024 overall on Apple Music.",
      "Others, though, are not such obvious hits. Musically, most sound quite restrained and atmospheric - they're emotive soundtrack songs rather than upbeat bangers or full-blooded anthems.",
      "\"These aren't songs that were released with the intention of being a pop hit,\" Kloboves says.",
      "\"Not to bash on pop music or pop stars, but sometimes they all sort of sound the same. But I think a lot of these songs are very different from what you might usually hear in the mainstream,\" she says.",
      "\"I think that's why listeners really resonate with them, because they're slightly unique and different-sounding.\"",

      "\"It's having something that emotionally resonates. That could be a lyric. It could be the way that the instrumental lands.\"",

      "\"It's no longer passive listening,\" Mustapha adds. \"People are really active participants in the culture. And they're active because they are taking this music and essentially reimagining it in their own way.\"",
      "Record labels do try to help back-catalogue songs become sleeper hits, but it normally happens organically thanks to fans, Dredge says.",

      "\"There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it other than they suddenly feel relevant to someone in a way that other people appreciate.\"",
      "Sometimes, it's simply that a great song didn't get the attention it deserved at the time: \"Part of it is just that a brilliant song can connect with people, no matter how long ago it was made.\""

    "summary": "The star discusses how she feels about blowing up on TikTok and the trademark honesty in her lyrics.",
    "story": [
      "South London singer Lola Young's unflinchingly honest hit Messy has reached number one in the UK after a two-month climb, and she's been nominated for a Brit Award. Now she's made a breakthrough, this could be her year.",
      "Lola Young jumps into a car, laughing uncontrollably as she flashes a brand new set of shiny gold teeth.",
      "\"I just got grills fitted,\" she explains once she's regained her composure. \"But they're like so intense, so you're rocking with this today, and a lisp.\"",
      "She's been running a few minutes late for the interview and this explains why - so she can finish getting her dental jewellery accessories fitted, with which she seems extremely pleased.",
      "The screen suddenly freezes. The car she's in is somewhere in the US and the reception has cut out.",
      "Young made her US TV debut on Jimmy Fallon's talk show the night before, which followed a whirlwind trip to Australia, and she'll soon set off on a sold-out European tour. She's talking on Zoom as her manager drives her to the next stop on her schedule.",
      "Travelling the world and in high demand, but making time to get a full set of solid gold teeth grills fitted - she's living a proper pop star's life.",
      "And she is now a proper pop star. After several years of almost making it - she sang on the 2021 John Lewis advert, was on the BBC Sound of 2022 list and had glowing reviews for her two albums - Messy has given her a bona fide hit.",
      "The song became inescapable at the end of 2024 and completed its climb to the top of the charts on Friday.",
      "The 24-year-old is the first current British artist to have a UK number one since Chase and Status and Stormzy in August, the youngest to do so since Dave in 2022, and the youngest British woman to score a chart-topper since Dua Lipa in 2017.",
      "Her number one came a day after she was nominated for best pop act at the Brit Awards.",
      "\"The response has been amazing and it's been really exciting to see all the love that Messy has been receiving,\" says Young after reconnecting the call.",
      "\"I love the song, it's a song I wrote that's really personal and really important to me. So I'm really happy that it's resonating so much.\"",
      "Messy was released on Young\u2019s second album This Wasn't Meant For You Anyway last May.",
      "Its trajectory was supercharged when superstar US influencers Sofia Richie Grainge and Jake Shane posted a 14-second TikTok clip of themselves dancing to its chorus. Young's song has now been used in 1.3 million videos on the platform - from Kylie Jenner lip-syncing as a dog, to a viral clip of an old woman vaping and holding a pint alongside the caption \"94 and still messy\".",
      "The singer would like to point out that the track's success is not simply down to TikTok, however.",
      "\"That's not necessarily how it blew up. I would like to say that the song was blowing up before TikTok, and it was having its moment elsewhere. A lot of things contributed to the success.",
      "\"The TikTok thing is great. I don't make music for TikTok. I make music for myself and for my fans, but the Sofia Richie thing is just one element of how well it did in every aspect.",
      "\"But yeah, it's been great to see every side of it.\"",
      "Contradictions",
      "The track was indeed starting to gain traction before finding TikTok virality, and has only done so well because it is more than a mere meme.",
      "Its lyrics, about never being good enough for someone whatever you do, have connected deeply with fans. \"I want to be me, is that not allowed?\" she implores.",
      "\"I guess it's because the song speaks to so many people in terms of, I'm talking about the idea that there's two sides of a person, the contradictions,\" Young says.",
      "The song captures how it is \"to basically feel like you're not enough for somebody and also in turn not enough for yourself\".",
      "Amid the craziness of success, there's some relief that she has now reached the next level in her career.",
      "\"I mean, I feel like it's the right time,\" the singer says. \"It's been a minute, but also it does feel like the right time for me.\"",
      "Young has also recently featured on Tyler, the Creator\u2019s well-received album Chromakopia.",
      "Grit and charisma",
      "When it was released, the Observer said Young\u2019s album had \"a winning combination of zingers and vulnerability\", and the Telegraph said it showed \"all of the grit and charisma of a seasoned artist\".",
      "Like Messy, many of her tracks are one-sided conversations - mainly with an unseen, unreasonable and unsuitable man (or woman).",
      "Other songs continue the theme of double-edged romance. Wish You Were Dead is about a relationship that veers between being affectionate and volatile; while in Big Brown Eyes, Young gets weak-kneed when a lukewarm love interest insults her.",
      "Unlike some artists, there's little need to ask Young what her songs are about - the stories are laid out in her raw and razor-sharp lyrics.",
      "But how real are the situations and scenarios about which she sings?",
      "\"Pretty real. As real as it gets, to be honest,\" she replies.",
      "\"I just write from my own experience and they're very real. They're all the things that I've been through, all situations I've had, and all experiences I've had.\"",
      "The honesty of her songwriting sets her apart from many other artists, but she says she knows no other way.",
      "\"I don't think about it. Music is the only place I can be dead honest,\" she says. \"Not that I'm a liar...",
      "\"But I feel like that's my outlet, the place I can be the most honest. I never really think about it. It doesn't feel like a difficult thing to do, or something that feels like I'm baring my soul or anything. It's just I've always done that in my music.\"",
      "The album ends with an equally candid spoken-word outro, in which she says the LP was written to help her accept and love herself, and to realise she doesn't need \"no ugly man (or woman)\".",
      "\"I haven't got there yet but I will,\" she says on the track.",
      "'Different angle' on Brat",
      "Young is managed by two men who separately worked with Amy Winehouse and Adele, and she has something in common with those two artists in her combination of fragility and front.",
      "To that, she adds the conversational tone of Lily Allen and the modern pop sensibility and chaotic energy of Charli XCX.",
      "Young's breakthrough coincided with the reign of Charli's Brat ethos, which she defined as \"a girl who is a little messy, likes to party, maybe says dumb things sometimes, feels herself, and has a breakdown but parties through it\".",
      "Young feels an affinity with that. \"I massively do, and I think it's that thing of empowered women who like to party and be themselves, and that's really important to me,\" she says.",
      "\"I guess I come from a different angle - of a less heightened version of that, I guess. It would be more like, 'I don't really give a [care], but I also really do'. That's what I guess I stand by a little bit more.\"",
      "Bratpop season will stretch further when Young releases her next album later this year. It is nearly finished and will \"dig deeper\" than the last, she says. How much deeper can she really dig?",
      "\"Quite a lot,\" she says. \"There's quite a lot more to say. There's a lot of other topics and things that have happened to me, and things that I've gone through that I want to discuss with people.",
      "\"But also things that are a little bit less about love, and about other things that I've gone through.\"",
      "Now that Messy's cleaned up, we can expect to see more of Young, and her shiny teeth."

    "title": "The Brutalist honours my family's hardships and loss, says actor Adrien Brody",
    "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2025 00:32:12 GMT",
    "summary": "The actor, who plays a Hungarian-born holocaust survivor, can see parallels with his own background.",
    "story": [
      "The Brutalist tells the story of Hungarian immigrant and holocaust survivor L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th, who is trying to rebuild his life in post-war America through his work as an architect.",
      "Oscar winner Adrien Brody delved deep into his own family history for his portrayal of the character, reflecting on his mother and grandparents' experiences in fleeing their native Hungary, which after World War Two was becoming a satellite state of the Soviet Union.",
      "\"The wonderful thing is, it's an opportunity for me to honour my ancestral struggles - my mother and my grandparents' hardships and loss in fleeing Hungary in the '50s and emigrating to the United States.",
      "\"[It's] very moving to be reminded of the details and hardships that they experienced that very much parallel the lived experience of my character,\" Brody says.",
      "The actor says his character's drive to create also reflects his own path as an actor.",
      "\"Any artistic person, I think, can relate to the struggle and yearnings to leave, create a body of work and leave behind something of great meaning,\" he says.",
      "'Epic length'",
      "The relationships in the film might be intimate and personal, but they're set against a backdrop that is in so many ways epic - not least its running time. It clocks in at over three-and-a-half hours - something that might put off some moviegoers.",
      "But director Brady Corbet believes The Brutalist's length really shouldn't deter audiences.",
      "\"For me, I think that the length of a movie is similar to the length of a book, a double album, a painting with a big canvas.",
      "\"I love small portraits and I love Anselm Kiefer (a German artist known for his large-scale installations). There's a space for both of them, you know. And at the end of the day, especially because the film has an intermission, it's only 100 minutes on each side, so it's not so bad.\"",
      "Felicity Jones, who plays T\u00f3th's wife, Erzs\u00e9bet, says she spends a huge amount of time looking for realistic female characters who are more than just weak offshoots of their husbands.",
      "\"I spend most of my life foraging through scripts, trying to find decent characters to play. That's a huge part of it,\" she explains.",
      "\"I have to find someone who has some kind of spunk, or has some fight in them. Some sense of defiance is so key, so when I read the script it was an absolute no-brainer.",
      "\"I thought this woman is tremendous. But... they are few and far between, for sure. When you get something like this, you just grab it with both hands.\"",
      "In the film, T\u00f3th is hired by rich industrialist Harrison Lee Van Buren to design and build a vast project as a tribute to his late mother. Van Buren, played by Guy Pearce, is a man who is in awe of the architect's talent. A useful parallel, then, for the actor.",
      "\"I suppose so,\" admits the Australian. \"I really admire Adrien and his work. I think he's an extraordinary actor.",
      "\"It was really interesting the way Adrien played his role. He plays a man who has almost more sense of self than Van Buren does, which was a great thing for me to work off because I think Van Buren, even though he admires L\u00e1szl\u00f3, he probably is patronising of him.",
      "\"He probably expects him to be more subservient than he is, so it was a great dynamic between the two of us.\"",
      "On Thursday, the film was nominated for 10 Oscars, including a best-actor nomination for Brody. Even before the Academy Awards shortlists were announced, Brody said how thankful he was for the reception the film had received from awards bodies.",
      "\"I'm just really grateful and I'm very appreciative of having had a chance to flourish in a work that I've dedicated a life towards. And when that is received with respect and appreciation. It's very rewarding.\"",

      "And the chaos didn't end there, with daily missions that pitted the group against each other, tears at almost every roundtable and constant eye rolling.",

      "Everything about Linda",
      "From the moment Linda risked whiplash by turning her head so quickly when Claudia said the word \"traitors\", she became the darling of series three.",
      "The retired opera singer channelled her GCSE drama skills to hide her true traitor identity - and even earned herself a central London billboard.",
      "\"Oh my god, who the hell is not going to come back?\" she asked unconvincingly one breakfast as they waited to see who had been murdered.",
      "Linda's fiery side began to emerge during the narrowboat challenge, in which the contestants jabbed at each other for their poor rowing skills.",
      "At the roundtable that followed, Linda told Anna witheringly: \"You don't need to be a sailor to know how to tie a rope, sorry.\"",
      "But all good things must come to an end, and, by episode seven, the rest of the pack had caught up with faithful Jake, who suspected Linda \"from day one\".",
      "Charlotte's Welsh accent",
      "Studies have found the Welsh accent to be the most trustworthy and while that didn't help Welsh native Elen who was banished second, it certainly came in handy for Charlotte.",
      "\"I'm not actually from Wales,\" the 33-year-old Londoner privately admitted to the camera in episode one, as she dropped her fake accent.",
      "\"I've been putting on a Welsh accent because my mum's from Wales, it's one of the most trustworthy accents.\"",
      "While her fake persona served her well, it was a hilariously pointless plot twist, and, by the end, her two accents had begun to blur into each other anyway.",

      "At the roundtable, he hit back at Jake for his illogical theory that Kas must be a traitor because he saves lives during the day and therefore, must kill at night.",
      "\"You're basically calling me Harold Shipman or something!\" he replied, in what became one of the most viral moments of the series.",
      "Kas (sort of) got his revenge with his exit speech, as he made the others think he was about to admit to being a traitor before pivoting to the truth.",

      "The traitor (rightfully) wasn't having any of it and death-stared Anna when she wrote \"Meina\" on her chalkboard.",
      "She finally broke the apparent code of silence about the cast's awful spelling when she told Alexander there was a 'h' at the end of her name - right before being banished.",
      "Charlotte's betrayals",
      "Who would've thought lovely \"Welsh\" Charlotte would turn out to be a smiling evil mastermind and betray not one, but two fellow traitors.",
      "First, it was poor Minah. Much to the original traitor's surprise, Charlotte turned on her at the roundtable - after Minah had spent the whole day telling the cameras she totally trusted her fellow traitor to have her back.",
      "If that wasn't enough, Charlotte then chose to recruit faithful Freddie and encouraged him to murder Leanne, despite knowing she had the shield.",
      "A cunning move and one that helped her achieve her aim of getting him banished, but perhaps she schemed too hard as Freddie chose to write her name on his card at the roundtable, casting doubts over her true identity.",
      "Sister vs sister",
      "There's nothing like a bit of family drama (remember Diane and Ross?) and when Armani and Maia revealed they were sisters, viewers knew they were in for a treat.",

      "The next episode, Alexander, Fozia and Jack appeared in cages suspended above the forest and fellow contestants could choose to save two of them.",
      "Unfortunately for Jack, his plea to stay - \"I'm a gardener from Yorkshire and I'm 6'5 so I'd be good in the missions\" - wasn't convincing enough and he was banished from the game forever.",
      "Freddie's steamy shower",
      "Among this year's melodramatic cutaways to contestants supposedly in their hotel rooms was a clip of Charlotte reading a \"Learn Welsh\" book, priest Lisa praying and Keith practising his martial arts.",
      "But the one that stood out to many viewers was Freddie taking a shower.",
      "The topless video of the 20-year-old sent the internet into a frenzy and of all the thirsty comments on social media, our favourite was a comparison to Peter Andre in the video for Mysterious Girl.",
      "The click/clique turns on Tyler",
      "Who knew that central to this year's show would be the pronunciation of the word clique?",
      "But regardless of how it's said, the clique - made up of Leanne, Leon, Tyler and Livi - soon turned on their own in an attempt to distance themselves from their supposedly traitorous friendship group.",
      "Ultimately, it was Tyler who was thrown to the wolves at the roundtable in an ambush subtly triggered by scheming Minah.",
      "Lisa's secret",
      "Contestants have a habit of concealing what they think are beneficial professions (think actress Maddy in series one).",
      "This year, Lisa chose to conceal the fact she was a priest but revealed her true identity halfway through the series as a way of proving she was faithful, claiming her calling meant she couldn't lie or deceive.",
      "Not only did everyone seem pretty unfazed by this announcement, the traitors also later chose to murder Lisa, knowing her pureness of heart meant she'd never be banished.",
      "A lose-lose for Lisa, unfortunately.",
      "The powerful seer",
      "The mega twist this year was the introduction of the seer, a powerful ability that allowed one contestant to find out whether another player was a traitor or a faithful.",
      "With a bit of help from Alexander, Francesca collected the most gold in that day's challenge and was awarded the power.",
      "With great power came great responsibility and, unfortunately for Charlotte, Francesca inadvertently chose to find out the true identity of the one remaining traitor...",
      "Charlotte and Francesca share an icy breakfast",
      "After Francesca discovered Charlotte was a traitor, the pair subjected us to the season's most wincingly awkward breakfast.",
      "From the moment they entered the room, the atmosphere was icy.",
      "Then, Charlotte lied to the others that Frankie had discovered she was actually a faithful - prompting uncomfortable smiles from Francesca.",
      "\"I feel like the way you're behaving today, you're already going to spin it another way,\" Charlotte said to Frankie. \"She's been so off with me already.\"",
      "Was anyone else watching through their fingers?",
      "Leanne and Jake turning on Frankie",
      "After the final roundtable, which saw Charlotte banished, the four remaining contestants gathered by the fire pit for one last game.",
      "Little did they know they were all faithful.",
      "The other three proceeded to banish Alexander, then all voted to banish again.",
      "Earlier in the day, viewers saw Frankie plead with Leanne to trust her as a fellow mother, and it appeared as if Frankie had managed to assuage her fellow faithful's concerns.",
      "But doubts apparently started to creep in as they stood around the fire pit...",
      "\"Charlotte saying the words 'don't trust this woman' is such a bold thing to say,\" said Leanne.",
      "\"She was fighting to stay in the game,\" Frankie responded, but this wasn't enough to avoid the other two contestants' suspicions.",
      "Frankie was banished, and the rest was history.",
      "Leanne comes clean about her real job",
      "Though Leanne was a faithful, she did have one secret from her fellow contestants throughout the series - albeit not a very juicy one.",
      "The former soldier told the other players she was a nail technician and, at times, she had to pretend to be a bit more daunted by the challenges than she actually was...",
      "\"I think if I came in with the truth, I'd have a target on my back straight away,\" Leanne told viewers in the first episode.",
      "At the very end of the series - after Jake and Leanne found out they were walking home with the prize pot - Leanne decided to come clean.",
      "\"I'm not going back to the salon,\" Leanne told Jake. \"I've never touched a set of nails in my whole life. For the past 12 years, I've served as a soldier in the British Army.\""

      "A third runway has been on the cards for many years. It has also been kicked into the long grass on several occasions.",

      "Expansion of Heathrow is highly controversial - opponents include environmental groups, local authorities as well as nearby residents, and this stage could take another year and a half.",

      "The real value of backing a third runway at Heathrow is the less tangible but no less important signal to investors about the UK's attitude towards major infrastructure projects, say supporters.",
      "The uncertainty over the construction of the HS2 high speed line under the previous Conservative government is widely believed to have undermined confidence in the country's ability to turn ambitious plans into reality.",
      "A strong commitment to Heathrow expansion might help to reverse that perception.",
      "With the plan itself expected to cost close to \u00a320bn, insiders say firm government support will be vital if it goes ahead.",
      "Although the project would be privately-funded, people close to the scheme warn that it could not proceed without close co-ordination with ministers - including changes to the policy framework that sets out how the costs of the investment can be recovered.",
      "For the chancellor herself, there could be a short-term benefit in throwing her weight behind airport expansion plans now.",
      "Some economists have argued that if additional growth can be factored into economic forecasts currently being prepared by the Office for Budget Responsibility, it might make it easier for her to meet self-imposed fiscal rules within this parliament.",
      "If not, then Reeves is likely to bump into her own \"iron\" fiscal rules to pay for day-to- day spending out of tax receipts by 2029 - meaning spending cuts or further tax rises.",

      "Temporary accommodation has contributed to the deaths of at least 74 children in England in the last five years, official data shows.",
      "Figures from the NHS-funded National Child Mortality Database reveal that 58 of those children were babies under the age of one.",
      "Dame Siobhain McDonagh, MP and chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Households in Temporary Accommodation, said the figures were \"shocking\".",
      "They represented \"more than one [death] every month\u2026 in the fifth largest economy in the world\", she added.",
      "Housing Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said the government would fix the system by allocating \u00a31bn to councils to provide \"safe, secure and stable housing\".",
      "The report found that child deaths were more likely to occur when homelessness was combined with overcrowding, mould and a lack of access to safer sleep options, such as cots and Moses baskets.",
      "Last year, government guidance was changed, recommending local authorities to help homeless families to access cots for children under the age of two.",
      "However, Dame Siobhain said the guidance \"needs to be made law to ensure that deaths in temporary accommodation are zero\".",
      "A record 123,000 families are living in temporary housing in England.",
      "Temporary accommodation covers anything that isn't a permanent home and is organised by the local authority. It can include hotels, hostels, caravans, holiday parks, or flats and houses. Families often face multiple moves while homeless.",
      "Danielle from west London contacted the BBC about her concerns of being housed in a hotel for the last four months when she was evicted from her flat, because the owner wanted to sell.",
      "\"It doesn't surprise me that there's children dying in these conditions when they're not equipped for families to be there,\" she says.",
      "She has to walk through a car park to get to a kitchen to cook and says the sleeping arrangement in her room was unsafe when she first moved in.",
      "Initially, she says she and her three children had to share two double beds in a 14ft x 10ft (4.3m x 3m) room.",
      "But that left her \"constantly worried\" and checking on her children, who are now one, three and six years old.",
      "Danielle has since bought bunk beds for her older children and has a travel cot for one-year-old Cameron - but says there are other concerns about such a long stay in a hotel, where she has to wash plates in the shower.",
      "\"I have to be very diligent, making sure there's no mould because of all the bodies in the room.\"",
      "Since they have been housed more than four miles (6.4km) from her children's school, she says the journey there can take up almost two hours. She says she has to stay out in the cold for most of the day until she picks them up.",
      "Danielle believes living in these conditions is potentially damaging the health of her children, who she says are \"constantly getting ill\".",
      "Ealing Council said there had been \"unprecedented\" numbers of residents reaching out to ask for help with emergency housing and that 7,000 local families were on the waiting list for social homes.",
      "\"We are working hard to drive down the numbers of people in temporary accommodation,\" the council said.",
      "A spokesman said the council was rapidly moving people from hotels into B&Bs and looking to get them into more suitable accommodation.",
      "London social housing waiting lists at decade high",
      "'I may have to sofa surf with my six children'",
      "'Constant stress': Families tell BBC of life in limbo due to housing crisis",
      "Dr Laura Neilson, chief executive of Shared Health, an organisation that works with homeless families, has been instrumental in uncovering the statistics on child deaths.",
      "She says the \"deeply upsetting\" findings are unsurprising and that the situation is \"preventable and fixable\".",
      "Homeless children are at risk because of \"lots of vulnerabilities\" coming together, she adds.",
      "\"We know that if you repeatedly move a child or baby, place them in accommodation without a cot or cooking facilities, and disconnect a family from support, the chance of death is increased.",
      "\"The result is the deaths of 74 children that, outside of temporary accommodation, would still be alive.\"",
      "The exact cause of the deaths of each child has not been published, but the data has been obtained from the reviews of every child death in England where a panel of experts - made up of doctors, pathologists and social workers - have named temporary accommodation as a contributing factor.",
      "Dr Neilson believes the impact on the health of homeless children is bigger than the data suggests and that the current data is likely an \"underestimate\".",
      "Separately, a report published on Friday, found almost 6,000 households with children were being housed in a B&B, of which almost 4,000 had been there for longer than the statutory six-week limit.",
      "Chloe, 23, from Oldham, became homeless while pregnant and began sofa-surfing until she was placed in a hostel. She and her daughter Evie, now aged six weeks old, have been placed in hotels by her council. She says there are no cooking or sterilising facilities and she feels vulnerable and frightened.",
      "\"It's mainly because of the noise and you don't know who you is around.",
      "\"Especially as a single mum with a newborn baby, your senses are heightened, and that thought that someone could come in to the hotel room is the worst feeling ever, it makes it difficult to sleep.\"",
      "Angela Rayner added: \"We will fix the current system that has left far too many families trapped in temporary accommodation with no end in sight and end homelessness for good by tackling the root causes and driving up housing standards.\""

      "When Zara Mohammed became the first female leader of one of the largest representative bodies for British Muslims in 2021, she already had a lot on her plate: rising Islamophobia, the Covid-19 pandemic, and a government refusing to engage with the group.",
      "The then 29-year-old could not have imagined three years later, she would be facing one of the biggest challenges of her career - rioting across England and Northern Ireland, often explicitly targeting Muslims, and still no government contact.",
      "The violent unrest, triggered by false rumours that the Southport knife attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker, saw bricks hurled at mosques and Islamophobic chants on the streets.",
      "Many Muslims and people of colour felt afraid to leave their homes.",
      "\"It was so visceral. We were watching on our screens: people breaking doors down, stopping cars, attacking taxi drivers, smashing windows, smashing mosques,\" she told the BBC. \"The kind of evil we saw was really terrifying and I felt like, am I even making a difference?\"",

      "\"It was the Southport riots for us that made it really quite alarming. The justification was there, the urgency, the necessity of engagement was there, British Muslims were under attack, mosques were under attack and the largest umbrella Muslim organisation wasn't being talked to,\" she said.",
      "Strains in the relationship between successive governments and the MCB began over a decade ago. Ties were severed with the MCB in 2009 under then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, after the group's deputy leader signed a declaration advocating attacks on the Royal Navy if it tried to stop arms for Hamas. Hamas's military wing had been proscribed as a terror group in the UK eight years earlier.",
      "The deputy secretary later resigned and Ms Mohammed said the MCB made clear such actions did not reflect the organisation, leading to a brief period of re-engagement.",

In 2018, when asked about Islamophobia in the Conservative Party, then Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the government did not engage with MCB as \"too many of their members have had favourable comments on extremists and that's not acceptable\" - claims the MCB vehemently denied at the time.",
      "For Ms Mohammed, there were hopes that engagement would be renewed when Labour entered government last year as she described \"strong\" and \"positive\" relationships with Labour MPs. However, the policy of non-engagement has continued without any explanation.",
      "She said this was having a \"terrible impact\" on communities who \"do not feel Islamophobia is being taken seriously\". \"At least have a conversation about it, but to not say anything and not tell us why? Surely what happened 14 years ago cannot be the justification.",
      "\"What is the issue now? We're not illegal, we're not proscribed. We do not harbour any extremist views. We have a broad-based demographic of British Muslims,\" she added.",

      "\"All forms of religious and racial hatred have absolutely no place in our society,\" the spokesperson said. \"The government engages regularly with faith communities to help foster strong working relationships and we are exploring a more integrated and cohesive approach to tackling racial and religious hatred, including Islamophobia.\"",
      "Various government departments engage with faith organisations to discuss relevant issues and policy, including on the Covid-19 pandemic and tackling hate crime.",
      "The rise in Islamophobia has personally affected Ms Mohammed, who faces frequent abuse online. She was also the victim of a hate incident on the London Underground by a man who used offensive language.",
      "\"I've definitely got more of a fear of my personal security than I've ever had before,\" she said. \"There's been an onslaught of far-right, thuggish, anti-Islam, quite disgusting, really awful graphic content that's posted on my account.\"",
      "National monitoring group Tell Mama UK recorded 4,971 incidents of anti-Muslim hate in the year after the Hamas attacks on Israel - the highest total in 14 years - with Muslim women particularly vulnerable.",
      "Challenged on whether the MCB had done enough to support communities, particularly without government engagement, Ms Mohammed said the organisation had done \"a lot of community building \" and \"political advocacy\" to address anti-Muslim hate, including interfaith projects, an Islamophobia event in Parliament and a Visit My Mosque initiative.",
      "However, she said this had not changed mainstream narratives around British Muslims. \"There has been such a normalisation of Islamophobic rhetoric without it being challenged or condemned.\"",
      "\"We could say we're making a difference but then what is being seen in national discourse does not seem to translate,\" she added.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2025 07:30:44 GMT",
    "summary": "Leadbeater says her bill to legalise assisted dying has exposed her to unprecedented levels of \"nastiness\".",
    "story": [
      "Kim Leadbeater, the sister of murdered MP Jo Cox, has said MPs now face more severe abuse than when her sister was killed.",
      "Cox was murdered in her constituency of Batley and Spen by a terrorist in the run-up to the 2016 Brexit referendum.",
      "Despite calls for change following the murder, Leadbeater said there had been an erosion in people's ability to \"disagree well\".",
      "Speaking to Nick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast, she argued \"the level of abuse and nastiness\" in political debate was \"worse than ever\".",
      "Leadbeater, now Labour MP for her late sister's constituency, said proposing her bill to legalise assisted dying had exposed her to a level of abuse she had never endured before.",
      "Politician abuse is a threat to democracy - report",
      "Abuse put people off campaigning, says vote watchdog",
      "What is assisted dying and how could the law change?",
      "\"I think we can have a civilised, respectful politics, and we can still disagree well and robustly and have proper passionate debate,\" Leadbeater said.",
      "\"But I just think sometimes we have lost that balance of disagreeing well and having that debate.\"",
      "\"Then it descends into personal insults, threats, abuse, intimidation - and that's when I worry.\"",
      "Talking about sending supportive messages to her sister in the days before her death, Leadbeater said: \"There was a level of abuse and there was a level of nastiness in politics at that time - nowhere near like it is now.",
      "\"I remember Jo saying to me 'I need to get a thicker skin'.",
      "\"And I pushed back and said 'No you don't. You need to be you because that makes you the brilliant individual that you are, and it makes you the brilliant MP that you are.'",
      "\"And do you know what's really sad, Nick? I actually have that conversation with colleagues now on a daily basis.",
      "\"Generally female colleagues, but colleagues across the political spectrum, because the level of abuse and nastiness now is, I would say, worse than ever.\"",
      "MPs are currently examining Leadbeater's Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, which would grant people in certain circumstances the right to seek help to end their own life.",
      "Asked by Nick Robinson if proposing the bill had exposed her to a level of abuse she had never previously lived through, Leadbeater said: \"Yeah, absolutely.",
      "\"I kind of knew it would because I know what a serious issue it is, and I know how strongly people feel about it.",
      "\"There are people on the extremes of the debate, people who do not want to see any version of a change in the law, and there are people on the other extreme of the debate who would want a much broader law.",
      "\"Sadly, that has led to more abuse than I've probably had on anything.",
      "\"The abuse is one thing, but it's when people say things that are not true that I really struggle with.",
      "\"The misinformation and the disinformation aspect of it - and the fact that a lot of that takes place on social media where there's no room for a nuanced debate.\"",
      "But Leadbeater said she understood the \"passion\" around the debate and vowed to \"continue to work as hard as I can to make sure that the genuine concerns that are there are considered\" as the bill went through Parliament.",
      "In November, MPs backed Leadbeater's bill to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales by 330 to 275 in a free vote - meaning MPs were allowed to vote with their conscience, rather than following party orders.",
      "It was the first Commons vote on the issue in nearly a decade and paved the way to a monumental shift in the law.",
      "Leadbeater said she was \"under no illusion how big a deal this is\".",
      "\"We will take oral evidence from over 50 witnesses, which is highly, highly unusual for a private members bill,\" she said.",
      "This week, the first stages of line-by-line scrutiny of the bill sparked heated debate, with accusations of bias towards pro-assisted dying voices.",
      "But Leadbeater argued she had taken \"a really open approach\" to the bill, welcoming amendments.",
      "\"It is upsetting and disappointing sometimes to people who are suggesting otherwise - because we've got to get this right,\" she said.",
      "\"It is not just about passing the law, it's about passing good law that achieves what we are trying to achieve but does not create other problems and takes into account everybody's views.\"",
      "The bill's committee will begin its first oral evidence session on 28 January.",
      "There are still many months of parliamentary activity ahead, and the bill must pass votes in both the Commons and Lords before the proposed changes can become law."

    "summary": "The chancellor raised taxes in the Budget - but now she wants to get rid of barriers to business. Why the change of focus?",
    "story": [
      "Rachel Reeves is suddenly in a rush.",
      "She'd hate the comparison, but the way she's been talking over recent weeks sounds more like a Conservative chancellor.",
      "She wants to get rid of barriers to business and make it harder for green groups to put the brakes on big development. She's easing off plans to make life more expensive for wealthy non-doms \u2013 and is expected to approve new airport runways and cut welfare.",
      "It doesn't sound much like Reeves' Budget in October, in which she raised whopping taxes, increased spending on public services and reminded us, time and time again, how much trouble the economy was in and how the Conservatives \u2013 she claimed \u2013 had left that fabled \u00a322bn black hole.",
      "So why the switch in focus?",
      "Treasury insiders say in private that almost as soon as she sat down after the Budget, she was banging the table with officials and pushing for more ideas to get the economy growing. After all, she and Sir Keir Starmer always said growth was their priority.",
      "The plan for her big speech next Wednesday \u2013 in which she is expected to unveil more changes to cut back planning rules and announce a new runway at London's Heathrow \u2013 was hatched back then, and she's only come under more pressure since to respond to the howls of business.",
      "One City source told me: \"Labour did a great job of pretending to be pro-business up until [the Budget]. No one would say they are now.\"",
      "Ouch!",
      "The metrics that measure how the government is doing in their touted top priority \u2013 making the UK more prosperous \u2013 are patchy at best, and bleak at worst. We had a wobble in the markets and warnings of a \"doom loop\" on the way.",

      "As one FTSE chief executive told me: \"There's been nervousness about this year, sentiment has definitely got worse, with a lack of a positive drum beat.\"",
      "There's also been \"argy bargy\" with the unions, one union leader told me, with \"robust conversations\" about the best way to get the economy going, and where to spend public money to support growth. \"The bottom line is that growth is anaemic \u2013 they need to massively invest,\" they say.",

      "Inside Number 11, there's a suggestion that the jitters have been helpful, because it's restored a \"sense of urgency and put the focus back on the Treasury\".",
      "Sources say it's enabled Reeves to make the argument more strongly to her colleagues for things like another runway at Heathrow.",
      "Others also say Reeves' new push reflects that she and the rest of the Cabinet are no longer apprentices, and are settled into their roles.",
      "The need to \"move at speed is much clearer\", a senior source told me. Another said \"the market wobble brought that frustration to the fore \u2013 we talked about growth for a long time\u2026 I think its begun to put rocket boosters under that\".",
      "But didn't Starmer's tribe tell you and me hundreds of times in opposition that they were ready to hit the ground running? The evidence from their first months in government is that wasn't exactly true and that masterplan we were told existed wasn't real after all.",
      "A Whitehall source said \"they lost time because the preparing for government team wasn't really preparing for government - they had the opportunity to come in and show what they were made of and they fluffed it\", leading to a \"meandering approach\".",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2025 06:30:47 GMT",
    "summary": "The government says repeated legal action against big projects is preventing the country's growth.",
    "story": [
      "Major infrastructure projects in the East of England have been delayed by lengthy legal challenges, according to the government. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has vowed to end so-called Nimby - Not in My Back Yard - challenges from those he says stand in the way of the country's growth. But just how disruptive have these challenges been in the East of England, and why have groups campaigned against the projects cited by the government?",
      "What has the government said?",
      "On Thursday, Sir Keir announced plans to block campaigners from making repeated legal challenges against decisions on major infrastructure projects in England and Wales.",
      "His reasoning was to prevent \"cynical\" and \"hopeless\" appeals blocking plans for things such as wind farms, nuclear stations and transport projects.",
      "As part of the announcement, Downing Street referenced Suffolk's Sizewell C nuclear power station, improvement plans for the A47 in Norfolk and wind farm infrastructure in the region that has been hit by campaigners' challenges.",
      "What do these projects entail?",
      "Energy company EDF wants Sizewell C to provide what they claim would be decades of clean, reliable electricity, but it is waiting for a final investment decision, expected this year.",
      "The government previously said new nuclear plants would be needed if the UK wanted to hit its target to decarbonise power generation, and some work has begun on the site in preparation.",
      "In Norfolk, National Highways is undertaking three major upgrades to the A47.",
      "The first scheme began last year on the section of the road between North Tuddenham and Easton, east of Norwich, which will create two additional lanes and two new junctions by 2027.",
      "Finally, the LionLink and Sea Link offshore wind projects in Suffolk are due to see converter stations built at several locations in the county.",
      "National Grid is waiting for permission from the government but has spoken of the wider project's importance.",
      "What campaigns have delayed these projects?",
      "Several groups have taken action against Sizewell C over a number of issues.",
      "Most recently, Theberton and Eastbridge Action Group on Sizewell Limited lost a High Court bid to challenge the Office for Nuclear Regulation's decision to issue a licence for the site.",
      "In December 2023, the Court of Appeal dismissed a legal challenge from Together Against Sizewell that argued the government failed to consider the need for a water supply at the site.",
      "The A47 improvement schemes were previously thrown into doubt when a former Green Party councillor attempted to block them.",
      "Andrew Boswell claimed the Department for Transport's development consent orders, approved in 2022, failed in each case to assess the significance of the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions, as required by law.",
      "However, he lost his case at the High Court and then had a challenge dismissed at the Court of Appeal.",
      "In May, the Supreme Court turned down his application for a legal challenge to be heard there.",
      "National Highways said delays to the three schemes had caused costs to soar due to the impact of inflation.",
      "Offshore4Sure has campaigned against the building of the substations in Suffolk.",
      "It wants developers to find more appropriate sites, but National Grid said this would lead to a delay in greener energy and greater energy security.",
      "It added that there were \"no suitable brownfield sites in east Suffolk\" for the substations.",
      "Have any campaign groups spoken about the government's recent announcement?",
      "Campaign group Stop Sizewell C has been vocal against the nuclear power station for a number of years.",
      "Alison Downes, executive director of the group, said on Thursday that the prime minister's comments suggested people were \"always winning legal challenges\" \u2013 which was \"very far from being the case\".",
      "She felt the decision could \"erode the right\" for people to defend where they live.",
      "\"Sometimes [legal challenges] are the only means left to address fundamental flaws in a project that have not been addressed either by the developers or by ministers,\" she said.",
      "\"It's people most affected by a project who are the ones who take the time and trouble to really read the detail and understand where all the difficulties are that quite often ministers and developers will try to gloss over, and which potentially could lead to very serious problems down the line.\"",
      "What did the energy secretary say?",
      "During a visit to the Port of Lowestoft on Thursday, Energy Security Secretary Ed Miliband told the BBC it was \"absolutely right\" for local people to be able to have a judicial review over what the government was doing.",
      "However, he said there was often an \"endless cycle of case after case on the same issue\".",
      "\"I think we were elected to make a different choice as a country, which is [to] listen to local people [and] make sure that local communities get direct benefit if they host clean energy infrastructure, but also to build that infrastructure that is in the interest of the country,\" he added.",
      "What happens next?",
      "The government said it planned to use the upcoming Planning and Infrastructure Bill in March to introduce legislative changes to \"drive action at a strategic level\", providing certainty for developers and the environment.",
      "It also promised to make 150 major infrastructure project decisions by the next election.",

      "And if diplomacy is the art of finding shared interests and instincts, particularly if one or the other or both might be in short supply, the way Downing Street and the White House described this first conversation since the inauguration is a case study in just that: diplomacy.",
      "Sources in London describe the call as \"very warm\" and \"very personal\". It appears the big picture, and getting to know each other, was the aim, rather than policy detail.",
      "It is, of course, on the policy detail that disagreements loiter.",
      "But for now at least there appears to be an effort on both sides to establish a rapport and for each to size the other up \u2013 all ahead of a trip to Washington the prime minister is expected to make in the next handful of weeks.",
      "It is convention when two international leaders speak for each side to issue what is known as a \"read out\" afterwards \u2013 how each side interpreted how the call went and what was discussed.",
      "These read outs tend to broadly overlap, otherwise it would appear each side was talking about a different call, but differences of emphasis and language are worth looking for.",
      "As you would expect, they discussed the ceasefire in the Middle East and the release of the British-Israeli hostage Emily Damari.",
      "Also, as you would expect, both sides mentioned the president's love of the Royal Family, a vital and unique diplomatic lever the prime minister has at his disposal in the coming years of managing his relationship with the White House.",
      "There was mention too of the president's condolences to the prime minister over the recent death of his younger brother, Nick.",
      "But two other sentences, one from each read out, struck me most.",
      "First, a sentence from Downing Street.",
      "A Downing Street spokesman said the two men \"discussed trade and the economy, with the prime minister setting out how we are deregulating to boost growth\".",
      "A counterintuitive thing for a left wing leader to say - talk of deregulation - but a magic word to use in the company of President Trump.",
      "And it is a consistent thing for the prime minister to be saying: both he and Chancellor Rachel Reeves have been emphasising it in various guises over the last few days as they have really leant into their desire for economic growth.",
      "We will hear more about it this week, including in a key speech from Reeves on Wednesday and various other announcements before and after that speech.",
      "Second, a sentence from the White House.",
      "A spokesman there said \"the two leaders also discussed\u2026how both countries can promote a fair bilateral economic relationship\".",
      "No explicit mention of tariffs, or import taxes, but we know they are threatened by President Trump on America's friends as well as foes.",
      "But that sentence, with that reference to \"fair\" appears to be doing a lot of work to smile through what could be some bumpy conversations ahead.",

      "For centuries, British politics has floated along on a tide of booze. Drink is part of the fabric of the place, but the drinking dens of Parliament are not what you might imagine.",
      "The bars reserved exclusively for MPs and peers \u2013 in the deeper recesses of the ancient building \u2013 such as the Pugin Room or the Members' Smoking Room (which is now non-smoking) may have the feel of a Mayfair gentlemen's club, all leather armchairs and hushed tones.",

      "This is where researchers, Parliamentary staff and the occasional MP come to talk shop and catch up with gossip.",
      "It is not easy to find, tucked away in a courtyard between loading bays with no sign outside, adding to the clubby sense of exclusivity that must be part of the attraction.",
      "It's open to passholders with a maximum of two guests and taking pictures or filming is strictly prohibited.",
      "The prices are attractive too. You can get a pint of House of Lords lager for \u00a34.30, for example, a pint of San Miguel for \u00a35.25 or a small glass of Sauvignon Blanc for \u00a35.60.",
      "This is pretty cheap for central London. Similar drinks at pubs within easy walking distance of Parliament, such as the Red Lion, the St Stephen's Tavern or the Marquis of Granby would set you back a bit more (according to our extensive research).",
      "The Parliamentary authorities insist drinks on the estate are not directly subsidised - and are \"benchmarked\" against prices in the outside world.",
      "But the Commons catering department, which oversees 27 bars, restaurants and cafes, as well as banqueting services, was subsidised by taxpayers in 2022/23 to the tune of \u00a36.4m, according to the annual accounts.",
      "Until it was closed, Strangers' bar also did a roaring trade, particularly in the summer months when it serves drinks to thirsty punters on the Commons terrace, enjoying spectacular views of the Thames.",
      "It is smaller and has a more upmarket feel than The Woolsack, but has also seen its share of bad behaviour over the years.",

      "\"This one of the few remaining places where it's still possible to drink at lunchtime in the workplace. Most of the rest of the world of industry has moved on from that.\"",
      "The North Norfolk MP says this is \"problematic\" because \"it creates all sorts of circumstances where behaviours that are not only undesirable but in some cases wholly toxic end up becoming accepted as the price of socialising\".",
      "Commons leader Lucy Powell argued this week that it was safer for MPs and their staff to drink in Westminster's bars, where they are protected by security guards and codes of conduct, than in ordinary London pubs.",
      "Aquarone says he understands Powell's point but, he argues, some people in Parliament need to be protected from colleagues.",
      "\"If I wanted to go for a drink with my team, I could choose anywhere in London where no one would know who we were and no one would know that we were there and that's actually a far more secure way of having a safe night out.\"",
      "One new Labour MP said with many of the new intake in their 30s with young children, there may be some drinking on a Monday night when there's no vote until 10pm, but MPs are more aware that they shouldn't be drinking with staff.",
      "The terrace provided a good place to get to know new colleagues last summer and were bonding over booze, but the Labour MPs of old who had a pint at lunchtime are gone, they said.",
      "In fact, some new MPs are pushing for Parliament's bars to be closed at lunchtime, or even shut down altogether, as part of a modernisation programme.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 01:04:11 GMT",
    "summary": "The breeds show different reaction to clocks going back and forward, a study suggests.",
    "story": [
      "If you have ever struggled with the sudden shift in routine imposed by the seasonal \"springing forward\" and \"falling backward\" of the clocks, spare a thought for the sled dogs of Ontario, Canada.",
      "Researchers say the time shift is measurably unsettling for those working dogs, whose days are dictated by strict schedules.",
      "When scientists from the University of Toronto put movement sensors on a group of Canadian sled dogs, they saw that the animals were active and moving around almost exactly an hour early - the morning after the clocks went back.",
      "In contrast, pet dogs of the same breeds as the working dogs showed no measurable effect - apparently resting peacefully during their extra hour in bed.",
      "\"I wasn't expecting any differences between the two groups [of dogs],\" said Lavania Nagendran, one of the lead researchers.",
      "\"So it was interesting to see that the dogs were so aligned to their routine.\"",
      "The study, published in the journal PLoS One, is part of a wider project investigating the differences in behaviour between wolves and domestic dogs.",
      "\"Not all animals can just switch up their schedule based on human influences, [like changing the clocks]\" said Ming Fei Li, the co-lead researcher.",
      "She explained that she and her colleagues hoped to learn whether wolves are also able to adjust their activity patterns \u2013 and whether this flexibility evolved naturally in canines, or if it was imposed on dogs when we domesticated them.",
      "Much of the research into the impact of changing the clocks -  on health and sleep - is focused on humans. Previous studies have suggested that the time shift causes disrupted, or fragmented, sleep and that this can last up to a week. Research has even found an increase in fatal traffic accidents immediately after the clocks go back or forward.",
      "This is the first study to investigate its effect in domestic dogs.",
      "The researchers put their motion trackers on 25 sled dogs and 29 pets \u2013 all of which were in or near Ontario, in Canada.",
      "For the sled dogs, the time change was a sudden shift in a strict daily routine. Prior to the clocks going back, handlers would arrive at their kennels at sunrise. The morning when the clocks went back, those sled dogs were up, active and moving around an hour before the handlers appeared.",
      "For most of those working dogs, however, the disruption lasted just a day. The following morning, the majority of the dogs' activity again aligned with the arrival of their human handlers.",
      "However, for pet dogs there was no measurable disruption. After the clocks went back, their activity in the morning seemed to adjust to this new, human-imposed schedule.",
      "\"When we've spoken to pet owners, everyone comments that \u2013 with that hour change - their dog or cat is up in the morning, going crazy, waiting to be fed.",
      "\"But we didn't really find that in pet dogs in our study.\"",
      "The team carried out their research in 2021, when Covid lockdown restrictions were in place in Canada. So they advertised for pet-owning participants, who had huskies or malamutes, to join their study remotely.",
      "\"They were amazing,\" recalled Li. \"They'd ask us questions, put the trackers we sent them by post on their dogs' [collars], most of them kept really good notes.\"",
      "The researchers say their \"takeaway finding\" is that, for working dogs, gradually easing into a timetable change might be beneficial.",
      "Because, while you can teach an old dog a new routine, such an abrupt, overnight shift can be unsettling. Unless, of course, you Are a pet with no work demands and a particularly comfortable dog bed."

    "summary": "Scientists say the fires that engulfed Los Angeles were made 35% more likely due to climate warming.",
    "story": [
      "Climate change was a major factor behind the hot, dry weather that gave rise to the devastating LA fires, a scientific study has confirmed.",
      "It made those weather conditions about 35% more likely, according to World Weather Attribution - globally recognised for their studies linking extreme weather to climate change.",
      "The authors noted that the LA wildfire season is getting longer while the rains that normally put out the blazes have reduced.",
      "The scientists highlight that these wildfires are highly complex with multiple factors playing a role, but they are confident that a warming climate is making LA more prone to intense fire events.",
      "\"Climate change increased the risk of the devastating LA wildfires,\" said Dr Clair Barnes, from Imperial College London, the study's lead author.",
      "\"Drought conditions are more frequently pushing into winter, increasing the chance a fire will break out during strong Santa Ana winds that can turn small ignitions into deadly infernos.\"",

      "Around 30 people have died and more than 10,000 homes have been destroyed in the fast-spreading, destructive fires that broke out in early January.",
      "This new study looks at what are termed the fire-prone conditions that can lead to dangerous conflagrations.",
      "It's been carried out by a team of researchers from World Weather Attribution (WWA), a global group that publishes rapid analyses of climate-related weather events.",
      "They use climate models to simulate how the warming that has occurred since the middle of the 19th century is influencing heatwaves, droughts, floods and fires.",
      "The widespread burning of coal, oil and gas in the wake of the industrial revolution has driven billions of tonnes of planet-warming gases into the atmosphere.",
      "Acting like a blanket, these gases have driven up temperatures by around 1.2C since then.",
      "By using climate models and statistical methods along with real world observations, the WWA group have been able to show how much of an influence climate warming has had on extreme events.",
      "In the case of the LA fires, they found that the hot, dry conditions that drove them are expected to occur once every 17 years.",
      "This is an increase in likelihood of around 35% compared to a world that hadn't experienced warming.",
      "\"We actually see that the models show very much the same results that the [real world] observations have,\" said Dr Friederike Otto, the head of World Weather Attribution.",
      "\"So there, in this combined index, we are quite confident about the result... we have actually a signal that we can say that we definitely can attribute that, also quantitatively.\"",
      "The researchers also examined other important variables that can lead to wildfire including the length of the fire season.",
      "By analysing weather observations, the scientists found that this has increased by around 23 days since the world began warming, around 1850.",
      "The team say that this means the dry conditions and the Santa Ana winds that are crucial for the spread of fires, are increasingly overlapping.",
      "Another key element is drought.",
      "Dry conditions in the LA area over the October to December period are now about 2.4 times more likely than before humans starting using fossil fuels on a large scale.",
      "The researchers are clear that climate change increased the probability of the hot, dry conditions that gave rise to the fires.",
      "However, the authors are more cautious about the link between rising temperatures and the longer fire season or decreased rainfall, saying that the models did not show a significant connection.",
      "Despite these reservations, the conclusion is that a warmer world increased the chances of the devastating wildfires occurring - as more fossil fuels continue to be burnt, those chances will continue to rise.",
      "\"Overall the paper finds that climate change has made the Los Angeles fires more likely despite some statistical uncertainty,\" said Prof Gabi Hegerl, from the University of Edinburgh, who was not part of the study team.",

      "The algorithm is used to select which notes are shown, and also to ensure they are found helpful by a range of users.",
      "In very simple terms, according to X, this \"bridging\" algorithm selects proposed notes that are rated helpful by volunteers who would normally disagree with each other.",
      "The result, it argues, is that notes are viewed positively across the political spectrum. This is confirmed, according to X, by regular internal testing. Some independent research also backs up that view.",
      "Meta says its community notes system will require agreement between people with a range of perspectives to help prevent biased ratings, \"just like they do on X\".",

      "Research indicates that more than 90% of proposed community notes are never used.",
      "This means accurate notes may go unused.",

    "summary": "Engineers are working on systems that can turn lunar regolith into useful elements like oxygen.",
    "story": [
      "Inside a giant sphere, the engineers pored over their equipment. Before them stood a silvery metal contraption swathed in colourful wires \u2013 a box that they hope will one day make oxygen on the moon.",
      "Once the team vacated the sphere, the experiment began. The box-like machine was now ingesting small quantities of a dusty regolith \u2013 a mixture of dust and sharp grit with a chemical composition mimicking real lunar soil.",
      "Soon, that regolith was gloop. A layer of it heated to temperatures above 1,650C. And, with the addition of some reactants, oxygen-containing molecules began to bubble out.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve tested everything we can on Earth now,\u201d says Brant White, a program manager at Sierra Space, a private company. \u201cThe next step is going to the moon.\u201d",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s experiment unfolded at Nasa\u2019s Johnson Space Center in the summer of 2024. It is far from the only such technology that researchers are working on, as they develop systems that could supply astronauts living on a future lunar base.",
      "Those astronauts will need oxygen to breathe but also to make rocket fuel for spacecraft that might launch from the moon and head to destinations further afield \u2013 including Mars.",
      "Lunar base inhabitants might also require metal and they could even harvest this from the dusty grey debris that litters the lunar surface.",
      "Much depends on whether we can build reactors able to extract such resources effectively or not.",
      "\u201cIt could save billions of dollars from mission costs,\u201d says Mr White as he explains that the alternative \u2013 bringing lots of oxygen and spare metal to the moon from Earth \u2013 would be arduous and expensive.",
      "Luckily, the lunar regolith is full of metal oxides. But while the science of extracting oxygen from metal oxides, for example, is well understood on Earth, doing this on the moon is much harder. Not least because of the conditions.",
      "The huge spherical chamber that hosted Sierra Space\u2019s tests in July and August this year induced a vacuum and also simulated lunar temperatures and pressures.",
      "The company says it has had to improve how the machine works over time so that it can better cope with the extremely jagged, abrasive texture of the regolith itself. \u201cIt gets everywhere, wears out all sorts of mechanisms,\u201d says Mr White.",
      "And the one, crucial, thing that you can\u2019t test on Earth or even in orbit around our planet, is lunar gravity \u2013 which is roughly one sixth that of the Earth. It might not be until 2028 or later that Sierra Space can test its system on the moon, using real regolith in low gravity conditions.",
      "The moon\u2019s gravity could be a real problem for some oxygen-extracting technologies unless engineers design for it, says Paul Burke at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "In April, he and colleagues published a paper detailing the results of computer simulations that showed how a different oxygen-extracting process might be hindered by the moon\u2019s relatively feeble gravitational pull. The process under investigation here was molten regolith electrolysis, which involves using electricity to split lunar minerals containing oxygen, in order to extract the oxygen directly.",
      "The problem is that such technology works by forming bubbles of oxygen on the surface of electrodes deep within the molten regolith itself. \u201cIt is the consistency of, say, honey. It is very, very viscous,\u201d says Dr Burke.",
      "\u201cThose bubbles aren\u2019t going to rise as fast \u2013 and may actually be delayed from detaching from the electrodes.\u201d",
      "There could be ways around this. One could be to vibrate the oxygen-making machine device, which might jiggle the bubbles free.",
      "And extra-smooth electrodes might make it easier for the oxygen bubbles to detach. Dr Burke and his colleagues are now working on ideas like this.",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s technology, a carbothermal process, is different. In their case, when oxygen-containing bubbles form in the regolith, they do so freely, rather than on the surface of an electrode. It means there is less chance of them getting stuck, says Mr White.",
      "Stressing the value of oxygen for future lunar expeditions, Dr Burke estimates that, per day, an astronaut would require the amount of oxygen contained in roughly two or three kilograms of regolith, depending on that astronaut\u2019s fitness and activity levels.",
      "However, a lunar base\u2019s life support systems would likely recycle oxygen breathed out by astronauts. If so, it wouldn\u2019t be necessary to process quite as much regolith just to keep the lunar residents alive.",
      "The real use case for oxygen-extracting technologies, adds Dr Burke, is in providing the oxidiser for rocket fuels, which could enable ambitious space exploration.",
      "Obviously the more resources that can be made on the moon the better.",
      "Sierra Space\u2019s system does require the addition of some carbon, though the firm says it can recycle most of this after each oxygen-producing cycle.",
      "Along with colleagues, Palak Patel, a PhD student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, came up with an experimental molten regolith electrolysis system, for extracting oxygen and metal from the lunar soil.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really looking at it from the standpoint of, \u2018Let\u2019s try to minimise the number of resupply missions\u2019,\u201d she says.",
      "When designing their system, Ms Patel and her colleagues addressed the problem described by Dr Burke: that low gravity could impede the detachment of oxygen bubbles that form on electrodes. To counter this, they used a \u201csonicator\u201d, which blasts the bubbles with sound waves in order to dislodge them.",
      "Ms Patel says that future resource-extracting machines on the moon could derive iron, titanium or lithium from regolith, for example. These materials might help lunar-dwelling astronauts make 3D-printed spare parts for their moon base or replacement components for damaged spacecraft.",
      "The usefulness of lunar regolith does not stop there. Ms Patel notes that, in separate experiments, she has melted simulated regolith into a tough, dark, glass-like material.",
      "She and colleagues worked out how to turn this substance into strong, hollow bricks, which could be useful for building structures on the moon \u2013 an imposing black monolith, say. Why not?",

      "Since Mr Musk's takeover companies have been choosing to leave the platform in what's been termed \"the great X-odus\".",

      "For example, between June 2022 and February 2023 antisemitic posts on X doubled, according to research by the Institute of Strategic Dialogue.",
      "More recently in the UK, Mr Musk's posts about British politics have stirred up controversy.",

      "There's no definitive way to know how many brands are choosing to leave or reduce their posts on the platform.",
      "When approached, X did not respond to the points raised in this article. But last year Mr Musk claimed X had 600 million monthly active users, and said the platform maintains its \"purpose is to serve the public conversation\".",

    "summary": "The founders of important open source software are getting older, who will take over?",
    "story": [
      "Many of us have prepared instructions and critical information for our family in the event of our sudden demise. For Daniel Stenberg, that includes passwords for his Google and GitHub accounts.",
      "That\u2019s because he\u2019s the founder of curl, an open source internet transfer engine that has been downloaded billions of times and is used to transfer data to and from computer servers.",
      "It was first released by Mr Stenberg in 1996 and is now used by millions every day.",
      "It's important that someone is able to maintain curl when he steps away.",
      "\u201cI just want to make sure that everything is there so the day I go away, someone can take over,\u201d Mr Stenberg says.",
      "It\u2019s a problem confronting many of the open source software pioneers who transformed the technology world in the 1990s and early 2000s.",
      "Their ethos was that anyone could contribute to the development of an open source application or operating system \u2013 and the software and underlying code could be used, modified, and distributed for free.",
      "The open source movement broke the stranglehold of big technology companies, spurred innovation and underpins much of today\u2019s technology landscape.",
      "In 1999, Loris Degioanni made his first contributions to an open source network analysis tool that eventually became Wireshark, as part of his master\u2019s thesis. \u201cMy concern was graduating,\u201d he says, not succession planning or the long-term future of the project.",
      "Almost 30 years on, Mr Degioanni is now CTO and founder of cybersecurity firm Sysdig, which is a key sponsor of Wireshark.",
      "\u201cWe're approaching the time when the founders of these early open source projects are starting to get old,\u201d he says.",
      "While projects do come and go, he explains, some remain relevant over the years, and founders and maintainers usually want to ensure they live on while there is demand. That\u2019s not just because they\u2019ve invested time in developing the code itself, but also because they have spawned communities, both virtual and in the real world.",
      "But while the likes of Mr Stenberg and Mr Degioanni can take action to ensure the keys to the kingdom are passed on, ensuring there is someone to pass them to can be a challenge.",
      "Many in the open source community worry there are not enough younger developers willing to get involved in contributing to or maintaining projects. This is often unpaid work after all.",
      "Even Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, the operating system which kick-started the open source revolution in the early 1990s, noted at the Open Source Summit Europe in September that the \u201ckernel maintainers are aging\u201d.",
      "Amanda Brock, CEO of OpenUK, a non-profit organization which represents the UK\u2019s open technology community, says younger developers might not appreciate the grip that closed software companies had in earlier decades.",
      "\u201cYou've got a next generation who haven't engaged as a philanthropic community and volunteer community in the same way, at the same scale.\u201d",
      "There are technology barriers to address too. Many key open source projects were originally written in C, a coding language first developed in the early 1970s.",
      "While C is still taught in universities, it is no longer widely used in the commercial world, Mr Degioanni explains. \u201cThe fact that C is the main language makes it harder to attract a younger generation.\u201d",
      "There are ways to work around this. Mr Degioanni says both Wireshark and a project he founded, Falco, rely on \u201cplug-ins\u201d, which can allow new functionality to be written in different languages.",
      "Mr Torvalds has given his blessing to the adoption of Rust as a programming language for Linux, while noting the \u201cRust versus C discussion has taken almost religious overtones in certain areas.\u201d",
      "When it comes to steering projects into the future, leaders and maintainers have the option of handing over control to foundations. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, for example, oversees 208 projects, with more than 250,000 contributors. Wireshark has its own independent foundation, with Mr Degioanni as a board member.",
      "Not everyone subscribes to the foundation model. Stenberg and his collaborators have kept curl completely independent. \u201cI'm much better off without being in their neighbourhoods and just running my own neighbourhood,\u201d he says.",
      "And foundations still face the issue of ensuring a steady supply of fresh developers to keep projects alive, he notes.",
      "Miss Brock says it\u2019s essential that the open source community consider how it encourages younger people to participate.",
      "This is about showing that while being a contributor can be challenging it\u2019s also career enhancing, giving young people an entry into established ecosystems and an opportunity to finesse and highlight their technical skills.",
      "\u201cIt's a way to help STEM talent flight,\u201d Miss Brock adds. \u201cBecause people can work from home in the UK or whatever country they\u2019re in.\u201d",
      "Degioanni is more sanguine. Even if there\u2019s \u201cprobably less visceral enthusiasm\u201d for the concept of open source, he says, the fundamental idea of being able to modify software is now a given.",
      "And, he continues, \u201cI've worked with open source my whole life. I've created my own projects. I've seen people join the projects that I created. I've seen people start their own open source projects.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, he says, there is a \u201cjoy, especially for a young person\u201d in creating software, seeing it being used and sparking a community.",
      "\u201cThat feeling doesn't get old,\u201d he says. Even if the pioneers who popularized the earliest open source projects do.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's pick for US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, was questioned by senators at his first confirmation hearing on Wednesday.",
      "The post of health secretary is a key federal government position that oversees public health issues, including medical research, food safety and public welfare programmes.",
      "Kennedy, who had been a vocal vaccine sceptic, was asked to explain his past comments on the Covid-19 vaccine and other immunisations. He also was asked about his views on abortion, and his opinions on the US food industry.",
      "His hearing was interrupted by shouting protesters, but he also received loud applause when he promised he would make America healthy again, a slogan used by the new administration.",
      "Here are five takeaways from Kennedy's first hearing.",
      "Delving into vaccine comments",
      "Throughout the hearing, senators brought up Kennedy's past comments about vaccination.",
      "A group he ran for eight years, Children's Health Defense, repeatedly cast doubt on the safety and efficacy of childhood vaccinations, and continues to push the debunked claim that vaccines cause autism.",
      "Kennedy insisted during the hearing that he was not anti-vaccine, and that he merely supports more stringent studies and safety tests for injections.",
      "He said he supports the current childhood vaccination schedule and insisted he was not a conspiracy theorist.",
      "\"That's a pejorative that's applied to me to keep me from asking difficult questions about powerful interests,\" he told senators.",
      "However, they zeroed in on his past comments, such as a quote taken from a 2023 podcast when he said: \"I think some of the live virus vaccines are probably averting more problems than they're causing. There's no vaccine that is safe and effective.\"",
      "He defended himself at the hearing, saying his words were taken out of context and that he was going to go on to say \"for all people\". But, Kennedy said, he was interrupted by the host, Lex Fridman, who said: \"Those are big words\".",
      "In the podcast interview, Kennedy went on to outline what he called safety problems with several common vaccines, including the polio vaccine, and later called vaccines \"inherently unsafe\", apparently quoting former President Ronald Reagan.",
      "'If you like a McDonald's cheeseburger ...'",
      "A key point during Kennedy's opening remarks and throughout the hearing was his criticism of processed foods in the US, which he said help drive the country's obesity epidemic.",
      "He promised to scrutinise chemical additives in food, and said he would work to remove the financial conflicts of interest in US agencies and the food industry.",
      "\"We will reverse the chronic disease epidemic and put the nation back on the road to health,\" he told the committee.",
      "Asked why he was a big advocate of nutrition-based disease prevention, Kennedy said that this generation has seen an \"explosion\" of autoimmune and allergic diseases, as well as diabetes.",
      "He later clarified that he does not want to take away access to processed food for Americans.",
      "\"If you like a McDonald's cheeseburger or a Diet Coke - which my boss loves - you should be able to get them,\" he said, referencing Trump's well-known affinity for the American fast-food chain.",
      "'Every abortion is a tragedy,' Kennedy told senators",
      "Kennedy, who previously stated that he was in favour of abortion rights, was asked about his stance on the issue by both Republican and Democratic senators.",
      "Republican Senator James Lankford asked Kennedy whether he plans to bring back conscience protections for doctors who do not want to perform the procedure because of religious or moral beliefs.",
      "Kenney responded by saying that forcing medical providers who believe abortion is murder to carry out the procedure \"doesn't make any sense\".",
      "Michael Bennet, a Democratic senator, then asked Kennedy about his past comments, in which he expressed support for abortion rights and said that governments should not be involved in a woman's right to choose.",
      "Kennedy started his response by saying: \"I believe every abortion is a tragedy.\"",
      "He later said he agreed with Trump that access to abortion should be controlled by individual states. Kennedy vowed to put his more liberal views aside, saying, \"I serve at the pleasure of the president. I'm going to implement his policies.\"",
      "This stance drew scrutiny from Democrats, including senator Maggie Hassan, who accused Kennedy of \"selling out\" his pro-choice values in order to secure President Trump's nomination.",
      "Senator Sanders pushes over 'unvaxxed' onesies",
      "Kennedy was asked by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a long-time advocate of universal healthcare, whether he believes the US should \"guarantee healthcare to all people as a human right.\"",
      "He responded by saying he cannot answer the question so simply.",
      "Kennedy posed a hypothetical situation of a 20-year cigarette smoker with lung cancer, then pondered whether that individual should have the same healthcare access as someone who does not smoke.",
      "The smoker, Kennedy said, would be \"taking from the pool\", referencing general health care costs.",
      "Sanders then criticised the pharmaceutical industry, saying that in the US patients pay more than people in European countries for the same drugs. He asked Kennedy if he was willing to \"end that absurdity.\"",
      "Kennedy responded: \"We should end that disparity\".",
      "Later, Sanders asked whether he supports baby clothes bearing anti-vaccine slogans. Some are sold by Children's Health Defense, the organisation that Kennedy founded.",
      "\"Are you supportive of these onesies?\" Sanders asked Kennedy, showing images of them to the rest of the committee.",
      "Kennedy responded that he has no oversight of the organisation and resigned from his position there.",
      "Some Republicans cheer Kennedy on",
      "As is typical, the nature and tone of the questions often differed depending on which side of the political aisle they were coming from.",
      "Democratic senators largely grilled him on his past anti-vaccine comments, his promotion of misinformation on health issues, and his knowledge of the US healthcare system, including Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "Some Republicans, however, focused their questions on Kennedy's advocacy for eradicating chronic disease in children and his criticism of the US food industry.",
      "One Republican senator in particular, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, said that Kennedy was the \"answer to his prayers,\" and that he was \"awesome\".",
      "Johnson himself has been criticised over anti-vaccine misinformation during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "As proceedings ended, Republican Senator and Finance Committee Chair Mike Crapo gave Kennedy his stamp of approval.",
      "\"I think you have come through well, and deserve to be confirmed,\" he told Kennedy.",
      "Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, on the other hand, accused Kennedy of delivering a \"word salad\" and ducking issues raised about his past anti-vaccine remarks.",
      "\"I find your presentation to be both untrustworthy and unprepared,\" Wyden said.",
      "Wednesday's hearing was before the Senate's finance committee. Kennedy faces a second confirmation hearing on Thursday before the health, education, labour and pensions committee, where he will face more questions from senators.",
      "The committees will then vote on his nomination before it can pass to the whole Senate for consideration."

    "story": [
      "Germany's parliament descended into heckles and recriminations on Wednesday after a \"firewall\" against working with the far-right cracked.",
      "A non-binding motion calling for tougher border and asylum rules passed with support from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). During the stormy session, politicians of various parties hurled criticism and blame at each other.",
      "Conservative CDU leader Friedrich Merz, who tabled the plans, defended his actions as \"necessary\". But Chancellor Olaf Scholz slammed the move as an \"unforgivable mistake\".",
      "Merz now plans to propose actual legislation on Friday \u2013 again with possible AfD backing \u2013 aimed at curbing immigration numbers and family reunion rights.",
      "But his proposed measures are highly unlikely to come into effect this side of February's snap election and \u2013 if they did \u2013 could clash with EU law.",
      "Referring to the AfD's support for the motion, the CDU leader told the Bundestag that a policy wasn't wrong just because the \"wrong people back it\".",
      "\"How many more children have to become victims of such acts of violence before you also believe there is a threat to public safety and order?\" he asked.",
      "The CDU leader \u2013 tipped to be Germany's next chancellor because of his party's leading position in the polls \u2013 has also insisted he has neither sought nor wants AfD support.",
      "\"Thinking about how the AfD fraction will cheer and their happy faces makes me feel uncomfortable,\" he told lawmakers.",
      "Chancellor Scholz \u2013 a social democrat whose coalition government collapsed last year \u2013 castigated Merz for his actions.",
      "\"Since the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany over 75 years ago, there has always been a clear consensus among all democrats in our parliaments: we do not make common cause with the far right.\"",
      "Germany's already fraught debate on immigration has flared up following a series of fatal attacks where the suspect is an asylum-seeker, most recently in the city of Aschaffenburg.",
      "It has become a central issue in campaigning for the election, triggered by the collapse of Scholz's governing coalition.",
      "Wednesday's CDU motion, supported by the AfD and liberal FDP, called for a \"ban\" on anyone entering Germany without the right documents \u2013 but it cannot compel the current minority government to act.",
      "It's hard to overstate the importance of the firewall against the far-right in German political culture. Remembrance of the Holocaust plays a fundamental role in modern Germany.",
      "Before Wednesday's vote, the Bundestag held its yearly commemoration for the victims of the Nazis, during which 88-year-old Holocaust survivor Roman Schwarzmann addressed parliament.",
      "German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier also delivered a speech to MPs, calling for the Nazis' crimes never to be forgotten. There should be no \"line drawn\" ending our historical responsibility as Germans, he said.",
      "This directly contradicts the policy of the AfD, which has criticised German memory culture and argued for a broader view of the country's history.",
      "That's partly why so many were shocked when Friedrich Merz said last week that he didn't care if the AfD supported his parliamentary motions or not.",
      "This contradicts not only his previous statements, but also the official line of his party, which bans the conservatives from relying on the far-right in parliamentary votes.",
      "Sections of the AfD have been classed as right-wing extremists by domestic intelligence, but the party is is currently polling second, although Merz has ruled out any kind of coalition with them.",
      "This week, latest polls showed that support for the conservative CDU had slipped a couple of percentage points to 28%, while the AfD increased slightly to 20%.",
      "AfD leader Alice Weidel has said the firewall amounts to an \"anti-democratic cartel agreement\" and has predicted it will crumble over the coming years.",
      "Opening the door to leaning on support from the far-right is a gamble for Merz, who believes that his increasingly radical stance on migration will win back right-wingers who are tempted to vote for the AfD.",
      "But in so doing, he could risk losing support from the centre.",
      "With these latest parliamentary motions, Merz has definitively said goodbye to the era of his more centrist conservative predecessor Angela Merkel, who a decade ago famously said \"wir schaffen das\" or \"we can do it\" when Germany was faced with large numbers of migrants and refugees.",
      "These motions are symbolic, signalling what the conservatives would like to do in power. But they are also a concrete signal to voters about who Merz appears prepared to accept support from.",
      "Critics say he has broken his word on the firewall. No wonder the AfD cheered in parliament when the result was announced."

      "Syria's de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa has been named president for the \"transitional period\", state media report, seven weeks after he led the rebel offensive that overthrew Bashar al-Assad.",
      "Rebel military commander Hassan Abdul Ghani also announced the cancellation of Syria's 2012 constitution and the dissolution of the former regime's parliament, army and security agencies, according to the Sana news agency.",
      "As president, Sharaa would form an interim legislative council to help govern until a new constitution was approved, he said.",
      "All rebel groups which opposed Assad in the 13-year civil war would be dissolved and integrated into state institutions, he added.",
      "The announcements came during a event in Damascus on Wednesday attended by the commanders of factions who fought alongside the rebel alliance led by Sharaa's Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). It was entitled the \"Conference for Announcing the Victory of the Syrian Revolution\".",

      "From Syrian jihadist leader to rebel politician: How Abu Mohammed al-Jolani reinvented himself",
      "Addressing the commanders wearing military uniform, Sharaa stressed that Syria's new leadership faced a \"heavy task and a great responsibility\".",
      "He said the first priority was to \"fill the power vacuum in a legitimate and legal way\". Secondly, he added, civil peace should be maintained by \"seeking transitional justice and preventing revenge attacks\".",
      "He also called for state institutions, particularly the military, security agencies and police, and economic infrastructure to be rebuilt.",
      "In late December, Sharaa told Al Arabiya TV in an interview that it would take up to four years to hold new elections.",
      "He said an up-to-date census would be required first which \"would take time\" and that writing up a new constitution would also take up to three years to complete.",
      "Sharaa also reiterated in the interview that he planned a \"national dialogue conference\", which he said would \"bring together all components\" of Syrian society.",
      "In 2011, Assad brutally crushed a peaceful pro-democracy uprising, sparking a civil war in which more than half a million people were killed and 12 million others forced to flee their homes.",

      "On 8 December, as the rebels entered Damascus after routing the army and sweeping down from the north in the space of only 12 days, Assad resigned the presidency and fled to Russia.",
      "An interim government led by Mohammed al-Bashir, the former head of the rebel administration in the north-west, has been tasked with running the country until March.",

      "Sharaa and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov discussed \"rebuilding trust with the Syrian people through concrete measures such as compensation, reconstruction and recovery\", Sana reported.",
      "The Russian foreign ministry said its delegation expressed \"unwavering support\" for Syria's unity and readiness to assist its recovery from the civil war.",
      "The Russian military carried out tens of thousands of air strikes on rebel-held areas after intervening in the conflict in support of Assad in 2015. A UK-based monitoring group says more than 21,000 people, including 8,700 civilians, were killed by those strikes and other Russian operations.",
      "Since the fall of the Assad regime, Russia has been withdrawing troops and weapons from its two bases on Syria's Mediterranean coast - Hmeimim airbase near Latakia and the naval base in Tartous",
      "Recent satellite photos analysed by BBC Verify showed that two Russian warships were docked at Tartous, which experts said suggested an evacuation of the facility had begun.",
      "However, Russia is believed to be seeking to retain both bases, which give it a strategically important foothold in the eastern Mediterranean.",
      "Following the Russian delegation's visit to Damascus, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow: \"That was an important trip, and the contacts were important, too, because it is necessary to establish and maintain a constant dialogue with Syria.\"",
      "When asked about reports that the Syrian government had requested Assad's extradition and war reparations in return, he replied: \"I leave this without any comments. We will continue further dialogue with the Syrian authorities.\"",

    "title": "Fear among migrants as Trump administration raids ramp up",
    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 19:00:18 GMT",
    "summary": "As more raids take place across the country, some migrants say they are avoiding work or school over fears of arrest.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has ramped up arrests of undocumented migrants in major cities around the US, detaining thousands of people including criminals and those without criminal histories alike.",
      "Since the president took office on 20 January, there have been raids in cities including Chicago, New York, Denver and Los Angeles.",
      "In some communities, the arrests have prompted some migrants to skip work or keep their children home from school.",
      "On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that while arrests of criminals will be prioritised, nobody in the country illegally is \"off the table\".",
      "More than 3,500 undocumented migrants have been arrested since Trump returned to the White House, including just over 1,000 on Tuesday, 969 on Monday and 1,179 on Sunday, according to daily statistics published by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).",
      "By comparison, an average of 310 were made during the 2024 fiscal year, when former President Joe Biden was in office, according to the agency.",
      "Immigration officials have described these raids as \"targeted enforcement operations\" that have resulted in the arrest of violent gang members and dangerous suspects, and have deputised agents from other federal law enforcement agencies to help step up arrests.",
      "\"I haven't seen anything remotely like this, and it's just the first few days of the presidency,\" said Gina Amato Lough, the California-based director attorney for the Immigrants Right Project, a division of a law firm, Public Counsel. \"Nothing of this magnitude.\"",
      "She said the \"stated intention is to create shock and awe\".",
      "\"It's working,\" she said. \"It's also creating terror in the community.\"",
      "The White House and ICE have publicised some of these arrests, showing pictures of the suspects and providing details of their countries of origin and crimes, which have included sex crimes, assaults and drug-trafficking offences.",
      "But the White House has made it clear that any undocumented migrant caught up in these raids - whether criminals or not - are subject to arrest and deportation, even though simply being in the US illegally is a civil matter.",
      "Earlier this week, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed that \"all of them\" are criminals.",
      "\"They illegally broke our nation's laws, and, therefore, are criminals are far as this administration goes,\" she told reporters on Tuesday.",
      "The arrests have already had a chilling effect on many immigrant communities across the US.",
      "Ms Lough, for example, said that undocumented clients have expressed a fear about going to any government agency - even to get a driver's licence - or seeking medical attention in hospitals.",
      "\"We're hearing people are terrified, and we're getting calls left and right,\" said Michael Lukens, the executive director of the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, an organisation which provides free legal representation to undocumented migrants detained by authorities.",
      "\"People are scared to go to work, or to send their kids to schools,\" he said, adding  the Trump administration has blocked his organisation's efforts to enter detention facilities to meet with detainees.",
      "\"That's exactly what the White House wants - to instil fear in people and make them leave,\" he said. \"That's not something we've ever seen.\"",
      "Among those who have expressed fear is Gabriela, a Bolivian migrant who entered the US over 20 years ago, hiding under a pile of corn stalks in the boot of a smuggler's case on the journey.",
      "Now a housekeeper in Maryland, Gabriela was initially unconcerned by Trump's election victory, believing that he would only target criminals and that many migrants would benefit from an improved economy.",
      "But nine days into the administration, she says she's grown fearful, along with many of her neighbours, after seeing that ICE had conducted operations in nearby communities.",
      "\"Lots of people in my building have stopped sending their children to schools. Nobody is even going to church now,\" she told the BBC. \"We're tuning into mass online.\"",
      "Gabriela said she's begun packing her belongings in the hopes that, if arrested and deported, acquaintances might be able to ship them back to Bolivia.",
      "Another undocumented migrant, a Mexican national named Carlos who lives in New York City, told the BBC concerns over possible arrests have driven some underground.",
      "\"We heard that ICE came to a building not far from me,\" said Carlos, whose son is a US citizen born in New York.",
      "Like Gabriela, Carlos was initially cautiously optimistic about Trump's electoral win and thought he would indirectly benefit from Trump's promises to boost the economy and lower inflation.",
      "\"It's scary. I've been avoiding being out on the street more than I need to,\" he added. \"I don't have a problem with criminals being arrested. But we keep hearing that other people - workers - are also being taken away.\"",
      "Both Gabriela and Carlos asked to be identified only by their first names, fearing retribution or attention from authorities.",
      "It is unclear how many of those arrested have criminal histories and how many are what have been what the first Trump administration termed \"collateral\" arrests.",
      "NBC has reported that on 26 January, only 52% of those taken into custody were considered \"criminal arrests\", citing administration officials .",
      "The BBC has contacted the White House for comment on the figures.",
      "When asked about the number at a press briefing on Tuesday, Ms Leavitt said only that anyone who \"broke our nation's laws\" is a criminal.",
      "The raids by ICE form part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to clamp down on undocumented migration into the US, which has also included declaring an emergency at the southern border and expanded processes that allow for rapid expulsions.",
      "On Thursday, Trump signed the so-called Laken Riley act into law, requiring undocumented immigrants who are arrested for theft or violent crimes to be held in jail pending trial.",
      "The bill, named after Laken Riley - a Georgia nursing student murdered last year by a Venezuelan man, was approved by Congress last week, an early legislative win for the the administration.",
      "At the signing, Trump said the government would move to set up a 30,000-person facility for undocumented detainees, doubling the government's holding capacity and taking the US \"one step further to eliminating the scourge of migrant crime\".",

      "He says the atmosphere at the base was one of excitement and nerves. \"It was a very important mission,\" he says.",
      "Col Dr Banov says the return begins with an introduction between the hostages and medical staff.",
      "The returned hostages are assigned a physician, a nurse and a social worker who \"accompany them all the way through\" to them being taken to hospital.",
      "Families are advised to give the hostages \"a little bit of time\" with the medical teams before the reunion to allow them to \"breathe and understand that [they're] in a safe place again\".",
      "Giving hostages agency",
      "\"We start with vitamins, something small to eat and drink, and then the families,\" Col Dr Banov says.",
      "As part of a \"grounding\" process, he says, efforts are made to give the released hostages agency to make their own decisions, with questions like: \"Would you like to take a shower before or after you meet your parents?\"",
      "Of the first seven hostages to be released, he says most had \"some sort of shrapnel injuries\" as well as suffering from malnutrition and metabolic problems.",
      "\"They're not good physically, mentally it's a very complicated issue,\" he says.",
      "In the coming weeks, he notes, the bodies of dead hostages will also arrive, with plans in place to transfer them to a forensic laboratory before funerals in Israel.",
      "After receiving initial treatment at the reception point, the surviving hostages are transferred in a \"specially adapted\" helicopter to a hospital elsewhere in the country.",
      "Col Dr Banov says: \"We tell them\u2026 we will take a helicopter back home. And then, if you're willing to, we're going to start talking about what you have been through.\"",
      "It is there that the proper recovery process begins."

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 18:14:17 GMT",
    "summary": "In a huge blow to Ecowas, Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger are leaving to forge ahead with their own group.",
    "story": [
      "Three countries under military rule have officially left West African regional bloc Ecowas, after more than a year of diplomatic tensions.",
      "The withdrawal of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger is a huge blow to Ecowas, which at 50 years old is considered Africa's most important regional group.",
      "The split was sparked after the three departing countries refused Ecowas demands to restore diplomatic rule.",
      "On Wednesday Ecowas said it would keep its \"doors open\" to Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, even though they have forged ahead with their own bloc, the Alliance of Sahel States (AES by its French acronym).",
      "What is Ecowas?",
      "Ecowas - which stands for the Economic Community of West African States - was founded in 1975 in a bid to improve economic and political integration in West Africa.",
      "Prior to Wednesday's shake-up, the bloc had 15 members, including states like Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Senegal.",
      "Citizens of all Ecowas countries currently have the right to live and work in all member states, while goods can circulate freely.",
      "Why have Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso left?",
      "Relations between Ecowas and the three Sahel countries have been tense since the military seized power in Niger in 2023, Burkina Faso in 2022 and Mali in 2020.",
      "After the Niger coup, Ecowas imposed crippling sanctions on the country, such as border closures, a no-fly zone for all commercial flights and the freezing of central bank assets.",
      "Ecowas also threatened to deploy its forces to Niger in order to restore democratic rule.",
      "But this hard line merely strengthened the resolve of the three juntas.",
      "Mali and Burkina Faso criticised Ecowas' \"inhuman\" sanctions and vowed to defend Niger if the bloc intervened militarily.",
      "After being suspended by Ecowas, the three states hit back by giving notice last January that they would withdraw in a year, meeting the timeline set by the bloc for states that decide to leave.",
      "Negotiations between Ecowas and the juntas have taken place since then - but have failed.",
      "The three countries accuse Ecowas of being too close to Western powers and have instead pivoted towards Russia.",
      "How will the withdrawal affect the three countries?",
      "According to the departing countries, they will now experience greater sovereignty and also independence from a force that has a foreign agenda.",
      "But analysts say Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso may struggle outside the bloc - these are poor and landlocked countries whose economies depend on their West African neighbours.",
      "While Ecowas works out the terms of its future relationship with the three countries, it says it will continue to recognise all passports and identity cards bearing the Ecowas logo held by citizens from Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso.",
      "The countries will also remain in the bloc's free-trade scheme.",
      "Similarly, AES chairman, Mali's military ruler Assimi Go\u00efta, said last January that the right of Ecowas citizens to \"enter, circulate, reside, establish and leave the territory\" of the new bloc would be maintained.",
      "Ilyasu Gadu, an international affairs expert and media consultant based in Nigeria's capital Abuja, told the BBC: \"The three junta leaders have taken steps to say: 'Yes, we are pulling out of Ecowas but we want to maintain our relationships. We will not close our borders' because they must have realised that if they do that, they would have shot themselves in the foot.\"",
      "West Africa observers are also concerned the withdrawal will worsen security in the region. The Sahel - the semi-arid region just south of the Sahara Desert that includes the three departing countries - is wracked with jihadist insurgencies and now accounts for \"almost half of all deaths from terrorism globally\", a senior UN official said in April.",
      "Ecowas was supporting Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger in their fight against the jihadists, but this help may now be rescinded, observers fear.",
      "Although the juntas now receive weapons and mercenaries from Russia, the militants continue to inflict heavy casualties on both civilians and the armed forces.",
      "How will Ecowas be impacted?",
      "Ecowas will lose 76 million of its 446 million people and more than half its total geographical land area.",
      "There are also concerns the withdrawal will weaken both regional unity and cooperation in combatting insurgencies.",
      "The split \"worsens a legitimacy crisis of ECOWAS which has often failed people's expectations in upholding the rule of law,\" Ulf Laessing, head of the Sahel program at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, told the Associated Press.",
      "\"That the three poorest member states decided to leave the bloc makes Ecowas in the eyes of its citizens look even more like a loser in this conflict.\"",
      "How do residents of Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso feel?",
      "On Tuesday, some people in the three departing countries' capitals took to the streets to celebrate the withdrawal.",
      "But not everyone supports the juntas' decisions.",
      "Omar Hama from Niger said he wished the three countries had remained in Ecowas, while simultaneously belonging to the AES.",
      "\"I would have liked them to overcome their differences because we have a common space, same people with historical similarities and same economic realities,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Fatouma Harber, a journalist and blogger living in Mali, is worried that the change may eventually cause administrative and economic hassles for her and other citizens of the three countries.",
      "\"However, if the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) can really bring benefits for us, that would be an excellent thing,\" she said.",
      "Zabeirou Issa, who lives in Mali's capital Bamako, took a firmer stance, saying: \"Ecowas does not have any power, it is the Westerners who decide for the Ecowas leaders. Yes, I am very happy about the decision.\"",
      "In Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso's capital, Cisse Kabore told the BBC she wanted her country to remain in Ecowas because now the region \"will no longer be united as before\".",
      "What happens next?",
      "Last month, Ecowas said it would give Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali a six-month grace period for them to reconsider their withdrawal.",
      "However, at a press conference on Wednesday, Ecowas Commission head Omar Alieu Touray said: \"Any state can decide to come back in the community at any time.\"",
      "To consolidate their exit from Ecowas and strenghten their alliance, the three countries said they would begin circulating new AES passports on Wednesday.",
      "They have also decided to join forces to create a 5,000-strong military unit to fight the jihadist violence that has plagued the nations for years.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 06:00:08 GMT",
    "summary": "Scheme to avoid tax on offshore billions may have been botched because money was managed from the UK, BBC learns.",
    "story": [
      "Sanctioned Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich could owe the UK up to \u00a31bn after a botched attempt to avoid tax on hedge fund investments, evidence seen by the BBC suggests.",
      "Leaked papers reveal investments worth $6bn (\u00a34.7bn) were routed through companies in the British Virgin Islands (BVI). But evidence suggests they were managed from the UK, so should have been taxed there.",
      "Some of the money that funded Chelsea FC when Mr Abramovich owned it can be traced back to companies involved in the scheme, the BBC and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) also found.",
      "The oligarch's lawyers said he \"always obtained independent expert professional tax and legal advice\" and \"acted in accordance with that advice\".",
      "Mr Abramovich - who now reportedly divides his time between Istanbul, Tel Aviv and the Russian resort of Sochi - denies having any knowledge of or being personally responsible for any unpaid tax.",
      "Joe Powell, a Labour MP who leads a Parliamentary group on fair taxation, called on HM Revenue and Customs to \"urgently\" investigate the case to recover what could be \"very significant amounts of money that could be invested in public services\".",
      "At the heart of the scheme was Eugene Shvidler, a former Chelsea FC director and a billionaire businessman in his own right, who is currently challenging the UK government's decision to sanction him for his close links to Mr Abramovich.",
      "Mr Shvidler moved to the USA after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but from 2004 until 2022 he lived in the UK, with properties in London and Surrey.",
      "A tax expert told the BBC that evidence Mr Shvidler had been making strategic decisions on the investments while based in the UK, and not in the BVI, was \"a pretty big smoking gun\", suggesting the companies should have been paying UK tax.",
      "Lawyers for Mr Shvidler said the BBC was basing its reporting on \"confidential business documents that present an incomplete picture\" and had \"drawn strong and erroneous conclusions as to Mr Shvidler's conduct\".",
      "They said \"the structure of investments\" was \"the subject of very careful and detailed tax planning, undertaken and advised on by leading tax advisors\".",
      "The scheme involving Mr Abramovich's hedge fund investments was revealed in a huge leak of data that the BBC and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism have been examining for over a year - thousands of files and emails from a Cyprus-based company that administered Mr Abramovich's global empire.",
      "The BBC and its media partners, including The Guardian, have been reporting on the leaked files since 2023 as part of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists' Cyprus Confidential investigation. On Tuesday, we revealed how Mr Abramovich had dodged millions in VAT on the running costs of his yacht fleet.",
      "The leaked data shows how Mr Abramovich invested a large part of the wealth he acquired in the 1990s through a corrupt deal - ploughing it into a company in the BVI called Keygrove Holdings Ltd.",
      "A network of British Virgin Islands companies owned by Keygrove invested this money - up to $6bn (\u00a34.8bn) between the late 1990s and early 2020s - into Western hedge funds, according to the leaked files.",
      "These investments made the oligarch an estimated $3.8bn (\u00a33.1bn) in profits over almost two decades. By making the investments through companies in the BVI, which does not levy tax on corporate profits, the scheme appears to be set up to ensure as little tax as possible was paid.",
      "'Full power to do anything'",
      "It is not unusual for businesses to legally avoid paying tax on their profits by making their investments from companies in tax havens. But the companies involved must be managed and controlled offshore where they are incorporated.",
      "If an offshore company's strategic decisions are being taken by someone in the UK, its profits could be taxed as if it were a UK company.",
      "The leaked documents show how the directors of the BVI investment companies handed sweeping powers over them to Mr Shvidler, who was living in the UK and gained British citizenship in 2010.",
      "The BBC has seen \"general power of attorney\" documents dated between 2004 and 2008, that gave him the \"broadest possible powers\" and \"full power to do everything and anything\" to investment companies in the BVI.",
      "From 2008, Mr Shvidler appears to have acquired the power to direct the investments of Keygrove, which owned the BVI companies, through another company.",
      "Millennium Capital Ventures Ltd, which was owned indirectly by Mr Shvidler's wife and appointed him as a director in 2000, became Keygrove's investment manager. It was assigned \"full power and authority to supervise and direct\" the investment of the assets, \"all without prior consultation with client\".",
      "'Strong evidence'",
      "Further evidence of Mr Shvidler's crucial role in the investment decisions of the BVI companies emerged in a court case brought in September 2023 by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against a New York firm called Concord Management.",
      "The SEC filing says that Concord had only one client, since identified as Mr Abramovich. The company advised on investment decisions for the oligarch's BVI companies.",
      "It identifies a \"longtime close associate\" of Mr Abramovich, referred to as \"Person B\", who \"made investment decisions\" for Mr Abramovich.",
      "It says he was \"the point of contact for receiving investment advice\" and \"for either deciding or communicating the decision whether to go forward with recommended transactions\".",
      "Using the leaked documents, the BBC was able to identify \"Person B\" as Eugene Shvidler.",
      "The evidence suggests Mr Shvidler was making the decisions described by the SEC, managing and controlling Mr Abramovich's investments, from the UK rather than the BVI.",
      "Tax expert Rita de le Feria told the BBC that evidence a UK resident, such as Mr Shvidler, was taking \"strategic big decisions\" on the hedge fund investments was a \"clear indication\" the huge profits should have been taxed by the UK.",
      "\"I think this is a pretty big smoking gun. That would be, again, strong evidence that the effective management of the company was not taking place in the BVI,\" she said.",
      "Mr Shvidler's lawyers said there can be \"no question of Mr Shvidler, either knowingly or negligently, being involved in an unlawful scheme to avoid paying tax\".",
      "Lawyers for Mr Abramovich said that in addition to the advice he obtained over his tax affairs, he \"expects that similar advice was sought\" by those with responsibility for running companies related to him.",
      "The leaked documents also reveal how large amounts of the untaxed profits from Mr Abramovich's hedge fund investments passed through a network of the oligarch's companies before flowing into Chelsea FC.",
      "The hedge fund investments flowed back into his companies in the BVI and then into Keygrove, their parent company.",
      "Keygrove then loaned out money to other companies in Mr Abramovich's network, which in turn lent money to Camberley International Investments Ltd - a company set up to bankroll Chelsea FC.",
      "By 2021, when Chelsea won the Champions League, Club World Cup and UEFA Super Cup, hundreds of millions of dollars in loans to the club could be traced back to companies benefiting from Mr Abramovich's untaxed hedge fund investments.",
      "How we calculated the bill",
      "If HMRC were to investigate, how much could Mr Abramovich or the companies concerned owe?",
      "We have assessed the profits made by the investment companies in the BVI from 1999 to 2018.",
      "The leaked documents only contain complete accounts for the companies investing in hedge funds from 2013 to 2018.",
      "But we can estimate how much money the companies involved were likely to have made over the entire period by looking at their \"revenue reserves\". These are profits kept in the businesses, rather than being paid out to shareholders. By the end of 2018 this amounted to $3.8bn.",
      "Applying historical UK corporation tax and currency conversion rates to the revenue reserves up to 2012, and the yearly profits to 2018, amounts to a potential tax bill of more than \u00a3500m owed to HMRC.",
      "But in the event of an enquiry into unpaid tax, HMRC can also impose late payment interest and penalties for failure to notify the authorities.",
      "If tax has gone unpaid, then depending on whether an investigation concluded those responsible knew but did not tell HMRC, or whether they did not know, the total amount due could range from almost \u00a3700m to over \u00a31bn.",
      "There is a possibility that some tax on the profits could not be recovered, as HMRC investigations can only go back a maximum of 20 years.",
      "However, our calculations are also likely to be an underestimate, because we have applied the lowest rate of corporation tax that existed between 1999 and 2012, and it is possible profits had been extracted from the companies in that period that we have not included in our sums.",
      "In any event, Mr Abramovich's tax bill could dwarf the \u00a3653m bill imposed on Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone in 2023.",
      "Frozen funds",
      "Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the British government allowed Roman Abramovich to sell Chelsea FC to Todd Boehly. It did so on the condition that \u00a32.5bn from the proceeds would be donated to charities supporting victims of the war in Ukraine.",
      "Nearly three years later, the money still sits in a frozen Barclays bank account, reportedly due to disagreement over how it should be spent, with Mr Abramovich wanting the money to go to \"all the victims\" of the war, and the UK government insisting it should be spent solely on humanitarian aid in Ukraine.",
      "The BBC's investigation suggests that, just as Ukrainians are waiting for money from the former Chelsea boss, so is the British taxpayer.",
      "Cyprus Confidential is international collaborative investigation launched in 2023 led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) into Cyprus firms provided corporate and financial services to associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin's regime, based on documents from a corporate service provider originally obtained by the whistleblowing group Distributed Denial of Secrets.",

      "For a while, Beijing seemed to fumble with its answer to ChatGPT, which is not available in China.",
      "Unimpressed users mocked Ernie, the chatbot by search engine giant Baidu. Then came versions by tech firms Tencent and ByteDance, which were dismissed as followers of ChatGPT - but not as good.",
      "Washington was confident that it was ahead and wanted to keep it that way. So the Biden administration ramped up restrictions banning the export of advanced chips and technology to China.",
      "That's why DeepSeek's launch has astonished Silicon Valley and the world. The firm says its powerful model is far cheaper than the billions US firms have spent on AI.",
      "So how did a little-known company - whose founder is being hailed on Chinese social media as an \"AI hero\" - pull this off?",
      "DeepSeek: the Chinese AI app that has the world talking",
      "China's DeepSeek AI shakes industry and dents America's swagger",
      "Watch DeepSeek AI bot respond to question about China",
      "The challenge",
      "When the US barred the world's leading chip-makers such as Nvidia from selling advanced tech to China, it was certainly a blow.",
      "Those chips are essential for building powerful AI models that can perform a range of human tasks, from answering basic queries to solving complex maths problems.",
      "DeepSeek's founder Liang Wenfeng described the chip ban as their \"main challenge\" in interviews with local media.",
      "Long before the ban, DeepSeek acquired a \"substantial stockpile\" of Nvidia A100 chips - estimates range from 10,000 to 50,000 - according to the MIT Technology Review.",
      "Leading AI models in the West use an estimated 16,000 specialised chips. But DeepSeek says it trained its AI model using 2,000 such chips, and thousands of lower-grade chips - which is what makes its product cheaper.",
      "Some, including US tech billionaire Elon Musk, have questioned this claim, arguing the company cannot reveal how many advanced chips it really used given the restrictions.",
      "But experts say Washington's ban brought both challenges and opportunities to the Chinese AI industry.",
      "It has \"forced Chinese companies like DeepSeek to innovate\" so they can do more with less, says Marina Zhang, an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney.",
      "\"While these restrictions pose challenges, they have also spurred creativity and resilience, aligning with China's broader policy goals of achieving technological independence.\"",
      "The world's second-largest economy has invested heavily in big tech - from the batteries that power electric vehicles and solar panels, to AI.",
      "Turning China into a tech superpower has long been President Xi Jinping's ambition, so Washington's restrictions were also a challenge that Beijing took on.",
      "The release of DeepSeek's new model on 20 January, when Donald Trump was sworn in as US president, was deliberate, according to Gregory C Allen, an AI expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "\"The timing and the way it's being messaged - that's exactly what the Chinese government wants everybody to think - that export controls don't work and that America is not the global leader in AI,\" says Mr Allen, former director of strategy and policy at the US Department of Defense Joint Artificial Intelligence Center.",
      "In recent years the Chinese government has nurtured AI talent, offering scholarships and research grants, and encouraging partnerships between universities and industry.",
      "The National Engineering Laboratory for Deep Learning and other state-backed initiatives have helped train thousands of AI specialists, according to Ms Zhang.",
      "And China had plenty of bright engineers to recruit.",
      "Is China's AI tool DeepSeek as good as it seems?",
      "BBC's AI correspondent explains why DeepSeek has caused shockwaves",
      "The talent",
      "Take DeepSeek's team for instance - Chinese media says it comprises fewer than 140 people, most of whom are what the internet has proudly declared as \"home-grown talent\" from elite Chinese universities.",
      "Western observers missed the emergence of \"a new generation of entrepreneurs who prioritise foundational research and long-term technological advancement over quick profits\", Ms Zhang says.",
      "China's top universities are creating a \"rapidly growing AI talent pool\" where even managers are often under the age of 35.",
      "\"Having grown up during China's rapid technological ascent, they are deeply motivated by a drive for self-reliance in innovation,\" she adds.",
      "Deepseek's founder Liang Wenfeng is an example of this - the 40-year-old studied AI at the prestigious Zhejiang University. In an article on the tech outlet 36Kr, people familiar with him say he is \"more like a geek rather than a boss\".",
      "And Chinese media describe him as a \"technical idealist\" - he insists on keeping DeepSeek as an open-source platform. In fact experts also believe a thriving open-source culture has allowed young start-ups to pool resources and advance faster.",
      "Unlike bigger Chinese tech firms, DeepSeek prioritised research, which has allowed for more experimenting, according to experts and people who worked at the company.",
      "\"The Top 50 talents in this field might not be in China, but we can build people like that here,\" Mr Liang said in an interview with 36Kr.",
      "But experts wonder how much further DeepSeek can go. Ms Zhang says that \"new US restrictions may limit access to American user data, potentially impacting how Chinese models like DeepSeek can go global\".",
      "And others say the US still has a huge advantage, such as, in Mr Allen's words,  \"their enormous quantity of computing resources\" - and it's also unclear how DeepSeek will continue using advanced chips to keep improving the model.",
      "But for now, DeepSeek is enjoying its moment in the sun, given that most people in China had never heard of it until this weekend.",
      "The new AI heroes",
      "His sudden fame has seen Mr Liang become a sensation on China's social media, where he is being applauded as one of the \"three AI heroes\" from southern Guangdong province, which borders Hong Kong.",
      "The other two are Zhilin Yang, a leading expert at Tsinghua University, and Kaiming He, who teaches at MIT in the US.",
      "DeepSeek has delighted the Chinese internet ahead of Lunar New Year, the country's biggest holiday. It's good news for a beleaguered economy and a tech industry that is bracing for further tariffs and the possible sale of TikTok's US business.",
      "\"DeepSeek shows us that only if you have the real deal will you stand the test of time,\" a top-liked Weibo comment reads.",
      "\"This is the best new year gift. Wish our motherland prosperous and strong,\" another reads.",
      "A \"blend of shock and excitement, particularly within the open-source community,\" is how  Wei Sun, principal AI analyst at Counterpoint Research, described the reaction in China.",
      "Fiona Zhou, a tech worker in the southern city of Shenzhen, says her social media feed \"was suddenly flooded with DeepSeek-related posts yesterday\".",
      "\"People call it 'the glory of made-in-China', and say it shocked Silicon Valley, so I downloaded it to see how good it is.\"",
      "She asked it for \"four pillars of [her] destiny\", or ba-zi - like a personalised horoscope that is based on the date and time of birth.",
      "But to her disappointment, DeepSeek was wrong. While she was given a thorough explanation about its \"thinking process\", it was not the \"four pillars\" from her real ba-zi.",

      "Protesters in Kinshasa, the capital of Democratic Republic of Congo, have been burning portraits of Rwanda's president and tearing up Rwandan flags as M23 rebels have taken control of most the eastern city of Goma.",
      "Their fury is focused on Rwandan President Paul Kagame, who they accuse of backing the rebels - an accusation long made by the UN.",
      "To put it bluntly, a group of UN experts maintains the Rwandan army is in \"de facto control of M23 operations\", detailing how M23 recruits are trained under Rwandan supervision and supported by high-tech Rwandan weaponry.",
      "Goma, which lies at the foot of a volcano near Lake Kivu, sits on the border with Rwanda. It is the capital of mineral-rich North Kivu province - and is an important trading and humanitarian hub and the base for the UN's largest peacekeeping mission.",
      "The city had also become a refuge for those fleeing the conflict between M23 fighters and the army that erupted again in late 2021 - with the population swelling to around two million.",
      "They all face further turmoil as fighting erupted there on Sunday night with loud explosions echoing through the streets, which are now strewn with bodies. The exact circumstances of what is going on is unclear as phone lines are down and electricity and water supplies have been cut off. But the M23 seem to have captured most, if not all, of the city.",
      "\"There was no question that there are Rwandan troops in Goma supporting the M23,\" said UN peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix, though he added that it was it was difficult to tell the exact numbers on the ground in Goma.",
      "Tellingly some Congolese army soldiers in Goma who surrendered on Monday, did so by crossing over the border into Rwanda.",
      "Since the conflict begun, President Kagame has repeatedly denied any involvement in supporting the M23 rebels, who are well equipped, well armed and well trained.",
      "However, this response has noticeably shifted as accusations continue to grow with \"overwhelming evidence\" showing Rwanda's support for the rebel group, according to Richard Moncrief, International Crisis Group's project director for the Great Lakes",
      "\"The tone has changed to justification for defensive measures,\" he told the BBC. \"It has become harder to deny Rwanda's support for M23.\"",
      "On Sunday, Rwanda's foreign ministry said in a statement: \"This fighting close to the Rwandan border continues to present a serious threat to Rwanda's security and territorial integrity, and necessitates Rwanda's sustained defensive posture.\"",
      "It said it was concerned by \"misguided or manipulative\" statements that lacked context about the conflict.",
      "For Kagame, the context all comes down to the Rwandan genocide that took place over 100 days in 1994.",
      "The ethnic Hutu militia involved in killing up to 800,000 people - the vast majority from the Tutsi community - fled to what is now DR Congo, some forming the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR).",
      "This rebel group is still active in the notoriously unstable eastern DR Congo - and still includes some of those responsible for the genocide.",
      "Kagame, who headed the rebel Tutsi force that ended the killing more than three decades ago, sees this \"genocidal militia\" as an existential threat.",
      "His government has twice invaded DR Congo, saying it wants to stop Hutu rebel groups from staging cross-border attacks.",
      "Earlier this month he called out his Congolese counterpart, F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi, for failing to deal with the FDLR and talk to the M23, saying this was exacerbating the conflict.",
      "Mr Moncrief believes that the targeting of Goma is more about making a political point as he says the M23 does not need the city strategically as it already \"controls many more lucrative areas\".",
      "\"It is President Kagame's way of exerting power over who is in charge of North Kivu,\" said the Great Lakes expert.",
      "Rwanda accused the military governor of North Kivu, who was killed in fighting last week, of collaborating with the FDLR.",
      "The discovery of this kind of high-level collaboration, experts agree, would have been like a red flag to a bull for Rwanda.",
      "The M23's origins are tied to these tensions - it is the latest incarnation of a rebel group that says it is fighting for the interests of the minority Tutsi community in eastern DR Congo.",
      "Its first uprising more than a decade ago ended with a peace deal - when its fighters disarmed and mainly moved into camps in Uganda.",
      "But three years ago, they began leaving the camps saying the deal was not honoured and within a couple months was seizing territory.",
      "The UN peacekeeping mission - first deployed in 1999 - is not mandated to go on the offensive. Two regional forces - an East African one followed by a southern African one - specially deployed over the last few years at the request of Tshisekedi have failed to contain the M23.",
      "This gives an indication of the M23's sophisticated operations.",
      "According to the UN group of experts, this includes five months of training at the M23's main base in Tchanzu, hilly terrain not far from Rwanda's border, that incorporates courses on theory and ideology and then practical elements including \"war tactics\", \"engagement rules'' and \"bush tactics\".",
      "It said Rwandan officers were often at the camp, where recruits, including children, were brought - some joining up on a voluntary basis, others forced to do so in a systematic operation where local chiefs had to provide conscripts.",
      "The experts said Sultani Makenga, who once fought for Kagame in the early 1990s in Rwanda and is now the M23's military chief, attended some of the passing-out ceremonies between 25 September and 31 October 2024 that involved 3,000 recruits.",
      "Rwanda's spokesperson Yolande Makolo did not address the question of whether Rwandan officers were in the M23 camp but she did deny the charges about child soldiers, telling the BBC last year: \"The claim about recruiting minors in camps is absurd, it's blatant information warfare against Rwanda.\"",
      "However UN expert reports detail how the M23's strength has grown since May when numbers were put at around 3,000.",
      "The experts estimate that between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwandan army troops are on the ground in DR Congo - saying it based this on authenticated photographs, drone footage, video recordings, testimonies and intelligence.",
      "Captured M23 fighters said that the Rwandans were known as the \"Friendly Force\", with the experts' December report saying the English term was \"generically used\" even when interviewees were speaking in other languages.",
      "They said these Rwandan special forces were there to train and support the rebels, and they did not interact with M23 regulars.",
      "Rwanda's ally Uganda, unhappy about another rebel group in DR Congo that threatens its security, has also been accused of helping the M23 - with its officers also spotted at Tchanzu. The UN experts say Uganda has also supplied weapons, hosted rebel leaders and allowed cross-border movements of M23 fighters - accusations Kampala denies.",
      "Kagame recently expressed his frustration that after Tshisekedi came to power in 2019, his suggestion that Rwanda work alongside the Congolese army to tackle the FDLR had been rebuffed - unlike a joint offensive by DR Congo and Uganda against the Islamist Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels.",
      "This may explain the re-emergence of the M23 in 2021 - with evidence showing Rwanda's backing of the group continues to grow.",
      "Cl\u00e9mentine de Montjoye, senior researcher in the Africa division at Human Rights Watch, told the BBC that geolocated images placed Rwandan troops in Sake, a town just outside Goma last week.",
      "The UN experts say the M23's decision to capture the mining town of Rubaya, which fell to its forces in May, was \"motivated by a strategic need to monopolise\" the lucrative trade in coltan, which is used to make batteries for electric vehicles and mobile phones.",
      "Its December report says the group now collects at least $800,000 (\u00a3643,000) a month from the taxation of coltan in Rubaya - and ensures that around 120 tonnes of the coveted mineral is sent directly to Rwanda every four weeks.",
      "It includes satellite images to show how a road was widened by September on the Congolese side of the Kibumba border crossing to allow access for heavy trucks that were previously unable to use the route into Rwanda.",
      "Ms De Montjoye explained how the advanced weapons being used by the M23 were not available to any other of the numerous armed groups operating in eastern DR Congo.",
      "\"Earlier last year, we documented how Rwandan forces, and M23 had fired 122mm rockets, hitting displacement camps,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"It's certainly with the kind of military support that the M23 has received that they've been able to make such an advance [on Goma].\"",
      "The UN experts have documented many such examples, including the use of Israeli-made anti-tank guided missiles.",
      "Mr Moncrief said the M23 was also using technology to interfere with Global Positioning System (GPS) that had stopped the Congolese army from flying drones it had acquired from China.",
      "The UN experts said the \"spoofing and jamming\" near areas controlled by M23 and the Rwandan army had also disrupted other aircraft.",
      "President Kagame has dismissed these UN reports, pouring scorn on their \"expertise\" and saying they ignore many outrages committed in DR Congo to focus on \"imaginary problems\" created by the M23.",
      "The East African Community \u2013 currently headed by Kenya's president - is now trying to mediate, though Tshisekedi has said he will not attend a hastily organised emergency summit.",
      "Observers say Rwanda's president will be telling any mediator that the FDLR is the only subject up for discussion as he is adamant their presence makes DR Congo an unsafe neighbour - something he reiterated at a press conference earlier this month.",
      "\"Honestly, for the last 30 years if anyone wanted to understand what the problems are [in DR Congo] and what solutions should be, you don't even need to be an expert,\" Kagame said.",

    "story": [
      "Teddy bears \u2013 large and small - are clustered around the grave of Adam Buhayov as if keeping him company.",
      "But the 17-month-old is not alone. His mother Sophiia Buhayova, 27, is buried in the grave with him, in a bleak and windswept cemetery in Ukraine's southern city of Zaporizhzhia.",
      "Adam's great-grandmother, Tetiana Tarasevych, 68, is in the grave right beside them.",
      "All three were killed together on 7 November last year by a Russian attack in a war that has devoured Ukraine since 2022 \u2013 but which no longer dominates the international agenda.",
      "Some of Adam's last moments were captured by Tetiana in a video on her phone. The two of them were out on a walk with Adam's mum Sophiia. Blond-haired, blue-eyed Adam wears a red anorak and a woollen hat, with a Mickey Mouse sticker on the front. \"Don't take off your hat,\" Tetiana tells him gently, \"you will be cold\".  He does it anyway.",
      "One hour later the trio were at home, about to get a bite to eat, when a Russian guided aerial bomb sliced through their block of flats. Adam, Sophiia and Tetiana were killed, along with six other civilians.",
      "Sophiia's mother Yuliia Tarasevych, 46, now struggles to carry on - without most of her family, without her past and her future.",
      "She is slight, and swamped by a heavy black coat and by grief.",
      "\"I don't know how to live,\" she says. \"It's hell on earth. I lost my mother, my daughter, and my grandson in one second.\" The closest she can get to them now is at their graves.",
      "\"My dear Mum,\" she says weeping, and stroking a photograph of Tetiana \u2013 a doctor like her - attached to a wooden cross. One step brings her to the grave of Sophiia and Adam. She leans down to touch his photo, calling him \"my little kitten\".",
      "Then she speaks directly to a photo of Sophiia - a black and white image of a young woman with long dark hair. \"My beautiful daughter,\" she cries, \"I am sorry I could not save you.\"",
      "Sophiia's father, 60-year-old Serhiy Lushchay, is by her side - a robust figure who shares her loss and her sorrow. \"We visit the graveyard often,\" Yuliia says, \"and we will as long as we live, because it truly makes it a little easy for us\".",
      "Every time they come, there are more graves stretching out into the distance. The cemetery is expanding \"at a staggering pace,\" Yuliia says. Rows of blue and yellow flags, marking the graves of fallen soldiers, pierce the sombre grey sky.",
      "Zaporizhzhia, where the family lived, is a regular target for Russian forces. It is a strategically important industrial city, near front-line fighting. Europe's largest nuclear power plant \u2013 about 55km (34 miles) from the city \u2013 is held by the Russians.",
      "On the day of the attack that killed Sophiia, Tetiana and Adam, Yuliia called her daughter from western Ukraine, where she was on a work trip.",
      "\"I told her to be careful. Bombs had been falling over the city since the morning. She said: 'Thank you mum, don't worry. Everything will be fine with us.'\"",
      "Serhiy was at work when he heard something had happened. He too called his daughter, but there was no reply.",
      "Then, on his local residents' WhatsApp group he saw a message saying: \"Friends, who else is still left under the rubble?\"",
      "\"I rushed home praying all the way,\" he says, \"but my prayers were already in vain\".",
      "\"When I arrived, all I saw was ruins. I wandered around looking for my balcony. I don't know how much time passed \u2013 two or three hours \u2013 and I realised there was nothing left, and no hope of rescue.\"",
      "In the days that followed some belongings were reclaimed from the rubble - a china cup of Sophiia's, somehow unbroken, a toy fish Adam played with in the bath, and the little red jacket he wore on his last walk. These are now family treasures, along with many precious memories.",
      "\"Every evening when I came home from work, I would take Adam for a walk,\" says Serhiy. \"He was very curious about the sky. He'd point his little finger up, and we'd tell him about it. And he loved birds.\"",
      "Another family video shows Adam hoisted in Sophiia's arms, being swung from side to side, and then running around on the ground, surrounded by pigeons. \"He had almost started talking,\" Yuliia says, \"and he was always smiling. He was healthy, beautiful and smart. He and my daughter made us happy every day\".",
      "After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Yuliia had taken Sophiia to safety in the UK.",
      "The young woman put her language skills to use, working as a translator for Ukrainian troops being trained by the British military, but she could not stay away from Ukraine.",
      "\"She really missed her parents and her relatives and the country,\" Yuliia says. Sophiia returned and later gave birth to Adam in June 2023.  She also took up psychology because \"she knew a lot of people in Ukraine needed psychological help,\" her mother says.",
      "In the midst of her grief, Yuliia knows that Ukraine may soon come under pressure to negotiate with the enemy that robbed her of so much.",
      "President Trump is back into the White House \u2013 all guns blazing -  pushing for peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv. But both Yuliia and Serhiy are adamant that Ukraine must fight on. She tells me Donald Trump's claim that he could end the war in a day was \"funny to hear\".",
      "\"Russia is an aggressor, that came to our country, and destroyed our homes, and our families,\" Yuliia says. \"So, there can be no talk of any ceasefire or peace talks. If we leave this glutton [Russian President Vladimir Putin] with our territories and do not avenge the people we lost, we will never win.\"",
      "Serhiy says the only contact with Russians on Ukrainian territory should be through combat.",
      "Many Ukrainians believe that even if there is a ceasefire, Russia will come back for more sooner or later \u2013 as it did in 2022, eight years after annexing the Crimean Peninsula. Moscow now controls almost one fifth of Ukraine.",
      "Time is not on Ukraine's side. In 2025 there is danger on several fronts - a lack of manpower, a possible reduction in future US military aid, and fading international attention.",
      "Yuliia accepts that life goes on in other countries.",
      "\"People can't live in constant stress, thinking only about us,\" she says.",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 00:06:25 GMT",
    "summary": "A kabaddi club has helped Indian girls find new opportunities and become financially independent as adults.",
    "story": [
      "Meena's eyes dart from left to right and back again, searching for the fleeting moment when she can make her move.",
      "She is playing Kabaddi, an Indian contact sport now played in more than 50 countries across the world.",
      "A Kabaddi game is played between two teams, each with seven players. Individuals take turns to run into the opposition's half of the pitch to tag opponents and make it back to their own half without being tackled to the ground.",
      "But for 14-year-old Meena, this is about more than winning points. The sport offers an escape from a restricted, rural life and opens up a world of opportunities.",
      "\"It feels different when I play,\" she says shyly, struggling to find the words. \"In that moment, I am not the Meena who is bound to housework, weighed down by pressures and expectations. It's just me and the opponent\u2026 It feels like I am more powerful than other girls who don't play.\"",
      "Meena lives on the outskirts of a small tribal village, Kudoshi, about 230km away from India's financial capital, Mumbai, where girls' lives traditionally revolve around household chores, marriage and children.",
      "But 15 years ago, a group of teachers at the village school decided they wanted to give girls more opportunities.",
      "\"I have a daughter. I want her to achieve things in life, live the best life she can, be something,\" says one of them, Daji Rajguru. \"Why can't girls play Kabaddi and make a career out of it?\"",
      "So he and his colleagues, who had played Kabaddi when they were younger, thought it would be good to teach local girls how to play. The pooled their savings - 5,000 rupees ($60; \u00a350) - persuaded the school to let them use its grounds, and opened what they believe was the region's first all-girls Kabaddi club.",
      "At the start, just two girls, who were pupils at the school, joined up. \"Parents were not ready to let their girls play Kabaddi as it meant spending a lot of time away from home,\" he says. \"They also worried about the impact it might have on their daughter's marriage prospects,\" as traditional families would not approve of girls going out and coming home late.",
      "Daji and his colleagues went door to door reassuring parents their daughters would be safe playing Kabaddi at training sessions before and after school. They reassured them they would supervise the girls properly and not let them be distracted by boys.",
      "At the start, the teachers would pick the girls up from their homes and drop them off, but as numbers grew they were no longer able to do that. Now, there are about 30 girls in the club and they estimate that about 300 have trained with them since they began coaching, including Daji's own daughter. Some start playing as young as seven years old.",
      "Like the rest of the members of the club, Meena trains for two hours before school and two hours after classes finish. She has to leave home at dawn and doesn't get back until nightfall.",
      "\"I go alone and it's dark [in the morning]. I used to be afraid that somebody could do something to me. My family was not supportive then, and are still unhappy with my choice to become a sportswoman,\" she says.",
      "But she is persevering, inspired by club members who have excelled over the years and joined state teams or local leagues.  Siddhi Chalke and Samreen Burandkar were among the first batch of girls who trained at the club for about eight years. Now, at the age of 25, they are professional league players and are financially independent.",
      "At the start, their families thought playing Kabaddi was a phase that would pass, and when the women decided to make a career of it, their parents were not happy. There is still pressure for them to get married but at the same time their families are also proud that the women are doing well.",
      "\"No-one in my family earns as much as I do,\" says Samreen. \"I now live in a big city and get to make my own choices. Coming from my community, it's difficult for girls to go after what they want. I am only here because of Kabaddi,\" she says.",
      "Siddhi plays on the same team as Samreen - their friendship born out of Kabaddi. They have travelled around India for competitions, winning medals and championships. \"I could only do that because of Kabaddi. Otherwise, I would have been married and ended up at my husband's place washing the dishes,\" says Siddhi and they both laugh, seemingly relieved that they have escaped this fate.",
      "Excelling in sports in India can also help players get jobs in the public sector. Indian states allocate jobs for high achievers in sports, guaranteeing an income even after a player's active sporting years are over.",
      "Many rural girls take up sport with the dream of getting financial independence via these jobs. It can also help them get greater respect and a sense of identity.",
      "\"When we started the sports club, no-one gave any importance to these girls. They were always secondary citizens in their homes, in society,\" says Vilas Bendre, a young coach at the club.",
      "\"But we realised that when rural girls climb ahead in their lives through sports, their lives change significantly. The way they talk, the way they carry themselves, their lifestyle, everything changes.\"",
      "Even if they haven't become professional sportswomen, many members of the club have seen their confidence grow and have persuaded their families to let them go to university and delay marriage until they are older.",
      "The community has become more accepting too, and when they see girls exercising, people don't frown at them any more.",
      "The club is funded by the coaches, cash prizes that the team win in competitions and occasional donations. Most of the girls are from poor and underprivileged families and don't have to pay any subscription fees.",
      "As well as training in term time, the club organises and funds residential sports camps at the school in the summer, provides food such as eggs, bananas and milk, and often pays for treatment for players' injuries.",
      "Over time, parents' fears have been assuaged, but critics sometimes question the coaches' motives. \"People say things indirectly like. 'Why don't you coach boys?'\" says Daji. But he says there are already opportunities for boys, and there is a gap when it comes to girls.",
      "\"We are not just their coaches,\" adds Vilas. \"At times we are their parents, guiding them, disciplining them, helping them make the right choice.\"",
      "And Meena knows the potential of this prized opportunity: \"I want to be the best raider and become the captain of India's Kabaddi team,\" she says, daring to dream about medals, championships and leaving an ordinary village girl's life behind.",

    "summary": "In her new musical, \"Redwood,\" the Tony Award-winning star of \"Wicked\" and \"Rent\" plays a woman seeking a refuge, and a purpose, by escaping into a redwood forest.",
    "story": [
      "Last fall, when superstar Idina Menzel wasn't in New York, she hung out in Oakland, Calif. At Bandaloop Studios, she was learning to dance suspended at the end of a rope \u2026 and this from a woman who says she isn't much of a dancer on the ground. \"I don't know what I'm doing!\" she exclaimed.",
      "But when you see exactly why she was doing this, it suddenly all makes sense.",
      "In the new Broadway musical \"Redwood,\" the audience is transported to the heart of the redwood forest, and seemingly into the trees themselves. It's loosely inspired by a woman named Julia Butterfly Hill, who, in the late '90s, spent more than two years living in a thousand-year-old redwood to save it from being cut down. Her effort worked: the tree was saved.",
      "And now, Menzel and writer-director Tina Landau are taking their own leap of faith with an idea they've been kicking around for more than a decade.",
      "Asked if she was ever worried that their experiment would fail, Landau said, \"Yes, I'm still worried. I didn't know. But it was one of those passion projects for both myself and Idina where it was just like, let's just trust that what is meant to happen will happen.\"",
      "\"Redwood\" is about a workaholic mom who runs away from it all, and finds herself in the redwood forest where her life is changed forever.",
      "One of the themes of the show is based on the fact that 300-foot redwoods actually support each other. Landau said, \"Their roots only go five or six feet into the ground. Their roots go sideways instead of down, until they reach the roots of other trees, and they intertwine with those. So, all the trees end up holding each other up.\"",
      "To listen to Idina Menzel perform \"Great Escape,\" from the musical \"Redwood,\" click on the video player below:",
      "The musical, which is currently in previews, is all-new, but Menzel is on familiar ground. She's performing at the Nederlander Theatre, which is the same theatre where she opened in \"Rent\" in 1996. \"Yeah, it's like a homecoming for me. It's full circle. It's very emotional for me. When I did 'Rent,\" that was the first professional job I ever had \u2013 and it was a Broadway show. So, I was super-lucky. That was a beautiful time in my life.\"",
      "It was beautiful. She was 25 years old, and her performance in \"Rent\" put her squarely on the map, with a Tony Award nomination. \"I got a record deal that I always wanted to get,\" she said. \"I wanted to be signed to a record label so badly and make my own album, and I did. And that was a dream come true. But then I only sold, like, three albums. So, then I got dropped from the label. And then by that time, my whole kind of momentum of being this Tony-nominated actress from the hit musical 'Rent,' it sort of dissipated. And then I had to kind of keep pounding the pavement again. It wasn't until 'Wicked' that things started to really look up again.\"",
      "As the original Wicked Witch Elphaba in Broadway's \"Wicked,\" Menzel won a Tony, and helped turn the show into a mega-hit, though it wasn't always easy being green. Asked what Elphaba gave her, Menzel replied, \"Green ears for the rest of my life!\"",
      "Idina Menzel performs \"Defying Gravity\" from \"Wicked\" on \"The Late Show With David Letterman\":",
      "And then, she was an animated princess in Disney's \"Frozen,\" singing the song that millions of would-be princesses couldn't get out of their heads. \"My relationship with 'Let It Go' is fabulous,\" she said. \"It's one of the best things that's ever happened to me. People always say, 'Do you get sick of a song like that?' And maybe they think I'm lying to you, but I really don't.\"",
      "Idina Menzel, as Elsa, performs \"Let It Go\" in \"Frozen\":",
      "\"When I was a little girl, if I would have dreamt that I'd be up there singing a song like this, I wouldn't have believed it. Or, no, I would have, 'cause I really was very cocky when I was little, and I actually, you know, believed in myself and thought, 'Definitely, it's definitely gonna happen for me.'\"",
      "But the task of writing Menzel's next big song went to someone who'd never written for a big Broadway star (or for anyone). \"Redwood\" is composer Kate Diaz's very first show, but you'd never know it. Asked what it's like to write for The Idina Menzel, Diaz said, \"It's amazing. I had never written for anybody else before, so great place to start, for sure! What an incredible voice to write for.\"",
      "I asked, \"Is there a little part of you that's like, 'Let me just see if she can do this'?\"",
      "\"I mean, she usually can,\" Diaz replied, \"So, not really.\"",
      "And she can do it on demand, as she demonstrated in the new \"Wicked\" film where she brought back her classic vocal riff.",
      "Her new show offers a different way to go green: an immersion in a leafy redwood forest. Even the seats in the newly-remodeled Nederlander are green. For Menzel it's almost hard to believe: \"It's just so rare that you get to see it come to fruition after so many years, and they're literally loading things into the Nederlander as we speak. That accomplishment isn't lost on me, and it's just, I'm so emotional about it.",
      "And now she's hoping to defy gravity, again. \"But I think green and being high, flying, literally or figuratively, is just something that I must respond to or attract in my life, in my characters,\" Menzel laughed. \"And I'm kind of happy with that!\"",

      "And while he's part man, he's all dog. \"Oh, yeah, yeah. The man part doesn't really come out that much,\" Pilkey said.",
      "But in addition to all the fun, Pilkey tries to layer meaning into the Dog Man books, even in their titles, from \"The Scarlet Shedder\" and \"Fetch-22,\" to \"Lord of the Fleas,\" and \"A Tale of Two Kitties.\" \"I was looking at Charles Dickens' 'A Tale of Two Cities,' which is such a wonderful book. It talks about sacrifice, self-sacrifice, and the value of that.\"",

They were all introduced not only to audiences, but to powerful film distribution companies, at the annual festival held high in the Wasatch Mountains of Utah.",

What if we created something, an opportunity, for those people to get their films made and have them distributed? \u2026 The smaller stories. The more offbeat stories. The more controversial.\"",
      "Which is why he wanted his non-profit Sundance Institute to be held as far away from profit-focused Hollywood as possible. So, he set it up amid the pines and aspens of Utah's Provo Canyon, on land he bought after the success of \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\"",
      "Close said, \"You are surrounded by nature in a way that, if you're from a city, it's undeniable,\" she said. \"It's a spiritual thing. And I think that was very important for Bob.\"",

      "You don't choose Sundance; Sundance chooses you.",
      "Michelle Satter, the Institute's founding senior director, has been by Redford's side since 1981. \"We'll get 3,000 scripts; we'll select 12,\" she said. \"That's a tiny number. But there are a lot of people globally who want to tell stories, and we believe in the power of storytelling.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do you know when you've found a unique story or a unique talent?\"",

      "\"It's not about ego,\" Harris said. \"It's not about anything other than learning, making mistakes. I love the work. It's all about the work, and I learn as much as I probably help anybody.\"",
      "All the Sundance \"Fellows,\" as they're called, bring projects already in the works, like Hannah Gray Organschi, polishing up her upcoming feature film. \"There's tough feedback, like, feedback that's good,\" she said. \"And to have that at the phase where you can really be deepening and honing the characters and story is, it feels lucky.\"",
      "Casey Modderno was fine tuning her rom-com: \"The questions I think that you're normally asked as a filmmaker are, like, about budget, about accessibility, about market response. And so, to be asked questions about the feeling of the film and the aesthetics of the film and the texture, and just go deep in craft, it's, like, super-special.\"",
      "And then there's Sean Wang. \"This experience has just, like, changed my DNA as a filmmaker,\" he said.",
      "What got him accepted to Sundance was his screenplay for his first feature film, \"Didi.\" He had been toiling away on the film pretty much by himself with his crew for six years. \"I was just obsessed with, 'Who won Sundance this year? Who won the Audience Award? Who won the Jury Prize? What's the next filmmaker that is coming out of Sundance?'\" he said.",
      "Turns out he was one of those Sundance filmmakers. Last year, \"Didi\" not only won two of the Sundance Film Festival's top prizes; it got him a distribution deal.",
      "Wang notes that Sundance doesn't finance films. \"They have no financial stake in your movie,\" he said. \"When we sell the movie, they're not like, 'Great. Where's our 10%?' It's a very giving environment. Obviously they want your films to succeed.\"",
      "This year the California wildfires cast a long shadow over the festival. Michelle Satter's home, where we did our interview, is now gone, as are so many others.",
      "None of those victims were forgotten in Utah this past week. As Satter told the audience, \"We lost our village, but at the end of the day, we are the village.\"",
      "As for Robert Redford, the visionary who started it all is now 88. He hasn't been here in person for the last three years, but his spirit remains. Independent film has forever been changed \u2013 a legacy that he and others have taken to the box office bank.",
      "Glenn Close said, \"He put his money where his mouth is. And you know, I'm in awe of that. And I salute him for it.\"",

      "Adam Ross, the acclaimed author of \"Mr. Peanut,\" returns with \"Playworld\" (Knopf), a novel dipped in nostalgia and flecked with love and sorrow, about a child actor coming of age as the object of attraction for an older woman.",
      "Read an excerpt below.",
      "\"Playworld\" by Adam Ross",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Prologue",
      "In the fall of 1980, when I was fourteen, a friend of my parents named Naomi Shah fell in love with me. She was thirty-six, a mother of two, and married to a wealthy man. Like so many things that happened to me that year, it didn't seem strange at the time.",
      "Two decades later, when I finally told my mother\u2014we were on Long Island, taking a walk on the beach\u2014she stopped, stunned, and said, \"But she was such an ugly woman.\" The remark wasn't as petty as it sounds. If I was aware of it then, it neither repulsed me nor affected my feelings for Naomi. It was just a thing I took for granted, like the color of her hair.",
      "Wiry and ashen, it had the shading but not the shimmer of pigeon feathers. Naomi kept it long, so that it fell past her shoulders. I knew it by touch, for my face was often buried in it. Only later did I wonder if she considered herself unattractive, because she always wore sunglasses, as if to hide her face, large gold frames with blue-tinted prescription lenses. When we were driving together, which was often that year, she'd allow these to slide down her nose and then look at me over their bridge. She might've considered this pose winning, but it was more likely to see me better. Her mouth often hung slightly open. Her lower teeth were uneven, and her tongue, which pressed against them, always tasted of coffee.",
      "Naomi's car was a silver Mercedes sedan\u2014300sd along with turbo diesel nickel-plated on the back\u2014that made a deep hum when she drove. The interior, enormous in my mind's eye, was tricked out with glossy wood paneling and white leather, back seat so wide and legroom so ample they made the driver appear to be far away. It was in this car that Naomi and I talked most often. We'd park, and then she'd lean across the armrest to press her cheek to mine, and I'd sometimes allow her to kiss me. Other times we'd move to the back. Lying there with Naomi, her nose nuzzled to my neck, I'd stare at the ceiling's dotted fabric until the pattern seemed to detach and drift like a starred sky. This car was her prized possession, and like many commuters, she had turned the machine into an extension of her body. Her left thumb lightly hooked the wheel at eight o'clock when traffic was moving, her fingertips sliding to eleven when it was slow. She preferred to sit slightly reclined, her free hand spread on her inner thigh, though after she lost her pinky the following summer, and even after being fitted with a prosthesis, she kept it tucked away.",
      "\"I was worried you'd think it was disgusting,\" she said, the digit hidden between the seat and her hip. She'd bought herself a diamond ring to hide the seam, and for the most part the likeness was uncanny, but at certain angles you could tell\u2014the cuticle's line was too smooth, the nail's pale crescent too creamy to match the others. Like my father's fake teeth, which he occasionally left lying around our apartment, I was fascinated by it, though my curiosity wasn't morbid. I was a child actor, you see, a student of all forms of dissembling, and had long ago found my greatest subject to be adults.",

      "It was meant to be a harmless prank. Not even a prank, not initially.",
      "An inside joke, only for the three of them. But now she was locking her apartment door behind two departing police officers.",
      "She had managed to sound appropriately earnest but unworried when they began asking questions. After all, why should May Hanover, of all people, be nervous around police? May was the good girl, always. The one who only needed to be told once by a teacher to open a book to a specific page. The teenager who drove strictly within the limits of her learner's permit. Even her pug, Gomez, seemed to understand at an instinctive level why he needed to break away from his neighbor buddies to ride the building's service elevator while they strutted brazenly with their humans through the lobby.",
      "May, simply put, was a rule follower. A rule enforcer, in fact. It was a trait that had helped her succeed in life, but, as she had learned, could also lead to trouble.",
      "Josh emerged from the bedroom where he'd gone to give her privacy when the police arrived. Gomez waddled slightly behind him. \"Was that about Roland Shaw?\"",
      "Shaw was the man she'd convicted in her final in-person trial as an assistant district attorney after he was found breaking into his next victim's apartment. \"How'd you know?\" Could a question be a lie? That one probably counted. So many lies since she'd gotten home yesterday from her long weekend in the Hamptons.",
      "\"That was a major case for you. I recognized the big guy from the news.\"",
      "The trial was before she and Josh had found themselves suddenly living together. Before they were engaged. The media coverage consisted of two small articles in the Post, including a photograph of a defiant-looking May flanked by two detectives in the courthouse hallway\u2014one of them the \"big guy\" Josh recognized. Whereas May was obsessed with all things crime-related\u2014in her job, the news, truth or fiction\u2014Josh found it all, quote, \"dark and depressing.\" But Josh was interested in all things May-related. Of course he had followed the coverage.",
      "\"The DA's Office got an inquiry from another jurisdiction and needed to clear something up,\" she said. Misleading, but technically true.",
      "\"They couldn't just call you?\" he asked.",
      "\"Actually, he called, but I didn't see the message.\" That one was a full-on lie. \"Guess he's training a new guy and wanted a change of scenery.\"",
      "\"Well, I'm glad they were quick. I really wanted a Negroni but thought the sound of a cocktail shaker might be inadvisable while you were in official law enforcement mode.\"",
      "\"Another reason why you should stir,\" she said. \"I like what I like.\"",
      "\"Make two? I'm getting back into my comfy clothes.\" She called Lauren once she was alone in the bedroom. \"Hey there, woman. We were just saying we miss you.\"",
      "\"Yes, we miss you!\" Kelsey called out in the background. \"Come back here right now. It's boring without you.\"",
      "May could hear a few drinks' worth of enthusiasm in Kelsey's voice. \"You're clearly having a miserable time. Absolutely suffering.\" She felt a knot form in her sternum as she steeled herself to explain why she was calling. \"I don't even know how to say this, but the police are probably going to call you. Both of you.\"",
      "\"What? How would they even know about us?\" Lauren asked. \"They came to my apartment. They asked who I was with. I didn't have a choice. They have your names. And your phone numbers.\"",
      "\"How? Were there cameras or something?\"",
      "\"No, it was because of me. I'm so sorry.\"",
      "What had she gone and done? No one was supposed to know about any of their stupidity. And now something really, really bad was going to happen\u2014she could feel it. Something she couldn't control. She wanted to open her mouth wide to scream\u2014to scream impossibly loudly again, like last time.",

      "The wisest souls say that pure mountain air makes us all go a little mad. A wind\u2014lawless and long-tailed\u2014slices through the snow-stippled Apuan alps and the Apennines with all the wantonness of La Befana, the winter witch. Swifts catch this wind on their wings, carving up the crisp blue morning. Dipping down into the valley, the wind now worries over the murmuring blue tongue of the Serchio river on its journey to the Tyrrhenian Sea. It slips\u2014an unseen spirit\u2014under Devil's bridge. Shivers along the great gray hunch of the Devil's back. Hissing over every ancient stone. Rising from the river, the wind picks up speed, hastening toward the woods. Hurtling toward chestnut trees spaced like the pews of a great Duomo. The wind now weaves between golden leaves. Whispering quick consonants between the branches, borrowing an autumnal aura. Sweet sigh of ripe chestnuts and shed leaves. And here\u2014where the wind steals woodland scents\u2014hides a curiosity. Cloistered by soil, moss, stone and leaf litter, a thing unseen\u2014a thing quite mysterious\u2014lies in waiting.",
      "A thing that sits buried, like old bones.",
      "What lies under the soil has stayed secret. It is an underground barterer. A schemer who has set a trap in the soil. A sylvan swindler. A tormentor.",
      "A tiny god.",
      "Swelling to irresistible bulk, it has ripened into a knobbled fruit of corruption. And now the time has come. The tiny god releases a lusty sigh, soundlessly unfurling a phantom into the wind.",
      "No more visible than the notes of nightingale song.",
      "No more audible than a wordless wish.",
      "The tiny god has released a cipher.",
      "The breath of the tiny god is whisked away by the breeze, slipping through the damp woodland of chestnut worship. Deeper into the woods, the breath in the breeze paints the pupils of a fallow deer into great glistening lakes. Fur stiffens along a back freckled in the white of first snow. The doe salivates in answer to the call of the stranger she can smell but cannot see. Her nostrils flutter, messages flood her bloodstream. But the breath blows on.",
      "Now a wild sow lifts her moist snout from the leaf litter and inhales a slip of the wind. Instantly intoxicated, her muddy snout snuffing. The grunting sow is aroused into a frenzy. Bristled legs stab at the soil as she arranges them to assume her stance, ready to receive the boar she smells. Turning her head toward her tail, she hunts for him, but\u2014and here is the trick, here is the olfactory deception\u2014there is no boar and the breeze blows on through the woods, fanning the sensual scent along with it.",
      "See-through scarves of scent curl from the forest and swirl toward a beautiful medieval village, perched upon a peak. Its tallest point an 11th century bell tower with memories of steel swords and shields. The wind, pickled with flavors of the forest, ridden by the breath of the tiny god, tickles trees of olive and cyprus. Until it dangles its string of little calamities above cobblestone streets and terracotta roof tiles.",
      "And it settles upon the medieval village like a spell.",

    "story": [
      "Abortion opponents praised Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Wednesday, after he vowed at a Senate hearing to implement \"whatever\" position President Trump takes on regulating abortion pills, if confirmed as the next secretary of health and human services.",
      "Kennedy's pledge comes as conservatives have stepped up pressure on the Trump administration to force the Food and Drug Administration to roll back decisions that eased restrictions on the abortion pill mifepristone, also known as Mifeprex.",
      "If confirmed as head of the department that oversees the FDA, Kennedy would have broad authority over how the pills are regulated, among a number of powers that HHS has to affect access to abortion nationwide.",
      "\"Today, we received clear signals that the prolife movement can work with RFK Junior. Acknowledging that every abortion is a tragedy left my team applauding,\" John Mize, head of the conservative group Americans United for Life, said in a statement.",
      "Mize's group led a \"coalition of leading pro-life organizations\" ahead of the hearing that called on the Trump administration to step up restrictions on the abortion pill or pull it from the U.S. market altogether, ending access to the medication abortion option, even in states where abortion is legal.",
      "\"President Trump has asked me to study the safety of mifepristone. He has not yet taken a stand on how to regulate it. Whatever he does, I will implement those policies and I will work with this committee, make those policies make sense,\" Kennedy told the Senate Committee on Finance.",
      "Kennedy also told the committeee that the president had \"made it clear to me that he wants me to look at safety issues, and I'll ask NIH and FDA to do that.\"",
      "Democrats on the Senate panel expressed alarm about Kennedy's apparent openness to restricting mifepristone.",
      "\"Women deserve to know if Mr. Kennedy will abuse his power as our country's chief health officer to essentially implement a national abortion ban by restricting access to the safe and legal medication,\" said Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking member on the committee.",
      "After the hearing, a spokesperson for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America said the group was looking forward to Kennedy's second round Thursday before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.",

      "\"The American people deserve an HHS Secretary with a firm commitment to protecting life, who doesn't fall for or promote health-related misinformation,\" the group said on X.",
      "Democrats also pointed to Kennedy's long record of voicing support for abortion, including a previous statement that he supported abortion up to full term.",
      "\"You have clearly stated in the past that bodily autonomy is one of your core values. The question is, do you stand for that value or not? When was it that you decided to sell out the values you've had your whole life in order to be given power by President Trump,\" New Hampshire Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan asked Kennedy at the hearing.",
      "Kennedy said multiple times during the hearing that he now agrees \"with President Trump that every abortion is a tragedy\" and serves \"at the pleasure of the president.\"",
      "\"President Trump has told me that he wants to end late-term abortions. And that he wants to protect conscience exemptions and that he wants to end federal funding for abortions here or abroad,\" he said.",
      "Other HHS authorities over abortion",
      "Beyond the FDA's regulation on mifepristone, it would be up to Kennedy to sign off on other changes called for by conservatives around abortion policy, including limits on how money is used under the so-called Title X funding for family planning clinics.",
      "He pledged at the hearing to \"support President Trump's policies on Title X.\"",
      "Under the first Trump administration, rules levied by HHS on Title X resulted in Planned Parenthood's departure from the funding program, decrying the rules as a \"gag order\" on providers referring patients to abortion services.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 19:19:09 -0500",
    "summary": "The humble egg is now a source of frustration for millions of shoppers around the U.S, who face soaring prices and shortages. What's going on?",
    "story": [
      "At Market Basket locations in some parts of Massachusetts, customers are being asked to limit their egg purchases\u00a0to two cartons per family. Another shopper on the hunt for eggs, this one in Las Vegas, reported finding\u00a0empty shelves\u00a0at a local grocery store. On social media, a consumer\u00a0accustomed to paying around $2 for a dozen eggs expressed shock over now having to pay more than double that amount.",
      "Egg restrictions, shortages and record-high prices are ruffling feathers at supermarkets across the U.S. as a deadly strain of avian flu\u00a0continues to decimate\u00a0the country's poultry flocks. To the dismay of consumers still struggling to digest soaring food costs, that likely means even higher egg prices in 2025.",
      "\"I think eggs have felt relatively extreme over the past few months,\" Kip Green, co-owner and general manager of Montague Diner in Brooklyn, New York, told CBS News. \"We're fortunate though, we have a great relationships with our purveyors, with farmers. So everybody is trying to help each other out, which is lovely.\"",
      "As at most diners, Montague uses hundreds of eggs a day said Green. Whether served as part of a classic breakfast plate alongside potatoes and toast, or an egg salad sandwich, eggs comprise 40% to 50% of the restaurant's menu, she said.",
      "\"I mean, it's even like, there's some things that you might not even think about, like in our pancake batter or like in our French toast batter, like just things like that. We still use so many eggs.\"",
      "Even so, Green says that she and her team are \"aligned on keeping guests at the forefront,\" which means shielding them from price hikes on eggs.",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it's challenging. Like we, we have to figure out how to make it work,\" said Green. \"Eggs are central to us, we are a diner. You have to have an egg plate,\" she said, adding, \"We don't ever want to stop that or to, to make people pay more for something like that. So you figure out how to cut costs elsewhere.\"",
      "The average price of a dozen large, grade-A eggs was $4.15 in December 2024, up 14% from $3.65 in November, federal\u00a0data shows. That's a more than 60% increase from the $2.51 it cost a year ago and 160% more than the $1.41 consumers paid for the same carton in 2019, CBS News' price tracker\u00a0reveals.",
      "By comparison, the overall monthly rate of inflation for food in December was 2.5%, with the cost of food at home rising just 0.3%, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data.",
      "Like a souffl\u00e9, egg prices are rising to impressive heights right before our eyes. When will it end? Not anytime soon, according to the USDA, which\u00a0predicts\u00a0in a recent report that egg prices will shoot up another 20% this year.",
      "Behind rising egg prices and shortages is a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), known as H5N1, that killed 13.2 million commercial egg-laying hens in the month of December alone and continues to depopulate flocks into 2025, according to the USDA. Outbreaks of H5N1 were first detected in the U.S. in 2022 and are considered to be the main driver behind the years-long volatility in egg prices.",
      "H5N1, which has a high mortality rate among infected\u00a0poultry\u00a0and wild birds, is being watched closely by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a potential public health\u00a0threat. So far, the CDC has received one report of a person dying after being hospitalized with severe illness from the virus. Among cattle, the average mortality and culling rate is 2% or less, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. However, officials warn that H5N1 is lethal to cats",
      "For now, the virus remains mostly a thorn in the side of U.S. consumers\u00a0fed up with inflation.",
      "\"For about a year and a half now, the sort of frequency and severity of avian flu outbreaks in the poultry and egg supply chains in the U.S. have sort of just been on the rise in a big way,\" Ricky Volpe, a professor of agribusiness at Cal Poly State University, San Luis Obispo, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone is just sort of hoping that, 'OK, this will be the last one, then we'll get back to normal.' But we keep on not getting back to normal.\"",
      "More than 79.3 million U.S. chickens died in 2022 and 2023 as result of H5N1 infections and related culling, according to a January\u00a0report\u00a0from TD Cowen. In total, H5N1 is estimated to have led to the loss of nearly 139 million birds across the country, including Puerto Rico, according to the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.",
      "Supply hit",
      "A couple of factors are contributing to the skyrocketing price of eggs. First, the bird flu outbreaks are disrupting the nation's supply chain. At farms, that means anytime the virus is found, the entire flock must be slaughtered to help limit the virus' spread. And with massive egg farms routinely housing more than 1 million chickens, just a few infections can lead to a supply crunch.",
      "\"This is an industry that's able to correct itself pretty quickly,\" Volpe said. \"The problem is it's literally like a nationwide game of whack-a-mole \u2014 as soon as one outbreak is more or less dealt with, another one pops up somewhere else.\"",
      "If there's any good news for farmers and shoppers, it's that it doesn't take very long to replenish egg supplies.",
      "\"Historically, we see a lot of variation in egg and chicken prices, but typically it's been true that what comes up, must come down, because it only takes about six weeks for a broiler to reach maturity and be market-ready, and I think it's actually slightly less than that for an egg-laying hen to get to the point where it is regularly laying a marketable egg, you know, once a day,\" Volpe added.",
      "A second factor driving up egg prices: a persistent shortage of truck drivers in the U.S. \u2014 a mounting problem as more drivers retire. And with fewer drivers to transport eggs to retailers, wholesalers are forced to raise shipping costs.",
      "\"Refrigerated truck transportation is a major pain point in the food supply chain right now. There's a shortage of drivers, long-haul truck rates are up and eggs are of course very transportation-intensive,\" Volpe said. \"Even before we were dealing with avian flu, the trucks just weren't there to deliver eggs in a timely fashion.\"",
      "As a partial solution to the problem, Volpe suggests that retailers source eggs locally wherever possible.",
      "\"[Local suppliers] are pretty well insulated from these systemic issues of avian flu or whatever, so supply is healthy. So it makes sense to augment supply whenever possible locally from local growers who are not facing these significant issues related to bird flu and transportation.\"",
      "Why are egg prices lower in some stores?",
      "Just as retailers use Thanksgiving Day turkey promotions to attract customers, some grocery stores around the country are offering lower egg prices to drive store traffic.",
      "\"You can go on social media and you'll see someone complaining about an $8 dozen of eggs and then someone else will chime in and go 'I just got it for $4.' Well, I absolutely guarantee you that was sold at a loss, and it was sort of a competitive effort to increase foot traffic,\" Volpe said. \"Maybe eggs are sold at a loss, but now you're going to buy your milk and your bread and vegetables, everything else, and those will have the normal profit margins.\"",
      "Translation: If you find a good deal on eggs at a store, you might still end up paying roughly the same cost for your entire basket of groceries as you would somewhere else.",
      "Response from White House",
      "\"There is a lot of reporting out there that is putting the onus on this White House for the increased cost of eggs,\" said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked at her first press briefing on Tuesday what President Trump is doing to address egg prices which have spiked since he took office earlier this month.",
      "\"As far as the egg shortage, what's also contributing to that is that the Biden admin and Department of Agriculture directed the mass killing of 100 million chickens,\" Leavitt, who made no mention of avian flu, said in her response.",
      "Leavitt went on to urge the Senate to move \"swiftly\" to confirm Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees \"including his nominee for the United States Department of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins ... who is leading the economic team here at the White House, on how we can address the egg shortage in this country.\"",

He must receive a majority of senators to be confirmed to head HHS, which encompasses America's federal health agencies.",
      "The committee's jurisdiction largely focuses on the department's mammoth Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs for seniors and low-income Americans, which make up the largest share of mandatory spending in the federal budget.",
      "He will head next to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, or HELP, which is scheduled to question Kennedy on Thursday.",
      "That committee's focus includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Food and Drug Administration and National Institutes of Health, all agencies that would fall under Kennedy's authority if he is confirmed to lead the department.",

      "What is RFK Jr.'s \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda?",
      "This week's hearings will offer the first public window into Kennedy's broad \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda in many weeks, after Kennedy and other nominees retreated from public appearances and social media posts.",
      "Advisers have been huddling with Kennedy for months behind closed doors, multiple advisers say, hashing out how and whether to implement dramatic changes he has sought to the federal government's health bureaucracy.",
      "Kennedy's supporters say many of his stances, like questioning ultra-processed foods and the risks of synthetic food additives and dyes, have hit on broad appeal among both Republicans and some Democrats that could buoy his chances to clear the Senate.",
      "Through the FDA, Kennedy would be able to exercise substantial authority on how foods are regulated, labeled and recommended by the federal government.",
      "But Kennedy is also facing criticism from both sides of the aisle, setting up a confirmation battle that multiple allies say he has privately acknowledged will be an uphill fight.",
      "His aides are facing mounting criticism over a department-wide communications \"pause\" that has stymied releases across the health agencies, which is timed to end in the days after Kennedy's confirmation hearings wrap up.",

      "Conservative groups have also been divided over Kennedy's nomination, with some criticizing his past statements voicing support for abortion rights.",
      "The issue is expected to be a large focus of Kennedy's hearings: as secretary, he would have authority over how the FDA regulates medications used for abortions.",
      "Kennedy has reassured conservative groups and lawmakers that he would hew closely to Mr. Trump's campaign trail promise to defer the issue to the states.",
      "But Kennedy and the Trump administration will have little room to avoid the issue, given an ongoing federal court case against the FDA. Conservatives have called on the Trump administration's FDA to roll back moves made since 2016 to ease access to abortion pills.",

      "Who is RFK Jr?",
      "When Kennedy first announced his campaign as a Democratic presidential candidate in April 2023, he touted his decades-long record as an environmental lawyer.",
      "Kennedy \u2014 whose father, Robert F. Kennedy, was assassinated during his 1968 presidential campaign \u2014 says he did not want to immediately enter politics, and instead \"carried on his family's legacy by devoting himself to environmental causes and children's welfare.\"",
      "That followed a struggle with substance abuse when he was younger, which he says spanned 14 years after he started using heroin at 15 years old.",
      "Kennedy made headlines for his environmental work was as founder and president of the nonprofit Waterkeeper Alliance from the 1980s until 2020, ranging from local efforts to clean up the Hudson River to campaigning against an oil pipeline in North Dakota.",
      "What Kennedy has described as his \"reluctant entrance into the vaccine debate\" dates back to 2005, when he wrote an article in Rolling Stone exploring supposed evidence for a link between autism and an ingredient that had formerly been used in some vaccines. The article contained numerous scientific and factual errors and was eventually retracted. Decades of research has established there is no such link.",
      "In 2016, Kennedy joined a nonprofit focused on mercury, which later broadened its focus and rebranded to Children's Health Defense. Kennedy chaired the group and served as one of its loudest voices raising doubts about vaccines and fighting against vaccine requirements and approvals.",

    "summary": "The online system for federal health funding warned of delays due to executive orders after the Trump administration announced a freeze.",
    "story": [
      "The White House blamed an \"outage\" for locking out a wide range of organizations and agencies on Tuesday from the online systems responsible for drawing down federal health dollars.",
      "Multiple state Medicaid programs reported late Tuesday they have been able to resume accessing their payment systems after the nationwide lockout.",
      "The interruption had sparked outcry from state governments, nonprofits and lawmakers in the wake of the Trump administration's\u00a0move to freeze spending\u00a0across the federal government. After legal challenges were filed against the funding freeze, a federal judge issued a stay\u00a0temporarily halting\u00a0the move until she can hear arguments in the case.",
      "State Medicaid agencies, federally funded\u00a0Head Start\u00a0early education programs and\u00a0community health centers\u00a0had been among those cut off from access to the\u00a0Payment Management Services\u00a0web portal, or PMS, run by the Department of Health and Human Services, which handles billions of dollars of payments every year.",
      "\"We have confirmed no payments have been affected \u2014 they are still being processed and sent. We expect the portal will be back online shortly,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt   said in a\u00a0post\u00a0on X.",
      "Confusion after Medicaid programs locked out",
      "There was widespread confusion after Medicaid and other programs discovered they were locked out of the federal health payment system. Spokespeople for HHS and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have not responded to requests for comment, amid the ongoing\u00a0communications \"pause\"\u00a0imposed by the Trump administration at the department.",
      "A spokesperson for the National Association of Medicaid Directors said they had also sought an explanation.",
      "\"My staff has confirmed reports that Medicaid portals are down in all 50 states following last night's federal funding freeze. This is a blatant attempt to rip away health care from millions of Americans overnight and will get people killed,\" Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden\u00a0posted\u00a0on X.",
      "\"Multiple states locked out of Medicaid portal,\" Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii tweeted. \"This is a Trump shutdown, except this time it's unlawful.\"",
      "Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley said he was assured Medicaid would not be affected.",
      "\"What the White House has told us just now is that Medicaid is not, categorically not, covered by this,\" Hawley said. \"In other words, there will be no interruption to Medicaid or Medicare or any grant that floats to individuals.\"",
      "Joann Alker of the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families had\u00a0called on\u00a0the administration to issue a statement clarifying that\u00a0Medicaid\u00a0should not be affected after its initial memo ordering the spending freeze late Monday, warning it is a\u00a0\"major crisis\"\u00a0as states look to draw down funding for the month.",
      "\"Any pause in federal funding of Medicaid \u2014 the largest source of federal funding received by states \u2014 would be disastrous for states as they need to draw down federal funds to meet their financial obligations to the health care providers and health plans serving Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries,\" Alker said.",
      "Health centers warn of \"irreversible\" consequences",
      "Even as the payment systems come back online, those who rely on the grants say they worry that new \"delays\" on payments imposed by the Trump administration could inflict permanent damage on stretched-thin health care systems.",
      "The HHS website currently warns that due \"to Executive Orders regarding potentially unallowable grant payments, PMS is taking additional measures to process payments. Reviews of applicable programs and payments will result in delays and/or rejections of payments.\"",
      "In a statement ahead of the lockout, HHS\u00a0announced\u00a0it would be reevaluating \"all programs, regulations, and guidance to ensure Federal taxpayer dollars are not being used to pay for or promote elective abortion\" following a previous\u00a0executive order.",
      "\"Even with the best of intentions, these types of funding freezes can do tremendous harm. And could be irreversible to some communities. What we're really talking about is a health center's ability to pay salaries,\" said Amanda Pears Kelly, CEO of the group Advocates for Community Health.",
      "The group lobbies on behalf of community health centers, which are subsidized by the federal government to offer health care to low-income communities.",
      "Pears Kelly said that health centers often rely on being able to request money every-other-week through the system, drawing down their grant to pay bills and make payroll for their staff. Without the money, she warned many health centers facing already slim margins could be forced to trim staff or close their doors.",
      "\"When the system's down, and there's no one to talk to to understand what they need to do, and then on top of that there's an uncertain time to the delay, it's paralyzing,\" said Pears Kelly.",
      "In a\u00a0statement, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association warned that health centers could face \"significant disruption\" to operations even with a \"temporary funding pause.\"",
      "\"For many patients, Title X-funded health centers serve as their sole source of health care. The Title X family planning program is already chronically underfunded, and this executive action risks destabilizing a health provider network that is already operating under immense strain,\" said Clare Coleman, president and CEO of the association.",
      "School lunches, other programs worry about impact",
      "The implications of the federal grant pause go beyond HHS, but the full effects are still unknown.",
      "It's unclear whether the National School Lunch Program, which reimburses schools and school districts each month for the meals they serve children, will still receive funding through the U.S. Department of Agriculture if the freeze takes effect. The program feeds about 28 million American schoolchildren each month.",
      "Diane Pratt-Heavner, director of media relations at the School Nutrition Association, said her organization is asking the USDA for more information.",
      "\"We're urging Congress to increase reimbursements for school meals given the financial crisis facing meal programs today, so certainly there's just no room in the budget for missed reimbursements,\" she said.",
      "Meals on Wheels, a nonprofit organization that delivers about 250 million meals each year to more than 2 million seniors, receives federal grant funding. They're not sure what's next either.",
      "\"If in fact this order includes the Older Americans Act, this would presumably halt service to millions of vulnerable seniors who have no other means of purchasing or preparing meals,\" a Meals on Wheels spokesperson said. \"And the lack of clarity and uncertainty right now is creating chaos for local Meals on Wheels providers not knowing for sure whether they should be serving meals today, which unfortunately means seniors will panic not knowing where their next meals will come from.\"",
      "They added that since the program is already underfunded, local providers generally \"don't have the ability to absorb a blow like this, especially if it persists for any extended period.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 16:28:23 -0500",
    "summary": "A different strain of H5N9 has shown up in U.S. birds before.",
    "story": [
      "A California duck farm made headlines this week after the World Organization of Animal Health published a report by U.S. authorities that a strain of bird flu that scientists call H5N9 had been found among sick birds in the flock.",
      "This is far from the first time that H5N9 has been found in birds around the country. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it was the first time that H5N9 had been found in American poultry sick with \"highly pathogenic avian influenza,\" meaning it caused severe disease.",
      "\"Clinical signs included increased mortality. State officials have quarantined the affected premises,\" the USDA said of the flock.",
      "What is H5N9 and how is it different from H5N1?",
      "Scientists classify bird flu viruses by which kind of two key proteins are inside of them: the hemagglutinin, like H5 or H3, and the neuraminidase, like N1 or N9.",
      "Different blends of those two proteins alongside many other mutations elsewhere in the virus can affect how sick people and animals get and how it spreads.",
      "H5N1 has been the dominant grouping of strains fueling this past year's outbreaks in the U.S., with different variants of that virus spreading in wild birds, poultry flocks, dairy cattle, pets and into at least 67 confirmed human cases.",
      "A spokesperson for the department said that scientists believe the H5N9 was the result of a \"reassortment,\" where H5N1 was able to\u00a0genetically mix\u00a0with other influenza viruses inside of a duck.",
      "\"The finding was not unexpected, as it is not uncommon to see reassortments and ducks are reservoir hosts for influenza A viruses,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Both H5N9 and H5N1 were found to be infecting ducks at the farm, the USDA said.",
      "\"The H5N1 virus is widely circulating across North America, and these viruses can reassort in species that are susceptible to influenza viruses,\" said S. Mark Tompkins, director of the Center for Influenza Disease and Emergence Research at the University of Georgia. He agreed that it would not be \"terribly surprising\" to see a reassortment emerge to infect poultry.",
      "\"H5N1 reassorts with other avian influenza viruses quite frequently and even the current H5 HA protein that is infecting dairy cows and commercial poultry farms in the US has been shown to reassort,\"\u00a0Andy Pekosz, professor of microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University, wrote in an email.",
      "Has H5N9 been seen in the U.S. before?",
      "H5N9 has been seen before in U.S. birds, but often it results in less severe symptoms, called \"low pathogenic avian influenza\" by veterinarians.",
      "\"H5N9 viruses have been detected in North American wild birds in 2023 and 2024, and before the current outbreak,\" said Tompkins.",
      "Some of the\u00a0earliest records\u00a0of H5N9 around the world date back to turkeys infected in Wisconsin in the 1960s, which U.S. officials\u00a0reported had\u00a0\"mild respiratory symptoms and a severe drop in egg production.\"",
      "The California duck farm's strain of H5N9 is different from those earlier cases because this time it is closely related to a newer variant of the H5N1 virus. That variant is called H5N1 D1.1, the USDA spokesperson said, which has emerged over the past year to dominate U.S. cases in wild birds and poultry.",
      "\"The combination H5N9 is not new and other versions, like H5N5 also exist. Just because this was now detected, doesn't mean trouble necessarily,\" said virologist Florian Krammer, professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in an email.",
      "Krammer pointed to recent detections of the H5N5\u00a0strain spreading from Europe, and then jumping from birds to be able to infect mammals across Canada as prompting more worry for him.",
      "\"It's not really surprising, because we have a history of three years of H5N1 undergoing reassortments that would typically burn out and not emerge as a major one,\" said David Swayne, a private veterinarian and former director of the USDA's Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory.",
      "Swayne said that past H5N9 outbreaks have been dead ends, in the handful of times they have been found to be causing severe disease in ducks.",
      "\"So far, I have not heard of any evidence to say this H5N9 has some kind of fitness that is better than the H5N1. If it doesn't have that, it can't outcompete,\" said Swayne.",
      "Is H5N9 a bigger risk to humans than H5N1?",
      "As with H5N1, H5N9 in birds would still need to achieve some key mutations before it is able to spread efficiently among humans.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday they have found no evidence of human-to-human transmission of bird flu in the U.S. to date. Most cases were blamed on direct contact with sick animals, except for three that have befuddled investigators who failed to identify a likely source.",
      "It is unclear whether authorities followed up with workers at the Merced County farm about potential human infections. A spokesperson for the county did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "If H5N9 gains a foothold in humans, people may possibly have less immunity to the virus than they do to H5N1.",
      "\"The seasonal, human H1N1 virus has an NA protein that is related, but different from the bovine H5N1 NA protein. There is some cross-recognition of avian H5N1 NA in the human population because of this,\" said Pekosz.",
      "Where was the California H5N9 outbreak?",
      "The USDA said the virus was detected at a \"commercial duck meat\" farm in California's Merced County, in an outbreak that started on Nov. 23, 2024.",
      "A total of 118,954 birds were culled at the duck farm by Dec. 2 to stamp out the virus, in an effort to curb the risk of further bird flu spread.",
      "More than 3 million birds have been culled at farms in this California county over the past year due to bird flu outbreaks, the most of any county in the state. California has been hit hard by this past year's bird flu outbreaks, which have resulted in record cullings across the egg industry.",
      "Scientists say ducks are especially susceptible to harboring influenza viruses without being sick, making them common mixing vessels for bird flu strains.",
      "\"Unless you have very tight biosecurity, it is very hard to raise ducks without many low path influenza viruses,\" said Swayne.",
      "Swayne said ducks often need the lowest dose of virus to be infected with bird flu viruses, compared to other poultry, like chickens. One way the virus can spread onto farms is when they are raised outside, mixing with wild ducks.",
      "\"If you look at the natural history, wild ducks are the reservoir of genes for all influenza virus. There's probably an adaptation with the virus. These viruses infect without showing overt clinical disease, they spread very rapidly between the adults to the juveniles,\" said Swayne.",

      "An Alabama woman passed a major milestone Saturday to become the longest-living recipient of a pig organ transplant \u2013 healthy and full of energy with her new kidney for 61 days and counting.",
      "\"I'm superwoman,\" Towana Looney told The Associated Press, laughing about outpacing family members on long walks around New York City as she continues her recovery. \"It's a new take on life.\"",

      "\"We're quite optimistic that this is going to continue to work and work well for, you know, a significant period of time,\" he said.",
      "Why scientists are using pig organs for transplants",
      "Scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike to address a severe shortage of transplantable human organs. More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list, most who need a kidney, and thousands die waiting.",
      "Pig organ transplants so far have been \"compassionate use\" cases, experiments the Food and Drug Administration allows only in special circumstances for people out of other options.",
      "And the handful of hospitals trying them are sharing information of what worked and what didn't, in preparation for the world's first formal studies of xenotransplantation, expected to begin sometime this year. United Therapeutics, which supplied Looney's kidney, recently asked the Food and Drug Administration for permission to begin a trial.",

      "\"We have to learn from each other,\" he said.",
      "Towana Looney's transplant story",
      "Looney donated a kidney to her mother in 1999. Later pregnancy complications caused high blood pressure that damaged her remaining kidney, which eventually failed, something incredibly rare among living donors. She spent eight years on dialysis before doctors concluded she'd likely never get a donated organ \u2013 she'd developed super-high levels of antibodies abnormally primed to attack another human kidney.",
      "So Looney, 53, sought out the pig experiment. No one knew how it would work in someone \"highly sensitized\" with those overactive antibodies.",
      "Discharged just 11 days after the Nov. 25 surgery, Montgomery's team has closely tracked her recovery through blood tests and other measurements. About three weeks after the transplant, they caught subtle signs that rejection was beginning \u2013 signs they'd learned to look for thanks to a 2023 experiment when a pig kidney worked for 61 days inside a deceased man whose body was donated for research.",
      "Montgomery said they successfully treated Looney and there's been no sign of rejection since \u2013 and a few weeks ago she met the family behind that deceased-body research.",
      "\"It feels really good to know that the decision I made for NYU to use my brother was the right decision and it's helping people,\" said Mary Miller-Duffy, of Newburgh, New York.",
      "Looney in turn is trying to help others, serving as what Montgomery calls an ambassador for people who've been reaching out to her through social media, sharing their distress at the long wait for transplants and wondering about pig kidneys.",
      "One, she said, was being considered for a xenotransplant at another hospital but was scared, wondering whether to proceed.",
      "\"I didn't want to persuade him whether to do or not to do it,\" Looney said.",
      "Instead, she asked if he was religious and urged him to pray, to \"go off your faith, what your heart tells you.\"",
      "\"I love talking to people, I love helping people,\" she added. \"I want to be, like, some educational piece\" for scientists to help others.",
      "There's no way to predict how long Looney's new kidney will work but if it were to fail she could receive dialysis again.",
      "\"The truth is we don't really know what the next hurdles are because this is the first time we've gotten this far,\" Montgomery said. \"We'll have to continue to really keep a close eye on her.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2025 11:13:57 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration's \"short pause\" on communications, expected to end on Feb. 1, has affected FDA updates on food contamination investigations.",
    "story": [
      "Multiple federal health agencies have stopped releasing some key health information \u2014 including updates on some outbreak investigations \u2014 amid a department-wide communications \"pause\" ordered by the Trump administration, though many other \"mission critical\" updates are still being released, CBS News has learned.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services \"has issued a pause on mass communications and public appearances that are not directly related to emergencies or critical to preserving health,\" Stefanie Spear, the HHS principal deputy chief of staff, told CBS News in an email. \"This is a short pause to allow the new team to set up a process for review and prioritization.\"",
      "The Food and Drug Administration, a federal agency of the HHS, usually releases updates on probes of outbreaks linked to contaminated food every Wednesday, but the agency did not release them this week. As of the FDA's last update on Jan. 15, authorities were investigating multiple outbreaks of E. coli and Listeria.",
      "Publication of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's authoritative scientific publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, has also been delayed, health officials said. Articles have been published virtually every Thursday for decades, detailing agency guidance, updates on disease outbreak investigations and studies of health threats. But no issue was published this past Thursday.",
      "Weekly CDC updates on rates of flu and COVID-19 vaccinations have also been disrupted, the agency's website shows. Local health departments and nonprofits rely on these figures to track uptake of the shots, targeting outreach to communities seeing lagging immunization rates.",
      "A Jan. 21 memo obtained by CBS News from acting Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Dorthy Fink ordered health agencies to, \"consistent with precedent,\" stop all new policies, communications and speaking engagements without clearing them with officials from the new administration until Feb. 1.",
      "Politico first reported the directive on Tuesday.",
      "Spear said there are \"exceptions\" for \"mission critical\" announcements, which will be made \"on a case-by-case basis.\"",
      "HHS Memo Jan21 by CBSNews.com",
      "The CDC on Thursday still released its weekly tally of certain infectious diseases reported to the agency from health departments, which include tracking of germs like whooping cough that have seen a record wave in recent months.",
      "Updated data on trends in emergency room visits from respiratory diseases were also updated Friday. Local officials and healthcare systems use the data to track influenza and COVID-19 every winter during surges.",
      "At least some of the CDC's work with outsiders is still ongoing. A spokesperson for Alabama's health department said Thursday that the CDC was still involved in an ongoing investigation of unusual side effects linked to an antibiotic injection used in the state.",
      "Public health labs have also so far not been hindered by the pause, a lab official outside the federal government said, despite a handful of webinars and calls that were canceled.",
      "An update to the CDC's travel notice about Tanzania was also published Thursday, after the World Health Organization announced an outbreak of Marburg virus disease had been confirmed in the country.",
      "The FDA is still releasing notices about recalls. A safety communication was also posted by the FDA this week, warning of an allergic reaction linked to a multiple sclerosis medication.",
      "Multiple current and former health officials said a slowdown in communications has happened during every recent transition, as incoming officials sought to get a handle around the firehose of information and guidance coming from across the federal health bureaucracy.",
      "But some also said the length and scope of the communications slowdown was unusual, resulting in confusion among staff as health agencies sought to stop or claw back communications, meetings and events to comply with the directive.",
      "At the National Institutes of Health, meetings set up to review grant applications were abruptly canceled and agency experts at outside events and conferences were either unexpectedly recalled or participated without making any comments, one researcher said.",
      "A meeting organized by the Presidential Advisory Council for Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria scheduled for next week was also canceled, according to an email obtained by CBS News. Health officials from several countries were scheduled to discuss strategies to respond to superbugs at the meeting.",
      "Another monthly meeting scheduled by the CDC for Jan. 27 with testing laboratories was also canceled. The CDC relies on the monthly calls to answer questions about guidance and ongoing outbreaks from labs, like about the recent change in testing procedures in response to this past year's unprecedented bird flu outbreak.",
      "The end of the communications \"pause\" will coincide with the conclusion of Senate hearings next week for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Trump's controversial nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "It's not clear whether Kennedy, a former Democrat who has been widely criticized for his anti-vaccine statements and activism, will have the support to be confirmed in the closely divided Senate."

      "The U.S. withdrawal will take a year to complete, and American funding would remain in place for that period, under the organization's rules. But Mr. Trump's order also instructed U.S. federal government staff to stop working with the group \u2014 something U.S. health officials do on a wide range of health issues of global concern.",
      "On \"CBS Mornings Plus\" earlier this week, CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook said health experts were already worried about the implications of the U.S. withdrawal.",

    "title": "Egg prices are likely to shoot up even more in 2025. Here's why.",
    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 19:19:09 -0500",
    "summary": "The humble egg is now a source of frustration for millions of shoppers around the U.S, who face soaring prices and shortages. What's going on?",
    "story": [
      "At Market Basket locations in some parts of Massachusetts, customers are being asked to limit their egg purchases\u00a0to two cartons per family. Another shopper on the hunt for eggs, this one in Las Vegas, reported finding\u00a0empty shelves\u00a0at a local grocery store. On social media, a consumer\u00a0accustomed to paying around $2 for a dozen eggs expressed shock over now having to pay more than double that amount.",
      "Egg restrictions, shortages and record-high prices are ruffling feathers at supermarkets across the U.S. as a deadly strain of avian flu\u00a0continues to decimate\u00a0the country's poultry flocks. To the dismay of consumers still struggling to digest soaring food costs, that likely means even higher egg prices in 2025.",
      "\"I think eggs have felt relatively extreme over the past few months,\" Kip Green, co-owner and general manager of Montague Diner in Brooklyn, New York, told CBS News. \"We're fortunate though, we have a great relationships with our purveyors, with farmers. So everybody is trying to help each other out, which is lovely.\"",
      "As at most diners, Montague uses hundreds of eggs a day said Green. Whether served as part of a classic breakfast plate alongside potatoes and toast, or an egg salad sandwich, eggs comprise 40% to 50% of the restaurant's menu, she said.",
      "\"I mean, it's even like, there's some things that you might not even think about, like in our pancake batter or like in our French toast batter, like just things like that. We still use so many eggs.\"",
      "Even so, Green says that she and her team are \"aligned on keeping guests at the forefront,\" which means shielding them from price hikes on eggs.",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it's challenging. Like we, we have to figure out how to make it work,\" said Green. \"Eggs are central to us, we are a diner. You have to have an egg plate,\" she said, adding, \"We don't ever want to stop that or to, to make people pay more for something like that. So you figure out how to cut costs elsewhere.\"",
      "The average price of a dozen large, grade-A eggs was $4.15 in December 2024, up 14% from $3.65 in November, federal\u00a0data shows. That's a more than 60% increase from the $2.51 it cost a year ago and 160% more than the $1.41 consumers paid for the same carton in 2019, CBS News' price tracker\u00a0reveals.",
      "By comparison, the overall monthly rate of inflation for food in December was 2.5%, with the cost of food at home rising just 0.3%, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data.",
      "Like a souffl\u00e9, egg prices are rising to impressive heights right before our eyes. When will it end? Not anytime soon, according to the USDA, which\u00a0predicts\u00a0in a recent report that egg prices will shoot up another 20% this year.",
      "Behind rising egg prices and shortages is a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), known as H5N1, that killed 13.2 million commercial egg-laying hens in the month of December alone and continues to depopulate flocks into 2025, according to the USDA. Outbreaks of H5N1 were first detected in the U.S. in 2022 and are considered to be the main driver behind the years-long volatility in egg prices.",
      "H5N1, which has a high mortality rate among infected\u00a0poultry\u00a0and wild birds, is being watched closely by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a potential public health\u00a0threat. So far, the CDC has received one report of a person dying after being hospitalized with severe illness from the virus. Among cattle, the average mortality and culling rate is 2% or less, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. However, officials warn that H5N1 is lethal to cats",
      "For now, the virus remains mostly a thorn in the side of U.S. consumers\u00a0fed up with inflation.",
      "\"For about a year and a half now, the sort of frequency and severity of avian flu outbreaks in the poultry and egg supply chains in the U.S. have sort of just been on the rise in a big way,\" Ricky Volpe, a professor of agribusiness at Cal Poly State University, San Luis Obispo, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone is just sort of hoping that, 'OK, this will be the last one, then we'll get back to normal.' But we keep on not getting back to normal.\"",
      "More than 79.3 million U.S. chickens died in 2022 and 2023 as result of H5N1 infections and related culling, according to a January\u00a0report\u00a0from TD Cowen. In total, H5N1 is estimated to have led to the loss of nearly 139 million birds across the country, including Puerto Rico, according to the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.",
      "Supply hit",
      "A couple of factors are contributing to the skyrocketing price of eggs. First, the bird flu outbreaks are disrupting the nation's supply chain. At farms, that means anytime the virus is found, the entire flock must be slaughtered to help limit the virus' spread. And with massive egg farms routinely housing more than 1 million chickens, just a few infections can lead to a supply crunch.",
      "\"This is an industry that's able to correct itself pretty quickly,\" Volpe said. \"The problem is it's literally like a nationwide game of whack-a-mole \u2014 as soon as one outbreak is more or less dealt with, another one pops up somewhere else.\"",
      "If there's any good news for farmers and shoppers, it's that it doesn't take very long to replenish egg supplies.",
      "\"Historically, we see a lot of variation in egg and chicken prices, but typically it's been true that what comes up, must come down, because it only takes about six weeks for a broiler to reach maturity and be market-ready, and I think it's actually slightly less than that for an egg-laying hen to get to the point where it is regularly laying a marketable egg, you know, once a day,\" Volpe added.",
      "A second factor driving up egg prices: a persistent shortage of truck drivers in the U.S. \u2014 a mounting problem as more drivers retire. And with fewer drivers to transport eggs to retailers, wholesalers are forced to raise shipping costs.",
      "\"Refrigerated truck transportation is a major pain point in the food supply chain right now. There's a shortage of drivers, long-haul truck rates are up and eggs are of course very transportation-intensive,\" Volpe said. \"Even before we were dealing with avian flu, the trucks just weren't there to deliver eggs in a timely fashion.\"",
      "As a partial solution to the problem, Volpe suggests that retailers source eggs locally wherever possible.",
      "\"[Local suppliers] are pretty well insulated from these systemic issues of avian flu or whatever, so supply is healthy. So it makes sense to augment supply whenever possible locally from local growers who are not facing these significant issues related to bird flu and transportation.\"",
      "Why are egg prices lower in some stores?",
      "Just as retailers use Thanksgiving Day turkey promotions to attract customers, some grocery stores around the country are offering lower egg prices to drive store traffic.",
      "\"You can go on social media and you'll see someone complaining about an $8 dozen of eggs and then someone else will chime in and go 'I just got it for $4.' Well, I absolutely guarantee you that was sold at a loss, and it was sort of a competitive effort to increase foot traffic,\" Volpe said. \"Maybe eggs are sold at a loss, but now you're going to buy your milk and your bread and vegetables, everything else, and those will have the normal profit margins.\"",
      "Translation: If you find a good deal on eggs at a store, you might still end up paying roughly the same cost for your entire basket of groceries as you would somewhere else.",
      "Response from White House",
      "\"There is a lot of reporting out there that is putting the onus on this White House for the increased cost of eggs,\" said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked at her first press briefing on Tuesday what President Trump is doing to address egg prices which have spiked since he took office earlier this month.",
      "\"As far as the egg shortage, what's also contributing to that is that the Biden admin and Department of Agriculture directed the mass killing of 100 million chickens,\" Leavitt, who made no mention of avian flu, said in her response.",
      "Leavitt went on to urge the Senate to move \"swiftly\" to confirm Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees \"including his nominee for the United States Department of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins ... who is leading the economic team here at the White House, on how we can address the egg shortage in this country.\"",

      "On Wednesday, the Office of Personnel Management clarified that employees who accept the deferred resignation plan would go on administrative leave immediately and would no longer work. They would continue to receive paychecks during regular pay periods, rather than a lump sum payout, OPM officials told CBS News.",
      "There are about 2 million federal government employees across the country, which means that the administration expects that as many as 200,000 may take the government's offer.",
      "Administration officials said only about 6% of federal employees work full-time in office, but that figure was contradicted by data from the Office of Management and Budget, which reported to Congress in August that 54% of federal employees work fully on-site during all working hours. Another 46% were eligible to telework, and they spent an average of 61% of working hours in office. Only 10% of federal workers were in fully remote positions.",

      "\"The substantial majority of federal employees\" working remotely since the pandemic \"will be required to return to their physical offices five days a week,\" the email says, adding that there were plans for \"meaningful consolidation\" that could result in office relocations for \"a number of federal workers.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it will leave its benchmark rate unchanged, hitting the brakes on lowering borrowing costs for individuals and businesses after a flurry of rate cuts starting last fall.",
      "The Fed said it will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The decision comes after the central bank trimmed rates three times starting in September 2024, which has pushed down the federal funds rate \u2014 the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 by one percentage point.",
      "The pause, the Fed's first rate decision since President Trump returned to office on Jan. 20, comes as economists predict the central bank is likely to take a wait-and-see approach to the president's economic policies, given that some, such as higher tariffs, could prove inflationary.",
      "The Fed's decision to keep rates steady reflects stubborn U.S. inflation, which remains close to 3% on an annual basis. That has fueled concerns that additional rate cuts could reignite price increases, making it more difficult to get to the Fed's 2% target. Notably, the Fed removed a line from its December statement expressing its belief that inflation \"has made progress\" toward its goal. Yet Powell struck a more dovish tone in a press conference to discuss the Fed's decision.",
      "\"Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well-anchored, as reflected in a broad, broad range of surveys of households, businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets,\" he said.",

      "\"If the Fed doesn't resume cutting in the next few months, however, we suspect the window will have closed,\" Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics said in a report. \"While markets are still pricing in second half rate cuts, our view is that a flurry of tariffs will put a stop to that, as inflation rebounds to 3%.\"",
      "Asked about the possible impact of Mr. Trump's economic plans, Powell demurred, noting that while the Fed is monitoring the new administration's policies, it's too early for the central bank to make an assessment of their possible impact. Mr. Trump has vowed to enact a broad tariff of 10% on all imports, as well as to imposed\u00a025% tariffs on Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1.",
      "\"We need to let those policies be articulated before we can even begin to make that a plausible assessment of what their implications for the economy will be,\" he said. \"We don't know what's going to be tariffed, we don't know for how long or how much, what countries, we don't know about retaliation.\"",
      "Asked by CBS News' Richard Escobedo about economic uncertainty created by Mr. Trump's plan to deport undocumented immigrants, Powell responded that the administration's efforts are not yet showing up in economic data.",
      "\"Businesses that are dependent on immigrant labor are saying that it's suddenly gotten harder to get people,\" the Fed chair said. \"But again, you don't see that in the aggregate data, but yes, you hear it anecdotally.\"",
      "While inflation has subsided from a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022, it\u00a0rose 2.9% in December on a year-over-year basis due to higher prices on gasoline, which rose 4.4% from the prior month, as well as food and housing.",
      "In its statement, the Fed described the labor market as \"solid,\" with an unemployment rate that has \"stabilized at a low level in recent months.\" Even so, the Fed is closely monitoring the labor market for signs of weakness, with the central bank pointing to a rise in the jobless rate last fall as one reason why it opted to cut rates at the time.",
      "\"The Fed will keep their options open in case a sudden weakening materializes in the months to come\" in the labor market, noted Bankrate chief financial analyst Greg McBride in an email.",
      "As for when the next rate cut might come, it's unclear from the Fed's statement, he added.",
      "\"They gave no indication in their post-meeting statement that a resumption of rate cuts is likely at the next meeting in March,\" McBride said. \"It will take a run of good inflation data to get us there, whenever that may be.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 16:02:41 -0500",
    "summary": "The Fed held off on another rate cut at its Jan. 29 meeting. Here's what it means for your finances.",
    "story": [
      "Borrowers hoping for more financial relief from the Federal Reserve may have a wait on their hands, as the central bank is hit the pause button on additional rate cuts at its Jan. 29 meeting.",
      "The Fed held its benchmark rate steady on Wednesday at its current range between 4.25% to 4.5%, a move that was forecast by a majority of economists polled by FactSet. Most economists also predict the Fed will hold off on cutting at its March 19 meeting, which means the next rate cut might not occur until the central bank's May 7 meeting, FactSet data shows.",
      "The January pause marks an end, at least temporarily, to the Fed's flurry of rate cuts that started in September 2024 which have pushed down the federal funds rate by one percentage point. That's helped trim borrowing costs for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other debt, providing some respite to inflation-pinched consumers and businesses.",
      "But in December, the Fed had signaled that it expected fewer cuts\u00a0in 2025 than it had earlier projected, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell pointing to inflation that remains above the central bank's goal of an annual 2% rate. Economists say it's likely the Fed wants to take a wait-and-see approach to the Trump administration's policies such as adding new tariffs and widespread deportations of immigrants, which could both prove inflationary.",
      "\"The reason why the Fed isn't jumping the gun at lowering the rates faster and further is that, on one hand, inflation is not gone. They looked carefully at the data, and it is still stubbornly above target, so there is concern if you lower rates further, inflation would tick up again,\" Erasmus Kersting, a professor of economics at Villanova University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Secondly, he added, \"Tariffs or mass deportations are expected to be inflationary. For that reason, the Fed is also right to be careful about lowering rates.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the rate pause by the fed.",
      "When did the Fed make its rate decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve announced its rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on Jan. 29. It will be followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m. EST.",
      "How will a pause on rate cuts impact my money?",
      "The Fed cut its benchmark rate three times last year, kicking off with a jumbo 0.5 percentage point reduction in September. That was followed by two consecutive\u00a00.25 percentage point cuts: one at its November meeting and a second at its December meeting.",
      "The pause in early 2025 means that consumers can't expect additional near-term relief on borrowing costs, experts say.",
      "\"Anyone hoping for the Fed to ride in as the cavalry and rescue you from high interest rates anytime soon is going to be really disappointed,\" said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, in an email. \"That's true whether you're talking about mortgages, auto loans, credit cards or most anything else.\"",
      "Because credit card rates and other borrowing costs aren't likely to change, consumers should work on getting their higher-interest debt under control, Schulz added. Turning to a 0% balance transfer credit card or consolidating credit card debt with a personal loan can prove helpful with lowering interest payments, he noted.",
      "If there's a bright side, it's for savers, given that they should still be able to find solid rates on high-yield savings accounts, even though they've declined since the Fed began trimming its benchmark rate last year, Schulz said. Some savings accounts are still paying above 4%, down from about 5% a year ago.",
      "\"Returns on high-yield savings accounts have fallen from their record levels as the Fed has moved to lower rates. However, as the Fed pauses, that decline should slow as well,\" he said.",
      "When will mortgage rates come down?",
      "One of the disappointments for house hunters, as well as homeowners who want to refinance into lower rates, has been stubbornly high mortgage rates. Despite the Fed's three rate cuts last year, the average 30-year home loan remains near 7%, near 25-year highs.",
      "Mortgage rates haven't declined despite the Fed's cuts because home loans are based on a number of factors besides the federal funds rate, including broader economic trends and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond.",
      "Given concerns from economists that President Trump's plans could prove inflationary, mortgage rates might not come down anytime soon, experts said.",
      "\"The general consensus is that rates will likely remain unchanged until the market has more clarity around potential policy impacts as it relates to immigration, taxes and tariffs,\" noted Austin Walker, CEO of A. Walker & Co., a housing finance company.",
      "Will interest rates go down under President Trump?",
      "Last week at the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Trump said he would \"demand that interest rates drop immediately, and likewise, they should be dropping all over the world.\"",
      "It's unlikely that Mr. Trump could influence the Fed to lower rates, as the central bank is an independent institution that bases its decisions on economic data, rather than orders from elected officials, experts say.",
      "Rates are set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which consists of 12 members \u2014 seven members come from the Fed's Board of Governors; four stem from the eleven Reserve Bank presidents, who each serve one-year terms on a rotating basis, and one FOMC member is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Powell, meanwhile, has said he won't step down if Mr. Trump, who has previously criticized Powell's performance, asks him to resign, adding that the president doesn't have the power to fire or demote the Fed chair. His term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "At the same time, economists are forecasting more rate cuts in 2025, but not until May or even later, according to FactSet polling. But one wild card is whether inflation could tick higher in early 2025 due to the Trump administration's policies.",
      "\"Importantly, the outlook is clouded by heightened policy uncertainty as a new administration takes office,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco in an email. Daco added he is forecasting three 0.25 percentage point cuts this year \u2014 in March, June and September. \"This year, we expect the Fed will tread carefully.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 14:59:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump executive order that reclassifies career civil servants risks politicizing thousands of government jobs, critics say.",
    "story": [
      "From meat inspectors to border patrol officers, many Americans who work for the federal government could soon see their jobs reclassified into at-will positions, meaning they can be dismissed for nearly any reason.",
      "In a related development, the White House expects up to 10% of federal employees to quit in September in a program meant to\u00a0end work-from-home practices, senior administration officials told CBS News.",
      "Depending on future court rulings and how effective the Trump administration proves to be in overriding existing federal regulations, an executive order signed by President Trump revives a policy from his first administration known as Schedule F. The Jan. 20\u00a0directive\u00a0creates a new employment classification for many career civil servants, effectively stripping them of job protections.",
      "Likely to impact tens of thousands of civil servants, and potentially more, the order defines policymaking positions to include mundane tasks such as viewing and circulating proposed government regulations.",
      "\"We think this order affects at least 50,000 people who are currently protected, but the number could be much bigger,\" Nick Bednar, a University of Minnesota Law School associate professor, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Some scholars think it could reach into the hundreds of thousands. At the end of the first term, when the Trump administration sought to reclassify positions, it included executive assistants, toxicologists and scientists \u2014 it's not clear who this doesn't reach.\"",
      "\"Individuals in these policymaking positions don't have the same due process protections as other employees. They can be more easily removed,\" Bednar added. \"There are 2.8 million civilian employees in the federal government. Most, or the vast majority, enjoy some kind of protection from removal.\"",
      "For now, it remains unclear how far the Trump administration plans to go in implementing the order, said Steve Lenkart, executive director of the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE-IAM), a union representing 100,000 government workers.",
      "\"Technically, if you're a maintenance person pushing a broom on the floor, you are executing a policy,\" said Lenkart in offering an example of how virtually any government worker could be defined as being engaged in work that falls under Schedule F.",
      "\"President Trump has the executive power to make decisions to implement a government that reflects the will of the American people,\" Harrison Fields, principal deputy press secretary at the White House, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"If an individual in the administration is working on policy, then they should align with President Trump's mission of putting America first.\"",
      "Hit to morale?",
      "President Trump is not unique in looking to have a stronger hand over the federal workforce, according to Bednar.",
      "\"A common strategy of presidents is trying to politicize federal employment positions so they have greater control over executive branch hiring and firing,\" said Bednar, who lists Dwight Eisenhower and Jimmy Carter among previous presidents who have sought to exert such influence. Still, he noted \"we haven't seen something that tries to reach this deep into the career staff.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump's Schedule F plan and other administration orders aimed a reshaping the federal workplace are being challenged in court, the Trump administration may succeed in its goal of downsizing government, regardless of whether it wins on the legal front, Bednar said.",
      "\"Even if the lawsuits slow down this process, there are many civil servants who might leave government fearing continuing to work in the Trump administration \u2014 employee moral is really affected,\" he said. \"They want a smaller government, and they view this as an opportunity to pursue that.\"",
      "Bednar also cautions that a smaller government workforce could hinder some Trump administration policy goals, including fewer agents to patrol U.S. borders and reduced staffing in immigration courts, adding to the current backlog.",
      "The case for and against Schedule F",
      "Mr. Trump originally implemented the Schedule F policy in 2020 as his first term was nearing an end, but it was repealed after former President Joe Biden took office. Mr. Trump said last week that the revived order is necessary to ensure that federal workers in roles that affect government policy remain accountable to the public.",
      "\"In recent years ... there have been numerous and well-documented cases of career federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership,\" Mr. Trump's order states. \"Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service, beginning with positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character.\"",
      "But critics of Schedule F argue it undermines the traditional principles behind civil service, which emphasize hiring based on professional qualifications. Should Schedule F survive legal challenges, they say, millions of government workers hired based on merit could be fired at will, including if they are deemed insufficiently loyal to Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Is this really about making government more efficient and smaller, or targeting regulatory and law enforcement people?\" asked Lenkart, who noted that the number of workers employed in the executive branch has remained roughly the same for more than 70 years even as the nation's population has doubled.",
      "Unions representing public workers have blasted Schedule F. The policy is among a slew of executive orders \"designed to intimidate and attack nonpartisan civil servants under the guise of increasing efficiency,\" Randy Erwin, national president of the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0last week. \"However, these orders will do the exact opposite.\"",
      "Members of the 100-year-old NFFE are employed\u00a0by\u00a0dozens of federal agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration and Social Security Administration.",
      "On Wednesday, the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) filed suit against the Trump administration, saying it was exceeding its authority in rolling back protections for workers.",
      "\"We can stop the efforts to fire hundreds of thousands of experienced, hard-working Americans who have dedicated their careers to serving their country and prevent these career civil servants from being replaced with unqualified political flunkies loyal to the president, but not the law or Constitution,\" AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in a statement.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union also filed a suit to block Schedule F, calling it \"contrary to congressional intent.\" The\u00a0complaint, filed Jan. 20 in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, argues that Mr. Trump's order reinstating Schedule F \"wrongly applies employment rules for political appointees to career staff, deprives federal employees of due process rights that they were promised when they were hired, and ignores Office of Personnel Management regulations.\"",
      "NTEU represents about 150,000 workers in 37 federal agencies and departments, including staff at the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Health and Human Services.",

    "story": [
      "Update: The White House Office of Management and Budget on Wednesday, Jan. 29, rescinded a memo ordering a federal funding freeze less than two days after it caused chaos and stoked fear that the directive could adversely affect millions of Americans.",
      "A White House memo ordering a broad freeze on federal grants and loans by 5 p.m. Tuesday left ordinary Americans who depend on such aid, as well as seasoned budget experts, scratching their heads.",
      "The memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) suspending the federal funding was vague in its wording, causing confusion within federal assistance programs, at nonprofits and among Americans receiving government aid. Adding to the whiplash, a federal judge on Tuesday\u00a0temporarily blocked the freeze, and the Trump administration walked back the memo on Wednesday.",
      "\"In light of the injunction, OMB has rescinded the memo to end any confusion on federal policy created by the court ruling and the dishonest media coverage,\" said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday. \"The executive orders issued by the president on funding reviews remain in full force and effect and will be rigorously implemented by all agencies and departments. This action should effectively end the court case and allow the government to focus on enforcing the president's orders on controlling federal spending.\"",
      "Trump administration rescinds federal funding freeze memo after chaos",
      "Trump administration rescinds federal funding freeze memo after chaos",
      "Before OMB abruptly reversed course, experts had questioned the policy, saying it was poorly thought out and implemented.",
      "\"If this was being undertaken pursuant to the executive orders on [diversity, equity and inclusion], why would the administration issue such broad, unclear and confusing directions?\" Tad DeHaven, a policy analyst focusing on economic and fiscal policy issues at the libertarian Cato Institute, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I don't really understand it, and I think even people who are in positions of power don't really understand it,\" added Wendy Edelberg, director of The Hamilton Project at Brookings, a liberal-leaning public policy research group.",
      "What programs aren't affected by the funding freeze?",
      "The memo, from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), indicated that Social Security and Medicare programs would be exempt from the suspension in federal funding. Additional guidance released Tuesday further specified that \"any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause.\"",
      "\"In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause,\" the updated guidance said.",
      "The memo adds that funds for small businesses, farmers, Pell grants, Head Start, rental assistance and other similar programs are also exempt.",
      "But even if the order ends up being more narrowly tailored, it could still have serious financial implications for the millions of Americans who receive federal assistance, experts said.",
      "\"If it's resolved quickly, the aggregate economic effects for the first quarter will be modest, but it will matter a whole lot to people on the other side of these expected payments,\" Edelberg said. \"It could be the difference between having a job and not, getting evicted or affording food \u2014 and the economic numbers won't fully reflect how individuals are going to feel this.\"",
      "Here's what to know about who may be affected by the proposed pause in federal funding.",
      "Will I still get SNAP benefits?",
      "The freeze does not apply to all federal financial assistance, according to an Office of Management and Budget memo on Tuesday. The agency indicates that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, better known as food stamps, are excluded, specifying that \"... any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause and exempted from this review process.\"",
      "\"In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause,\" the memo reads.",
      "SNAP serves roughly 41 million low-income Americans.",
      "Yet while the program appears to be exempt from the freeze, \"You are still going to be really worried in the near term whether the federal government is going to make good on those promises,\" Edelberg said. \"And that kind of uncertainty is not good for the economy.\"",
      "Are meals for seniors affected?",
      "The Older Americans Act Nutrition Program, a federal initiative that supports community-based senior nutrition programs like Meals on Wheels, could be affected by the proposed funding pause.",
      "If the order includes the Older Americans Act, it \"would halt service to millions of vulnerable seniors who have no other means of purchasing or preparing meals,\" Meals on Wheels said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lack of clarity is creating chaos for Meals on Wheels providers not knowing whether they should be serving meals today.\"",
      "Is housing assistance at risk?",
      "The OMB memo added that rental assistance and other similar programs will not be paused. Still, the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) expressed concern that Department of Housing and Urban Development programs could be covered by the freeze.",
      "\"Even a short pause in funding could cause significant harm to low-income families and their communities,\" NLIHC Interim President and CEO Renee Willis said in a\u00a0statement. \"The longer the freeze continues, the greater the risk that low-income households receiving federal rental assistance could face eviction, and in the worst cases, homelessness \u2014 homeless shelters may be forced to close their doors, and nonprofit organizations may have to lay off staff.\"",
      "Are student loans affected?",
      "The federal funding freeze does not apply to student loans and Pell grants, according to the Department of Education. The funding pause \"only applies to discretionary grants at the Department of Education,\" DOE spokesperson Madi Biedermann said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Still, an advocate for students with government loans said they are worried about the impact of the freeze.",
      "\"Any kind of freeze to federal financial aid across the board is incredibly harmful to working families just trying to pay for college,\" Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at Student Borrower Protection Center, told CBS MoneyWatch, adding that \"Lots of questions remain about what the freeze applies to and what programs it does not,\"",
      "Meanwhile, many student borrowers rely on different kinds of government assistance to cover costs beyond tuition, Ba\u00f1ez noted.",
      "\"There are other types of federal work-study grants that go directly to colleges and universities, and supplemental education opportunities that go to some of the lowest-income students. People really rely on federal financial aid, and you could see families having to drop out of college or figure out how they will cover this gap,\" she said.",
      "The OMB memo also indicated that Head Start, a preschool program serving nearly 800,000 low-income children that receives federal health funds, is not impacted by the pause.",
      "But the National Head Start Association (NHSA) said that the OMB memo has already \"created panic among Head Start grant recipients who are currently not able to draw down any funds.\"",
      "\"While we understand that this is an evolving story, this disruption, at best, will slow down Head Start agencies' ability to pay hundreds of thousands of staff, contractors, and small businesses who support Head Start operations in every corner of the country,\" NHSA Executive Director Yasmina Vinci said in a statement. \"At worst, this means that hundreds of thousands of families will not be able to depend on the critical services and likely will not be able to work.\"",
      "Medicaid systems go down",
      "Despite the updated guidance issued Tuesday stating that programs including Medicaid were excluded from the funding pause, state Medicaid programs on Tuesday\u00a0said they were locked out\u00a0of the Department of Health and Human Services system used to track and disburse money.",
      "The White House late Tuesday pointed to an \"outage\" for blocking a range of organizations and agencies from accessing the online systems responsible for tapping federal health dollars.",
      "The Payment Management Services web portal displayed a message reading: \"Due to Executive Orders regarding potentially unallowable grant payments, PMS is taking additional measures to process payments. Reviews of applicable programs and payments will result in delays and/or rejections of payments.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 12:17:52 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has said he will \"demand\" lower interest rates, raising questions about his ability to influence the Federal Reserve.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump had a message last week for the Federal Reserve while at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland: He plans to \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\"",
      "Mr. Trump may be in for disappointment. The Federal Reserve widely expected to keep its benchmark rate steady when it announces its latest interest rate decision today at 2 p.m. Eastern Time. Economists aren't penciling in a 2025 reduction until at least May, according to economists polled by financial data service FactSet.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has over the years steadfastly defended the central bank's independence. Most recently, he underlined at a New York Times event in December that insulating the Fed from political influence is \"for the benefit of all Americans,\" allowing it to make decisions based on economic data rather than at the behest of elected officials. The Fed's independence allows it to pursue its dual mandate \u2014 to keep inflation low and the labor market at full employment \u2014 without political pressure, economists concur.",
      "\"We know monetary policy needs to be enacted with a democratic mandate underpinning it, with a day-to-day remove from politics,\" Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Interest rates may need to be raised but it may be inconvenient for political interests, and [the central bank] may need to move quickly to lower rates\" in case of an economic downturn.",
      "While the Fed is an independent agency, it is accountable to Congress and the public, with its chair and other officials testifying before Congress regularly. Its dual mandate was also established by Congress, as well as its structure of staggered appointments for Fed officials, designed to make the agency less vulnerable to pressures \"that could lead to undesirable outcomes,\" according to the Fed.",
      "What happens when a central bank isn't independent?",
      "Those \"undesirable outcomes\" can be seen in nations where central bankers are more vulnerable to political influence, economists say.",
      "That's because interest rates remain the most potent weapon that a central bank can wield against surging inflation \u2014 a tool that the Federal Reserve turned to in 2022 to tame the hottest U.S. inflation in 40 years. But elected officials sometimes decide that higher borrowing costs are politically inconvenient, because they make it more expensive for businesses to expand or for consumers to make purchases.",
      "In cases where a central bank isn't independent, officials may succeed in pressuring a central bank to keep a lid on rates.",
      "Experts point to Turkey as an example of what can occur when political interests dictate a central bank's monetary policies. Since 2010, its central bank has increasingly come under pressure from President Erdo\u011fan to keep its interest rates low, even as inflation surged during the pandemic, according to the non-partisan Centre for Economic Policy Research.",
      "Instead of hiking rates as Turkey's inflation rate topped 80% in October 2022 on an annual basis, the nation's central bank cut its benchmark rate several times in 2022 and 2023. While the bank reversed course and hiked rates starting in mid-2023, inflation there has proved tough to tame, with prices rising by 44% in December 2024.",
      "By comparison, the highest U.S. inflation rate during the post-pandemic period was in June 2022, when inflation hit 9.1% on an annual basis in June 2022. In the face of the Fed's rate hikes, inflation has cooled since then, deflating to 2.9% on an annual basis last month.",
      "\"The Fed has done really well \u2014 they have raised the rates enough to try to slowly squeeze inflation out of the market,\" noted Erasmus Kersting, a professor of economics at Villanova University. The Fed has \"done all that while avoiding a recession \u2014 that is a delicate needle to thread.\"",
      "Could Mr. Trump influence the Fed?",
      "Questions about Mr. Trump's ability to influence the Federal Reserve or shake up its leadership are intensifying amid the president's statements about his desire for lower interest rates. During his 2024 election campaign, Mr. Trump had insisted that as president he should have a \"say\" in the Fed's interest rate policies.",
      "\"I think that, in my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman,\" Mr. Trump said in August.",
      "For his part, Powell said last year that he would not resign\u00a0even if asked to do so by Mr. Trump, adding that under the law presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "However, Mr. Trump has recently fired several government officials in ways that critics say violate the law, such as his administration's firing of more than a dozen federal inspectors general on Friday. Federal law requires the White House to give Congress a full month of warning and case-specific details before firing a federal inspector general.",
      "Removing Powell wouldn't necessarily change the Fed's monetary policy decisions, given that rates are set by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Seven members are from the Fed's Board of Governors; four are assigned from the 11 Reserve Bank presidents, who each serve one-year terms on a rotating basis; and one FOMC member is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Interfering with the Fed could have consequences, both legally and for the stock market, experts said.",
      "\"Should any president attempt to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve without cause other than doing the job they were appointed and confirmed to do, I expect there to be swift legal challenges,\" noted Tim Stretton at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government watchdog. \"I suspect the market would also react negatively. Markets like stability, and this level of unprecedented interference in the Federal Reserve would be anything but stable.\"",
      "Asked what advice he would give Mr. Trump about dealing with the Fed, Columbia Business School's House said, \"Stop talking.\"",
      "He added, \"Let the Fed conduct its business consistent with its mandate, and it'll be more likely to get interest rates down.\"",

    "story": [
      "As Chinese AI application DeepSeek attracts hordes of American users, Trump administration officials, lawmakers and cybersecurity experts are expressing concern that the technology could pose a threat to U.S. national security.",
      "DeepSeek's introduction in the U.S. on Monday saw it quickly become the most downloaded free application in the country on Apple's app store. The rollout also rocked Wall Street as investors struggled to compute the sudden appearance of a low-cost, open-source generative AI tool able to compete with leading artificial intelligence apps such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Shares of Nvidia, the U.S. manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, plummeted 17%, chopping roughly $600 billion off its market value \u2014 a record single-day drop for a U.S. stock.",
      "That explosive debut was branded a \"wake-up call\" by President Trump on Monday. Addressing reporters on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the National Security Council (NSC) would examine the potential national security implications around DeepSeek's launch, noting that the administration would seek to \"ensure American AI dominance.\"",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "Some lawmakers also weighed in with concerns about the application's access to U.S. users.",
      "\"The U.S. cannot allow Chinese Communist Party models such as DeepSeek to risk our national security and leverage our technology to advance their AI ambitions,\" Rep. John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said Tuesday in a statement shared on social media. \"We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek's AI infrastructure.\"",
      "The spotlight on DeepSeek comes amid rising tensions over trade, technology and other issues between the two superpowers. The U.S. has already imposed significant export controls on China in an effort to rein in Beijing's production of semiconductors used in developing advanced AI, with the most recent curbs coming in\u00a0December.",
      "\"At the President's direction, the NSC and others in the U.S. government work in many ways to address concerns involving AI, China and data security,\" agency spokesperson Brian Hughes told CBS News in an email. \"As the President has underscored, U.S. policy is to ensure that the United States leads the world in AI.\"",
      "Security threat for users",
      "While the calls from Moolenaar could be the first inkling of a possible congressional crackdown, Ross Burley \u2014 a co-founder of the nonprofit Centre for Information Resilience \u2014 warned that DeepSeek's emergence in the U.S. raises data security and privacy issues for users. Chinese law grants Beijing broad authority to access data from companies based in China.",
      "\"More and more people will use it, and that will open the door to more and more personal data just being given away to the [Chinese Communist Party] and being sent basically to mainland China to be able to inform them of their activities,\" Burley told CBS News.",
      "\"What they'll use it for is behavior change campaigns, disinformation campaigns, for really targeted messaging as to what Western audiences like, what they do,\" he added.",
      "DeepSeek, which is based in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, notes in its privacy policy that the personal information it collects from users is held \"on secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Under that\u00a0policy, the company says it collects information including users' \"device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, and system language.\" DeepSeek also collects \"service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs,\" according to the company.",
      "A key difference from TikTok",
      "The fact that DeepSeek's servers are based in mainland China differentiates it from TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform that Congress had sought to ban on national security grounds before President Trump signed an executive order last week directing the Justice Department to not enforce the law for a period of 75 days.",
      "In an effort to mitigate U.S. regulatory concerns, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in 2022 moved all of its U.S. data to infrastructure owned by American software maker Oracle.",
      "The legislation banning TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April \u2014 grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on tech platforms owned by countries regarded as U.S. adversaries.",
      "Under that law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content; has more than 1 million monthly active users; is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country; and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "But DeepSeek may be seen as less of a threat given that, unlike TikTok, it is an open-source large language model, according to Matt Sheehan, a China fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\"[A] lot of these open-source apps, open-source models, you can actually sort of use them directly on other platforms. Perplexity is a major U.S. AI company, and they're currently using a version of DeepSeek that you can use that doesn't have the data privacy or security threats,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Advancing censorship?",
      "One issue that DeepSeek users face outside of China: censorship. For example, a CBS News analysis of the application found that DeepSeek did not return any results for a prompt seeking information bout the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre in Beijing.",
      "Burley of the Centre for Information Resilience thinks such suppression of information on an app being downloaded by millions of users will pressure policymakers to act.",
      "\"I think it's incumbent on Western governments \u2014 the U.K., Canada, the U.S. \u2014 to look and see if it is wise for the Apple store and the Android store to host this large language model when it is so clearly being curated to push Chinese narratives and censorship,\" he said.",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 17:19:32 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has painted a bullseye on diversity, equity and inclusion. But what exactly is DEI, and what has it achieved?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the U.S. government is renewing debate over what DEI is and whether it has benefited workers and companies.",
      "DEI has its roots in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which barred employment discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion and other criteria. In the following decades, a range of policies have sought to root out bias in hiring, promote fairness in the workplace and open career pathways for people of color and for women, while also expanding to include sexual orientation and gender identity.",
      "This push gained momentum after the 2020 murder of George Floyd, as politicians and social activists pressed companies to do their part in confronting systemic racism. But Mr. Trump's Jan. 20\u00a0order, issued on his first day back in office, criticized DEI as \"illegal and immoral,\" while the following day a memo from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management called for all federal DEI employees to be placed on leave.",
      "What is DEI in the workplace?",
      "DEI is often misperceived as focusing only on race, according to DEI experts. But such initiatives comprise many practices that aim to uplift different marginalized groups in the workplace. For example, a policy that accommodates working parents, such as flexible work hours, could qualify as DEI. So could establishing affinity groups based on shared identities, like sexual orientation.",
      "Many critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. Other opponents of the policies go further, arguing that DEI itself promotes racism.",
      "But DEI defenders say that policies that seek to foster diversity and inclusion within organizations aren't in conflict with those that seek to reward the most talented or hardest-working employees.",
      "\"DEI enhances merit by saying, 'How do we find the best people for the job or make sure we are promoting the best people?'\" David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NYU School of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And that means thinking about barriers and biases that might be getting in the way of considering the full talent pool.\"",
      "In defining DEI, Glasgow described \"diversity\" as a commitment to diversifying personnel within an institution so that U.S. workplaces better represent the population at large. \"It's about engaging in effective outreach to places that might be overlooked and making sure hiring and promotion systems aren't screening out women or people of color from being considered,\" he said.",
      "Meanwhile, when designed and implemented effectively, DEI programs are not discriminatory, according to Jessica Fulton, vice president of Policy at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonprofit that aims to improve African-Americans' socioeconomic status.",
      "\"These policies don't actually dictate who gets hired. They are ways to open doors to people who might not have access or aren't as well-connected in an industry or occupation,\" she explained.",
      "The equity piece of DEI seeks to level the playing field for groups of workers who have historically been underrepresented in a given field or who, compared with their white or male peers, are underpaid for doing the same work.",
      "\"It could mean making sure women are able to enter traditionally male-dominated occupations, like construction or technology,\" Fulton said. \"It's about addressing issues around equal pay for equal work, making sure people feel safe in the workplace so they don't feel discrimination when they come to work, because workers who don't feel safe are not the most productive.\"",
      "Corporations also commonly aim to develop inclusion policies that help people from diverse backgrounds feel safe within a given workplace and its culture, she explained. They are intended to be, and often are, inclusive of everyone and not just members of marginalized communities, according to Fulton.",
      "\"It is also making sure they can put certain policies in place to make sure their workers stick around and keep working. It is about building a great team and being able to treat that team well and retain the folks they hire,\" Fulton said.",
      "Given the recent backlash against DEI, though, a number of corporations are moving away from such inclusion policies, noting that they could pose a legal risk. That's after many major U.S. employers already ditched their DEI programs in response to pressure from anti-diversity activists. Among them are Ford,\u00a0Harley Davidson,\u00a0McDonald's, Meta and more.",
      "How is success measured?",
      "Many corporate executives have soured on DEI in recent years because of the perception that such policies don't enhance a company's performance, said Daniel Snell, co-founder of Arrival, a UK-based consulting firm focused on corporate leadership and culture. Other leaders, while recognizing the value of promoting diversity and inclusion, argue that DEI is inadequate for redressing what are at bottom much broader socioeconomic issues.",
      "Glasgow of NYU Law concedes that it can be hard to determine if DEI programs are succeeding or otherwise clearly assess their outcomes. \"It's difficult to measure certain DEI interventions, like the effectiveness of implicit bias training in the workplace,\" he said. \"It also depends on what you are trying to achieve.\"",
      "One tool employers use to try to gauge the efficacy of DEI policies are internal surveys that ask workers whether they feel like they can be themselves in the office, believe they are respected by their peers, and feel that their opinions matter. When it comes to a company's mentorship and promotion policies, employers will also monitor if members of a particular group of workers, such as veterans and Black employees, are quitting shortly after being hired \u2014 patterns that can yield insights into a workplace's equity and inclusiveness.",
      "By contrast, if over time more women or people of color ascend to leadership positions, that could be viewed as a company achieving its goal of building a workplace that's more representative of its job applicant pool.",
      "Corporate DEI programs aren't altruistic, experts emphasize, pointing to at least some empirical evidence showing that such efforts can help companies adapt to change, support innovation and even boost the bottom line.",
      "\"The point of diversity and inclusion is that companies, the government, universities, all do better when there are diverse participants in management and throughout the enterprise,\" said Michael Posner, director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. \"The objective of this is not to set quotas or say we are going to take unqualified people because they fit a certain characteristic, like gender or race, but to create opportunity and try to overcome historic barriers to entry.\"",
      "In one noted study, McKinsey found that companies in the top quartile for the gender diversity of their boards of director are 27% more likely to outperform financially than those in the bottom quartile. In separate research, the consulting firm in 2024 found that women's representation at work over the past decade has increased at every level of corporate management \u2014 women today make up 29% of C-suite level positions, up from 17% in 2015.",
      "\"[A] lot of the language and framing right now of DEI as illegal and discriminatory obscures who it's really for, which is all of us, and to the benefit of companies,\" Fulton told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "A Chinese artificial intelligence company called DeepSeek is grabbing America's attention \u2014 and sending a shock wave through Wall Street \u2014 due to its new tech, which some experts say rivals that of OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "DeepSeek is also catching investors off guard because of the low development costs for its AI app, which Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives pegged at only $6 million. By comparison, OpenAI, Google and other major U.S. companies are on track to invest a total of roughly $1 trillion in AI over the coming years, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "On Monday, DeepSeek's rollout roiled shares of AI stalwarts such as Nvidia, the high-flying manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, and Dutch company ASML, another chipmaker. The Chinese company's tech is raising questions about whether demand for Nvidia's chips could take a hit, as well as whether investors are overvaluing tech stocks that have been buoyed by the promise of AI, from Meta to Microsoft, experts said.",
      "\"DeepSeek has taken the market by storm by doing more with less,\" said Giuseppe Sette, president at AI market research firm Reflexivity, in an email. \"This shows that with AI the surprises will keep on coming in the next few years.\"",
      "DeepSeek's latest app comes just days after President Trump announced a new $500 billion venture\u00a0with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, dubbed Stargate, which he touted as ensuring \"the future of technology\" in the U.S.",
      "AI-related stocks took a hit on Monday, with Nvidia shares tumbling 17%, shedding $600 billion in value and marking the single-biggest one-day loss for a company in stock market history, according\u00a0to CNBC. ASML sank 6%, while Broadcom, another semiconductor stock, also slumped 17%.",
      "Some energy-related stocks also plunged on Monday on investor worries that the new tech could require less energy to run, translating into lower demand from the tech sector. GE Vernova, which makes wind and gas turbines, plunged 21%, while electricity generator Vistra slumped 28%.",
      "The tech-heavy Nasdaq index slumped 3%, or 612 points, while the S&P 500 declined 1.5%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7%.",
      "Despite the sharp drop on the Nasdaq, it's far from the worst day for the index during the past five years. The worst one-day decline since Jan. 27, 2020, came on March 16, 2020, when the index plunged more than 12% as COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy.",
      "What is DeepSeek?",
      "DeepSeek is a private Chinese company founded in July 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a graduate of Zhejiang University, one of China's top universities, who funded the startup via his hedge fund,\u00a0according to the MIT Technology Review. Liang has about $8 billion in assets, Ives wrote in a Jan. 27 research note.",
      "Liang, who had previously focused on applying AI to investing, had bought a \"stockpile of Nvidia A100 chips,\" a type of tech that is now banned from export to China. Those chips became the basis of DeepSeek, the MIT publication reported.",
      "Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius, told investors in a note that DeepSeek makes legitimate breakthroughs as an AI tool, including better learning and more efficient use of memory, although he expressed skepticism about the \"amount of chips used.\"",
      "Is DeepSeek available in the U.S.?",
      "The company's AI app is available in Apple's App store, as well as online at its website. The service is free and as of Monday morning was the top download on Apple's store, although some people were having trouble signing up for the app.",
      "On its Chinese site, DeepSeek blamed \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its service, requiring it to temporarily limit new registrations. \"Existing users can log in as usual,\" the company said in the post, which was dated shortly after midnight Jan. 28 in China's local time.",
      "The company released its latest AI model on Jan. 20, which is causing Wall Street to reappraise the AI sector.",
      "\"Last week DeepSeek launched a model that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta's Llama 3.1 and was #1 on Apple's App Store over the weekend,\" Wedbush's Ives wrote. \"DeepSeek built the model using reduced capability chips from Nvidia. which is impressive and thus has caused major agita for U.S. tech stocks with massive pressure on Nasdaq this morning.\"",
      "How is DeepSeek different than other AI apps?",
      "DeepSeek is an open-source large language model that relies on what is known as \"inference-time computing,\" which Sette said in layman's terms means \"they activate only the most relevant portions of their model for each query, and that saves money and computation power.\"",
      "Some experts praised DeepSeek's performance, with noted tech investor Marc Andreessen writing\u00a0on X on Jan. 24, \"DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen \u2014 and as open source, a profound gift to the world.\"",
      "David Sacks, a venture capitalist named by Mr. Trump to help oversee AI and cryptocurrency policy, said on social media Monday that DeepSee's app \"shows that the AI race will be very competitive.\"",
      "However, Ives said he's skeptical the service will gain ground with major U.S. businesses.",
      "\"No U.S. Global 2000 is going to use a Chinese startup DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases,\" Ives wrote. \"At the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia.\"",
      "Are there privacy issues with DeepSeek?",
      "Some experts are raising concerns about the personal data that DeepSeek is collecting, given that the company stores data from users \u2014 including their date of birth, keystrokes, text or audio inputs, uploaded files, chat history and other data \u2014 on servers located in China, according to its privacy policy.",
      "That echoes some of the issues raised with TikTok, another company with Chinese ownership that sparked worries about the supposed risks its ties to China posed to national security. Last year, Congress passed a law\u00a0banning\u00a0 TikTok in the U.S. as long as it is under Chinese ownership, although that is now in flux after President Trump signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0directing the Justice Department to not enforce the ban for 75 days.",
      "What does DeepSeek mean for Nvidia and other tech companies?",
      "Wall Street is trying to assess the long-term impact of a low-cost AI tool from China that rivals ChatGPT and other so-called generative AI apps. It also raises questions about whether Silicon Valley is overspending on tech advancements in the AI sector, noted Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, in an email.",
      "\"The fact that this technology is supposed to take less energy and is more cost-effective than U.S.-based models has U.S. technology investors very concerned,\" Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, said.",
      "It's also unclear what type of pushback or reaction could come from the White House, given that Mr. Trump has raised the possibility of placing new tariffs on Chinese imports, although he also gave the Chinese-owned TikTok a reprieve by ordering the Justice Department not to enforce a looming ban.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts think Monday's stock selloff is an overreaction, noting that the enormous demand for AI will continue lifting key players in the sector.",
      "\"It's one thing to train a [large language] model for less money, but accommodating the huge demand for the consumption of all this AI technology is still going to require massive amounts of infrastructure,\" Adam Crisafulli of VitalKnowledge said in a report.",
      "Analysts at Bernstein Research also noted that while DeepSeek's technology looks promising, it likely isn't revolutionary, suggesting that Monday's investment rout is overblown.",
      "What is Nvidia saying about DeepSeek?",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Nvidia offered praise for DeepSeek.",
      "\"DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of test-time scaling,\" the company said in an email. \"DeepSeek's work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export-control compliant.\"",
      "But, Nvidia added, AI inference, or using AI models to make decisions or predictions, \"requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.\"",

      "Employees at the Philadelphia store at 21st Street and Pennsylvania Avenue cast 130 votes \u2014 or about 57% of the ballots cast \u2014 in favor of joining a local chapter of The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union for the purposes of collective bargaining. According to the National Labor Relations Board, which oversaw the election, 100 workers rejected the motion.",
      "\"This fight is far from over, but today's victory is an important step forward,\" said Wendell Young IV, the president of UFCW Local 1776. \"We are ready to bring Whole Foods to the bargaining table to negotiate a fair first contract that reflects the workers' needs and priorities.\"",
      "The results mark the first successful entry of organized labor into Amazon's grocery business, which includes Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh and the Amazon Go convenience stores. Amazon, which purchased Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion, has tried to fend off organizing efforts in its stores as well as by delivery drivers and warehouse workers.",
      "Nearly three years ago, Amazon warehouse workers in the New York City borough of Staten Island voted to be represented in labor negotiations by a fledgling union that has since affiliated with the Teamsters. But Amazon has refused to come to the bargaining table.",
      "Employees at the Whole Foods store, located in the center of Philadelphia, started organizing early last year, Young said. They teamed up with UFCW Local 1776 in the late summer, and in November petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to hold an official election.",
      "The local union said the store workers hoped a successful vote would help them secure higher wages, more affordable health care coverage, child care support, greater work-life balance and better working conditions.",
      "In a statement after the votes were counted Monday night, Whole Foods said it \"is proud to offer competitive compensation, great benefits, and career advancement opportunities to all Team Members.\"",
      "\"We are disappointed by the outcome of this election, but we are committed to maintaining a positive working environment in our Philly Center City store,\" the company added.",
      "The company said it provides store employees with a competitive average hourly wage and other benefits, such as 401(k) plans and \"on-demand\" mental health support. It did not disclose its average hourly rate, but some online job postings show store employees can earn $16 per hour or higher.",
      "After the union filed the election petition, workers at the Philadelphia store were given free snacks, and the company repainted their break rooms, according to Young.",
      "Earlier this month, UFCW Local 1776 filed unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB against the company, accusing it of firing one worker in retaliation for union activities and alleging that supervisors told employees they would get paid more if they rejected the union bid. Whole Foods disputed the worker was fired in retaliation.",
      "The union has also accused Whole Foods of withholding region-wide wage increases from employees at the Philadelphia store because of the union activities.",
      "The company acknowledges it did not offer wage increases to workers at the store, even though it did so at a number of other stores as part of a quarterly review. Whole Foods maintains it would have been illegal to make wage adjustments in the lead-up to the union election, an argument Young disputed.",
      "The company said it was delaying the pay bumps until after the election to avoid the appearance of trying to influence the vote with raises.",

      "The proposal, submitted last week, is a revision of a prior plan the artificial intelligence startup had presented to TikTok's parent ByteDance on Jan. 18, a day before the law that bans TikTok went into effect.",
      "The first proposal, which ByteDance hasn't responded to, sought to create a new structure that would merge San Francisco-based Perplexity with TikTok's U.S. business and include investments from other investors.",
      "The new proposal would allow the U.S. government to own up to half of that new structure once it makes an initial public offering of at least $300 billion, said the person, who was not authorized to speak about the proposal. The person said Perplexity's proposal was revised based off of feedback from the Trump administration.",

      "ByteDance and TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Under the plan, ByteDance would not have to completely cut ties with TikTok, a favorable outcome for its investors. But it would have to allow a \"full U.S. board control,\" the person said.",
      "Under the proposal, the China-based tech company would contribute TikTok's U.S. business without the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app, according to a document seen by the Associated Press.",
      "The proposal seems to mirror a strategy Steven Mnuchin, treasury secretary during President Donald Trump's first term, discussed Sunday on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures \u2014 that a new investor in TikTok could simply \"dilute down\" the Chinese ownership and satisfy the law. Mnuchin has previously expressed interest in investing in the company.",

      "On\u00a0a flight from Las Vegas to Miami on Air Force One, Mr. Trump also said he hadn't discussed a deal with Larry Ellison, CEO of software maker Oracle, despite\u00a0a report\u00a0that Oracle, along with outside investors, was considering taking over TikTok's global operation.",
      "\"Numerous people are talking to me. Very substantial people,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We have a lot of interest in it, and the United States will be a big beneficiary. ... I'd only do it if the United States benefits.\"",
      "Under a bipartisan law passed last year, TikTok was to be banned in the United States by Jan. 19 if it did not cut ties with ByteDance. The Supreme Court upheld the law, but Mr. Trump then issued an executive order to halt enforcement of the law for 75 days.",
      "Mr. Trump, on Air Force One, noted that Ellison lives \"right down the road\" from his Mar-a-Lago estate, but added, \"I never spoke to Larry about TikTok. I've spoken to many people about TikTok and there's great interest in TikTok.\"",
      "TikTok briefly shut down in the U.S. a week ago, but went back online after Mr. Trump said he would postpone the ban. Mr. Trump had unsuccessfully attempted a U.S. ban of the platform during his first term. But he has since reversed his position and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters during last year's presidential election.",

    "summary": "Discount store chain Target says it's joining rival Walmart and a number of other prominent American brands in scaling back corporate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",
    "story": [
      "Discount store chain Target said Friday that it would join rival Walmart and a number of other prominent American brands in scaling back diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that have come under attack from conservative activists and, as of this week, the White House.",
      "The Minneapolis-based retailer said the changes to its \"Belonging at the Bullseye\" strategy would include ending a program it established to help Black employees build meaningful careers, improve the experience of Black shoppers and to promote Black-owned businesses following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.",
      "Target, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it already had planned to end the racial program this year. The company said Friday that it also would conclude the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, goals it previously set in three-year cycles.",
      "The goals included hiring and promoting more women and members of racial minority groups, and recruiting more diverse suppliers, including businesses owned by people of color, women, LGBTQ+ people, veterans and people with disabilities.",
      "Target has long been a fierce corporate advocate for the rights of Black and LGBTQ+ people. In a memo to employees, Kiera Fernandez, Target's chief community impact and equity officer, as a \"next chapter\" in a decades-long process to create \"inclusive work and guest environments that welcome all.\"",
      "\"Many years of data, insights, listening and learning have been shaping this next chapter in our strategy,\" Fernandez wrote in the memo, which Target shared Friday. \"And as a retailer that serves millions of consumers every day, we understand the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape, now and in the future.\"",
      "There's no doubt the U.S. civil rights landscape has undergone a massive transformation in the five years since much of corporate America adopted DEI goals in response to the Black Lives Matter protests that followed Floyd's death in Minneapolis.",
      "In 2020, Target pledged to give $10 million to social justice initiatives and to rebuild areas of the Twin Cities damaged by riots. At that time, Target leaders said they wanted to increase their Black workforce by 20% over the next three years.",
      "A 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions emboldened conservative groups to bring or threaten lawsuits targeting corporate initiatives such as employee resource groups and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.",
      "Walmart, McDonald's, Ford, Harley-Davison, John Deere and Lowe's are among the well-known consumer brands that reduced or phased out their DEI commitments in recent months.",
      "President Donald Trump this week signaled his administration's agreement with conservatives who argue that policies designed to increase minority representation by considering factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation are unconstitutional.",
      "On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order aimed at ending DEI programs within the federal government. The order cut funding for so-called DEI initiatives across all agencies in order to \"end DEI inside the federal government,\" according to Trump administration officials.",
      "A memo from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Tuesday evening called for all federal DEI employees to be placed on leave by Wednesday evening.",
      "Unlike some of the companies retooling or retiring their diversity initiatives, Target's work to build a more inclusive workforce predated 2020, and the company also was long seen as a trailblazer with respect to LGBTQ+ inclusion.",
      "But the employee memo shared Friday said Target no longer would participate in surveys designed to gauge the effectiveness of its actions, including an annual index compiled by the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ+ rights organization. Target said it would further evaluate corporate partnerships to ensure they're connected directly to business objectives, but declined to share details.",
      "Getting corporations to withdraw from the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index and to stop sponsoring Pride activities have been goals of DEI opponents.",
      "Steering clear of a backlash from conservative customers and organizations is something that Target has tried to navigate for a while. As transgender rights became a more prominent issue in 2016, the company declared that \"inclusivity is a core belief at Target\" and said it supported transgender employees and customers using whichever restroom or fitting room \"corresponds with their gender identity.\"",
      "But after some customers threatened to boycott Target stores, the company said that more stores would make available a single-toilet bathroom with a door that could be locked.",
      "In 2023, Target faced an anti-LGBTQ campaign that went viral on social media. The campaign\u00a0threatened employees and there were some instances of damaged products and displays in stores. In response, Target removed certain items that it said caused the most \"volatile\" reaction from opponents.",
      "The company did not stock its stores with Pride Month products in 2024.",
      "Still, some prominent companies have resisted public pressure to retreat from their diversity plans. On Thursday, Costco shareholders rejected a proposal urging the wholesale club operator to evaluate any risks posed by its diversity, equity and inclusion practices.",
      "According to preliminary results shared by Costco executives, more than 98% of shares voted against the proposal submitted by a conservative think tank based in Washington. Costco's board of directors had recommended a no vote.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2025 17:20:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Republican lawmakers are floating a range of ideas to pay for an extension of President Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.",
    "story": [
      "A key economic priority for President Trump this year is to extend the provisions in his signature Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a 2017 law that lowered tax rates for most Americans, before they expire at the end of 2025. Now, Republican lawmakers have developed a 50-page laundry list of ideas for how to pay for those planned cuts.",
      "The plan from congressional Republicans,\u00a0published earlier by the New York Times, was confirmed by a person familiar with the document, who noted that it represents a menu of policy options for lawmakers to consider. The document also cites several new tax breaks proposed by Mr. Trump while on the campaign trail last falls, such as eliminating taxes on overtime and tips.",
      "But extending the TCJA's provisions alone could prove costly, with the Congressional Budget Office forecasting a cost of $4.6 trillion over 10 years. Adding new tax breaks, such as Mr. Trump's promise to ditch taxes on overtime pay, could push up the bill even higher at a time when the nation's debt has spiraled to more than $36 trillion.",
      "According to the document, some ideas for funding those tax breaks include eliminating the mortgage home deduction, a popular break for homeowners, and the deductibility of student loan interest. Other methods to drum up more money include an across-the-board 10% import tariff \u2014 essentially, a universal tax on U.S. imports that would be paid by consumers.",
      "The plan also outlines ideas for cutting federal spending, primarily by trimming outlays for social safety net programs such as Medicaid and food stamps. Overall, the document points to a potential tax overhaul that could put more money in the pockets of wealthier \u00a0Americans while cutting assistance for low- and middle-class taxpayers, experts say.",
      "\"If you are extending the tax cuts and enacting tariffs and cutting Medicaid, that will deliver benefits more among higher-income households, and more of a cost will be born by lower-income households,\" Joseph Rosenberg, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a tax-focused think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Adding a blanket 10% tariff could raise $1.9 trillion over the next decade, according to the document shared with Republican lawmakers. But tariffs are largely paid by consumers because companies tend to raise their prices to cover the extra import duties. Mr. Trump's tariffs could add $2,600 a year in costs for the typical U.S. family, according to an August\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank focused on economic issues.",

      "Damage caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton helped push total economic losses from natural disasters in the U.S. to $217.8 billion last year, according to insurance broker Aon PLC. That figure represents an 85.3% increase from 2023, when losses totaled about $117.5 billion. It's also the largest annual tally of economic losses from natural disasters since 2017.",
      "Insured losses, or the portion of economic losses that are covered by insurance, also rose last year. They climbed 36% to $112.7 billion, the most since 2022. In some areas, homes are such great a risk that they're\u00a0too expensive to insure \u2014 if private insurance is even available at all.",
      "Hurricane Helene tore across six southeastern states last fall, costing $75 billion in economic losses, mainly due to inland and coastal flooding. according to Aon. Less than two weeks later, Hurricane Milton made landfall on the west coast of Florida, causing some $25 billion in economic losses.",
      "\"In 2024, one of the big differences is we had significant U.S. hurricane events that happened,\" said Liz Henderson, global head of climate risk advisory at Aon. \"When those events happen, they affect a large area and they affect areas with large values in terms of properties and people and content. So the losses from those events tend to be significantly higher.\"",
      "At least two other hurricanes, several severe \"convective\" storms and a draught contributed to the losses from natural disasters in the U.S. last year.",
      "In addition to the severe storms in the U.S., deadly floods in the Valencia region of Spain and other natural disasters drove worldwide economic losses from natural disasters to $368 billion last year, according to Aon. That's a 7.3% decline from 2023, but about 14% higher than the annual average going back to 2000. Global insured losses, meanwhile, climbed 15.1% to $145 billion.",
      "While it's impossible to predict the timing, location and losses from natural disasters, 2025 is not off to an encouraging start. The devastating wildfires that erupted in Los Angeles County on Jan. 7, killing at least 28 people and destroying more than 14,000 structures, are already projected to be among the costliest natural disasters.",
      "In a separate report last week, Aon estimated that total economic and insured losses for the two largest wildfires \u2014 the Palisades fire and the Eaton blaze burning just outside Los Angeles \u2014 could reach into the lower tens of billions of dollars, likely making them the costliest wildfires in U.S. history.",

    "summary": "Costco's public support of DEI programs contrasts with positions taken in recent months by other big U.S. brands",
    "story": [
      "Costco shareholders voted down a shareholder proposal urging the wholesale club operator to evaluate any risks posed by its diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, practices.",
      "According to preliminary results shared by Costco executives at its annual meeting Thursday, more than 98% of shares voted against the proposal.",
      "In a pre-recorded statement which was played at Costco's 2025 annual shareholders meeting on Jan. 23, the shareholder proposing the anti-DEI resolution, The National Center for Public Policy Research, said that \"Diversity, equity and inclusion may sound benign on the surface, but in reality it is weaponized language concealing a radical Marxist agenda.\"",
      "The shareholder continued to say that DEI \"comes at the expense of merit by not hiring and promoting completely, irrespective of race and sex.\"",
      "Prior to the shareholder meeting, Costco's board of directors had voted unanimously to ask investors to reject the motion. The board had said it believes \"our commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary. The report requested by this proposal would not provide meaningful additional information.\"",
      "Costco's defense of its DEI practices comes as other large U.S. corporations are shifting away from programs that encourage equality in the workplace for women, minorities and other groups. In recent weeks, companies including\u00a0Meta,\u00a0Ford,\u00a0McDonald's\u00a0and\u00a0Walmart\u00a0have ended their DEI programs, decisions that follow the 2023 Supreme Court decision\u00a0banning affirmative action\u00a0in college admissions, as well as pressure from conservative political activists.",
      "\"Our commitment to inclusion ... does not and has never included quotas or systematic preferences, nor does it mean compromising merit,\" said Tony E. James, Costco's board chair, said at Thursday's meeting. \"The demands of our business and our steadfast commitment to serve our members mean that we cannot afford to do anything but hire and promote the most qualified individuals,\"",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank based in Washington, had earlier submitted a\u00a0proposal\u00a0asking Costco to examine the risks of its DEI program, arguing that such initiatives hold \"litigation, reputational and financial risks to the company, and therefore financial risks to shareholders.\"",
      "The think tank, which has made a similar proposal to Apple, cited the U.S. Supreme Court decision in July 2023 that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions.",
      "Costco: Diversity fosters \"creativity and innovation\"",
      "The directors' message to shareholders details how having diverse employees and suppliers has, in their view, fostered \"creativity and innovation in the merchandise and services that we offer\" and led to greater customer satisfaction among Costco members.",
      "In advance of the meeting, Neil Saunders, managing director of consulting firm GlobalData's retail division, said Costco could be confident the proposal would be rejected.",
      "\"I think people generally have confidence in Costco's management, and there's an attitude of 'Why rock the boat? It's sailing very nicely,'\" Saunders said.",
      "Costco's public stance in support of diversity, equity and inclusion programs contrasts with the positions taken in recent months by other big consumer brands that have backed away from DEI. Last week, more than 30 Walmart shareholders, including Amalgamated Bank and Oxfam America, asked the CEO of the nation's largest retailer to explain the business impact of curbing the company's DEI policies, a move they called \"disheartening.\"",
      "Emboldened by the Supreme Court's decision on affirmative action at colleges and universities, conservative groups have filed lawsuits making similar arguments about corporations, targeting initiatives such as employee resource groups and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.",
      "On Monday, Trump signed an executive order aimed at terminating DEI programs within federal agencies. Conservatives have long condemned them, arguing they violate the U.S. Constitution by considering factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation.",
      "The Trump administration's plan includes leveraging the Justice Department and other agencies to probe private companies pursuing training and hiring practices that conservative critics consider discriminatory against people who do not belong to minority groups, such as white men.",
      "Costco's financial performance",
      "As for Costco, the National Center for Public Policy Research alleged that at least 200,000 of the company's 300,000 employees worldwide \"are potentially victims of this type of illegal discrimination because they are white, Asian, male or straight.\" If only a fraction of those employees were to sue Costco, the legal costs could be significant, the center said.",
      "Costco has a chief diversity officer, but the company's executive ranks do not reflect the diversity of its customers. Nearly 81% of the executives Costco had in place last year were white, and 72% of them were men, according to data published on its website. Saunders said members of Costco's management team typically stay a long time given the company's solid and stable financial performance.",
      "The warehouse giant's sales rose 7.5% in its most recent quarter versus the year-earlier period, while net income jumped 13% from a year earlier. Meanwhile, Costco's stock has soared about 36% during the past 12 months, outpacing the S&P 500's 26% gain over the same period.",
      "In other ways, Costco has been a bit of a maverick in the corporate world. It doesn't have an official corporate public relations team, and it hasn't focused on building up online business as much as rivals Walmart and Target.",
      "Apple's support of DEI",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research intends to present a proposal at Apple's Feb. 25 shareholder meeting that goes beyond what the think tank wants from Costco. The center's resolution asks the tech company to abolish its inclusion and equity department, policies and goals, describing them as \"consistent with, if not more radical than, most corporate DEI programs.",
      "Apple's board wants shareholders to vote down the proposal, saying the company strives \"to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work.\"",
      "JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon this week joined the corporate leaders taking a stand in support of the expanded diversity goals some companies added after the 2020 police killing of George Floyd. Dimon defended his bank's DEI policies during an interview with CNBC.",
      "\"We are going to continue to reach out to the Black community, Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community,\" he said, speaking Wednesday from the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland. \"And wherever I go, red states, blue states, green states, mayors, governors and they said they like what we do.\"",

      "Menendez, 71, was\u00a0convicted last July\u00a0on\u00a016 counts of bribery, extortion, conspiracy and obstruction of justice.",
      "Prosecutors\u00a0had been calling for Menendez to serve 15 years, citing \"the seriousness of the defendants' crimes, the immeasurable harm they have caused to the public trust, and the need to deter others from engaging in such egregious abuses of power.\"",
      "The defense had said Menendez should've received less than two years in prison, saying their client suffered financial and professional ruin and deserved mercy because of his age.",
      "U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein sided more with the government.",
      "\"Somewhere along the way, you became, I'm sorry to say, a corrupt politician,\" Stein said.",
      "Prior to learning his fate, sources close to the former three-term Democratic senator told CBS News New York he had been praying a lot and spending time with his son, daughter and grandchildren.  When he addressed the judge during sentencing, Menendez got emotional, saying the trial ripped apart his work and what he stands for, and harmed his family and the community he represented.",
      "\"Your honor, you have before you a chastened man. You really don't know the man you are about to sentence. I have lost everything I have ever cared for,\" Menendez said, adding every day that he's awake is \"a punch.\"",
      "Menendez spoke of his upbringing, how he was the first in his family to go to college and law school, and listed several things he did for members of the community. He said of the things disclosed about him at trial, \"None of it gets close to who I am.\"",
      "\"I have dedicated my entire life to the service of others,\" he added. \"I am far from a perfect man, but I believe in my half-century of public service, I have done more good than bad.\"",
      "Menendez, who has vowed to appeal, must surrender to authorities on June 6.",
      "Fordham University law professor Cheryl Bader called it a \"significant sentence for a very significant crime,\" adding, \"I think the judge was very disturbed by how Sen. Menendez wielded this great power, particularly on the Foreign Relations Committee. The judge was disturbed that [Menendez] would compromise his interests and literally line his pockets and his boots with cash and gold bars, and I think the judge found it particularly egregious that he used the power to further the aims of a foreign country above U.S. foreign policy.\"",
      "Menendez leaves court, blasts federal prosecutors",
      "After leaving the courthouse, Menendez, who has consistently proclaimed his innocence, made a statement to reporters in which he charged the prosecution with ignoring numerous crimes committed by its star witness. He also echoed many of President Donald Trump's words about the Southern District of New York.",
      "\"This whole process has been nothing but a political witch hunt by the Justice Department's prosecutors ... [who] are more interested in political scalps and preparing to run for public office, like Damian Williams,\" Menendez said. \"Welcome to the Southern District of New York, the Wild West of political prosecutions. President Trump is right. This process is political and it's corrupted to the core. I hope President Trump cleans up the cesspool and restores the integrity to the system.\"",
      "Some have questioned whether Menendez would seek a pardon from Mr. Trump, and if the president, who has called the former senator \"Gold Bar Bob,\" would even offer one.",
      "However, based on his statement to reporters on Wednesday, Menendez could be angling for a pardon as a last resort.",

      "Both President Trump and his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, have claimed that the administration has stopped a plan to spend $50 million on condoms for Gaza as part of the new administration's reevaluation of federal funding.",
      "\"We identified and stopped $50 million being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas,\" he said Wednesday. \"They've used them as a method of making bombs.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of State said in 2021 that Hamas and other militant groups have a history of launching incendiary balloons toward Israel. Previous photos taken by The Associated Press in 2020 show masked men attaching incendiary devices to gas-filled condoms and balloons.",
      "However, neither Trump nor officials in his administration have provided evidence of the program they are referring to or whether Hamas has used condoms as a weapon in its war with Israel. The Office of Management and Budget and the U.S. Agency of International Development (USAID) have not responded to questions from CBS News. Available figures from the State Department show that previous shipments for contraception, including condoms, to the Middle East cost far less than $50 million.",
      "Without specifying whether she was referring to a program that included the $50 million figure, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that a federal pause in foreign assistance included preventing $102 million in \"unjustified funding\" to a contractor in Gaza, \"including money for contraception.\"",
      "In an email to reporters, Bruce added that the administration stopped $102 million in funding to the International Medical Corps for Gaza.",
      "In a news release, the International Medical Corps, a global aid organization based in Los Angeles, responded that it has received about $68 million from USAID since Oct. 7, 2023, and has used the funding to operate two field hospitals in Gaza.",
      "\"No US government funding was used to procure or distribute condoms,\" the organization's statement said.",
      "The latest available report online on contraceptives and condom shipments from USAID, from fiscal year 2023, states that the agency's only shipment of contraceptives to the Middle East since fiscal year 2019 was made to Jordan and cost $45,680. The shipment contained injectable and oral contraceptives, not condoms.",
      "According to USAID reports, shipments of contraceptives to the Middle East do not happen annually. In the decade before fiscal year 2023, there were only two shipments, including one in fiscal year 2019 and one in fiscal year 2013. In fiscal year 2019, USAID spent a total of $1.1 million on contraceptives for Yemen, with condoms comprising 4% of the total value.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard's nomination to be President Trump's director of national intelligence is in peril as she faces skepticism from senators ahead of her confirmation hearing Thursday.",
      "Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii and combat veteran, faces a narrow path to confirmation amid concerns over her decision to meet with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in 2017, her past push to pardon National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden, her views on Ukraine and her previous opposition to renewing a key government surveillance authority, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.",
      "If confirmed, the 43-year-old who has no background in intelligence, would be tasked with overseeing the nation's 18 spy agencies.",
      "Last week, two sources told CBS News that Gabbard's nomination is at risk of being blocked and called the situation \"fluid.\" Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine are among the Republicans concerned about her nomination, they said.",
      "Collins sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee and could tip the scale against her. Gabbard cannot afford to lose a single Republican vote on the panel, which has nine GOP members and eight Democrats. Collins said Wednesday she is still undecided.",
      "\"I do not make a decision on nominees until after the hearing is concluded,\" she said.",
      "Collins said Monday she's seeking clarity from Gabbard about her position on Section 702. Gabbard, who sought to repeal the controversial law that authorizes the U.S. government to collect the communications of foreigners abroad without a warrant, has since reversed her stance. In a\u00a0statement to Punchbowl earlier this month, Gabbard said she now supports the surveillance authority, calling it \"crucial\" to protecting national security.",
      "\"My prior concerns about FISA were based on insufficient protections for civil liberties, particularly regarding the FBI's misuse of warrantless search powers on American citizens. Significant FISA reforms have been enacted since my time in Congress to address these issues,\" she said. \"If confirmed as DNI, I will uphold Americans' Fourth Amendment rights while maintaining vital national security tools like Section 702 to ensure the safety and freedom of the American people.\"",
      "Collins said Gabbard's response to her questions have been \"hedged and unclear.\"",
      "Gabbard's secret trip to Syria in 2017 in which she met with Assad is expected to be another focus of Thursday's hearing. Gabbard's trip faced an outcry from her fellow lawmakers, who argued it legitimized the brutal dictator. Assad fled the country in December 2024 after his regime was toppled.",
      "\"When the opportunity arose to meet with him, I did so because I felt that it's important that if we profess to truly care about the Syrian people, about their suffering, then we've got to be able to meet with anyone that we need to if there is a possibility that we can achieve peace,\" she said in 2017.",
      "She also doubted whether the Assad regime was behind a chemical weapons attack on its own civilians, which international weapons experts said originated from Syrian government sites.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who is not a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday said he would be paying attention to Gabbard's hearing.",
      "\"I tend to vote for almost everybody at both parties, but I want to see how the hearing goes,\" Graham said. \"Why did you go to Syria? What did you do regarding the Assad [regime]? Why do you think Edward Snowden should be held as a hero? I certainly don't.\"",
      "In 2020, Gabbard called for the dismissal of charges against Snowden, who leaked a trove of information on the U.S. government's top-secret mass surveillance programs. Snowden, who was charged with espionage in 2013, has been living in exile in Russia.",
      "Gabbard drew further ire after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, when she made statements that were viewed by some as parroting Russian propaganda.",
      "\"This war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden Admin/NATO had simply acknowledged Russia's legitimate security concerns regarding Ukraine's becoming a member of NATO, which would mean US/NATO forces right on Russia's border,\" she\u00a0wrote at the time.",
      "Republican Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas said Wednesday he expects Gabbard's potential confirmation vote to be \"really close.\"",

      "The vote was 56-42 in Zeldin's favor.",
      "Zeldin, a former Republican congressman from New York, is a longtime Trump ally and served on Mr. Trump's defense team during his first impeachment. He voted against certifying Mr. Trump's 2020 election loss to former President Joe Biden.",
      "Zeldin, 44, said during his confirmation hearing that he has a moral responsibility to be a good steward of the environment and pledged to support career staff who have dedicated themselves to the agency's mission to protect human health and the environment.",
      "Zeldin repeatedly declined to commit to specific policies, however, promising instead not to prejudge outcomes before arriving at EPA. When asked by Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska whether he would roll back programs that promote electric cars \u2014 a program Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized \u2014 Zeldin stayed vague but acknowledged he has heard Republican complaints.",
      "Mr. Trump led efforts to dismantle more than 100 environmental protections during his first term and has promised to do so again, targeting what he falsely labels an electric vehicle \"mandate\" and \"green new scam\" approved by Democrats.",
      "Mr. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, has vowed to overturn Biden's biggest climate accomplishments, including tailpipe regulations for vehicles and slashed pollution from power plants fired by coal and natural gas. Mr. Trump has already moved to oust career staff at EPA and other agencies, remove scientific advisers and close an office that helps minority communities that disproportionately struggle with polluted air and water.",
      "Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island called Zeldin the wrong man for the job.",
      "\"We need an EPA administrator who will take climate change seriously, treat the science honestly and stand up where necessary to the political pressure that will be coming from the White House, where we have a president who actually thinks (climate change) is a hoax, and from the huge fossil fuel forces that propelled him into office with enormous amounts of political money and who now think they own the place,\" Whitehouse said in a Senate speech.",
      "Mr. Trump is \"under the thumb of the fossil fuel industry,\" Whitehouse said, adding that the EPA administrator \"has to be truthful and factual and support and defend our environment and our safety from climate change.''",
      "He has nothing against Zeldin personally, Whitehouse added, \"but the likelihood of him standing against that fossil fuel bulldozer that is coming at him is essentially zero. And in that context, this is very much the wrong guy.\"",
      "Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said Zeldin will return the EPA to its original mission of protecting America's air, water and land \u2014 without \"suffocating the economy.\"",
      "Barrasso called Zeldin \"a lifelong public servant\" and a seasoned lawyer with a sharp legal mind and over 20 years of military service.",
      "Zeldin will continue Mr. Trump's \"mission to roll back punishing, political regulations\" at the EPA, \"cut red tape\" and oversee \"a new wave of creativity and innovation,'' Barrasso said.",
      "\"For the last four years, the so-called experts at the Environmental Protection Agency went on a reckless regulatory rampage,'' Barrasso said, referring to the Biden administration. \"They saddled American families and businesses with higher costs and heavy-handed restrictions. They bowed to climate extremism and ignored common sense.\"",
      "Zeldin \"will right the ship and restore balance at the EPA,'' Barrasso said, citing likely actions to repeal Biden-era rules on tailpipe emissions and power plants, along with eliminating federal subsidies for electric vehicles.",
      "The League of Conservation Voters, a national environmental advocacy group, has panned Zeldin's lifetime environmental record, giving him a 14% score. Like all Republicans at the time, he voted against the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act aimed at boosting renewable energy and manufacturing and fighting climate change.",
      "Zeldin supported a bill to reduce harmful forever chemicals, called PFAS, that would have required the EPA to set limits on substances in drinking water. He also was a leading proponent of the 2020 Great American Outdoors Act, which used oil and gas royalties to help the National Park Service tackle its massive maintenance backlog. He's also supported local conservation efforts on Long Island.",

      "It's not yet clear how much the administration can do without Congress to prioritize money for school choice programs, or to allow military children to go to the school of their parents' choosing.",
      "It's also not yet immediately clear if the Office of Management and Budget's directive to temporarily pause federal assistance would affect educational grant programs. A federal judge has also issued a stay on the order.",

      "The data, released Wednesday at midnight, also shows 4th and 8th grade average reading scores have continued a downward trend, each down two points from 2022. According to the NAEP, 70% of 8th graders weren't proficient in reading and 72% weren't proficient in math.",
      "\"Every child deserves the best education available, regardless of their zip code,\" the White House document reads. \"However, for generations, our government-assigned education system has failed millions of parents, students and teachers. This executive order begins to rectify that wrong by opening up opportunities for students to attend the school that best fits their needs.\"",
      "Federal funding represents a relatively small portion of funding for most public schools, about 14% of funding for public K-12 schools in the U.S., according to the U.S. Census Bureau. States account for about 44% of funding, and localities about 43%.",
      "Mr. Trump championed school choice on the campaign trail, as well as during his first term in office.",
      "But measures that would have shifted money away from public education to strengthen school choice and voucher programs failed in three states in 2024, including in two states Mr. Trump easily won \u2014 Kentucky and Nebraska.",

      "The pause, the Fed's first rate decision since President Trump returned to office on Jan. 20, comes as economists predict the central bank is likely to take a wait-and-see approach to the president's economic policies, given that some, such as higher tariffs, could prove inflationary.",
      "The Fed's decision to keep rates steady reflects stubborn U.S. inflation, which remains close to 3% on an annual basis. That has fueled concerns that additional rate cuts could reignite price increases, making it more difficult to get to the Fed's 2% target. Notably, the Fed removed a line from its December statement expressing its belief that inflation \"has made progress\" toward its goal. Yet Powell struck a more dovish tone in a press conference to discuss the Fed's decision.",
      "\"Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well-anchored, as reflected in a broad, broad range of surveys of households, businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets,\" he said.",
      "Powell also described the economy as \"in quite a good place,\" citing growing GDP, solid job gains and a low unemployment rate, as well as signs of inflationary pressures easing. \"We don't need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,\" he added.",
      "\"Pressing the pause button,\" noted Lindsay Rosner, head of multisector fixed-income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"[T]he FOMC will want to see further progress in the inflation data to deliver the next rate cut highlighted by the fact they removed the reference on inflation making progress.\"",

      "In the meantime, inflation-weary consumers won't get much relief from still-high borrowing costs, especially if the Fed holds off on additional rate cuts later in 2025, as many economists and Wall Street analysts forecast. With the Fed hitting the pause button, it's unlikely that consumers will see lower borrowing costs on credit cards or other forms of debt, even as more households struggle to pay their bills.",
      "\"[L]ower- and middle-income households are facing mounting pressure, as evidenced by an increase in credit card and auto loan delinquencies,\" Joe Gaffoglio, CEO of Mutual of America Capital Management, said in an email.",
      "When will the Fed cut rates?",
      "The Fed may hold off on cutting rates until its May 7 meeting, according to economists polled by financial-data firm FactSet. That means the central bank is expected to hold rates steady at its next meeting on March 19.",
      "\"If the Fed doesn't resume cutting in the next few months, however, we suspect the window will have closed,\" Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics said in a report. \"While markets are still pricing in second half rate cuts, our view is that a flurry of tariffs will put a stop to that, as inflation rebounds to 3%.\"",
      "Asked about the possible impact of Mr. Trump's economic plans, Powell demurred, noting that while the Fed is monitoring the new administration's policies, it's too early for the central bank to make an assessment of their possible impact. Mr. Trump has vowed to enact a broad tariff of 10% on all imports, as well as to imposed\u00a025% tariffs on Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1.",
      "\"We need to let those policies be articulated before we can even begin to make that a plausible assessment of what their implications for the economy will be,\" he said. \"We don't know what's going to be tariffed, we don't know for how long or how much, what countries, we don't know about retaliation.\"",
      "Asked by CBS News' Richard Escobedo about economic uncertainty created by Mr. Trump's plan to deport undocumented immigrants, Powell responded that the administration's efforts are not yet showing up in economic data.",
      "\"Businesses that are dependent on immigrant labor are saying that it's suddenly gotten harder to get people,\" the Fed chair said. \"But again, you don't see that in the aggregate data, but yes, you hear it anecdotally.\"",
      "While inflation has subsided from a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022, it\u00a0rose 2.9% in December on a year-over-year basis due to higher prices on gasoline, which rose 4.4% from the prior month, as well as food and housing.",
      "In its statement, the Fed described the labor market as \"solid,\" with an unemployment rate that has \"stabilized at a low level in recent months.\" Even so, the Fed is closely monitoring the labor market for signs of weakness, with the central bank pointing to a rise in the jobless rate last fall as one reason why it opted to cut rates at the time.",
      "\"The Fed will keep their options open in case a sudden weakening materializes in the months to come\" in the labor market, noted Bankrate chief financial analyst Greg McBride in an email.",
      "As for when the next rate cut might come, it's unclear from the Fed's statement, he added.",
      "\"They gave no indication in their post-meeting statement that a resumption of rate cuts is likely at the next meeting in March,\" McBride said. \"It will take a run of good inflation data to get us there, whenever that may be.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The White House Office of Management and Budget on Wednesday walked back a memo that ordered a freeze on federal assistance, less than two days after the directive led to chaos and confusion around the country as to what programs would be impacted.",
      "The latest two-line memo from acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget Matthew Vaeth states that the earlier directive is rescinded. It directs those with questions about implementing President Trump's executive orders to contact the general counsels at their agencies.",
      "\"In light of the injunction, OMB has rescinded the memo to end any confusion on federal policy created by the court ruling and the dishonest media coverage,\" said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday. \"The executive orders issued by the president on funding reviews remain in full force and effect and will be rigorously implemented by all agencies and departments. This action should effectively end the court case and allow the government to focus on enforcing the president's orders on controlling federal spending.\"",
      "She said Mr. Trump will take more action in the coming weeks and months to address federal funding.",
      "The White House sent shockwaves when it issued the guidance late Monday that requested agencies temporarily pause \"to the extent permitted by law\" grant, loan or federal financial assistance programs that were implicated by Mr. Trump's executive orders. The executive orders listed include those involving immigration, energy, diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs, and gender ideology.",
      "The memo, from Vaeth, noted that $3 trillion was spent on federal assistance programs in 2024. It directed agencies to submit to the White House budget office by Feb. 10 detailed information on the programs, projects or activities subject to the funding freeze. The pause was set to take effect by 5 p.m. Tuesday.",
      "The full scope of the directive was not clear, and it left nonprofits, small businesses, universities and other entities scrambling to determine whether they would be impacted, and congressional offices faced an onslaught of questions from constituents and organizations fearing they would lose federal dollars.",
      "While the White House's memo stated Medicare or Social Security benefits would not be impacted, state Medicaid agencies, federally-funded Head Start early education programs and community health centers said they were cut off from accessing a web portal run by the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later clarified there was an \"outage\" that affected the portal, and said no payments were affected.",
      "In addition to sowing confusion, the memo sparked numerous lawsuits, including from a coalition of nonprofits and Democratic state attorneys general. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., swiftly convened a hearing on a request from the nonprofit groups to temporarily block enforcement of the freeze, and agreed Tuesday to issue a brief pause to fully consider the matter.",
      "At a hearing Wednesday in the case brought by the Democratic attorneys general, a federal judge in Rhode Island indicated he is likely to grant their request to temporarily block the funding freeze, but was unclear as to the scope of such an order given the White House's rescission of the memo.",
      "U.S. District Judge John McConnell said the states have \"clearly\" shown they would be irreparably harmed by the halting of federal assistance. He cited an affidavit from the director of the Rhode Island Department of Administration, which said the state has been awarded more than $5 billion in federal financial assistance \u2014 more than one-third of its fiscal year 2025 budget.",
      "McConnell said the initial memo ordering the freeze was \"hugely ambiguous and broad and potentially chaotic.\" He directed the states to submit a proposed temporary restraining order, which the Justice Department will have 24 hours to respond to.",
      "\"While the piece of paper may not exist, there is sufficient evidence that the defendants collectively are acting consistent with that directive,\" he said.",
      "Democrats, meanwhile, lambasted the move by Mr. Trump's administration and accused him of depriving states, cities, towns, schools and hospitals of billions of dollars in federal support.",
      "\"This decision is lawless, dangerous, destructive, cruel. It's illegal, it's unconstitutional,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said during a news conference Tuesday.",

    "summary": "Kash Patel is a staunch Trump ally and a former federal prosecutor and national security official.",
    "story": [
      "Kash Patel, President Trump's nominee to serve as FBI director, is set to appear Thursday on Capitol Hill\u00a0 for a high-stakes confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee amid calls from Republicans for massive reforms in FBI leadership and concerns from Democrats about his fitness to lead the nation's top law enforcement agency.",
      "Patel \u2014 a staunch Trump ally and former federal prosecutor and national security official \u2014 was announced\u00a0 by\u00a0Mr. Trump in December\u00a0to take the helm at the agency that has long been a target of the president's ire.\u00a0 The FBI director at the time, Christopher Wray, appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term, then announced his departure from the top job despite having not yet served the full ten-year term. He told 60 Minutes his decision was prompted in part by a desire to transition \"in an orderly way\" and \"not thrust the FBI deeper into the fray.\"",
      "Presidents have the power to replace FBI directors as they see fit and many past directors have not served full 10-year terms.",
      "Patel previously served in intelligence and defense roles in Mr. Trump's first term and held a position on the National Security Council and as chief of staff to the secretary of defense.",
      "An FBI whistleblower alleged that while serving in government, Patel violated firmly entrenched protocols to keep hostage rescue operations under wraps until the captives are safely in U.S. hands and their families have been notified, CBS News previously reported. In a letter obtained by CBS News, Sen. Dick Durbin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote that Patel, while serving on the National Security Council during the first Trump term, \"broke protocol regarding hostage rescues by publicly commenting without authorization on the then-in-progress retrieval of two Americans held captive by Iranian-backed militants in Yemen in October 2020.\"",
      "A source close to Patel pushed back on the allegations and Democrats' criticism, telling CBS News, \"Mr. Patel was a public defender, decorated prosecutor and accomplished national security official that kept Americans safe. He has a track record of success in every branch of government, from the courtroom to congressional hearing room to the situation room. There is no veracity to this anonymous source's complaints about protocol.\"",
      "A former Justice Department prosecutor, Patel has been highly critical of leadership within the organization and he has alleged recent cases against Mr. Trump were politically weaponized against the president and Republicans, allegations officials within the agency have previously denied.",
      "In 2023, Patel published a book titled \"Government Gangsters\" in which he alleged the \"FBI has become so thoroughly compromised that it will remain a threat to the people unless drastic measures are taken.\" And he has pledged to take on government officials and members of the media who he said \"lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections.\"",
      "The FBI came under increased scrutiny from Mr. Trump and his allies in 2022, when FBI agents executed a court-authorized search warrant at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. The search exposed what had been an ongoing federal probe into Trump's handling of classified records after he left office. The president has long denied wrongdoing and alleged the FBI and Justice Department were targeting him because of political considerations.",
      "If confirmed by the Senate, Patel would be the third FBI director to work under a Trump administration and would take over the nation's chief federal law enforcement apparatus amid years of intense criticism from Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill. He would report to the U.S. Attorney General. Trump's pick for that role, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, cleared a critical committee vote on Wednesday and is likely to be confirmed for her post in the coming days.",
      "Many Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee, including chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa, have applauded Patel's nomination as a step toward needed reform.",
      "\"The common sense that we have in the Midwest \u2013 we need more of it in Washington, D.C. and I think the [nominees] are going to bring it in, and Kash is one of them,\" Grassley said on a recent podcast.",
      "Democrats, however, have been outspoken in their opposition to Patel's nomination and pointed to his past as a reason for concern.",
      "To be confirmed, Patel will first have to receive a majority of votes from within the GOP-led Senate Judiciary Committee, after which his nomination would be presented to the full senate for a vote.",

      "The Laken Riley Act, named after a 22-year-old nursing student who was murdered by an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant last year, expands mandatory detention to include noncitizens convicted of or charged with burglary, larceny, theft or shoplifting, as well as those who admit to committing those crimes. It also empowers state attorneys general who claim their states or residents have been harmed by immigration policies to sue the federal government.",
      "The House approved the legislation last week, sending the measure to the president's desk after the Senate expanded its scope to include the assault of a law enforcement officer and crimes that result in the death \"or serious bodily injury of another person\" as grounds for mandatory detention. The legislation passed both the House and Senate with bipartisan support, despite pushback from some Democrats.",
      "Ahead of the signing, Mr. Trump called it a \"very important law\" and said he was \"proudly\" signing it.",
      "\"We will keep Laken's memory alive in our hearts forever,\" Mr. Trump said. \"With today's action, her name will also live forever in the laws of our country.\"",
      "Though the measure stalled last year in the Democratic-controlled Senate, Democrats have appeared more willing to engage on the measure following their losses in the 2024 election, where immigration was a key issue.",
      "Still, the legislation has prompted questions among some Democrats, including whether Immigration and Customs Enforcement could fully enforce this new mandate without more funding.",
      "The bill signing comes as Mr. Trump has signed a slew of executive actions since taking office targeting border security as part of a dramatic crackdown on illegal immigration \u2014 from attempting to terminate birthright citizenship to tasking the military with border enforcement and moving to designate cartels and gangs as terrorist groups to shutting down asylum and refugee admissions.",

      "What programs aren't affected by the funding freeze?",
      "The memo, from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), indicated that Social Security and Medicare programs would be exempt from the suspension in federal funding. Additional guidance released Tuesday further specified that \"any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause.\"",
      "\"In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause,\" the updated guidance said.",

      "Under the move, some Venezuelan migrants with TPS could lose their ability to live and work in the U.S. lawfully as early as this spring. Migrants whose TPS lapses could face deportation by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, which the Trump administration has charged with carrying out the largest deportation effort in American history.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revoked an order issued earlier this month by her predecessor, Alejandro Mayorkas, that would have extended the Venezuela TPS program for 18 months, through October 2026. TPS allows migrants from countries beset by war, environmental disasters and other crises to work and live in the U.S. legally on a temporary basis.",
      "The Biden administration made two TPS designations for Venezuelans, one in 2021 and the other in 2023, citing the country's economic collapse under the repressive rule of President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "The decision by the Trump administration means that Venezuelans who applied for TPS under the 2021 designation will be able to keep their work permits and deportation protections through September. Those who applied under the 2023 designation will continue to have TPS through at least early April.",
      "Noem has until Saturday, Feb. 1, to decide whether to terminate or extend the 2023 designation, meaning that another announcement could happen soon. If no formal decision is made by then, the designation will be automatically extended by six months.",
      "Roughly 600,000 Venezuelans have protected status, making the Venezuela TPS program the largest of its kind, according to DHS figures.

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 12:17:52 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has said he will \"demand\" lower interest rates, raising questions about his ability to influence the Federal Reserve.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump had a message last week for the Federal Reserve while at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland: He plans to \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\"",
      "Mr. Trump may be in for disappointment. The Federal Reserve widely expected to keep its benchmark rate steady when it announces its latest interest rate decision today at 2 p.m. Eastern Time. Economists aren't penciling in a 2025 reduction until at least May, according to economists polled by financial data service FactSet.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has over the years steadfastly defended the central bank's independence. Most recently, he underlined at a New York Times event in December that insulating the Fed from political influence is \"for the benefit of all Americans,\" allowing it to make decisions based on economic data rather than at the behest of elected officials. The Fed's independence allows it to pursue its dual mandate \u2014 to keep inflation low and the labor market at full employment \u2014 without political pressure, economists concur.",
      "\"We know monetary policy needs to be enacted with a democratic mandate underpinning it, with a day-to-day remove from politics,\" Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Interest rates may need to be raised but it may be inconvenient for political interests, and [the central bank] may need to move quickly to lower rates\" in case of an economic downturn.",
      "While the Fed is an independent agency, it is accountable to Congress and the public, with its chair and other officials testifying before Congress regularly. Its dual mandate was also established by Congress, as well as its structure of staggered appointments for Fed officials, designed to make the agency less vulnerable to pressures \"that could lead to undesirable outcomes,\" according to the Fed.",
      "What happens when a central bank isn't independent?",
      "Those \"undesirable outcomes\" can be seen in nations where central bankers are more vulnerable to political influence, economists say.",
      "That's because interest rates remain the most potent weapon that a central bank can wield against surging inflation \u2014 a tool that the Federal Reserve turned to in 2022 to tame the hottest U.S. inflation in 40 years. But elected officials sometimes decide that higher borrowing costs are politically inconvenient, because they make it more expensive for businesses to expand or for consumers to make purchases.",
      "In cases where a central bank isn't independent, officials may succeed in pressuring a central bank to keep a lid on rates.",
      "Experts point to Turkey as an example of what can occur when political interests dictate a central bank's monetary policies. Since 2010, its central bank has increasingly come under pressure from President Erdo\u011fan to keep its interest rates low, even as inflation surged during the pandemic, according to the non-partisan Centre for Economic Policy Research.",
      "Instead of hiking rates as Turkey's inflation rate topped 80% in October 2022 on an annual basis, the nation's central bank cut its benchmark rate several times in 2022 and 2023. While the bank reversed course and hiked rates starting in mid-2023, inflation there has proved tough to tame, with prices rising by 44% in December 2024.",
      "By comparison, the highest U.S. inflation rate during the post-pandemic period was in June 2022, when inflation hit 9.1% on an annual basis in June 2022. In the face of the Fed's rate hikes, inflation has cooled since then, deflating to 2.9% on an annual basis last month.",
      "\"The Fed has done really well \u2014 they have raised the rates enough to try to slowly squeeze inflation out of the market,\" noted Erasmus Kersting, a professor of economics at Villanova University. The Fed has \"done all that while avoiding a recession \u2014 that is a delicate needle to thread.\"",
      "Could Mr. Trump influence the Fed?",
      "Questions about Mr. Trump's ability to influence the Federal Reserve or shake up its leadership are intensifying amid the president's statements about his desire for lower interest rates. During his 2024 election campaign, Mr. Trump had insisted that as president he should have a \"say\" in the Fed's interest rate policies.",
      "\"I think that, in my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman,\" Mr. Trump said in August.",
      "For his part, Powell said last year that he would not resign\u00a0even if asked to do so by Mr. Trump, adding that under the law presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "However, Mr. Trump has recently fired several government officials in ways that critics say violate the law, such as his administration's firing of more than a dozen federal inspectors general on Friday. Federal law requires the White House to give Congress a full month of warning and case-specific details before firing a federal inspector general.",
      "Removing Powell wouldn't necessarily change the Fed's monetary policy decisions, given that rates are set by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Seven members are from the Fed's Board of Governors; four are assigned from the 11 Reserve Bank presidents, who each serve one-year terms on a rotating basis; and one FOMC member is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Interfering with the Fed could have consequences, both legally and for the stock market, experts said.",
      "\"Should any president attempt to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve without cause other than doing the job they were appointed and confirmed to do, I expect there to be swift legal challenges,\" noted Tim Stretton at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government watchdog. \"I suspect the market would also react negatively. Markets like stability, and this level of unprecedented interference in the Federal Reserve would be anything but stable.\"",
      "Asked what advice he would give Mr. Trump about dealing with the Fed, Columbia Business School's House said, \"Stop talking.\"",
      "He added, \"Let the Fed conduct its business consistent with its mandate, and it'll be more likely to get interest rates down.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 12:16:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Local officials in Samoa don't blame Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's HHS pick, for measles deaths, but critics call his actions \"harmful.\"",
    "story": [
      "As U.S. senators grill Robert F. Kennedy Jr. this week, President Trump's pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services is facing sharp questions about his actions in an island nation half a world away.",
      "Kennedy's 2019 visit to Samoa has recently brought fresh attention to his history of activism focused on raising questions about the safety and effectiveness of the measles vaccine \u2014 because his trip came just months before a devastating measles outbreak that claimed 83 lives, many of them young children.",
      "\"It was very sad,\" Dr. Take Naseri, Samoa's health chief at the time, told CBS News. \"It's one of those things you don't want to revisit.\"",
      "Kennedy has maintained that he had \"nothing to do\" with the people of Samoa resisting vaccines.",
      "\"I had nothing to do with people not vaccinating in Samoa,\" he said in an interview\u00a0with documentary producer Scott Hamilton Kennedy. \"I never told anyone not to vaccinate.\"",
      "But some of Kennedy's critics assert he bears a measure of responsibility for the outbreak and that he leveraged the tragedy to promote false claims about the vaccine. Democrats have seized on the episode, even sponsoring advertising that calls out his visit.",
      "What happened in Samoa?",
      "Years before Kennedy trained his focus on vaccine issues in Samoa, the small Pacific island nation had been experiencing low vaccination rates. Medical professionals attributed this to a shortage of doctors and nurses as well as demographic shifts, with more people moving to cities and away from social structures that helped promote childhood vaccinations. By 2017, only about half of 1-year-old Samoan children were fully vaccinated \u2014 far below the 95% coverage needed to prevent community spread and a steep drop from earlier rates that had reportedly reached 90%.",
      "The situation took a tragic turn in July 2018 when two nurses mistakenly combined an expired muscle relaxant with MMR vaccine doses instead of sterile water, leading to the deaths of two children. The nurses were charged with manslaughter, and the government responded by suspending the national vaccination program for 10 months. Vaccination rates for children dropped to 31%.",
      "Naseri, the former Samoan health chief, told CBS News that the government had struggled to implement an effective vaccine program. He said the mishandling of the vaccine and its tragic consequences \"was the last straw.\"",
      "\"It created more hesitancy,\" Naseri said.",
      "Mistrust in vaccines spread across the island like a virus. At the time, even the prime minister issued a statement on Facebook alleging that his grandson had been injured by a vaccine. The temporary suspension of vaccinations corresponded with a growing distrust in modern medicine.",
      "\"I would rather treat them at home with old-fashioned herbal medicines than taking them to see a doctor,\" one mother told local reporters at the time. \"Since children died from these vaccines, I don't trust any medication from the hospital.\"",
      "Patricia Stinchfield, a nurse practitioner and past president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, said she had been monitoring the Samoan vaccine crisis even before the measles outbreak struck. She says the immunization rates had dropped so low the situation was \"a ticking time bomb.\"",
      "It was in the midst of that \"perfect storm,\" Stinchfield said, that Kennedy arrived in Samoa in the summer of 2019. Kennedy has said the purpose of his visit was to pitch a health surveillance system, and that the vaccination pause in 2018 was an opportunity to naturally study an unvaccinated population. His trip was coordinated by a local anti-vaccine advocate known for spreading medical misinformation online.",
      "Dr. Naseri told CBS News he met briefly with Kennedy but their conversation focused on environmental and vaccine safety issues.",
      "In August 2019, two months after Kenendy's visit, an infected traveler from New Zealand arrived in Samoa and the deadly measles virus began its spread. The government officially declared an outbreak on Oct. 16 and a month later declared a state of emergency.",
      "It wasn't until early December that the Samoan government conceded it had mishandled immunizations and launched an aggressive vaccination campaign, making the shots mandatory. Dr. Naseri said that delayed response may have contributed to the high infection and death rates. But finally, the country shut down for two days to allow health workers to vaccinate people at home, quickly achieving 90% coverage.",
      "Hundreds of medical professionals from around the world responded and traveled to Samoa to help with the vaccination efforts, including Hawaii's lieutenant governor, now Gov. Josh Green.",
      "\"The government needed the political will, and the international community backed us up,\" Naseri said.",
      "CBS News visited Samoa during that response and met one parent named Paulo Puelua, who said the measles outbreak took hold of his family in an instant, killing three of his five children. Their mother Fa'oso was so distraught that she had been sleeping on her children's grave, set up in the family's front yard according to Samoan tradition. She told CBS News she felt it was her only way to be close to them now.",
      "Looking back, officials told CBS News they believe the outbreak's high death toll resulted from multiple factors, including widespread malnutrition, reliance on traditional medicine, and an overwhelmed health care system. In rural Samoa, many families share a single sleeping space, making transmission easier, and nearly a quarter of the population lives in poverty, further complicating treatment.",
      "Controversy about RFK Jr.'s role",
      "Dr. Paul Offit is a vaccine specialist and co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine. He's also director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He's been a frequent critic of Kennedy's and believes the nominee for health secretary deserves harsh judgment for how the outbreak unfolded.",
      "Offit says Kennedy had been posting about the two deaths before it was understood what had happened, and blamed the MMR vaccine. When that turned out not to be the case, Kennedy did not correct that false assertion.",
      "\"If he was any kind of man, which he isn't, he should go back to Samoa and apologize to every one of the families where a child died,\" Offit said. \"He's a famous man who goes there and meets with anti-vaccine activists. He gives them credence by going there.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to Kennedy for comment through the organization he led until last month, Children's Health Defense, and did not receive a reply. The group has previously denied his visit played any role in the outbreak.",
      "In interviews, Samoan health officials told CBS News they believe Kennedy's actions were unlikely to have directly influenced what occurred.",
      "\"It is well documented that RFK Jnr's visit to Samoa in 2019 coincided with increased anti-vaccine sentiment, particularly among certain groups,\" Samoa's Ministry of Health said in a statement. \"However, there is no conclusive evidence that his visit directly contributed to the decline in vaccination rates or the subsequent measles outbreak.\"",
      "But in the midst of the island's state of emergency, Kennedy sent a letter to the Samoan prime minister suggesting a defective vaccine may have been responsible for causing infections \u2014 a theory that has been debunked.",
      "\"It is critical that the Samoan Health Ministry determine, scientifically, if the outbreak was caused by inadequate vaccine coverage or alternatively, by a defective vaccine,\" Kennedy wrote in the Nov. 19, 2019 letter. Kennedy's letter partly leans on an idea that appears to have originated from misinformation widely spread on social media during a 2014-2015 measles outbreak at Disneyland that inaccurately said that measles originating from the vaccine had been identified.",
      "Stinchfield says this is impossible based on the weakened nature of the virus in the vaccine. In very rare cases people may exhibit symptoms similar to those associated with measles but no cases have ever been documented of measles being spread as a result.",
      "After the Samoan infections, critics say Kennedy downplayed the outbreak's severity in blog posts and continued to suggest that the vaccine itself was responsible for the high death rate. He was joined by Del Bigtree, a prominent anti-vaccine activist and Kennedy ally, in pushing conspiracy theories surrounding the outbreak.",
      "Stinchfield says the claims they pushed remained unsupported by evidence. And eventually, the Samoan government stopped listening.",
      "Samoa has since achieved high vaccination rates and the World Health Organization says the country has reported no measles cases since 2020. However, vaccine hesitancy remains a challenge globally, with anti-vaccine activists continuing to spread fear and misinformation.",
      "Samoa's Health Ministry says it remains concerned about \"the global spread of vaccine misinformation and the potential consequences of RFK Jnr.'s influence, particularly if he assumes a leadership role in public health policy. The spread of anti-vaccine narratives has already contributed to outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases in multiple countries, reversing decades of progress in immunization efforts.\"",
      "Stinchfield said she believes misinformation spread by Kennedy and others \u2014 in Samoa, and during the years since \u2014 remains acutely dangerous.",
      "\"Their modus operandi is to take a little kernel of truth and spin it around and confuse people, spin it at a time where the fear is already so high,\" she said. \"That is disinformation, a weapon that will harm people, harm children.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The top federal prosecutor in South Florida is asking a federal appeals court to toss out the classified documents case against President Trump's former co-defendants, aide Walt Nauta and former Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos de Oliveira.",
      "Acting U.S. Attorney Hayden O'Byrne made the request to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit on Wednesday, which lawyers for Nauta and de Oliveira do not oppose. It's likely the Atlanta-based appeals court will grant the request, bringing the case initially brought by former special counsel Jack Smith to a close.",
      "Nauta and de Oliveira were charged alongside Mr. Trump in 2023 with allegedly helping obstruct the Justice Department probe into the president's handling of sensitive government documents after the end of his first term in January 2021.",
      "The prosecution was brought by Smith, who resigned as special counsel before Mr. Trump returned to the White House. The special counsel claimed the president unlawfully held onto sensitive government after returning to his South Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, after leaving the White House four years ago, and accused Nauta and de Oliveira of working with Mr. Trump to conceal information from the Justice Department.",
      "The three co-defendants pleaded not guilty. The charges were then dismissed by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon last July on the grounds that Smith was unlawfully appointed. The special counsel appealed the decision to the 11th Circuit.",
      "Following Mr. Trump's election in November, Smith successfully sought to remove him from the case because of a longstanding Justice Department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president. But the appeal was continuing as to Nauta and de Oliveira.",
      "The former special counsel accused the two allies of Mr. Trump of attempting to interfere with the federal probe. Their attorneys fought the charges and resisted the Justice Department's previous efforts to keep the cases moving forward on appeal after Mr. Trump's election win.",
      "Should the judges agree to close the case, a major impediment to the public release of Smith's report summarizing the classified documents investigation would be eliminated. Former Attorney General Merrick Garland agreed to keep the volume of Smith's report that dealt with the case under seal as the appeal progressed. Now, with the case on the verge of dismissal and Mr. Trump's administration in power, it remains unclear whether the volume of the report will be released to the public.",
      "The first volume of Smith's report, which involved his investigation and prosecution of Mr. Trump stemming from alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of presidential power after the 2020 election, was made public just before the president returned to office.",
      "Mr. Trump has returned to office with a pledge to end the so-called \"weaponization\" of the Justice Department. He has since fired roughly a dozen department employees\u00a0who worked with Smith on the prosecutions of the president.",

      "Mr. Trump and Milley, however, had a public falling out in the final months of Mr. Trump's first term over several incidents, beginning with an apology Milley issued for taking part, while dressed in fatigues, in the photo op in front of St. John's Church in June 2020 after federal officers cleared out social justice protesters from Lafayette Park so Mr. Trump could walk to the church from the White House.",
      "A book published in September 2021 revealed that Milley had also engaged in two phone calls \u2014 one on Oct. 30, 2020, and the second on Jan. 8, 2021, two days after the Capitol insurrection \u2014 with Chinese General Li Zuocheng of the People's Liberation Army in order to assure him that the U.S. would not launch an attack against China and that the U.S. was stable.",

      "Copenhagen \u2014 The vast majority of Greenland residents do not want their island to become part of the United States, as envisaged by President Trump, according to a poll published Wednesday. Mr. Trump, who returned to the White House in late January, has signaled that he wants the Arctic island \u2014 which is believed to hold large untapped mineral and oil reserves \u2014 to become part of the United States and has suggested the possible use of force or tariffs to annex the autonomous Danish territory.",
      "When asked if they wanted to become part of the United States, 85% of Greenlanders said no, according to the poll published in the Danish Berlingske and Greenland's Sermitsiaq dailies.",
      "6% of those polled said they were in favor and 9% were undecided, according to the poll conducted by the Verian agency.",
      "\"It's the first poll that asked a representative section of Greenland's population and I think this is very important,\" Kasper Moller Hansen, a political science professor at the University of Copenhagen, told AFP. \"I think this poll shows very clearly that they do not want to be American.\"",
      "Around 45% of Greenlanders view Mr. Trump's interest in their island as a \"threat,\" while 43% view it as an \"opportunity\" and 13% are undecided, according to the poll.",
      "The poll questioned 497 respondents 18 years and older between January 22 and 26, and it had a margin of error between 1.9 and 4.4 percentage points.",

    "summary": "The order directs that federally-run insurance programs, including TRICARE and Medicaid, exclude coverage for gender-affirming care for those under 19.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order aimed at cutting federal support for certain types of gender-affirming care for people under age 19, his latest move to roll back protections for transgender people across the country.",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures,\" the order says.",
      "The order covers gender-affirming care that includes puberty blockers, hormone replacement therapy and surgical procedures.",
      "The order directs that federally-run insurance programs, including TRICARE for military families and Medicaid, exclude coverage for such care and calls on the Department of Justice to vigorously pursue litigation and legislation to oppose the practice.",
      "Medicaid programs in some states cover gender-affirming care. The new order suggests that the practice could end, and targets hospitals and universities that receive federal money and provide the care.",
      "The language in the executive order \u2014 using words such as \"maiming,\" \"sterilizing\" and \"mutilation\" \u2014 contradicts what is typical for gender-affirming care in the United States. It also labels guidance from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health as \"junk science.\"",
      "On his Truth Social platform, Mr. Trump called gender-affirming care \"barbaric medical procedures.\"",
      "Major medical groups such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics support access to care.",
      "Young people who persistently identify as a gender that differs from their sex assigned at birth are first evaluated by a team of professionals. Some may try a social transition, involving changing a hairstyle or pronouns. Some may later also receive puberty blockers or hormones. Surgery is extremely rare for minors.",
      "\"It is deeply unfair to play politics with people's lives and strip transgender young people, their families and their providers of the freedom to make necessary health care decisions,\" said Human Rights Campaign President Kelley Robinson.",
      "The order encourages Congress to adopt a law allowing those who receive gender-affirming care and come to regret it, or their parents, to sue the providers.",
      "It also directs the Justice Department to prioritize investigating states that protect access to gender-affirming care and \"facilitate stripping custody from parents\" who oppose the treatments for their children. Some Democratic-controlled states have adopted laws that seek to protect doctors who provide gender-affirming care to patients who travel from states where it's banned for minors.",
      "Lambda Legal promised swift legal action.",
      "Michel Lee Garrett, a trans woman whose teenage child only partially identifies as a girl and uses they/them pronouns, said such policies aim to erase trans people from public life but will never succeed. Her child has not elected to pursue a medical transition, but the mother from State College, Pennsylvania, said she won't stop fighting to preserve that option for her child and others.",
      "\"I'll always support my child's needs, regardless of what policies may be in place or what may come ... even if it meant trouble for me,\" Lee Garrett said.",
      "For Howl Hall, an 18-year-old first-year student at Eastern Washington University, taking testosterone not only changed his body but dramatically improved his experience with depression. With that treatment now under threat, Hall said he's concerned that getting off testosterone would hurt his mental health.",
      "\"I would be alive, but I wouldn't be living,\" Hall said. \"I wouldn't be living my life in a productive way at all. I can guarantee that I would be failing all of my classes if I was even showing up to them.\"",
      "The push is the latest by Mr. Trump to reverse Biden administration policies protecting transgender people and their care. On Monday, Mr. Trump directed the Pentagon to conduct a review that is likely to lead to them being barred from military service.",
      "That order's language stated that identifying as a gender that is \"inconsistent\" with one's biological sex \"conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life\" and that soldiers who do so \"cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\"",
      "A group of active-duty military personnel sued over the executive order Tuesday.",
      "SPARTA Pride, a nonprofit organization for trans service members and veterans, released a\u00a0statement\u00a0saying: \"Transgender service members have been serving openly for almost ten years, and currently fill critical roles in every branch and specialty, including infantry, aviation, nuclear engineering, law enforcement, and military intelligence, many requiring years of specialized training and expertise. ... The readiness and physical capabilities of transgender service members is not different from that of other service members.\"",
      "Hours after taking office last week, Mr. Trump signed another order that seeks to define sex as only male or female, not recognizing transgender, nonbinary or intersex people or the idea that gender can be fluid. Already that's resulted in the State Department halting issuing passports with an \"X\" gender marker, forcing transgender people to apply for travel documents with markers that don't match their identities.",
      "Mr. Trump said he would address these issues during his campaign last year, and his actions could prove widely divisive.",
      "In the November election, voters were slightly more likely to oppose than support laws that ban gender-affirming medical treatment, such as puberty blockers and hormone therapy, for minors under the age of 18 who identify as transgender, according to AP VoteCast. About half of voters, 52%, were opposed, but 47% said they were in favor.",
      "Mr. Trump's voters were much more likely to support bans on transgender care: About 6 in 10 Trump voters favored such laws.",
      "\"It's very clear that this order, in combination with the other orders that we've seen over the past week, are meant to not protect anyone in this country, but rather to single-mindedly drive out transgender people of all ages from all walks of civic life,\" said Harper Seldin, a staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union's LGBTQ & HIV Project.",
      "Seldin said the ACLU is reviewing the order \"to understand what, if anything, has immediate effect versus what needs to go through continued agency action.\"",
      "Even as transgender people have gained visibility and acceptance on some fronts, they've become major targets for social conservatives. In recent years, at least 26 states have adopted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors. Most of those states face lawsuits, including one over Tennessee's ban that's pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Republican-controlled states have also moved to keep transgender women and girls from competing in women's or girls' sports and to dictate which bathrooms transgender people can use, particularly in schools.",
      "\"These policies are not serving anyone,\" said Shelby Chestnut, executive director of the Transgender Law Center. \"They're only creating confusion and fear for all people.\"",

    "story": [
      "Dozens of senior staff inside the U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, have been placed on administrative leave until further notice, and hundreds of contractors have had their employment furloughed or terminated, multiple sources told CBS News. This followed Secretary of State Marco Rubio's order last Friday that placed an immediate halt on virtually all U.S.-funded foreign aid assistance globally.",
      "CBS News spoke to a dozen current and former USAID staff and contractors who were granted anonymity to speak openly.",
      "An email obtained by CBS News and sent from USAID's acting administrator Jason Gray to USAID staff Monday stated that \"a number of USAID employees\" were placed on administrative leave with full pay and benefits until further notice after \"several actions within USAID that appear to be designed to circumvent the President's Executive Orders and the mandate from the American people\" were identified.",
      "Approximately 60 senior staff within USAID have been suspended \u2014 including the assistant administrators and deputy assistant administrators heading up most of its bureaus \u2014 leaving the agency without clear leadership, five sources familiar with the internal action told CBS News. The majority of those placed on leave were career civil servants and foreign service officers. They also included USAID attorneys in the Office of the General Counsel, who are responsible for interpreting the executive orders for implementation.",
      "One source told CBS News the individuals affected were told to \"go home and not communicate with anyone\" at USAID. Two sources told CBS News that some of the individuals in question were physically escorted out of the building.",
      "CBS News has also learned that several hundred contractors at USAID have been furloughed or laid off, according to six sources familiar with the action. Some have been notified they have been terminated immediately without severance pay and that their benefits will expire in just three days, at the end of January, while others who have been furloughed have been told their benefits will remain in effect through the end of February.",
      "Rubio's order is part of an effort by the administration to meet President Trump's campaign promises of shrinking the size of the federal workforce, and looking for places to cut what it sees as wasteful government spending. Mr. Trump has long held that other nations are not contributing enough when it comes to foreign aid, and that the U.S. is bearing the brunt of the burden. But critics say such cuts could undermine America's standing in the world and create an opening for China and other adversaries looking to exert their influence abroad.",
      "In response to Rubio's mandate to halt federal foreign assistance, stop-work orders were issued on Monday and Tuesday to companies that hold contracts with USAID and the State Department.",
      "Termination letters sent to two contractors obtained by CBS News read, \"This letter is to inform you that effective January 28, 2025, your employment with [federal contract holder] will be terminated due to a contract layoff. Unfortunately, [federal contract holder] received a Stop Work Order, and without authority to proceed, we have no work for you to perform.\"",
      "There is language in the termination letters reading, \"We hope this situation is temporary and that you can return to your positions.\" However, the employees' email accounts with USAID and the contracting company were shut off, and the termination letters were sent afterwards to their personal emails, sources said.",
      "One source said that USAID staff had scrambled to put forward applications for waivers for programs once Rubio had sent out the order.",
      "\"Then they physically escorted out USAID leadership. The waiver process was a joke,\" the source said.",
      "\"USAID is absolutely gutted,\" another source in the agency said. \"This is surgical to stop programs. Lives are at stake here. We are jeopardizing lives.\"",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters late Tuesday that \"staff have been given a template for waiver requests.\"",
      "Rubio, later on Tuesday, then issued a waiver to his own foreign assistance pause. In a second memo provided to CBS by a senior administration official, Rubio stated the waiver applies to \"life-saving humanitarian assistance\", which he defined as \"life-saving medicine, medical services, food, shelter, and subsistence assistance, as well as supplies and reasonable administrative costs as necessary to deliver such assistance.\"",
      "The memo also stated, \"Implementers of existing life-saving humanitarian assistance programs should continue or resume work if they have stopped.\"",
      "The new waiver does not apply to \"activities that involve abortions, family planning conferences, gender or DEl ideology programs, transgender surgeries, or other non-life saving assistance,\" per the memo.",
      "The State Department has not yet provided clarification on whether some U.S.-funded foreign aid programs are now automatically exempt as a result of Rubio's new waiver, or whether all programs globally must still apply for a waiver in order to opt back into receiving U.S. funding.",
      "It is not immediately clear how this new waiver will impact those whose employment has already been terminated.",
      "In the copy of Rubio's initial order obtained by CBS News last Friday, he told all U.S. diplomatic and consular posts to immediately issue \"stop-work\" orders \"for existing foreign assistance awards,\" pending review by the Secretary of State.",
      "Rubio had also stated in his initial order that \"exceptions\" to the pause approved by the State Department Director of Foreign Assistance Office are also exempt, without further specifying what those exceptions are. CBS News has learned that Pete Marocco, a former deputy assistant secretary of African Affairs at the Pentagon, is now serving in a senior directing role within the State Department's Foreign Assistance Office \u2014 known internally as 'F' \u2014 which oversees foreign assistance programs administered by the State Department and USAID.",
      "\"I'm so devastated [as] to what just took place,\" one impacted USAID source said. \"We enjoyed the work we'd done and how it contributed to helping people all over the world. What took place was not fair at all. This has never taken place in any administration change, ever,\" they said, adding that they had respected the change and had been \"looking forward to building a relationship with the new administration for the better good.\"",
      "Two now-former USAID contractors voiced deep concerns about having life-threatening health conditions, in one case exacerbated by frequent work travel, and suddenly finding themselves without medical insurance after the end of the month on Friday.",
      "\"Our contractor could have paid us for two weeks. Or at least through next week so that we could have health insurance through February,\" says another USAID contractor whose employment was terminated on Tuesday. \"It feels apocalyptic. Every email felt like a threat starting last week and then they followed through.\" The source added that in their office on Monday and Tuesday \"people were in disarray and bawling\u2026People are terrified. Direct hires are feeling intense survivor's guilt and don't know what to do.\"",
      "A number of USAID contractors were also terminated last week without being placed on leave or receiving severance as a result of the executive order targeting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs. This included individuals who were not DEI advisers, or did not have primary job functions related to DEI, but may have contributed to collective workplace efforts focused on inclusivity and accessibility in the Biden administration.",
      "Termination letters sent to those employees last Thursday evening read, \"Effective immediately, USAID no longer requires the services you currently perform on the contract. As of today, USAID is ending funding for this position.\"",
      "Multiple sources also told CBS News that in several Washington, D.C.-based USAID annex office buildings, photographs hanging up of the agencies' programs and beneficiaries have been stripped from the walls. The removal of photographs is \"not normal protocol\" between administrations, one source said.",
      "\"They're physically dismantling things in the building,\" a second source said. \"They're erasing our existence,\" said a third.",
      "Contractors with USAID's Bureau for Global Health \u2014 the department responsible for projects covering HIV/AIDS treatment, maternal and child health, malaria, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases \u2014 were among those who received termination notices on Tuesday. According to two sources, all contractors in the Global Health Bureau, roughly 450 technical experts, were terminated. Those contractors make up about 50% of the entire USAID global health staff, leaving only about 450 direct hires still employed in that bureau.",
      "The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR \u2014 started by the administration of George W. Bush in 2003 \u2014 is among the notable government programs suddenly brought to a halt since Rubio issued the order, potentially interrupting the provision of anti-viral medications (ARVs) for millions of HIV and AIDS patients globally.\u00a0 According to the State department, PEPFAR has saved the lives of 26 million people since it started.",
      "While funding could be turned back on pending the outcome of a 90-day review, there is also growing concern among advocates that congressional support for PEPFAR is in peril due to a revelation earlier this month that groups receiving aid performed abortions, which is a violation of U.S. law. Reuters reported that four nurses in Mozambique had performed 21 abortions since 2021. That revelation may also be part of the upcoming State Department review.",
      "Currently 20.6 million people globally are on life-saving drugs due to PEPFAR, one source told CBS News, so the freeze in U.S. aid funding could lead to \"hundreds of thousands of deaths, particularly for women and children, depending on the length of the freeze.\"",
      "\"This is a crime against humanity,\" the source added.",
      "\"This purge is unprecedented, is a threat to our national security, makes America less safe, and seems [to be] circumventing congressional authority,\" one former USAID employee said.",

      "A palm-sized mammal that lives underground in California  has been caught alive on camera for the first time.",
      "Three undergraduate students came up with an idea to capture the elusive Mount Lyell shrew, native to the Eastern Sierra Nevada region, as part of their fall 2024 project. Vishal Subramanyan, Prakrit Jain and Harper Forbes laid out over 100 traps last November and checked them every two hours, for three days and four nights, to photograph the tiny creatures.",
      "\"The hardest part of getting the photos was one, they're incredibly fast cuz they're always running around,\" Subramanyan told CBS News.",
      "Another reason the Mount Lynell shrews had never been captured alive on camera is that they have an incredibly fast metabolism, Subramanyan said. He and Jain were already taking photos of small mammals for their mammalogy class when they learned that this particular animal had never been photographed before, so they devised a plan.",
      "Researchers have set up similar pitfall traps to capture the shrews, but if they're left in the trap for more than two hours, they'll simply starve to death. That's why Subramanyan, Jain and Forbes had to check their traps every two hours.",
      "To take the photos, the students set up a white background on the bottom of a box, using glass on the top so they could photograph through it. They also had a terrarium with soil and mealworms for the shrews.",
      "The tiny mammals are active through day and night because they have to constantly feed on insects and arachnids to survive. Another challenge in getting the photos were cold fingers, Subramanyan said.",

      "Satellite imagery suggested that unlike previous \"megabergs,\" this rogue was not crumbling into smaller chunks as it plodded through the Southern Ocean, Andrew Meijers, a physical oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey, told AFP on Friday.",
      "He said predicting its exact course was difficult but prevailing currents suggested the colossus would reach the shallow continental shelf around South Georgia in two to four weeks.",
      "But what might happen next is anyone's guess, he said.",
      "It could avoid the shelf and get carried into open water beyond South Georgia, a British overseas territory some 870 miles east of the Falkland Islands.",
      "Or it could strike the sloping bottom and get stuck for months or break up into pieces.",
      "Meijers said this scenario could seriously impede seals and penguins trying to feed and raise their young on the island. The island hosts 1.3 million pairs of Chinstrap penguins \u2014 one of the world's largest colonies \u2014 about 5 million seals, and 65 million breeding birds.",
      "\"Icebergs have grounded there in the past and that has caused significant mortality to penguin chicks and seal pups,\" he said.",
      "Roughly 1,550 square miles across, the world's biggest and oldest iceberg, known as A23a, calved from the Antarctic shelf in 1986. Before its calving in 1986, the colossal iceberg hosted a Soviet research station. falley",
      "It remained stuck for over 30 years before finally breaking free in 2020, its lumbering journey north sometimes delayed by ocean forces that kept it spinning in place. In 2023, the British Antarctic Survey posted a time-lapse of satellite imagery, showing the iceberg's movement.",

      "A23a has followed roughly the same path as previous massive icebergs, passing the east side of the Antarctica Peninsula through the Weddell Sea along a route called \"iceberg alley.\" That is the same current of water that famed explorer Ernest Shackleton used in 1916 to make his storied escape from Antarctica after losing his ship, the Endurance. The legendary\u00a0shipwreck was discovered\u00a0off the coast of Antarctica in 2022.",

      "Raul Cordero from Chile's University of Santiago, who is also part of the National Antarctic Research Committee, said he was confident the iceberg would sidestep South Georgia.",
      "\"The island acts as an obstacle for ocean currents and therefore usually diverts the water long before it reaches the island,\" he said.",
      "\"The iceberg is moved by that water flow, so the chances of it hitting are not that high,\" though chunks could, he said.",
      "Another scientist, glaciologist Soledad Tiranti currently on an Argentinian exploration voyage in the Antarctic, said that icebergs such as A23a \"are so deep that before reaching an island or mainland they generally get stuck\" on the seabed.",
      "It is summer in South Georgia and resident penguins and seals along its southern coastline are foraging in the frosty waters to bring back food to fatten their young.",
      "\"If the iceberg parks there, it'll either block physically where they feed from, or they'll have to go around it,\" said Meijers.",
      "\"That burns a huge amount of extra energy for them, so that's less energy for the pups and chicks, which causes increased mortality.\"",
      "The seal and penguin populations on South Georgia have already been having a \"bad season\" with an outbreak of bird flu \"and that (iceberg) would make it significantly worse,\" he said.",
      "As A23a ultimately melted it could seed the water with nutrients that encourage phytoplankton growth, feeding whales and other species, and allowing scientists to study how such blooms absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",

    "story": [
      "Asteroid samples fetched by NASA hold not only the pristine building blocks for life but also the salty remains of an ancient water world, scientists reported Wednesday.",
      "The findings provide the strongest evidence yet that asteroids may have planted the seeds of life on Earth and that these ingredients were mingling with water almost right from the start.",
      "\"That's the kind of environment that could have been essential to the steps that lead from elements to life,\" said the Smithsonian Institution's Tim McCoy, one of the lead study authors.",
      "NASA's Osiris-Rex spacecraft returned 122 grams (4 ounces) of dust and pebbles from the near-Earth asteroid Bennu, delivering the sample canister to the Utah desert in 2023 before swooping off after another space rock. It remains the biggest cosmic haul from beyond the moon. The two previous asteroid sample missions, by Japan, yielded considerably less material.",
      "Small amounts of Bennu's precious black grains \u2014 leftovers from the solar system's formation 4.5 billion years ago \u2014 were doled out to the two separate research teams whose studies appeared in the journals Nature and Nature Astronomy. But it was more than enough to tease out the sodium-rich minerals and confirm the presence of amino acids, nitrogen in the form of ammonia and even parts of the genetic code.",
      "Some if not all of the delicate salts found at Bennu \u2014 similar to what's in the dry lakebeds of California's Mojave Desert and Africa's Sahara \u2014 would be stripped away if present in falling meteorites.",
      "\"This discovery was only possible by analyzing samples that were collected directly from the asteroid then carefully preserved back on Earth,\" the Institute of Science Tokyo's Yasuhito Sekine, who was not involved in the studies, said in an accompanying editorial.",
      "Combining the ingredients of life with an environment of sodium-rich salt water, or brines, \"that's really the pathway to life,\" said McCoy, the National Museum of Natural History's curator of meteorites. \"These processes probably occurred much earlier and were much more widespread than we had thought before.\"",
      "NASA's Daniel Glavin said one of the biggest surprises was the relatively high abundance of nitrogen, including ammonia. While all of the organic molecules found in the Bennu samples have been identified before in meteorites, Glavin said the ones from Bennu are valid \u2014 \"real extraterrestrial organic material formed in space and not a result of contamination from Earth.\"",
      "Bennu \u2014 a rubble pile just one-third of a mile (one-half of a kilometer) across \u2014 was originally part of a much larger asteroid that got clobbered by other space rocks. The latest results suggest this parent body had an extensive underground network of lakes or even oceans, and that the water evaporated away, leaving behind the salty clues.",
      "Sixty labs around the world are analyzing bits of Bennu as part of initial studies, said the University of Arizona's Dante Lauretta, the mission's chief scientist who took part in both studies.",
      "Most of the $1 billion mission's cache has been set aside for future analysis. Scientists stress more testing is needed to better understand the Bennu samples, as well as more asteroid and comet sample returns. China plans to launch an asteroid sample return mission this year.",
      "Many are pushing for a mission to collect rocks and dirt from the potentially waterlogged dwarf planet Ceres in the main asteroid belt. Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus also beckon as enticing water worlds. Meanwhile, NASA has core samples awaiting pickup at Mars, but their delivery is on hold while the space agency studies the quickest and cheapest way to get them here.",

      "President Trump blamed the Biden administration Tuesday for \"abandoning\" two astronauts who have been stuck aboard the International Space Station in the wake of problems last summer with their Boeing Starliner capsule.",
      "In a post to his Truth Social platform, the president said he has asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration. They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!\"",
      "For his part, Musk had written in an earlier post on his own social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding that \"we will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's post made it sound like Musk himself would be going to space, adding to widespread confusion about what was being planned, in part because the astronauts in question, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and co-pilot Sunita Williams, are not \"stranded\" in any conventional sense, and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "They could return to Earth anytime NASA so decides, riding down in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule that carried two station crew members to orbit last September with two empty seats specifically for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "They blasted off aboard the Starliner capsule last June 5 for a presumed eight-to-10-day mission. It was the first piloted flight of a Starliner, a key step toward beginning service as an operational alternative to SpaceX's Crew Dragon.",
      "But the flight was marred by propellant leaks and pressurization problems with the Starliner's propulsion system.",
      "After multiple extensions to carry out tests and analyses, NASA managers decided on Aug. 24 to leave Wilmore and Williams aboard the station for an extended stay, bringing the Starliner down under remote control, without its crew, on Sept. 7. There were no major problems.",
      "The decision to keep Wilmore and Williams aloft on the station was made by NASA management based on a risk assessment and a desire to minimize long-range disruption to the carefully choreographed schedule of crew rotation and cargo delivery missions.",
      "In any case, in the wake of NASA's decision, SpaceX launched a four-seat Crew Dragon spacecraft to the space station on Sept. 28 with just two crew members aboard \u2014 NASA's Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov \u2014 leaving two seats available for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "NASA opted to carry out a normal long-duration stay by Hague and Gorbunov, who launched with an expectation of returning to Earth at the end of February with Wilmore and Williams. All of that was known last September.",
      "The return flight was later delayed an additional month or so to give SpaceX more time to ready a new Crew Dragon capsule for launch on its maiden flight to ferry a replacement crew \u2014 Crew 10 \u2014 to the station.",
      "As it now stands, Crew 9 commander Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams are expecting to return to Earth at the end of March. By that point, the two Starliner astronauts will have logged around 300 days in space. Both astronauts have said they understood NASA's decision to extend their mission.",
      "As the founder of SpaceX, Musk was certainly aware of those decisions when they were made and the rationale behind them. There have been no reports of any direct involvement of the Biden administration in the decisions to extend the Starliner crew's stay in space, and Musk offered no criticisms of NASA's decision at the time.",
      "As for what returning the Starliner crew to Earth \"as soon as possible\" might mean, the only obvious answer would be to bring Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams down ahead of schedule. They would not need anyone to come get them.",
      "But an early departure would leave a single U.S. astronaut behind on the space station: Don Pettit, who launched to the lab last year aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft along with two Russian crewmates.",
      "NASA would then have just one astronaut on board the station to operate the multi-module U.S. segment of the lab, likely halting research in its tracks until Crew 10 could arrive aboard the next Crew Dragon.",
      "Rumors indicate the Crew 10 Dragon could be facing additional delays. NASA could opt to move the next station crew to a Crew Dragon earmarked for a commercial trip to the station carrying a crew sponsored by Houston-based Axiom Space. That might move the Crew 9 return up a few days, but not by any significant amount.",
      "A Crew Dragon that will be used for a commercial space tourism flight around Earth's poles this spring is not believed to be an option because it is not equipped with a space station docking mechanism.",

      "DeepSeek's introduction in the U.S. on Monday saw it quickly become the most downloaded free application in the country on Apple's app store. The rollout also rocked Wall Street as investors struggled to compute the sudden appearance of a low-cost, open-source generative AI tool able to compete with leading artificial intelligence apps such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.",

      "That explosive debut was branded a \"wake-up call\" by President Trump on Monday. Addressing reporters on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the National Security Council (NSC) would examine the potential national security implications around DeepSeek's launch, noting that the administration would seek to \"ensure American AI dominance.\"",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "Some lawmakers also weighed in with concerns about the application's access to U.S. users.",
      "\"The U.S. cannot allow Chinese Communist Party models such as DeepSeek to risk our national security and leverage our technology to advance their AI ambitions,\" Rep. John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said Tuesday in a statement shared on social media. \"We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek's AI infrastructure.\"",
      "The spotlight on DeepSeek comes amid rising tensions over trade, technology and other issues between the two superpowers. The U.S. has already imposed significant export controls on China in an effort to rein in Beijing's production of semiconductors used in developing advanced AI, with the most recent curbs coming in\u00a0December.",
      "\"At the President's direction, the NSC and others in the U.S. government work in many ways to address concerns involving AI, China and data security,\" agency spokesperson Brian Hughes told CBS News in an email. \"As the President has underscored, U.S. policy is to ensure that the United States leads the world in AI.\"",
      "Security threat for users",
      "While the calls from Moolenaar could be the first inkling of a possible congressional crackdown, Ross Burley \u2014 a co-founder of the nonprofit Centre for Information Resilience \u2014 warned that DeepSeek's emergence in the U.S. raises data security and privacy issues for users. Chinese law grants Beijing broad authority to access data from companies based in China.",
      "\"More and more people will use it, and that will open the door to more and more personal data just being given away to the [Chinese Communist Party] and being sent basically to mainland China to be able to inform them of their activities,\" Burley told CBS News.",
      "\"What they'll use it for is behavior change campaigns, disinformation campaigns, for really targeted messaging as to what Western audiences like, what they do,\" he added.",
      "DeepSeek, which is based in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, notes in its privacy policy that the personal information it collects from users is held \"on secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Under that\u00a0policy, the company says it collects information including users' \"device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, and system language.\" DeepSeek also collects \"service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs,\" according to the company.",
      "A key difference from TikTok",
      "The fact that DeepSeek's servers are based in mainland China differentiates it from TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform that Congress had sought to ban on national security grounds before President Trump signed an executive order last week directing the Justice Department to not enforce the law for a period of 75 days.",
      "In an effort to mitigate U.S. regulatory concerns, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in 2022 moved all of its U.S. data to infrastructure owned by American software maker Oracle.",
      "The legislation banning TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April \u2014 grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on tech platforms owned by countries regarded as U.S. adversaries.",
      "Under that law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content; has more than 1 million monthly active users; is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country; and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "But DeepSeek may be seen as less of a threat given that, unlike TikTok, it is an open-source large language model, according to Matt Sheehan, a China fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\"[A] lot of these open-source apps, open-source models, you can actually sort of use them directly on other platforms. Perplexity is a major U.S. AI company, and they're currently using a version of DeepSeek that you can use that doesn't have the data privacy or security threats,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Advancing censorship?",
      "One issue that DeepSeek users face outside of China: censorship. For example, a CBS News analysis of the application found that DeepSeek did not return any results for a prompt seeking information bout the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre in Beijing.",
      "Burley of the Centre for Information Resilience thinks such suppression of information on an app being downloaded by millions of users will pressure policymakers to act.",
      "\"I think it's incumbent on Western governments \u2014 the U.K., Canada, the U.S. \u2014 to look and see if it is wise for the Apple store and the Android store to host this large language model when it is so clearly being curated to push Chinese narratives and censorship,\" he said.",

By comparison, OpenAI, Google and other major U.S. companies are on track to invest a total of roughly $1 trillion in AI over the coming years, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "On Monday, DeepSeek's rollout roiled shares of AI stalwarts such as Nvidia, the high-flying manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, and Dutch company ASML, another chipmaker. The Chinese company's tech is raising questions about whether demand for Nvidia's chips could take a hit, as well as whether investors are overvaluing tech stocks that have been buoyed by the promise of AI, from Meta to Microsoft, experts said.",
      "\"DeepSeek has taken the market by storm by doing more with less,\" said Giuseppe Sette, president at AI market research firm Reflexivity, in an email. \"This shows that with AI the surprises will keep on coming in the next few years.\"",
      "DeepSeek's latest app comes just days after President Trump announced a new $500 billion venture\u00a0with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, dubbed Stargate, which he touted as ensuring \"the future of technology\" in the U.S.",
      "AI-related stocks took a hit on Monday, with Nvidia shares tumbling 17%, shedding $600 billion in value and marking the single-biggest one-day loss for a company in stock market history, according\u00a0to CNBC. ASML sank 6%, while Broadcom, another semiconductor stock, also slumped 17%.",
      "Some energy-related stocks also plunged on Monday on investor worries that the new tech could require less energy to run, translating into lower demand from the tech sector. GE Vernova, which makes wind and gas turbines, plunged 21%, while electricity generator Vistra slumped 28%.",
      "The tech-heavy Nasdaq index slumped 3%, or 612 points, while the S&P 500 declined 1.5%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7%.",
      "Despite the sharp drop on the Nasdaq, it's far from the worst day for the index during the past five years. The worst one-day decline since Jan. 27, 2020, came on March 16, 2020, when the index plunged more than 12% as COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy.",
      "What is DeepSeek?",
      "DeepSeek is a private Chinese company founded in July 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a graduate of Zhejiang University, one of China's top universities, who funded the startup via his hedge fund,\u00a0according to the MIT Technology Review. Liang has about $8 billion in assets, Ives wrote in a Jan. 27 research note.",
      "Liang, who had previously focused on applying AI to investing, had bought a \"stockpile of Nvidia A100 chips,\" a type of tech that is now banned from export to China. Those chips became the basis of DeepSeek, the MIT publication reported.",
      "Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius, told investors in a note that DeepSeek makes legitimate breakthroughs as an AI tool, including better learning and more efficient use of memory, although he expressed skepticism about the \"amount of chips used.\"",
      "Is DeepSeek available in the U.S.?",
      "The company's AI app is available in Apple's App store, as well as online at its website. The service is free and as of Monday morning was the top download on Apple's store, although some people were having trouble signing up for the app.",
      "On its Chinese site, DeepSeek blamed \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its service, requiring it to temporarily limit new registrations. \"Existing users can log in as usual,\" the company said in the post, which was dated shortly after midnight Jan. 28 in China's local time.",
      "The company released its latest AI model on Jan. 20, which is causing Wall Street to reappraise the AI sector.",
      "\"Last week DeepSeek launched a model that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta's Llama 3.1 and was #1 on Apple's App Store over the weekend,\" Wedbush's Ives wrote. \"DeepSeek built the model using reduced capability chips from Nvidia. which is impressive and thus has caused major agita for U.S. tech stocks with massive pressure on Nasdaq this morning.\"",
      "How is DeepSeek different than other AI apps?",
      "DeepSeek is an open-source large language model that relies on what is known as \"inference-time computing,\" which Sette said in layman's terms means \"they activate only the most relevant portions of their model for each query, and that saves money and computation power.\"",
      "Some experts praised DeepSeek's performance, with noted tech investor Marc Andreessen writing\u00a0on X on Jan. 24, \"DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen \u2014 and as open source, a profound gift to the world.\"",
      "David Sacks, a venture capitalist named by Mr. Trump to help oversee AI and cryptocurrency policy, said on social media Monday that DeepSee's app \"shows that the AI race will be very competitive.\"",
      "However, Ives said he's skeptical the service will gain ground with major U.S. businesses.",
      "\"No U.S. Global 2000 is going to use a Chinese startup DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases,\" Ives wrote. \"At the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia.\"",
      "Are there privacy issues with DeepSeek?",
      "Some experts are raising concerns about the personal data that DeepSeek is collecting, given that the company stores data from users \u2014 including their date of birth, keystrokes, text or audio inputs, uploaded files, chat history and other data \u2014 on servers located in China, according to its privacy policy.",
      "That echoes some of the issues raised with TikTok, another company with Chinese ownership that sparked worries about the supposed risks its ties to China posed to national security. Last year, Congress passed a law\u00a0banning\u00a0 TikTok in the U.S. as long as it is under Chinese ownership, although that is now in flux after President Trump signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0directing the Justice Department to not enforce the ban for 75 days.",
      "What does DeepSeek mean for Nvidia and other tech companies?",
      "Wall Street is trying to assess the long-term impact of a low-cost AI tool from China that rivals ChatGPT and other so-called generative AI apps. It also raises questions about whether Silicon Valley is overspending on tech advancements in the AI sector, noted Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, in an email.",
      "\"The fact that this technology is supposed to take less energy and is more cost-effective than U.S.-based models has U.S. technology investors very concerned,\" Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, said.",
      "It's also unclear what type of pushback or reaction could come from the White House, given that Mr. Trump has raised the possibility of placing new tariffs on Chinese imports, although he also gave the Chinese-owned TikTok a reprieve by ordering the Justice Department not to enforce a looming ban.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts think Monday's stock selloff is an overreaction, noting that the enormous demand for AI will continue lifting key players in the sector.",
      "\"It's one thing to train a [large language] model for less money, but accommodating the huge demand for the consumption of all this AI technology is still going to require massive amounts of infrastructure,\" Adam Crisafulli of VitalKnowledge said in a report.",
      "Analysts at Bernstein Research also noted that while DeepSeek's technology looks promising, it likely isn't revolutionary, suggesting that Monday's investment rout is overblown.",
      "What is Nvidia saying about DeepSeek?",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Nvidia offered praise for DeepSeek.",
      "\"DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of test-time scaling,\" the company said in an email. \"DeepSeek's work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export-control compliant.\"",
      "But, Nvidia added, AI inference, or using AI models to make decisions or predictions, \"requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.\"",

      "\"We've received a few questions about naming within Google Maps. We have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources,\" wrote Google in a social media post Monday. Their policy is to implement title changes for geographic features in the U.S. after the adjustments appear in the Geographic Names Information System.",
      "\"When that happens, we will update Google Maps in the U.S. quickly to show Mount McKinley and Gulf of America,\" the tech company said.",
      "Also longstanding practice: When official names vary between countries, Maps users see their official local name. Everyone in the rest of the world sees both names. That applies here too.",
      "Google noted that a location's name may appear differently depending on where Maps users are. When a place's title varies between countries, users will see the official name used by the country where they're accessing Maps. Everyone elsewhere in the world sees both names.",
      "The Interior Department announced Friday that the Gulf of Mexico had been renamed the Gulf of America, and Denali had, again, been renamed Mount McKinley, in response to a directive signed by Mr. Trump shortly after he took office.",
      "In a news release, the agency said the changes \"reaffirm the Nation's commitment to preserving the extraordinary heritage of the United States and ensuring that future generations of Americans celebrate the legacy of its heroes and historic assets.\" The U.S. Board on Geographic Names was set to begin updating \"the official federal nomenclature in the Geographic Names Information System to reflect these changes, effective immediately for federal use,\" the department added.",
      "Although the federal government will formally reference both the Gulf and the mountain by their new names \u2014 in government documents and official U.S. maps, for example \u2014 other nations are not required recognize them. The Associated Press, whose style guidance many news organizations typically follow, said it will call the Gulf of Mexico by its original name while acknowledging the name Gulf of America. The AP will also refer to Denali as Mount McKinley, since Mr. Trump's position gives him authority to alter geographical names of places inside the country.",
      "The Gulf of Mexico first appeared on a world map roughly 400 years ago, as Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum pointed out during a briefing earlier this month where she derided what was at the time Mr. Trump's proposal to rename the ocean basin that shares near-equal lengths of coastline with her country and the U.S. Citing one of Mexico's founding documents that dates to the early 1800s and preceded the nation's constitution, Sheinbaum sarcastically suggested renaming North America \"Am\u00e9rica Mexicana,\" which translates to \"Mexican America.\"",
      "Denali's name comes from the Koyukon Indigenous residents of Alaska who are native to area around the mountain. Subject to dispute over the decades, the U.S. designated it Mount McKinley in the early 1900s to commemorate a slain president. The name was changed formally to Denali by former President Barack Obama during his administration.",

      "\"I do not make a decision on nominees until after the hearing is concluded,\" she said.",
      "Collins said Monday she's seeking clarity from Gabbard about her position on Section 702. Gabbard, who sought to repeal the controversial law that authorizes the U.S. government to collect the communications of foreigners abroad without a warrant, has since reversed her stance. In a\u00a0statement to Punchbowl earlier this month, Gabbard said she now supports the surveillance authority, calling it \"crucial\" to protecting national security.",
      "\"My prior concerns about FISA were based on insufficient protections for civil liberties, particularly regarding the FBI's misuse of warrantless search powers on American citizens. Significant FISA reforms have been enacted since my time in Congress to address these issues,\" she said. \"If confirmed as DNI, I will uphold Americans' Fourth Amendment rights while maintaining vital national security tools like Section 702 to ensure the safety and freedom of the American people.\"",
      "Collins said Gabbard's response to her questions have been \"hedged and unclear.\"",
      "Gabbard's secret trip to Syria in 2017 in which she met with Assad is expected to be another focus of Thursday's hearing. Gabbard's trip faced an outcry from her fellow lawmakers, who argued it legitimized the brutal dictator. Assad fled the country in December 2024 after his regime was toppled.",
      "\"When the opportunity arose to meet with him, I did so because I felt that it's important that if we profess to truly care about the Syrian people, about their suffering, then we've got to be able to meet with anyone that we need to if there is a possibility that we can achieve peace,\" she said in 2017.",
      "She also doubted whether the Assad regime was behind a chemical weapons attack on its own civilians, which international weapons experts said originated from Syrian government sites.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who is not a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday said he would be paying attention to Gabbard's hearing.",
      "\"I tend to vote for almost everybody at both parties, but I want to see how the hearing goes,\" Graham said. \"Why did you go to Syria? What did you do regarding the Assad [regime]? Why do you think Edward Snowden should be held as a hero? I certainly don't.\"",
      "In 2020, Gabbard called for the dismissal of charges against Snowden, who leaked a trove of information on the U.S. government's top-secret mass surveillance programs. Snowden, who was charged with espionage in 2013, has been living in exile in Russia.",
      "Gabbard drew further ire after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, when she made statements that were viewed by some as parroting Russian propaganda.",
      "\"This war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden Admin/NATO had simply acknowledged Russia's legitimate security concerns regarding Ukraine's becoming a member of NATO, which would mean US/NATO forces right on Russia's border,\" she\u00a0wrote at the time.",
      "Republican Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas said Wednesday he expects Gabbard's potential confirmation vote to be \"really close.\"",
      "\"I still have confidence,\" he said. \"I think that she's an outsider, that she's a disrupter.\"",

    "summary": "The EPA chief will help President Trump fulfill his pledge to roll back major environmental regulations.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican-controlled Senate on Wednesday confirmed Lee Zeldin to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, a key role to help President Trump fulfill his pledge to roll back major environmental regulations, including those aimed at slowing climate change and encouraging use of electric vehicles.",
      "The vote was 56-42 in Zeldin's favor.",
      "Zeldin, a former Republican congressman from New York, is a longtime Trump ally and served on Mr. Trump's defense team during his first impeachment. He voted against certifying Mr. Trump's 2020 election loss to former President Joe Biden.",
      "Zeldin, 44, said during his confirmation hearing that he has a moral responsibility to be a good steward of the environment and pledged to support career staff who have dedicated themselves to the agency's mission to protect human health and the environment.",
      "Zeldin repeatedly declined to commit to specific policies, however, promising instead not to prejudge outcomes before arriving at EPA. When asked by Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska whether he would roll back programs that promote electric cars \u2014 a program Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized \u2014 Zeldin stayed vague but acknowledged he has heard Republican complaints.",
      "Mr. Trump led efforts to dismantle more than 100 environmental protections during his first term and has promised to do so again, targeting what he falsely labels an electric vehicle \"mandate\" and \"green new scam\" approved by Democrats.",
      "Mr. Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, has vowed to overturn Biden's biggest climate accomplishments, including tailpipe regulations for vehicles and slashed pollution from power plants fired by coal and natural gas. Mr. Trump has already moved to oust career staff at EPA and other agencies, remove scientific advisers and close an office that helps minority communities that disproportionately struggle with polluted air and water.",
      "Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island called Zeldin the wrong man for the job.",
      "\"We need an EPA administrator who will take climate change seriously, treat the science honestly and stand up where necessary to the political pressure that will be coming from the White House, where we have a president who actually thinks (climate change) is a hoax, and from the huge fossil fuel forces that propelled him into office with enormous amounts of political money and who now think they own the place,\" Whitehouse said in a Senate speech.",
      "Mr. Trump is \"under the thumb of the fossil fuel industry,\" Whitehouse said, adding that the EPA administrator \"has to be truthful and factual and support and defend our environment and our safety from climate change.''",
      "He has nothing against Zeldin personally, Whitehouse added, \"but the likelihood of him standing against that fossil fuel bulldozer that is coming at him is essentially zero. And in that context, this is very much the wrong guy.\"",
      "Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said Zeldin will return the EPA to its original mission of protecting America's air, water and land \u2014 without \"suffocating the economy.\"",
      "Barrasso called Zeldin \"a lifelong public servant\" and a seasoned lawyer with a sharp legal mind and over 20 years of military service.",
      "Zeldin will continue Mr. Trump's \"mission to roll back punishing, political regulations\" at the EPA, \"cut red tape\" and oversee \"a new wave of creativity and innovation,'' Barrasso said.",
      "\"For the last four years, the so-called experts at the Environmental Protection Agency went on a reckless regulatory rampage,'' Barrasso said, referring to the Biden administration. \"They saddled American families and businesses with higher costs and heavy-handed restrictions. They bowed to climate extremism and ignored common sense.\"",
      "Zeldin \"will right the ship and restore balance at the EPA,'' Barrasso said, citing likely actions to repeal Biden-era rules on tailpipe emissions and power plants, along with eliminating federal subsidies for electric vehicles.",
      "The League of Conservation Voters, a national environmental advocacy group, has panned Zeldin's lifetime environmental record, giving him a 14% score. Like all Republicans at the time, he voted against the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act aimed at boosting renewable energy and manufacturing and fighting climate change.",
      "Zeldin supported a bill to reduce harmful forever chemicals, called PFAS, that would have required the EPA to set limits on substances in drinking water. He also was a leading proponent of the 2020 Great American Outdoors Act, which used oil and gas royalties to help the National Park Service tackle its massive maintenance backlog. He's also supported local conservation efforts on Long Island.",
      "Zeldin said at his Jan. 16 hearing that he wants to collaborate with the private sector \"to promote common-sense, smart regulation that will allow American innovation to continue to lead the world.\"",
      "The EPA under his leadership \"will prioritize compliance as much as possible,\" Zeldin said. \"I believe in the rule of law and I want to work with people to ensure they do their part to protect the environment.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 16:33:51 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve opted to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged in its first policy meeting since President Trump's inauguration.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it will leave its benchmark rate unchanged, hitting the brakes on lowering borrowing costs for individuals and businesses after a flurry of rate cuts starting last fall.",
      "The Fed said it will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The decision comes after the central bank trimmed rates three times starting in September 2024, which has pushed down the federal funds rate \u2014 the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 by one percentage point.",
      "The pause, the Fed's first rate decision since President Trump returned to office on Jan. 20, comes as economists predict the central bank is likely to take a wait-and-see approach to the president's economic policies, given that some, such as higher tariffs, could prove inflationary.",
      "The Fed's decision to keep rates steady reflects stubborn U.S. inflation, which remains close to 3% on an annual basis. That has fueled concerns that additional rate cuts could reignite price increases, making it more difficult to get to the Fed's 2% target. Notably, the Fed removed a line from its December statement expressing its belief that inflation \"has made progress\" toward its goal. Yet Powell struck a more dovish tone in a press conference to discuss the Fed's decision.",
      "\"Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well-anchored, as reflected in a broad, broad range of surveys of households, businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets,\" he said.",
      "Powell also described the economy as \"in quite a good place,\" citing growing GDP, solid job gains and a low unemployment rate, as well as signs of inflationary pressures easing. \"We don't need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,\" he added.",
      "\"Pressing the pause button,\" noted Lindsay Rosner, head of multisector fixed-income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"[T]he FOMC will want to see further progress in the inflation data to deliver the next rate cut highlighted by the fact they removed the reference on inflation making progress.\"",

      "In the meantime, inflation-weary consumers won't get much relief from still-high borrowing costs, especially if the Fed holds off on additional rate cuts later in 2025, as many economists and Wall Street analysts forecast. With the Fed hitting the pause button, it's unlikely that consumers will see lower borrowing costs on credit cards or other forms of debt, even as more households struggle to pay their bills.",
      "\"[L]ower- and middle-income households are facing mounting pressure, as evidenced by an increase in credit card and auto loan delinquencies,\" Joe Gaffoglio, CEO of Mutual of America Capital Management, said in an email.",
      "When will the Fed cut rates?",
      "The Fed may hold off on cutting rates until its May 7 meeting, according to economists polled by financial-data firm FactSet. That means the central bank is expected to hold rates steady at its next meeting on March 19.",
      "\"If the Fed doesn't resume cutting in the next few months, however, we suspect the window will have closed,\" Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics said in a report. \"While markets are still pricing in second half rate cuts, our view is that a flurry of tariffs will put a stop to that, as inflation rebounds to 3%.\"",
      "Asked about the possible impact of Mr. Trump's economic plans, Powell demurred, noting that while the Fed is monitoring the new administration's policies, it's too early for the central bank to make an assessment of their possible impact. Mr. Trump has vowed to enact a broad tariff of 10% on all imports, as well as to imposed\u00a025% tariffs on Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1.",
      "\"We need to let those policies be articulated before we can even begin to make that a plausible assessment of what their implications for the economy will be,\" he said. \"We don't know what's going to be tariffed, we don't know for how long or how much, what countries, we don't know about retaliation.\"",
      "Asked by CBS News' Richard Escobedo about economic uncertainty created by Mr. Trump's plan to deport undocumented immigrants, Powell responded that the administration's efforts are not yet showing up in economic data.",
      "\"Businesses that are dependent on immigrant labor are saying that it's suddenly gotten harder to get people,\" the Fed chair said. \"But again, you don't see that in the aggregate data, but yes, you hear it anecdotally.\"",
      "While inflation has subsided from a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022, it\u00a0rose 2.9% in December on a year-over-year basis due to higher prices on gasoline, which rose 4.4% from the prior month, as well as food and housing.",
      "In its statement, the Fed described the labor market as \"solid,\" with an unemployment rate that has \"stabilized at a low level in recent months.\" Even so, the Fed is closely monitoring the labor market for signs of weakness, with the central bank pointing to a rise in the jobless rate last fall as one reason why it opted to cut rates at the time.",
      "\"The Fed will keep their options open in case a sudden weakening materializes in the months to come\" in the labor market, noted Bankrate chief financial analyst Greg McBride in an email.",
      "As for when the next rate cut might come, it's unclear from the Fed's statement, he added.",
      "\"They gave no indication in their post-meeting statement that a resumption of rate cuts is likely at the next meeting in March,\" McBride said. \"It will take a run of good inflation data to get us there, whenever that may be.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The White House Office of Management and Budget on Wednesday walked back a memo that ordered a freeze on federal assistance, less than two days after the directive led to chaos and confusion around the country as to what programs would be impacted.",
      "The latest two-line memo from acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget Matthew Vaeth states that the earlier directive is rescinded. It directs those with questions about implementing President Trump's executive orders to contact the general counsels at their agencies.",
      "\"In light of the injunction, OMB has rescinded the memo to end any confusion on federal policy created by the court ruling and the dishonest media coverage,\" said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday. \"The executive orders issued by the president on funding reviews remain in full force and effect and will be rigorously implemented by all agencies and departments. This action should effectively end the court case and allow the government to focus on enforcing the president's orders on controlling federal spending.\"",
      "She said Mr. Trump will take more action in the coming weeks and months to address federal funding.",
      "The White House sent shockwaves when it issued the guidance late Monday that requested agencies temporarily pause \"to the extent permitted by law\" grant, loan or federal financial assistance programs that were implicated by Mr. Trump's executive orders. The executive orders listed include those involving immigration, energy, diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs, and gender ideology.",
      "The memo, from Vaeth, noted that $3 trillion was spent on federal assistance programs in 2024. It directed agencies to submit to the White House budget office by Feb. 10 detailed information on the programs, projects or activities subject to the funding freeze. The pause was set to take effect by 5 p.m. Tuesday.",
      "The full scope of the directive was not clear, and it left nonprofits, small businesses, universities and other entities scrambling to determine whether they would be impacted, and congressional offices faced an onslaught of questions from constituents and organizations fearing they would lose federal dollars.",
      "While the White House's memo stated Medicare or Social Security benefits would not be impacted, state Medicaid agencies, federally-funded Head Start early education programs and community health centers said they were cut off from accessing a web portal run by the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later clarified there was an \"outage\" that affected the portal, and said no payments were affected.",
      "In addition to sowing confusion, the memo sparked numerous lawsuits, including from a coalition of nonprofits and Democratic state attorneys general. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., swiftly convened a hearing on a request from the nonprofit groups to temporarily block enforcement of the freeze, and agreed Tuesday to issue a brief pause to fully consider the matter.",
      "At a hearing Wednesday in the case brought by the Democratic attorneys general, a federal judge in Rhode Island indicated he is likely to grant their request to temporarily block the funding freeze, but was unclear as to the scope of such an order given the White House's rescission of the memo.",
      "U.S. District Judge John McConnell said the states have \"clearly\" shown they would be irreparably harmed by the halting of federal assistance. He cited an affidavit from the director of the Rhode Island Department of Administration, which said the state has been awarded more than $5 billion in federal financial assistance \u2014 more than one-third of its fiscal year 2025 budget.",
      "McConnell said the initial memo ordering the freeze was \"hugely ambiguous and broad and potentially chaotic.\" He directed the states to submit a proposed temporary restraining order, which the Justice Department will have 24 hours to respond to.",
      "\"While the piece of paper may not exist, there is sufficient evidence that the defendants collectively are acting consistent with that directive,\" he said.",
      "Democrats, meanwhile, lambasted the move by Mr. Trump's administration and accused him of depriving states, cities, towns, schools and hospitals of billions of dollars in federal support.",
      "\"This decision is lawless, dangerous, destructive, cruel. It's illegal, it's unconstitutional,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said during a news conference Tuesday.",

      "\"President Trump has the executive power to make decisions to implement a government that reflects the will of the American people,\" Harrison Fields, principal deputy press secretary at the White House, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"If an individual in the administration is working on policy, then they should align with President Trump's mission of putting America first.\"",
      "Hit to morale?",
      "President Trump is not unique in looking to have a stronger hand over the federal workforce, according to Bednar.",
      "\"A common strategy of presidents is trying to politicize federal employment positions so they have greater control over executive branch hiring and firing,\" said Bednar, who lists Dwight Eisenhower and Jimmy Carter among previous presidents who have sought to exert such influence. Still, he noted \"we haven't seen something that tries to reach this deep into the career staff.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump's Schedule F plan and other administration orders aimed a reshaping the federal workplace are being challenged in court, the Trump administration may succeed in its goal of downsizing government, regardless of whether it wins on the legal front, Bednar said.",
      "\"Even if the lawsuits slow down this process, there are many civil servants who might leave government fearing continuing to work in the Trump administration \u2014 employee moral is really affected,\" he said. \"They want a smaller government, and they view this as an opportunity to pursue that.\"",
      "Bednar also cautions that a smaller government workforce could hinder some Trump administration policy goals, including fewer agents to patrol U.S. borders and reduced staffing in immigration courts, adding to the current backlog.",
      "The case for and against Schedule F",
      "Mr. Trump originally implemented the Schedule F policy in 2020 as his first term was nearing an end, but it was repealed after former President Joe Biden took office. Mr. Trump said last week that the revived order is necessary to ensure that federal workers in roles that affect government policy remain accountable to the public.",
      "\"In recent years ... there have been numerous and well-documented cases of career federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership,\" Mr. Trump's order states. \"Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service, beginning with positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character.\"",
      "But critics of Schedule F argue it undermines the traditional principles behind civil service, which emphasize hiring based on professional qualifications. Should Schedule F survive legal challenges, they say, millions of government workers hired based on merit could be fired at will, including if they are deemed insufficiently loyal to Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Is this really about making government more efficient and smaller, or targeting regulatory and law enforcement people?\" asked Lenkart, who noted that the number of workers employed in the executive branch has remained roughly the same for more than 70 years even as the nation's population has doubled.",
      "Unions representing public workers have blasted Schedule F. The policy is among a slew of executive orders \"designed to intimidate and attack nonpartisan civil servants under the guise of increasing efficiency,\" Randy Erwin, national president of the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0last week. \"However, these orders will do the exact opposite.\"",
      "Members of the 100-year-old NFFE are employed\u00a0by\u00a0dozens of federal agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration and Social Security Administration.",
      "On Wednesday, the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) filed suit against the Trump administration, saying it was exceeding its authority in rolling back protections for workers.",
      "\"We can stop the efforts to fire hundreds of thousands of experienced, hard-working Americans who have dedicated their careers to serving their country and prevent these career civil servants from being replaced with unqualified political flunkies loyal to the president, but not the law or Constitution,\" AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in a statement.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union also filed a suit to block Schedule F, calling it \"contrary to congressional intent.\" The\u00a0complaint, filed Jan. 20 in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, argues that Mr. Trump's order reinstating Schedule F \"wrongly applies employment rules for political appointees to career staff, deprives federal employees of due process rights that they were promised when they were hired, and ignores Office of Personnel Management regulations.\"",
      "NTEU represents about 150,000 workers in 37 federal agencies and departments, including staff at the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Health and Human Services.",

      "Part of President Trump's crackdown on immigration includes lifting restrictions on where federal agents can conduct immigration enforcement, sparking some backlash and uncertainty amid a surge in raids across the country.",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE, said it arrested more than 1,000 people on Tuesday. In 2024, an average of 312 people were arrested per day.",
      "Hours after Mr. Trump's inauguration, his administration revoked a policy that prohibited arrests by U.S. immigration agents at or near schools, places of worship and other \"sensitive locations.\"",
      "Speaking to \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\"\u00a0Vice President JD Vance said the change in policy empowers \"law enforcement to enforce the law everywhere.\"",
      "Some Catholic leaders have expressed concern about the potential impact in churches, and school officials are issuing guidance on how to handle immigration-related issues at schools. Some local officials have also criticized ICE for how agents are conducting raids.",
      "However, experts say there are still limits on where immigration officials can operate, and constitutional protections remain. Here's what to know.",
      "Where ICE can operate",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has followed a policy since 2011 that restricted ICE enforcement actions, including arrests, interviews, searches and surveillance, at \"sensitive\" locations such as schools, churches and hospitals.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the department issued a policy in 2021 that expanded on the definitions of what is considered \"protected areas\" for both ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP).",
      "Anyone, including ICE agents, can enter public areas without permission. Examples of public areas include lobbies, dining areas in restaurants and waiting rooms, according to the National Immigration Law Center, a nonprofit advocacy organization known as NILC.",
      "The NILC said ICE agents cannot enter private areas \u2014 such as a home or an employee-only area like a breakroom \u2014 without permission or a judicial warrant signed by a judge.",
      "Because ICE officers typically don't have warrants signed by judges, they sometimes wait for unauthorized immigrants to come outside of their homes to arrest them, or convince homeowners to give them entry.",
      "Regardless of being in a public or private space, anyone approached by ICE agents has the right to remain silent.",
      "The reasonable expectation of privacy is protected by the Fourth Amendment and the right to remain silent is protected by the Fifth Amendment in the U.S. Constitution.",
      "\"Every person maintains constitutional rights within the United States, regardless of the sensitive locations policy or not,\" Heidi Altman, NILC's vice president of policy, told CBS News.",
      "However, there are limits on Fourth Amendment protections. A federal regulation allows CBP agents without a warrant to enter and search buses, trains, boats and aircraft within 100 miles of a land or sea border.",
      "The NILC said ICE agents who are in public spaces or are authorized to enter private spaces can make arrests if they have an administrative warrant or probable cause.",
      "An administrative warrant is issued by a federal agency, such as ICE or CBP, and enables an officer to make an arrest or seizure, but it does not authorize a search, according to the NILC.",
      "An administrative warrant can be signed by an immigration judge or immigration officer, whereas a judicial warrant must be issued by a judicial court and signed by a judge or magistrate judge.",

    "summary": "A NASA spacecraft has returned asteroid samples that hold not only the pristine building blocks for life but also the salty remains of an ancient water world.",
    "story": [
      "Asteroid samples fetched by NASA hold not only the pristine building blocks for life but also the salty remains of an ancient water world, scientists reported Wednesday.",
      "The findings provide the strongest evidence yet that asteroids may have planted the seeds of life on Earth and that these ingredients were mingling with water almost right from the start.",
      "\"That's the kind of environment that could have been essential to the steps that lead from elements to life,\" said the Smithsonian Institution's Tim McCoy, one of the lead study authors.",
      "NASA's Osiris-Rex spacecraft returned 122 grams (4 ounces) of dust and pebbles from the near-Earth asteroid Bennu, delivering the sample canister to the Utah desert in 2023 before swooping off after another space rock. It remains the biggest cosmic haul from beyond the moon. The two previous asteroid sample missions, by Japan, yielded considerably less material.",
      "Small amounts of Bennu's precious black grains \u2014 leftovers from the solar system's formation 4.5 billion years ago \u2014 were doled out to the two separate research teams whose studies appeared in the journals Nature and Nature Astronomy. But it was more than enough to tease out the sodium-rich minerals and confirm the presence of amino acids, nitrogen in the form of ammonia and even parts of the genetic code.",
      "Some if not all of the delicate salts found at Bennu \u2014 similar to what's in the dry lakebeds of California's Mojave Desert and Africa's Sahara \u2014 would be stripped away if present in falling meteorites.",
      "\"This discovery was only possible by analyzing samples that were collected directly from the asteroid then carefully preserved back on Earth,\" the Institute of Science Tokyo's Yasuhito Sekine, who was not involved in the studies, said in an accompanying editorial.",
      "Combining the ingredients of life with an environment of sodium-rich salt water, or brines, \"that's really the pathway to life,\" said McCoy, the National Museum of Natural History's curator of meteorites. \"These processes probably occurred much earlier and were much more widespread than we had thought before.\"",
      "NASA's Daniel Glavin said one of the biggest surprises was the relatively high abundance of nitrogen, including ammonia. While all of the organic molecules found in the Bennu samples have been identified before in meteorites, Glavin said the ones from Bennu are valid \u2014 \"real extraterrestrial organic material formed in space and not a result of contamination from Earth.\"",
      "Bennu \u2014 a rubble pile just one-third of a mile (one-half of a kilometer) across \u2014 was originally part of a much larger asteroid that got clobbered by other space rocks. The latest results suggest this parent body had an extensive underground network of lakes or even oceans, and that the water evaporated away, leaving behind the salty clues.",
      "Sixty labs around the world are analyzing bits of Bennu as part of initial studies, said the University of Arizona's Dante Lauretta, the mission's chief scientist who took part in both studies.",
      "Most of the $1 billion mission's cache has been set aside for future analysis. Scientists stress more testing is needed to better understand the Bennu samples, as well as more asteroid and comet sample returns. China plans to launch an asteroid sample return mission this year.",
      "Many are pushing for a mission to collect rocks and dirt from the potentially waterlogged dwarf planet Ceres in the main asteroid belt. Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus also beckon as enticing water worlds. Meanwhile, NASA has core samples awaiting pickup at Mars, but their delivery is on hold while the space agency studies the quickest and cheapest way to get them here.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration is reversing the Biden administration's decision to extend the Temporary Protected Status program for Venezuelans in the U.S., casting a cloud of uncertainty over the hundreds of thousands of migrants enrolled in the policy, according to a Department of Homeland Security notice obtained by CBS News.",
      "Under the move, some Venezuelan migrants with TPS could lose their ability to live and work in the U.S. lawfully as early as this spring. Migrants whose TPS lapses could face deportation by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, which the Trump administration has charged with carrying out the largest deportation effort in American history.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revoked an order issued earlier this month by her predecessor, Alejandro Mayorkas, that would have extended the Venezuela TPS program for 18 months, through October 2026. TPS allows migrants from countries beset by war, environmental disasters and other crises to work and live in the U.S. legally on a temporary basis.",
      "The Biden administration made two TPS designations for Venezuelans, one in 2021 and the other in 2023, citing the country's economic collapse under the repressive rule of President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "The decision by the Trump administration means that Venezuelans who applied for TPS under the 2021 designation will be able to keep their work permits and deportation protections through September. Those who applied under the 2023 designation will continue to have TPS through at least early April.",
      "Noem has until Saturday, Feb. 1, to decide whether to terminate or extend the 2023 designation, meaning that another announcement could happen soon. If no formal decision is made by then, the designation will be automatically extended by six months.",
      "Roughly 600,000 Venezuelans have protected status, making the Venezuela TPS program the largest of its kind, according to DHS figures. Venezuelans made up a significant portion of migrants crossing the U.S. southern border illegally during the historic migration wave there in the earlier years of the Biden administration.",
      "While hundreds of thousands have come to the U.S., millions of other Venezuelans have settled in countries like Colombia. In all, nearly 8 million Venezuelans have fled their homeland in recent years, according to United Nations figures.",
      "Noem announced her move to scale back the Venezuela TPS program on Fox News on Wednesday morning, after it was reported by The New York Times late Tuesday.",
      "The Biden administration used TPS at an unprecedented scale, making hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees from crisis-stricken countries like Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti and Ukraine eligible for the status.",

    "summary": "President Trump has said he will \"demand\" lower interest rates, raising questions about his ability to influence the Federal Reserve.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump had a message last week for the Federal Reserve while at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland: He plans to \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\"",
      "Mr. Trump may be in for disappointment. The Federal Reserve widely expected to keep its benchmark rate steady when it announces its latest interest rate decision today at 2 p.m. Eastern Time. Economists aren't penciling in a 2025 reduction until at least May, according to economists polled by financial data service FactSet.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has over the years steadfastly defended the central bank's independence. Most recently, he underlined at a New York Times event in December that insulating the Fed from political influence is \"for the benefit of all Americans,\" allowing it to make decisions based on economic data rather than at the behest of elected officials. The Fed's independence allows it to pursue its dual mandate \u2014 to keep inflation low and the labor market at full employment \u2014 without political pressure, economists concur.",
      "\"We know monetary policy needs to be enacted with a democratic mandate underpinning it, with a day-to-day remove from politics,\" Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Interest rates may need to be raised but it may be inconvenient for political interests, and [the central bank] may need to move quickly to lower rates\" in case of an economic downturn.",
      "While the Fed is an independent agency, it is accountable to Congress and the public, with its chair and other officials testifying before Congress regularly. Its dual mandate was also established by Congress, as well as its structure of staggered appointments for Fed officials, designed to make the agency less vulnerable to pressures \"that could lead to undesirable outcomes,\" according to the Fed.",
      "What happens when a central bank isn't independent?",
      "Those \"undesirable outcomes\" can be seen in nations where central bankers are more vulnerable to political influence, economists say.",
      "That's because interest rates remain the most potent weapon that a central bank can wield against surging inflation \u2014 a tool that the Federal Reserve turned to in 2022 to tame the hottest U.S. inflation in 40 years. But elected officials sometimes decide that higher borrowing costs are politically inconvenient, because they make it more expensive for businesses to expand or for consumers to make purchases.",
      "In cases where a central bank isn't independent, officials may succeed in pressuring a central bank to keep a lid on rates.",
      "Experts point to Turkey as an example of what can occur when political interests dictate a central bank's monetary policies. Since 2010, its central bank has increasingly come under pressure from President Erdo\u011fan to keep its interest rates low, even as inflation surged during the pandemic, according to the non-partisan Centre for Economic Policy Research.",
      "Instead of hiking rates as Turkey's inflation rate topped 80% in October 2022 on an annual basis, the nation's central bank cut its benchmark rate several times in 2022 and 2023. While the bank reversed course and hiked rates starting in mid-2023, inflation there has proved tough to tame, with prices rising by 44% in December 2024.",
      "By comparison, the highest U.S. inflation rate during the post-pandemic period was in June 2022, when inflation hit 9.1% on an annual basis in June 2022. In the face of the Fed's rate hikes, inflation has cooled since then, deflating to 2.9% on an annual basis last month.",
      "\"The Fed has done really well \u2014 they have raised the rates enough to try to slowly squeeze inflation out of the market,\" noted Erasmus Kersting, a professor of economics at Villanova University. The Fed has \"done all that while avoiding a recession \u2014 that is a delicate needle to thread.\"",
      "Could Mr. Trump influence the Fed?",
      "Questions about Mr. Trump's ability to influence the Federal Reserve or shake up its leadership are intensifying amid the president's statements about his desire for lower interest rates. During his 2024 election campaign, Mr. Trump had insisted that as president he should have a \"say\" in the Fed's interest rate policies.",
      "\"I think that, in my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman,\" Mr. Trump said in August.",
      "For his part, Powell said last year that he would not resign\u00a0even if asked to do so by Mr. Trump, adding that under the law presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "However, Mr. Trump has recently fired several government officials in ways that critics say violate the law, such as his administration's firing of more than a dozen federal inspectors general on Friday. Federal law requires the White House to give Congress a full month of warning and case-specific details before firing a federal inspector general.",
      "Removing Powell wouldn't necessarily change the Fed's monetary policy decisions, given that rates are set by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Seven members are from the Fed's Board of Governors; four are assigned from the 11 Reserve Bank presidents, who each serve one-year terms on a rotating basis; and one FOMC member is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Interfering with the Fed could have consequences, both legally and for the stock market, experts said.",
      "\"Should any president attempt to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve without cause other than doing the job they were appointed and confirmed to do, I expect there to be swift legal challenges,\" noted Tim Stretton at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government watchdog. \"I suspect the market would also react negatively. Markets like stability, and this level of unprecedented interference in the Federal Reserve would be anything but stable.\"",
      "Asked what advice he would give Mr. Trump about dealing with the Fed, Columbia Business School's House said, \"Stop talking.\"",
      "He added, \"Let the Fed conduct its business consistent with its mandate, and it'll be more likely to get interest rates down.\"",

The battalion was active in the Mediterranean Theater, which included Italy, northern Africa and the Middle East.",

After making his way ashore, Bryant engaged in fighting near the Chiunzi Pass on the Sorrento Peninsula, the DPAA said. On Sept. 23, he was reported missing in action after encountering a four-man patrol near Pietre, Italy.",
      "Bryant's body was not recovered, and German forces never reported him as a prisoner of war, the DPAA said. The War Department declared him non-recoverable on July 19, 1949. A formal telegram informed his parents he was killed in action, according to a local newspaper clipping shared by the DPAA. He was survived by his parents, five brothers and his wife, according to the clipping. He was awarded a posthumous Purple Heart, according to another news clipping. Bryant's name was recorded on the Walls of the Missing at the Sicily-Rome American Cemetery in Nettuno, Italy.",
      "After World War II, the American Graves Registration began working to recover missing American personnel from around the world. In 1947, investigators from the registration found remains in a cemetery in the Italian village of San Nicola. The remains were designated as X-152 Naples, and since the remains could not be associated with nearby casualties, they were interred under that name at the Sicily-Rome American Cemetery.",
      "In 2019, a DPAA historian studying American losses during Operation AVALANCHE compiled multiple records that showed Bryant was likely lost near where the X-152 remains had been discovered. In 2022, the remains were disinterred and sent to the DPAA laboratory for identification.",
      "Scientists with the DPAA used anthropological and dental analysis to study the remains. Mitochondrial DNA analysis and circumstantial evidence were also used to confirm the remains as Bryant's. Descendants of World War II Rangers Inc., Associazione Salerno 1943, and the staff of the National Archives at College Park also provided \"research assistance,\" the DPAA said.",

      "Washington \u2014 The top federal prosecutor in South Florida is asking a federal appeals court to toss out the classified documents case against President Trump's former co-defendants, aide Walt Nauta and former Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos de Oliveira.",
      "Acting U.S. Attorney Hayden O'Byrne made the request to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit on Wednesday, which lawyers for Nauta and de Oliveira do not oppose. It's likely the Atlanta-based appeals court will grant the request, bringing the case initially brought by former special counsel Jack Smith to a close.",
      "Nauta and de Oliveira were charged alongside Mr. Trump in 2023 with allegedly helping obstruct the Justice Department probe into the president's handling of sensitive government documents after the end of his first term in January 2021.",
      "The prosecution was brought by Smith, who resigned as special counsel before Mr. Trump returned to the White House. The special counsel claimed the president unlawfully held onto sensitive government after returning to his South Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, after leaving the White House four years ago, and accused Nauta and de Oliveira of working with Mr. Trump to conceal information from the Justice Department.",
      "The three co-defendants pleaded not guilty. The charges were then dismissed by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon last July on the grounds that Smith was unlawfully appointed. The special counsel appealed the decision to the 11th Circuit.",
      "Following Mr. Trump's election in November, Smith successfully sought to remove him from the case because of a longstanding Justice Department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president. But the appeal was continuing as to Nauta and de Oliveira.",
      "The former special counsel accused the two allies of Mr. Trump of attempting to interfere with the federal probe. Their attorneys fought the charges and resisted the Justice Department's previous efforts to keep the cases moving forward on appeal after Mr. Trump's election win.",
      "Should the judges agree to close the case, a major impediment to the public release of Smith's report summarizing the classified documents investigation would be eliminated. Former Attorney General Merrick Garland agreed to keep the volume of Smith's report that dealt with the case under seal as the appeal progressed.

    "story": [
      "Hamas will release three Israelis, including two women and an 80-year-old man, as well as five Thai nationals during the next hostage release, slated for Thursday, officials from Israel and Hamas said.",
      "The officials named the Israeli women as Arbel Yehoud, 29, Agam Berger, 19, and the man as Gadi Moses, 80. The officials, who spoke to The Associated Press on Wednesday on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media, said the hostages' families had approved the publication of their names.",
      "The identities of the Thai nationals were not immediately known. A number of foreign workers were taken captive along with dozens of Israeli civilians and soldiers during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that set off the war in Gaza.",
      "There are 89 hostages \u2014 both living and dead \u2014 still in Gaza, according to Israeli officials, including seven dual U.S. nationals: Keith Siegel, 65, from Chapel Hill, North Carolina; Sagui Dekel-Chen, 35, who grew up in Bloomfield, Connecticut; and Edan Alexander, 19, from Tenafly, New Jersey. Four other Americans are believed to have been killed. It remains unclear when any of the Americans might be released.",
      "Thursday's expected release will keep up the momentum of the fragile ceasefire between Israel and the militant Hamas group that began earlier this month and which paused the 15-monthlong war in Gaza. As part of the deal, Hamas is releasing hostages in phases in exchange for freedom for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.",
      "President Trump's Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, was in Israel on Wednesday and met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who heads to Washington next week to meet with Mr. Trump \u2014 the first foreign leader to meet the president in his second term in office.",

      "Israel had demanded that Yehoud, a civilian, be part of that group and when she wasn't freed, Israel held up the movement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians looking to return to what is left of their homes in the war-battered north of Gaza.",
      "International mediation efforts brought about the additional release on Thursday and cleared the way for Palestinians to stream north. Another release is slated for Saturday, which Netanyahu's office said would free male hostages.

      "Earlier Wednesday, Egypt, an important U.S. ally, rejected Mr. Trump's suggestion.",
      "The idea has long been rejected by the two countries and the Palestinians themselves because they say it would undermine the notion of Palestinian statehood and foment instability in their states.",
      "Mr. Trump on Saturday said he would urge Egypt and Jordan to accept people from Gaza so that \"we just clean out that whole thing,\" calling the territory \"a demolition site.\"",

      "In his first public comments since Mr. Trump floated the suggestion Saturday, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi called the idea \"an injustice\" which Egypt would not be party to.",

The Office of Management and Budget and the U.S. Agency of International Development (USAID) have not responded to questions from CBS News.

      "In the Chinese zodiac, each new year, according to the lunar calendar, is associated with one of 12 animals, and 2025 marks the Year of the Snake. Different regions in Asia may not follow the same zodiac observed in China, and many Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders do not observe the Chinese zodiac, said the art museum.",
      "What is the Lunar New Year?",
      "Lunar New Year begins on the lunar calendar's first new moon and continues through the first full moon, which falls 15 days later.",
      "The new moon usually happens at some point between mid-January and early February \u2014 so the start of the new year begins different days depending on the year.",

      "The lunar calendar, unlike the Gregorian calendar, uses the phases of the moon to delineate days, weeks and months of the year. A lunar month is the period of time from one new moon to the next \u2014 about 29.5 days \u2014 so the lunar calendar doesn't precisely align with the common one where most months span 30 or 31 days.",
      "The Chinese government\u00a0officially adopted the solar Gregorian calendar\u00a0more than a century ago to align with the rest of the world.

      "How to celebrate Lunar New Year",
      "Commemorated through 15 days of cultural festivities, Lunar New Year activities are often centered around various forms of art and cuisine, which can be enjoyed at home and in public forums. Experts say the core focus of Lunar New Year celebrations is to bring families together.",
      "Mario Poceski, a professor of Buddhist studies and Chinese religions at the University of Florida who wrote about Lunar New Year celebrations in The Conversation last year, said holiday traditions typically involve cleaning and decorating the house, shopping for gifts and preparing food for family gatherings, like a traditional dinner held on the eve of the new year.",
      "\"Many of the dishes are assigned symbolic meanings,\" Poceski wrote. \"For instance, dumplings are given the shape of gold ingots to invoke good fortune.\"",
      "Exchanging red envelopes, which contain money, is another popular custom that's carried out each Lunar New Year. The envelopes' red color is featured prominently in decorations for the holiday and represents prosperity and good fortune, Poceski said, adding that older members of the family usually gift them to younger members.",
      "Parades, carnivals and gatherings featuring fireworks, dances and other cultural performances are often staples of Lunar New Year celebrations, as individual residences, shops and markets decorate with lanterns or dragons made from red paper in honor of the holiday.",
      "In Beijing, crowds of people filled a park for a \"temple fair\" Wednesday, with some ringing bells and tossing coins into containers shaped like gold bars for good luck, the Associated Press reported.",
      "In Malaysia, revelers rang in the new year with firecrackers in Kuala Lumpur, the capital city, while Russians cheered for a musical procession in Moscow Tuesday night that commenced a 10-day Lunar New Year festival, according to the AP.",
      "One of many U.S. cities paying homage to the holiday, businesses in Denver kicked off the Lunar New Year with spreads of traditional cuisine and merchandise.",
      "\"To celebrate the cultural side, the celebration of just welcoming in a new year, a vibrant year full of good luck and change,\" Mimi Luong, the co-owner of Denver gift shop Truong An Gifts, told CBS News Colorado this week of her family's celebrations and the store's public observance.",
      "\"Every year, we celebrate with decorating our home with lots of red and gold, and eating long noodles so we can have long life, and dumplings so we can have abundance,\" Luong said.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 12:16:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Local officials in Samoa don't blame Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's HHS pick, for measles deaths, but critics call his actions \"harmful.\"",
    "story": [
      "As U.S. senators grill Robert F. Kennedy Jr. this week, President Trump's pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services is facing sharp questions about his actions in an island nation half a world away.",
      "Kennedy's 2019 visit to Samoa has recently brought fresh attention to his history of activism focused on raising questions about the safety and effectiveness of the measles vaccine \u2014 because his trip came just months before a devastating measles outbreak that claimed 83 lives, many of them young children.",
      "\"It was very sad,\" Dr. Take Naseri, Samoa's health chief at the time, told CBS News. \"It's one of those things you don't want to revisit.\"",
      "Kennedy has maintained that he had \"nothing to do\" with the people of Samoa resisting vaccines.",
      "\"I had nothing to do with people not vaccinating in Samoa,\" he said in an interview\u00a0with documentary producer Scott Hamilton Kennedy. \"I never told anyone not to vaccinate.\"",
      "But some of Kennedy's critics assert he bears a measure of responsibility for the outbreak and that he leveraged the tragedy to promote false claims about the vaccine. Democrats have seized on the episode, even sponsoring advertising that calls out his visit.",
      "What happened in Samoa?",
      "Years before Kennedy trained his focus on vaccine issues in Samoa, the small Pacific island nation had been experiencing low vaccination rates. Medical professionals attributed this to a shortage of doctors and nurses as well as demographic shifts, with more people moving to cities and away from social structures that helped promote childhood vaccinations. By 2017, only about half of 1-year-old Samoan children were fully vaccinated \u2014 far below the 95% coverage needed to prevent community spread and a steep drop from earlier rates that had reportedly reached 90%.",
      "The situation took a tragic turn in July 2018 when two nurses mistakenly combined an expired muscle relaxant with MMR vaccine doses instead of sterile water, leading to the deaths of two children. The nurses were charged with manslaughter, and the government responded by suspending the national vaccination program for 10 months. Vaccination rates for children dropped to 31%.",
      "Naseri, the former Samoan health chief, told CBS News that the government had struggled to implement an effective vaccine program. He said the mishandling of the vaccine and its tragic consequences \"was the last straw.\"",
      "\"It created more hesitancy,\" Naseri said.",
      "Mistrust in vaccines spread across the island like a virus. At the time, even the prime minister issued a statement on Facebook alleging that his grandson had been injured by a vaccine. The temporary suspension of vaccinations corresponded with a growing distrust in modern medicine.",
      "\"I would rather treat them at home with old-fashioned herbal medicines than taking them to see a doctor,\" one mother told local reporters at the time. \"Since children died from these vaccines, I don't trust any medication from the hospital.\"",
      "Patricia Stinchfield, a nurse practitioner and past president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, said she had been monitoring the Samoan vaccine crisis even before the measles outbreak struck. She says the immunization rates had dropped so low the situation was \"a ticking time bomb.\"",
      "It was in the midst of that \"perfect storm,\" Stinchfield said, that Kennedy arrived in Samoa in the summer of 2019. Kennedy has said the purpose of his visit was to pitch a health surveillance system, and that the vaccination pause in 2018 was an opportunity to naturally study an unvaccinated population. His trip was coordinated by a local anti-vaccine advocate known for spreading medical misinformation online.",
      "Dr. Naseri told CBS News he met briefly with Kennedy but their conversation focused on environmental and vaccine safety issues.",
      "In August 2019, two months after Kenendy's visit, an infected traveler from New Zealand arrived in Samoa and the deadly measles virus began its spread. The government officially declared an outbreak on Oct. 16 and a month later declared a state of emergency.",
      "It wasn't until early December that the Samoan government conceded it had mishandled immunizations and launched an aggressive vaccination campaign, making the shots mandatory. Dr. Naseri said that delayed response may have contributed to the high infection and death rates. But finally, the country shut down for two days to allow health workers to vaccinate people at home, quickly achieving 90% coverage.",
      "Hundreds of medical professionals from around the world responded and traveled to Samoa to help with the vaccination efforts, including Hawaii's lieutenant governor, now Gov. Josh Green.",
      "\"The government needed the political will, and the international community backed us up,\" Naseri said.",
      "CBS News visited Samoa during that response and met one parent named Paulo Puelua, who said the measles outbreak took hold of his family in an instant, killing three of his five children. Their mother Fa'oso was so distraught that she had been sleeping on her children's grave, set up in the family's front yard according to Samoan tradition. She told CBS News she felt it was her only way to be close to them now.",
      "Looking back, officials told CBS News they believe the outbreak's high death toll resulted from multiple factors, including widespread malnutrition, reliance on traditional medicine, and an overwhelmed health care system. In rural Samoa, many families share a single sleeping space, making transmission easier, and nearly a quarter of the population lives in poverty, further complicating treatment.",
      "Controversy about RFK Jr.'s role",
      "Dr. Paul Offit is a vaccine specialist and co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine. He's also director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He's been a frequent critic of Kennedy's and believes the nominee for health secretary deserves harsh judgment for how the outbreak unfolded.",
      "Offit says Kennedy had been posting about the two deaths before it was understood what had happened, and blamed the MMR vaccine. When that turned out not to be the case, Kennedy did not correct that false assertion.",
      "\"If he was any kind of man, which he isn't, he should go back to Samoa and apologize to every one of the families where a child died,\" Offit said. \"He's a famous man who goes there and meets with anti-vaccine activists. He gives them credence by going there.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to Kennedy for comment through the organization he led until last month, Children's Health Defense, and did not receive a reply. The group has previously denied his visit played any role in the outbreak.",
      "In interviews, Samoan health officials told CBS News they believe Kennedy's actions were unlikely to have directly influenced what occurred.",
      "\"It is well documented that RFK Jnr's visit to Samoa in 2019 coincided with increased anti-vaccine sentiment, particularly among certain groups,\" Samoa's Ministry of Health said in a statement. \"However, there is no conclusive evidence that his visit directly contributed to the decline in vaccination rates or the subsequent measles outbreak.\"",
      "But in the midst of the island's state of emergency, Kennedy sent a letter to the Samoan prime minister suggesting a defective vaccine may have been responsible for causing infections \u2014 a theory that has been debunked.",
      "\"It is critical that the Samoan Health Ministry determine, scientifically, if the outbreak was caused by inadequate vaccine coverage or alternatively, by a defective vaccine,\" Kennedy wrote in the Nov. 19, 2019 letter. Kennedy's letter partly leans on an idea that appears to have originated from misinformation widely spread on social media during a 2014-2015 measles outbreak at Disneyland that inaccurately said that measles originating from the vaccine had been identified.",
      "Stinchfield says this is impossible based on the weakened nature of the virus in the vaccine. In very rare cases people may exhibit symptoms similar to those associated with measles but no cases have ever been documented of measles being spread as a result.",
      "After the Samoan infections, critics say Kennedy downplayed the outbreak's severity in blog posts and continued to suggest that the vaccine itself was responsible for the high death rate. He was joined by Del Bigtree, a prominent anti-vaccine activist and Kennedy ally, in pushing conspiracy theories surrounding the outbreak.",
      "Stinchfield says the claims they pushed remained unsupported by evidence. And eventually, the Samoan government stopped listening.",
      "Samoa has since achieved high vaccination rates and the World Health Organization says the country has reported no measles cases since 2020. However, vaccine hesitancy remains a challenge globally, with anti-vaccine activists continuing to spread fear and misinformation.",
      "Samoa's Health Ministry says it remains concerned about \"the global spread of vaccine misinformation and the potential consequences of RFK Jnr.'s influence, particularly if he assumes a leadership role in public health policy. The spread of anti-vaccine narratives has already contributed to outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases in multiple countries, reversing decades of progress in immunization efforts.\"",
      "Stinchfield said she believes misinformation spread by Kennedy and others \u2014 in Samoa, and during the years since \u2014 remains acutely dangerous.",
      "\"Their modus operandi is to take a little kernel of truth and spin it around and confuse people, spin it at a time where the fear is already so high,\" she said. \"That is disinformation, a weapon that will harm people, harm children.\"",

      "A soldier who went missing in action during an aquatic mission in World War II has been accounted for, military officials said Tuesday.",
      "U.S. Army Pfc. Robert L. Bryant, 23, was assigned to Company B, in the 4th Ranger Battalion, as part of a group known as Darby's Rangers, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said. The battalion was trained by Colonel William Darby, who also established a battalion that would later grow into the modern-day United States Army Rangers, the military said. The battalion was active in the Mediterranean Theater, which included Italy, northern Africa and the Middle East.",
      "Bryant was one of 170,000 Allied servicemen who f6participated in Operation AVALANCHE, when forces invaded Italy in a series of amphibious landings between Sept. 9 and Sept. 18, 1943. After making his way ashore, Bryant engaged in fighting near the Chiunzi Pass on the Sorrento Peninsula, the DPAA said. On Sept. 23, he was reported missing in action after encountering a four-man patrol near Pietre, Italy.",
      "Bryant's body was not recovered, and German forces never reported him as a prisoner of war, the DPAA said. The War Department declared him non-recoverable on July 19, 1949. A formal telegram informed his parents he was killed in action, according to a local newspaper clipping shared by the DPAA. He was survived by his parents, five brothers and his wife, according to the clipping. He was awarded a posthumous Purple Heart, according to another news clipping. Bryant's name was recorded on the Walls of the Missing at the Sicily-Rome American Cemetery in Nettuno, Italy.",
      "After World War II, the American Graves Registration began working to recover missing American personnel from around the world. In 1947, investigators from the registration found remains in a cemetery in the Italian village of San Nicola. The remains were designated as X-152 Naples, and since the remains could not be associated with nearby casualties, they were interred under that name at the Sicily-Rome American Cemetery.",
      "In 2019, a DPAA historian studying American losses during Operation AVALANCHE compiled multiple records that showed Bryant was likely lost near where the X-152 remains had been discovered. In 2022, the remains were disinterred and sent to the DPAA laboratory for identification.",
      "Scientists with the DPAA used anthropological and dental analysis to study the remains. Mitochondrial DNA analysis and circumstantial evidence were also used to confirm the remains as Bryant's. Descendants of World War II Rangers Inc., Associazione Salerno 1943, and the staff of the National Archives at College Park also provided \"research assistance,\" the DPAA said.",
      "Bryant's surviving family members were informed of his identification. A rosette will be placed next to his name on the Walls of the Missing at the Sicily-Rome American Cemetery to indicate that he has been accounted for, the DPAA said, and he will be buried in April 2025.",

      "Butt captioned a video of the event \"it's raining gifts,\" racking up nearly 10 million views. Faisal Mushtaq, an inspector from the Punjab provincial wildlife department, said authorities learned about the animal through social media.",
      "The cub was given to him by Umar Dolla, who runs another YouTube channel called Lion Hub, the BBC reported. Dolla claimed in court that he was still the animal's legal owner, but the judge ruled it had been seized by Butt, local media reported.",
      "The morning after the wedding, police raided his house, confiscated the cub and kept the newlywed in custody overnight. They said they found the lion cub roaming around the garage. Mushtaq described the animal as \"in a poor condition, as it was very cold.\"",

      "The coins are thousands of years old, the Netherlands' Cultural Heritage Agency said in a news release, and are a mix of Roman and British coins. Bunnik, the village where they were buried, was once along the northern border of the Roman Empire. It's the first time such a find has been made on the European mainland, the agency said, with the only other comparable discovery having been made in Great Britain.",
      "Two metal detectorists made the discovery, then formally reported the coins to authorities. An archaeologist then examined the findings to confirm their veracity, and a larger excavation was conducted.",
      "The majority of the artifacts were Roman coins dated between 46 and 47 A.D., around the end of the first Roman conquests in Britain, and were primarily stamped with the portrait of the Emperor Claudius. Nearly 300 of the Roman coins are silver denarii,\u00a0minted between 200 B.C. and 47 A.D. Some of those coins are stamped with unique portraits, including several of Julius Caesar and one with the face of Juba, the king of a Northern African region that is present-day Algeria, according to a news release from the National Museum of Antiquities in the Netherlands.",
      "Also found among the Roman coins were 72 gold aurei, dated from 18 B.C. to 47 A.D. Those coins show no signs of wear and likely came from a pile of freshly minted coins, according to the Cultural Heritage Agency.",
      "Several dozen other coins, made of an alloy of gold, silver and copper, come from what is now Great Britain and were stamped with the face of the Celtic king Cunobelinus, who reigned between 9 and 40 A.D. The king's name was also inscribed on the coins, known as \"staters.\"",
      "Roman soldiers returning home likely carried the coins from Britain to Bunnik, the agency said. The British coins may have been spoils of war, while the Roman coins were likely being carried as currency. They may have been buried to hide them temporarily, or as an offering to the gods, possibly as \"an expression of gratitude to the gods for a safe return from battle,\" the agency said.",

The limes existed from 83 to about 260 A.D., according to the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, and separated the empire from Germanic tribes. The coins show that Roman troops returning from Britain used these points as a route to return home.",

    "summary": "Lawmakers and experts say China's DeepSeek AI app could expose U.S. users to risks and promote censorship.",
    "story": [
      "As Chinese AI application DeepSeek attracts hordes of American users, Trump administration officials, lawmakers and cybersecurity experts are expressing concern that the technology could pose a threat to U.S. national security.",
      "DeepSeek's introduction in the U.S. on Monday saw it quickly become the most downloaded free application in the country on Apple's app store. The rollout also rocked Wall Street as investors struggled to compute the sudden appearance of a low-cost, open-source generative AI tool able to compete with leading artificial intelligence apps such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Shares of Nvidia, the U.S. manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, plummeted 17%, chopping roughly $600 billion off its market value \u2014 a record single-day drop for a U.S. stock.",
      "That explosive debut was branded a \"wake-up call\" by President Trump on Monday. Addressing reporters on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the National Security Council (NSC) would examine the potential national security implications around DeepSeek's launch, noting that the administration would seek to \"ensure American AI dominance.\"",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "Some lawmakers also weighed in with concerns about the application's access to U.S. users.",
      "\"The U.S. cannot allow Chinese Communist Party models such as DeepSeek to risk our national security and leverage our technology to advance their AI ambitions,\" Rep. John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said Tuesday in a statement shared on social media. \"We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek's AI infrastructure.\"",
      "The spotlight on DeepSeek comes amid rising tensions over trade, technology and other issues between the two superpowers. The U.S. has already imposed significant export controls on China in an effort to rein in Beijing's production of semiconductors used in developing advanced AI, with the most recent curbs coming in\u00a0December.",
      "\"At the President's direction, the NSC and others in the U.S. government work in many ways to address concerns involving AI, China and data security,\" agency spokesperson Brian Hughes told CBS News in an email. \"As the President has underscored, U.S. policy is to ensure that the United States leads the world in AI.\"",
      "Security threat for users",
      "While the calls from Moolenaar could be the first inkling of a possible congressional crackdown, Ross Burley \u2014 a co-founder of the nonprofit Centre for Information Resilience \u2014 warned that DeepSeek's emergence in the U.S. raises data security and privacy issues for users. Chinese law grants Beijing broad authority to access data from companies based in China.",
      "\"More and more people will use it, and that will open the door to more and more personal data just being given away to the [Chinese Communist Party] and being sent basically to mainland China to be able to inform them of their activities,\" Burley told CBS News.",
      "\"What they'll use it for is behavior change campaigns, disinformation campaigns, for really targeted messaging as to what Western audiences like, what they do,\" he added.",
      "DeepSeek, which is based in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, notes in its privacy policy that the personal information it collects from users is held \"on secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Under that\u00a0policy, the company says it collects information including users' \"device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, and system language.\" DeepSeek also collects \"service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs,\" according to the company.",
      "A key difference from TikTok",
      "The fact that DeepSeek's servers are based in mainland China differentiates it from TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform that Congress had sought to ban on national security grounds before President Trump signed an executive order last week directing the Justice Department to not enforce the law for a period of 75 days.",
      "In an effort to mitigate U.S. regulatory concerns, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in 2022 moved all of its U.S. data to infrastructure owned by American software maker Oracle.",
      "The legislation banning TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April \u2014 grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on tech platforms owned by countries regarded as U.S. adversaries.",
      "Under that law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content; has more than 1 million monthly active users; is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country; and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "But DeepSeek may be seen as less of a threat given that, unlike TikTok, it is an open-source large language model, according to Matt Sheehan, a China fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\"[A] lot of these open-source apps, open-source models, you can actually sort of use them directly on other platforms. Perplexity is a major U.S. AI company, and they're currently using a version of DeepSeek that you can use that doesn't have the data privacy or security threats,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Advancing censorship?",
      "One issue that DeepSeek users face outside of China: censorship. For example, a CBS News analysis of the application found that DeepSeek did not return any results for a prompt seeking information bout the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre in Beijing.",
      "Burley of the Centre for Information Resilience thinks such suppression of information on an app being downloaded by millions of users will pressure policymakers to act.",
      "\"I think it's incumbent on Western governments \u2014 the U.K., Canada, the U.S. \u2014 to look and see if it is wise for the Apple store and the Android store to host this large language model when it is so clearly being curated to push Chinese narratives and censorship,\" he said.",

      "One of them is really disgusting",
      "As her character Carol Seaver on television's, \"Growing Pains\" dealt with the perils of adolescence, actress Tracey Gold struggled with her own problem: a debilitating eating disorder.",
      "The studio's actions - which included asking her to lose weight and subsequently gain some back, as well as writing jokes about her weight into the show - made it difficult for Gold to separate herself from her character. However, in the same way art influenced reality, Gold says it was her TV mother, Joanna Kerns, who would ultimately look out for her, pressuring the crew to help get her healthy.",
      "After three seasons, Gold noticed the writing on the show \"became a little edgier,\" as the program angled to \"be funnier\" and \"stay on top.\"",

      "Joanna Kerns, left, and Tracey Gold starred as Maggie and Carol Seaver on \"Growing Pains.\" (ABC Photo Archives/Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty Images)",
      "\"Unfortunately, I think in that time it became at my expense, and it became because they started to have Mike Seaver make fat jokes about Carol Seaver,\" she said of Kirk Cameron's character, who played Gold's older brother on the show, during an episode of the late Shannen Doherty's podcast, \"Let's Be Clear.\"",
      "A member of the cast, but only a child, Gold said she felt she did not have much say in the direction of her character. \"One thing you have to know about being a child actor. I always say this when I talk to kids who want to be child actors, I'm like, you have to be the best person on that set. You watch the adults messing up. You watch the adults, you know, laughing, forgetting their lines. They are allowed to do that. You, as a child actor, you need to get there. You need to know your lines. You shut your mouth and you do your job,\" she explained.",
      "Tracey Gold said that her character Carol started being the butt of Kirk Cameron's jokes, who played her older brother Mike. (ABC Photo Archives/Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty Images)",
      "\"The ambiance on a set is that way. So when these jokes would come in, I really had no voice, so I would sort of just be like, I don't think I'm allowed to say anything. But I had power, a little bit, because Carol Seaver was all of a sudden, she was mine and I had created her and I was known for her, so all of a sudden I also felt protective of her a little bit.\"",
      "Gold said at the time, she was not hyper-fixated on her weight, so jokes were easier to accept, although after going on hiatus one summer, things changed. \"I came [back with] the freshman 15 basically, and then the jokes accelerated when I came back and became meaner,\" she recalled. \"It was out of my character to speak up, but it was hurting me, and I was sensitive to it. And I knew I had gained a little bit of weight, and I had never had that problem before.\"",

      "Although she had struggled in the past with disordered eating, the catalyst then had been different. \"It was about staying childlike, you know, scared of hitting puberty.\"",
      "Gold found herself negotiating with the crew, many of whom were men. \"Whether I like it or not. The set did have an element of misogyny to it because they're always bringing in the beautiful actress of the week \u2026 a few years older than me and coming in and, you know, dolling them up and sexualizing that and all of those things,\" she said. \"It was a boys club. It really was a boys club.\"",
      "\"They would say, you don't have any brothers, so you don't know what this is like. This is what brothers and sisters do to each other,\" said Gold, who grew up with four sisters. Although the jokes continued to hurt, \"It'd be like a joke like, \u2018Here comes wide load.\u2019 And you're not talking just about Carol anymore. You're talking about me, Tracey Gold. And now I have to be in front of an audience that's laughing at me and my body and my weight.\"",
      "Tracey Gold says the show asked her to first lose weight and then gain it. (ABC Photo Archives/Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty Images)",
      "The studio eventually called Gold's father, who was her agent, and requested she lose weight.",
      "\"That was a blow,\" Gold said, who would end up on a 500 calorie diet. \"So within a month I had lost 20 pounds. Easily,\" she said. \"I did it and I did it quietly, and I didn't tell anyone I was doing it. I just went and did it. And all of a sudden, everybody's coming up to me on the set, you know, everywhere, kind of going, \u2018Oh my god, you look so good, you look so beautiful, you look so amazing.\u2019\"",
      "\"At that time, I think everybody \u2026 meant well, but in my view of it, it was like, was I that embarrassing before? Was I absolutely kidding myself that I could go on National TV, be Carol Seaver, and I really was that person they were saying those jokes about?\"",

      "\"I would make negotiations with myself. But as I'm doing this, I'm getting lower and lower and lower and lower in weight. But you know, you're in Hollywood, and everybody just kept giving me compliments. And it was making [my then-boyfriend] furious that everybody was complimenting me because he knew I was sick,\" she said of her husband Roby Marshall, whom she was introduced to by Kerns.

And it put me into a tailspin that I just found I couldn't get out of. You know, people asked me, did I think it was a cry for help? No, I don't. I think it was a really internal thing. I don't think I wanted help at that point. I wanted to keep myself safe and protected. It was a self-coping mechanism to keep myself safe,\" she explained.",
      "\"I became very, very, very self-protective of myself and I kept continuing to lose weight. And I remember - and it was the irony of all ironies - they basically said to me, they called my dad once again, this is a few months later, and they say, 'We need Tracey to gain weight. She's getting too thin on camera. She's looking not healthy.'\"",
      "Tracey Gold met her husband Roby while filming the show. He quickly learned of her eating disorder and took matters into his own hands. (ABC Photo Archives/Disney General Entertainment Content via Getty Images)",
      "Although she tried to get healthy, Gold said it was too late.",
      "\"I had taken to throwing up and stuff,\" she admitted. \"I remember [Marshall] came one day to my dressing room and he nailed the bathroom door shut. He went to the prop department \u2026 He's like, \u2018I need a nail and hammer' \u2026 And they're like, \u2018Why?\u2019 And he's like, \u2018I'm gonna nail Tracey\u2019s bathroom shut.' And they're like, \u2018Thank you. Thank you for looking after her. We're so worried about her.'\"",
      "At one point, Gold went on vacation with Marshall to Florida, and the expectation on set was she would return healthier. \"He thought he could take me out of California or Los Angeles and I could suddenly eat. But I couldn't,\" she said. Unfortunately, she contracted bronchitis and lost even more weight. A doctor ended up coming to the set and sending her home.",
      "\"I'm like, OK, that's fine, I'm sick. I don't feel like being there anyway,\" she said of being sent home. \"And they're like, she needs to go somewhere before she comes back on the set. And I didn't know, till years later, but it was Joanna Kerns, god bless her\u2026she called the studio and she said, this girl's gonna die on your watch if you don't step in and do something.

The only person that would speak to me from a pay phone was my husband. Everybody else would hang up on me because they were told to hang up. I mean they thought they were doing the right thing. And I took a week to find the right doctor. And I go to doctors, I tell them what I was going through and, because it was so public, it was like living in a fishbowl. And it broke the news and everything like that,\" she said of her health becoming tabloid fodder.",

I always say no, because I was the one that was very susceptible to it. I think if I had been on the cheerleading team and a cheerleading coach had said the same thing to me, I think that would happen to me, I would have gone down a road of restriction. And you know, was it magnified because I was on TV? Possibly. I'll never know.\"",

      "\"Based on other research, we think that likely reasons are to do with unmet support needs around mental health, risky behaviors and addictive behaviors, all of which are higher in people with ADHD and can lead to suicide and addictions and can convey health risks,\" senior author Josh Stott, professor of psychology and language sciences at UCL, told Fox News Digital.",
      "ADHD NOW AFFECTS 15.5 MILLION US ADULTS, SAYS NEW CDC REPORT",
      "Another factor may be that society is not set up for people who have different ways of processing information (neurodivergent as opposed to neurotypical), Stott noted.",

      "For women with ADHD, life expectancy was shortened by 6.5 to 11 years, the researchers determined. (iStock)",

      "The doctor reiterated that the study points to several lifestyle factors contributing to mortality, such as higher rates of smoking, substance use, poor sleep habits and high-risk behaviors resulting in accidents.",
      "\"This indicates that premature death is not caused by ADHD itself, but rather by the effects of untreated symptoms that are potentially preventable.\"",
      "What can be done?",
      "To help reduce ADHD-associated mortality, Stott emphasized the need to provide healthcare systems and interventions that are adapted for people with ADHD and other neurodiverse people, which could require special training and research.",

      "Reasons for rising cases",
      "One in 45 adults in the U.S. are diagnosed with autism, Shih noted \u2014 more than ever before.",

      "A new scam has come to light targeting residents across the United States with text messages that pretend to be from toll road operators. For many who receive these messages, it\u2019s an easy and expensive trap to fall into.",
      "The scam begins when people receive a message claiming they have unpaid tolls and may be charged fines. Scammers then ask for card details and a one-time password sent via SMS to steal their money. Security researchers believe that Chinese smishing groups are behind this scam, selling SMS-based phishing kits to thousands of scammers.",

      "As reported by\u00a0KrebsOnSecurity, the scam begins with a text message claiming to be from a toll road operator, such as E-ZPass or SunPass. The message warns about unpaid tolls and the possibility of fines, forcing recipients to act quickly. Victims are directed to a fake website mimicking the toll operator\u2019s site, where they are asked to provide sensitive information, including payment card details and one-time passwords.",
      "Security researchers have traced the scam to Chinese smishing groups known for creating and selling sophisticated SMS phishing kits. One such kit, \"Lighthouse,\" makes it easy for scammers to spoof toll road operators in multiple states. These kits are designed to trick users into sharing financial information, which is then used to commit fraud.",
      "Reports of these phishing attacks have surfaced across the U.S., targeting users of toll systems like EZDriveMA in Massachusetts, SunPass in Florida and the North Texas Toll Authority in Texas.

      "3) Do not share personal information:\u00a0Never provide sensitive details like payment card information, Social Security numbers or one-time passwords via text or unverified websites. Legitimate toll operators will not request such information through SMS.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Use\u00a02FA for your accounts whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of protection by requiring two forms of verification, reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if some details are compromised.",
      "5) Be wary of urgency in messages:\u00a0Scammers often create a sense of urgency, claiming immediate action is required to avoid penalties. Take a moment to assess the situation and verify the legitimacy of the message through official channels.",
      "6) Report suspicious messages:\u00a0If you suspect a phishing attempt, report it to the Federal Trade Commission or the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center. Include details like the sender\u2019s phone number and any links in the message. Additionally, inform your mobile carrier to help block similar scams.",
      "7) Use a personal data removal service: Employ a reputable data removal service to reduce your online footprint and minimize the risk of scammers obtaining your personal information. These services can help remove your data from various data broker sites, making it harder for scammers to target you with personalized scams. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

At best, identity theft will steal away your time and patience. But more often, identity theft leads to severe consequences, like losing control over your financial accounts, having your credit score affected or even losing lifelong savings.",

      "With so much of our lives having moved online, identity thieves are having an easier time than ever. Your most important accounts \u2013 banking, credit, Social Security \u2013 are all digital. Thieves don\u2019t need to know much about you to steal your identity, just a few pieces of personal information can be enough. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics,\u00a024 million Americans reported identity theft in the past 12 months. In their lifetime,\u00a01 in 3 Americans (more than 110 million people) have experienced identity theft. Here\u2019s the part many people don\u2019t realize: You might have already been a target. Maybe your identity was stolen, and the thieves failed, or maybe your good online habits saved you without you even knowing, which brings us to the next lesson: prevention.",

Even if a thief has your password, they won\u2019t be able to log in without a second step, like a code sent via text message or app-based verification.

      "Another sneaky tactic is\u00a0phishing, where scammers trick you into giving away your card info by posing as legitimate companies via emails or fake websites.",

With four out of five American adults owning at least one credit card, the report found that three in five cardholders have faced unauthorized charges \u2014 an estimated 128 million victims. Even more concerning, 75% of these victims reported having their credit card information stolen more than once.",
      "The typical unauthorized transaction is around $100, which adds up to approximately $5 billion in criminal purchases each year. Interestingly, most unauthorized transactions involve credit cards that weren\u2019t physically lost or stolen, highlighting the growing risks of online fraud and data breaches.",

      "The need for identity theft protection",
      "Data breaches are one of the main ways credit card fraud happens. Hackers often get unauthorized access to sensitive information stored by businesses or institutions. When a retailer, financial institution or online store experiences a data breach, the hackers usually go after the payment systems where customer credit card details are kept.",
      "If these systems aren\u2019t properly secured, hackers can grab things like credit card numbers, expiration dates and sometimes even security codes. Once they have that info, they can either use it themselves or sell it to others.",
      "But it\u2019s not just credit card information at risk.\u00a0Data breaches can also expose personal details like names, email addresses and phone numbers. Scammers can then use this stolen info to launch phishing attacks, pretending to be trusted companies and tricking you into giving away more sensitive information.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "This is why identity theft monitoring is so important. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of some identity theft protection services is that they have identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees\u00a0and a white glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",

      "10 ways to protect yourself from credit card fraud",
      "1. Notify your credit card issuer immediately: If you notice fraudulent charges on your credit card, start by calling the number on the back of your credit card. From there, you should get more detailed information on what to do next.",
      "2. Monitor your statements regularly: One of the best ways to catch credit card fraud early is to keep an eye on your statements. Review your transactions regularly to spot any unfamiliar charges. The sooner you notice something suspicious, the quicker you can report it to your credit card company and prevent further damage.",
      "3. Regularly check your credit report: In addition to monitoring your credit card statements, periodically review your credit report to catch any unauthorized accounts opened in your name.",
      "4. Use strong, unique passwords: Always use strong, unique passwords for your online accounts, especially those that store payment details. Avoid using easily guessable information, and consider using a\u00a0password manager to store and generate secure passwords. This reduces the chances of fraudsters accessing your accounts.",
      "5. Use credit card alerts:\u00a0Set up transaction alerts with your credit card company. This way, you\u2019ll receive a notification via email or text for every transaction made with your card. If you receive an alert for a purchase you didn\u2019t make, you can take immediate action to report it and prevent further charges.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "6. Be Cautious with public Wi-Fi:\u00a0Avoid making purchases or entering sensitive information when connected to\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks because they\u2019re often not secure. If you need to make an online purchase while on the go, consider using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to encrypt your connection and keep your credit card details safe from hackers.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "7. Don't store credit card info on browsers and websites:\u00a0Storing your credit card information on browsers or websites can make it convenient, but it also exposes you to a higher risk of fraud. If your browser or the website\u2019s security gets compromised, hackers could gain access to your saved card details. To stay safe, avoid saving your credit card information and manually enter it each time you make a purchase. If a site offers to save your details for future use, think twice before accepting. It's better to take the extra step to enter your information each time, ensuring your data stays secure.",
      "8. Use EMV chip technology: When making in-person purchases, always use the chip reader instead of swiping your card. Chip technology provides an extra layer of security against fraud.",
      "9. Be wary of phishing attempts and have strong antivirus software: Be cautious of unsolicited emails, texts or phone calls asking for your credit card information. Legitimate companies typically don't request sensitive information through these channels. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "10. Keep your card in sight:\u00a0When using your card in restaurants or stores, try to keep it within view. This reduces the risk of someone copying your card details.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It's clear that credit card fraud is more prevalent than ever, affecting millions of Americans each year. The good news is that there are effective steps to protect yourself from becoming a victim. By staying vigilant and employing best practices \u2014 like monitoring your statements and using strong passwords \u2014 you can significantly reduce your risk. Remember, awareness and proactive measures are your best defenses against credit card fraud.",

Earlier this month,\u00a0hackers claimed to have breached Gravy Analytics, a major location data broker and the parent company of Venntel, which is known for selling smartphone location data to U.S. government agencies.",

      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "5 ways to stay safe from unwanted tracking",
      "1. Avoid installing the insurance company\u2019s app:\u00a0Many insurance companies encourage users to download their apps to \"simplify\" claims, payments or policy management. However, these apps often collect and track your location data under the guise of improving their services. If the app is not absolutely essential, manage your account through the company\u2019s website or contact customer service directly instead.",
      "2. Don\u2019t give location permissions unnecessarily:\u00a0When an app requests location access, ask yourself whether it genuinely needs this information to function. For example, a weather app may need approximate location data, but a flashlight app does not.\u00a0 Always choose \"Deny\" or \"Allow only while using the app\" unless absolutely necessary. Most modern devices also allow you to provide an approximate location rather than a precise one, which is a safer option when location access is unavoidable.",
      "3. Review and manage app permissions regularly:\u00a0Over time, you may forget which apps have been granted permissions. Regularly go through your device\u2019s app settings to check and adjust permissions. On most devices, you can access this under\u00a0settings >\u00a0privacy >\u00a0app permissions (specific steps vary by operating system). Revoke access for any apps that don\u2019t need it or seem suspicious.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Turn off location services when not in use:\u00a0Keep location services off when you don\u2019t need them. This reduces the chances of apps or devices tracking you passively in the background. For tasks like mapping or food delivery, turn location services on temporarily, then turn them off when you\u2019re done. For added security, avoid connecting to\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks, which can also be used to track your location indirectly.",
      "5. Use privacy-focused tools and apps: Invest in tools designed to safeguard your privacy. Virtual private networks (VPNs) can mask your location online and prevent unwanted tracking while browsing.\u00a0 VPNs will also protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "BEWARE OF ENCRYPTED PDFS AS THE LATEST TRICK TO DELIVER MALWARE TO YOU",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "If Allstate is indeed unlawfully collecting and selling people\u2019s location data, Attorney General Paxton is right to hold them accountable by filing a lawsuit. In an era where cybercriminals exploit every opportunity to scam individuals, companies that fail to protect customer data are unacceptable and should face consequences. Data has become the new oil, and everyone seems eager to exploit it \u2014 often at the expense of ordinary people. Businesses that prioritize profits over privacy erode trust and put consumers at risk, making it crucial to enforce strict accountability for such practices.",

      "Let\u2019s take a deeper look at five smartphone rules they use that you can, too.",
      "1. Restart your phone once a week",
      "It\u2019s dead simple and absolutely worth doing. Turn off your phone, wait 10 seconds, then turn it back on. This works to combat zero-click exploits where a hacker can get in simply by sending you the right code.",
      "Heads up: A restart won\u2019t work for other types of malware. If your phone becomes infected,\u00a0you\u2019ll need to do a full factory reset.",
      "2. Disable Bluetooth when you don\u2019t need it",
      "Bluetooth works similarly to Wi-Fi and cellular networks but performs simpler tasks at shorter ranges. You don\u2019t need a cellular signal or network connection to use Bluetooth, and it doesn\u2019t use data. And like any other connection, it\u2019s not 100% safe.",
      "A driver is pictured holding an iced coffee and a mobile phone while in the car. (iStock)",
      "Hackers and scammers must be close to you to use Bluetooth to hijack your phone. But in just about any public space, you\u2019re arm\u2019s length from strangers.",
      "The NSA\u2019s advice: Turn off Bluetooth when you\u2019re not using it. It\u2019ll help battery life, too.",
      "On an iPhone, go to Settings > Bluetooth and switch it off. You can also swipe down from the top right of your screen to open the Control Center and tap the Bluetooth icon.The same steps work for Android phones. Go to Settings > Connected Devices > Connection Preferences > Bluetooth and switch it off. (Note: Steps may vary based on your phone\u2019s model. Look or search for Bluetooth if these steps don\u2019t match your phone.)",

      "THE STEP I TAKE TO CLEAR MY INBOX EVERY JANUARY",
      "3. Skip public USB ports",
      "In spaces like the airport or coffee shop, hackers can use them to install malware or steal your data. Now, actual cases of juice jacking are rare in the U.S. but it\u2019s still a real threat. They happen through USB connections, so if a kiosk has actual power outlets to charge your phone using your own adapter, you\u2019re good to go.",
      "Stay away from USB ports of any size, especially when traveling overseas. USB standards are international, and foreign hackers can target USB ports in hotels or rentals to steal your data, even if you\u2019re not using a kiosk.",
      "More and more public kiosks have wireless charging pads instead of USBs. This method doesn\u2019t exchange data directly with your phone, so it\u2019s virus-free by default.",
      "If you\u2019re desperate for juice, you can use a USB connection safely \u2026 with the right cable. Pack a\u00a0charge-only cable for your trip. They\u2019re cheap and compact, and they don\u2019t allow for data transfers.",
      "A business person is seen working on a laptop. (iStock)",
      "4. Don\u2019t use public Wi-Fi",
      "It's a playground for snoopers. Public Wi-Fi is open to everyone, and every device is susceptible, whether it\u2019s your smartphone, laptop or tablet.",
      "Just because a public Wi-Fi network pops up and asks if you want to join doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s legitimate. If you\u2019re at a coffee shop or hotel, ask an employee for the specific name of their Wi-Fi network. Scammers will sometimes create networks called \"Coffee Shop\" or \"Hotel Guest\" to make you believe you\u2019re connecting to the real thing when, actually, you\u2019re not.",
      "Here\u2019s a good rule of thumb: If it requires a username and password to log in, you should only access that site from your own private network. If you do need to access sensitive sites or info on a public network, don\u2019t do it without a VPN enabled.",
      "AI ISN\u2019T GOING ANYWHERE: PROMPTS TO MAKE LIFE EASIER",
      "5. Cover your mic and camera",
      "The NSA says it\u2019s best to use a protective case that drowns out your microphone and covers your camera when you\u2019re not using it.",
      "In \"hot-miking\" attacks, hackers activate your microphone without you knowing it so they can listen into your conversations. It happens when your device has been compromised in some way, usually through malware or an app that\u2019s exploiting permissions you granted.

      "A separate Migrant Operations Center at the camp could be expanded \u2014 with military construction help \u2014 and run by DHS.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a CNN interview Wednesday that \"there might be some resources that could be established for the worst of the worst at Guant\u00e1namo Bay\" and that Trump and DHS were assessing those resources.",
      "Guant\u00e1namo Bay became a detention site where detainees were first sent in 2002 under President George W. Bush after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. President Joe Biden said when he was in office that he wanted to\u00a0shut down the detention facility, as did President Barack Obama. Neither was successful.",
      "The Defense Department said this month that 15 detainees remain at Guant\u00e1namo Bay after it transferred 11 Yemeni detainees to Oman after they had been held at the base for over two decades.",
      "Trump has made other efforts to crack down on migrants living in the United States illegally since his second term began.",
      "During his first week in office, Trump declared a national emergency at the border that could permit the Pentagon to deploy the military, including the National Guard, to the border. He has also signed a slew of\u00a0executive orders\u00a0intended to shutdown illegal immigration at the southern border and to deport millions of people who have crossed into the United States illegally."

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 22:02:44 GMT",
    "summary": "Federal Reserve officials held interest rates steady after their latest policy meeting, drawing sharp criticism from President Donald Trump.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump took Federal Reserve officials to task after they left interest rates unchanged following their first policy meeting since he returned to office.",
      "\u201cBecause Jay Powell and the Fed failed to stop the problem they created with Inflation, I will do it by unleashing American Energy production, slashing Regulation, rebalancing International Trade, and reigniting American Manufacturing,\u201d he wrote on his Truth Social platform, referring to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.",
      "\u201cIf the Fed had spent less time on DEI, gender ideology, \u2018green\u2019 energy, and fake climate change, Inflation would never have been a problem,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump raised pressure on policymakers\u00a0to drive rates lower last week, extending his habit of publicizing his views on monetary policy \u2014 something presidents have long avoided to maintain the Fed\u2019s autonomy from politics.",
      "But the central bank opted to sit tight for now.",
      "In their news release announcing the decision \u2014\u00a0which analysts typically parse for signs of the path ahead \u2014 Fed officials struck a more cautious tone on inflation. They removed part of a line in their previous release saying inflation \u201chas made progress toward\u201d a goal of 2%, noting in Wednesday\u2019s statement only that it \u201cremains somewhat elevated.\u201d",
      "Powell said at a news conference after the announcement that recent inflation data looked \u201cgood\u201d but that \u201cwe\u2019re not going to over-interpret two good or two bad [inflation] readings.\u201d",
      "He also told reporters earlier Wednesday, before Trump\u2019s Truth Social post, that he wouldn\u2019t comment \u201cwhatsoever on what the president said\u201d about interest rates.",
      "\u201cThe public should be confident that we will continue to do our work as we always have,\u201d he said.",
      "Powell said he hasn\u2019t had any direct contact with Trump. \u201cLots of research shows [independence is] the best way for a central bank to operate,\u201d he said.",
      "All three major stock indices closed lower on the heels of the decision, which leaves interest rates uncomfortably high for many borrowers on everything from auto loans to mortgages. Consumer prices averaged 2.9% higher in December than the same period a year earlier \u2014 an annual rate that has hovered for months above the Fed\u2019s 2% target.",
      "Trump has positioned himself as the solution to lingering flaws in what analysts broadly agree is a solid economy.",
      "In a videoconference address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week, Trump said he\u2019d \u201cdemand that interest rates drop immediately.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know interest rates much better than they do,\u201d he said of Fed officials \u2014 shortly after he said by videoconference that he\u2019d \u201cdemand that interest rates drop immediately.\u201d Trump has also recently ramped up his criticism of Powell, whom he appointed in 2017 and has promised not to try to remove before Powell\u2019s term ends in May 2026.",
      "The U.S. economy has changed dramatically since Trump left office in January 2021, when the country was still gripped by the Covid-19 pandemic and bitter disputes over lockdown measures to combat it.After a pandemic-era run-up in prices that devastated many consumers\u2019 finances, inflation has been curtailed dramatically. Unemployment edged down to 4.1% in December from 4.2% the month before after employers added over a quarter-million jobs, helping tamp down worries about a labor market that has remained sturdy even as it cools.",
      "Consumer spending has held steady despite households\u2019 increasing focus on value. Gross domestic product \u2014 driven largely by the consumption of goods and services \u2014 has grown by at least 3% for two straight quarters, federal researchers said in December.",
      "Analysts see those and other metrics as signs that the economy is still humming along despite the inflation fight\u2019s difficult \u201clast mile,\u201d which would reduce the need for a fresh boost from the Fed just yet. The central bank has penciled in two rate cuts this year after it lowered them for three consecutive meetings, whittling its benchmark rate from a 20-year high range of 5.25%-5.5% to the current 4.25%-4.5%.",
      "\u201cWe think disinflation continues on a slow and sometimes bumpy path,\u201d Powell said Wednesday. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance.\u201d",
      "Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride put the situation more bluntly: \u201cThe progress toward 2% inflation has stalled out, and the Fed knows it,\u201d he said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThey gave no indication in their post-meeting statement that a resumption of rate cuts is likely at the next meeting in March. It will take a run of good inflation data to get us there, whenever that may be.\u201d",
      "Economists say the delicate dance of keeping borrowing costs elevated enough to wrestle price growth lower without pushing the economy into a recession has become more complicated. That\u2019s largely because of Trump\u2019s economic agenda \u2014 particularly tariffs, with his first policy move on that front expected Saturday.",
      "Asked about the potential economic impact of tariffs, Powell said, \u201cThe range of possibilities is very wide.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know for how long or how much, what countries. We don\u2019t know about retaliation. We don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to transmit through the economy to consumers,\u201d he said.",
      "Whatever the eventual outcome, \u201cit\u2019s clear that the central bank\u2019s decisions this year will be shaped by the Trump administration\u2019s policies on trade and immigration,\u201d Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at the financial firm RSM, wrote in a note Tuesday ahead of the rate announcement. \u201cThese policies could lead to higher inflation, or, just as important, raise inflation expectations, which would put the Fed\u2019s long-held 2% inflation target at risk.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Welcome to the online version of\u00a0From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.",
      "Happy Wednesday from Washington, where the focus was (at least partially) back on President Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks. We break down the key moments from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s confirmation hearing to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Plus, Ben Kamisar compares Trump\u2019s standing with voters with that of other recent presidents as they entered office.",
      "Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.",
      "\u2014 Adam Wollner",
      "4 things to know from RFK Jr.'s confirmation hearing",
      "It was Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s turn in the hot seat as he appeared before senators for the first of two hearings to be the next secretary of health and human services.",
      "While several of President Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks have stirred up controversy, Kennedy\u2019s nomination is unique in that it has drawn opposition from those on the left and the right. The 3\u00bd-hour hearing before the Senate Finance Committee gave Kennedy his highest-profile opportunity yet to address concerns.",
      "Here are the key takeaways:",
      "Vaccines: As expected, Kennedy\u2019s long history of hostility toward vaccines was a major line of questioning. Kennedy tried to get ahead of it in his opening statement, declaring he is not \u201canti-vaccine or anti-industry\u201d but \u201cpro-safety,\u201d as Natasha Korecki reports.",
      "But Democrats didn\u2019t buy it. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the ranking member of the committee, pressed Kennedy about his comments on a 2023 podcast in which he said, \u201cThere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective.\u201d Kennedy said the quote was taken out of context.",
      "\u201cI support the measles vaccine. I support the polio vaccine. I will do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult or discourages people from taking anything,\u201d he said.",
      "Abortion: Similarly, Kennedy, a former Democrat, sought to backtrack on his past comments about abortion rights, which have been a concern for conservatives.",
      "While he was running for president last year, Kennedy said on a podcast that he would support allowing women to have abortions at full term. Days later, he walked his position back, writing on X that \u201cabortion should be legal up until a certain number of weeks, and restricted thereafter.\u201d",
      "Kennedy faced questions from senators on both sides of the aisle about his position. And he tried to align himself with Trump, saying abortion policy should be left to the states. He also added that Trump asked him to study the abortion pill mifepristone.",
      "\u201cI agree with President Trump that every abortion is a tragedy,\u201d Kennedy said, a line he repeated several times at the hearing. \u201cI serve at the pleasure of the president. I\u2019m going to implement his policies.\u201d",
      "Medicaid: While Kennedy didn\u2019t face much in the way of opposition from Republicans, he was tripped up during a line of questioning from Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., about Medicaid.",
      "For instance, Kennedy said Medicaid premiums and deductibles were too high, saying most people who use it are \u201cnot happy.\u201d But most people on Medicaid aren\u2019t charged for premiums or deductibles, and polls generally show the public views the program favorably.",
      "Cassidy will be a key factor in Kennedy\u2019s path to confirmation. A doctor, Cassidy also chairs the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which will hold a confirmation hearing for Kennedy on Thursday. Cassidy hasn\u2019t said how he plans to vote on Kennedy.",
      "Bottom line: Kennedy didn\u2019t endear himself to any Democrats, but he has yet to have any Republican senators publicly come out in opposition to him. He can afford to lose the support of only three on the Senate floor if Democrats are united against him.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., a member of the Finance Committee who was a swing vote for Pete Hegseth\u2019s nomination for defense secretary, said after the hearing: \u201cI\u2019m in a presumptive lean yes position, and everything he did today hasn\u2019t eroded that position.\u201d",
      "Read more from Natasha on the hearing \u2192",
      "What the polls say about the start of Trump's second term",
      "The early polling shows Donald Trump starting with more backing from voters \u2014 and more wiggle room \u2014 than he had going into his first term in the White House. But it remains to be seen how they will judge his first actions as president.",
      "Trump entered his second term with a better image rating than he had in January 2017. NBC News/Wall Street Journal polling from the days before his first inauguration found just 38% of adults gave him positive ratings, while Fox News found 42% of registered voters viewed him positively at that point.",
      "Now, Fox News\u2019 most recent poll shows Trump with a 50% positive rating among registered voters, and a new Wall Street Journal poll has found that 47% of registered voters view him favorably. (Both polls were conducted before Trump took office.)",
      "An analysis of NBC News polling spanning the last five presidencies shows how short honeymoons can be in the White House.",
      "Joe Biden: His 51% approval rating in April 2021 slipped to 45% by late October and to 41% by March 2022. His approval rating never got above 46% for the rest of his presidency.",
      "Donald Trump: His first approval rating in NBC News polling was 44% in February 2017, which slipped immediately to 39% by the next NBC News poll, in May. But Trump\u2019s approval rating was more inelastic than those of other presidents of recent memory, staying inside a relatively narrow range of 39% to 47% for his entire presidency.",
      "Barack Obama: His 60% approval rating in early March 2009 stayed consistent in an NBC News poll the following month. But it slid in four of the next five polls, though his low of 47% in December 2009 was substantially higher than the depths Trump\u2019s or Biden\u2019s numbers reached. After the initial dive, Obama\u2019s rating oscillated around 50% until the summer before the 2010 midterm elections.",
      "Bill Clinton: His approval rating ticked up from 51% shortly after he took office to 57% in March 1993. It slid to 41% by June 1993 before it marched back up to 60% on his first anniversary in office.",
      "Clinton\u2019s approval rating proceeded to slide in 1994 all the way to 43% before Republicans took over Congress in that year\u2019s midterm elections.",
      "(George W. Bush\u2019s first year was marred by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which makes comparison to the first years of other presidencies difficult.)",

      "As the Trump administration's immigration raids ramped up across America, many people were stunned to see a former daytime TV staple take center stage \u2014 Phil McGraw, commonly known as \"Dr. Phil,\" who accompanied immigration agents during raids around Chicago.",
      "McGraw, who came to national fame alongside Oprah Winfrey and hosted \u201cDr. Phil\u201d\u00a0for more than two decades, said he had embedded with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents as they apprehended \u201cknown criminals and terrorists.\u201d",
      "McGraw in the past year has become a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration positions, discussing his views on TV, podcasts and social media and even at a Trump rally.",
      "In a statement when he ended his CBS daytime show in 2023, McGraw said that he had \u201cgrave concerns for the American family\u201d and that he was \u201cdetermined to help restore a clarity of purpose as well as our core values.\u201d",
      "He offered a glimpse into his views on immigration during a \u201cDr. Phil\u201d show in January 2023. That's when he told his guests and the audience that he believed U.S. immigration laws were not being properly enforced and that \u201cwe can\u2019t get our act together by doing this the right way.\u201d",
      "But\u00a0before last year, McGraw did not appear to have ever\u00a0used terms such as\u00a0\u201cillegal,\u201d \u201cborder,\u201d \u201cimmigration\u201d or \u201cICE\u201d in his social media content.",

    "summary": "In samples NASA brought back from the asteroid Bennu, scientists have discovered of organic compounds, including key building blocks of life like amino acids.",
    "story": [
      "The Summary",
      "A NASA spacecraft brought samples from the asteroid Bennu back to Earth in 2023.The first in-depth analyses of that material have revealed organic molecules, including building blocks of life. The results bolster the theory that asteroids that crashed into Earth may have delivered the ingredients for life.",
      "A NASA spacecraft brought samples from the asteroid Bennu back to Earth in 2023.",
      "The first in-depth analyses of that material have revealed organic molecules, including building blocks of life.",
      "The results bolster the theory that asteroids that crashed into Earth may have delivered the ingredients for life.",
      "In samples taken from a distant asteroid, scientists have discovered a host of organic molecules, including key building blocks of life.",
      "The surprising finding suggests the chemical ingredients necessary for life may have been widespread across the early solar system.",
      "NASA\u2019s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, which launched in 2016, scooped up bits of dust, soil and rocks from the asteroid Bennu and then brought them to Earth in 2023. The 4.5-billion-year-old asteroid is thought to have formed in the first 10 million years of the solar system\u2019s existence.",
      "An analysis of that collected asteroid material, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, indicates that the samples included thousands of organic compounds and 14 of the 20 amino acids that life on Earth uses to form proteins. The samples also contained four \u201cnucleobases\u201d \u2014 the main components of DNA and RNA, which store and transmit genetic blueprints within our cells.",
      "The researchers did not find evidence of life itself on Bennu; rather, their results bolster the theory that asteroids that crashed into Earth when it was young may have delivered the necessary ingredients for life to take hold. The findings could also mean that the chances life formed on other planets and moons in the solar system could be higher than scientists previously thought.",
      "\u201cThe OSIRIS-REx mission is already rewriting the textbook on what we understand about the ingredients thought to be necessary for the emergence of life in our solar system,\u201d Nicky Fox, the associate administrator of NASA\u2019s Science Mission Directorate, said Wednesday in a news briefing.",
      "Similar organic molecules, including amino acids, have been detected in meteorites before, but these fragments of space rocks are imperfect specimens because they are studied after enduring fiery trips through Earth's atmosphere.",
      "Whereas meteorites have been exposed to and contaminated by conditions on Earth that could skew scientific results, gathering samples directly from an asteroid in space is like peering into a time capsule from the nascent solar system.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s so significant about the OSIRIS-REx Bennu findings is that those samples are pristine,\u201d said Danny Glavin, an astrobiologist at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center.",
      "The return canister that carried the Bennu samples shielded them from harsh conditions during atmospheric re-entry, Glavin said.",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is: We have a higher confidence that the organic material we\u2019re seeing in these samples are extraterrestrial and not contamination,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can trust these results.\u201d",
      "In the samples from Bennu, the researchers stumbled on some surprises. For one, they found exceptionally high concentrations of ammonia \u2014 \u201cabout 100 times more than the natural levels of ammonia that you find in soils on the Earth,\u201d Glavin said.",
      "Ammonia is an essential ingredient in many biological processes, including as a building block to form amino acids, which in turn can link together into long chains to make proteins.",
      "Another surprise was described in a second paper published Wednesday in the journal Nature: Researchers found traces of 11 minerals that were likely part of a briny mixture left behind after deposits of water evaporated off Bennu and its parent asteroid.",
      "The salty crystals left behind by the evaporated water resembled sodium-rich crusts found in dry lakebeds on Earth, such as Searles Lake in California, said Tim McCoy, curator of meteorites at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum in Washington, D.C., and a co-author of both studies.",
      "\u201cWe now know from Bennu that the raw ingredients of life were combining in really interesting and complex ways on Bennu\u2019s parent body,\u201d McCoy said in a statement. \u201cWe have discovered that next step on a pathway to life.\u201d",
      "The minerals detected included sodium carbonate compounds such as trona (sometimes referred to as \u201csoda ash\u201d) that the scientists said had never been observed in other extraterrestrial samples. Similar briny mixtures are thought to exist on Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus and the dwarf planet Ceres.",
      "The two new studies represent the first in-depth analyses of the Bennu samples. In 2023, scientists announced preliminary findings, including traces of carbon and water locked up in clay minerals.",
      "The soil and rock from Bennu are the first samples NASA has collected and brought back from an asteroid, but they were not the first in history. Japan\u2019s Hayabusa mission in 2010 delivered to Earth a few micrograms of material from an asteroid called Itokawa. A second mission, dubbed\u00a0Hayabusa2, delivered a small sample from an asteroid known as Ryugu in 2020.",
      "While the samples from Bennu have already yielded intriguing results, more research is needed to understand what precisely causes life to emerge on one planet or moon and not others.",
      "\u201cWhat did Bennu not have that Earth did have?\u201d said Jason Dworkin,\u00a0an OSIRIS-REx project scientist at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center. \u201cThis is a future area of study for astrobiologists around the world to ponder, looking at Bennu as an example of a place that had all the stuff but didn\u2019t make life. Why was Earth special?\u201d"

    "summary": "While several major companies are eliminating or scaling back diversity programs under pressure and amid a push to exorcise them from the federal government, some say they\u2019re standing firm in the shifting political winds.",
    "story": [
      "While several major companies and organizations are eliminating or scaling back diversity programs under conservative pressure and amid a\u00a0push to exorcise them from the federal government, some others, including Delta Airlines and the NBA\u2019s Cleveland Cavaliers, say they\u2019re standing firm in the shifting political winds.",
      "\u201cDEI is not something that\u2019s going to stop at Delta Airlines,\u201d said Eric Hendricks, Delta\u2019s director of pilot outreach, adding that the airline still has recruiting and training events for marginalized groups scheduled throughout the year.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re pressing on,\u201d Hendricks said.",
      "The Cleveland Cavaliers, which incorporated DEI policies to the front office in 2019, is also keeping the initiatives intact.",
      "\u201cIt is just how we go about things,\u201d said Kevin Clayton, the Cavs\u2019 executive vice president, chief equity and impact officer. \u201cWe believe that everybody in our organization, every person in our community, is part of our diversity, equity and inclusion story. So it\u2019s not about any one group. This work is about humanity. We know that our platform is one that can uplift our community \u2014 everyone in our community.\u201d",
      "Sacha Thompson, a Maryland-based inclusive workplace consultant, said the pushback against DEI did not come as a surprise. \u201cFor one, Trump said what he would do. But also, anytime there\u2019s progress in this country, there\u2019s always going to be some level of regression or pushback,\u201d she said.",
      "But Thompson predicted many of these companies will hold onto these programs because \u201cthere is a business imperative to keeping them,\u201d as well as a moral imperative.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d said Fatimah Gilliam, who heads the New York-based DEI consulting firm Azara Group. \u201cThese companies understand the business case and the value of DEI,\u201d which she said ranges from boosting innovation, retention and profitability, to reducing employee turnover.",
      "Many companies, she noted, \u201chave a diverse customer base, and they have a diverse employee base,\u201d as well, and executives \u201cunderstand that aspect, too.\u201d",
      "Less than five years after corporations across the country made implemented policies\u00a0to bolster diversity and equity following the police murder of George Floyd in May 2020, many of them have quietly \u2014 or loudly \u2014 scaled back their efforts. The list includes Walmart, Ford, McDonald\u2019s and Target, among many others that have announced revisions since President Donald Trump won re-election.",
      "Anti-DEI activist Robby Starbuck and other conservatives have helped heap public pressure on major consumer brands, often using social media to single out companies that have stood by diversity and inclusion programs. Trump\u2019s executive order, two days after his inauguration, to end DEI in the federal government has put wind in the sails of efforts\u00a0to dismantle DEI initiatives in the private sector, even though his move doesn\u2019t directly affect those companies. Many of them, eyeing these developments, are now feeling the pressure and may acquiesce, DEI experts say.",
      "That\u2019s especially true for businesses that have not blended diversity initiatives into their culture yet, Thompson said. If DEI has been \u201cpart of the organization\u2019s DNA,\u201d she said, there\u2019s a better chance it would remain that way. \u201cWhen it is separate and apart, it\u2019s easier to cut off.\u201d",
      "Research has shown that companies with diversity and equity platforms perform better financially than those that do not. A 2023 McKinsey study showed, for example, that companies with women on executive teams had a 39% higher likelihood of profitability. And that can be a driving factor of why leaders from companies like Costco, JPMorgan, Apple and others have said they will continue diversity efforts \u2014 even when they have signaled openness to working with the Trump White House on other fronts.",
      "\u201cWhen these companies that have kept it look at their data and say, \u2018We\u2019re not stopping these programs,\u2019 it says to me that they are seeing a result that is tied to their bottom line,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201d",
      "Conservatives have the political upper hand, including control of all three branches of the federal government, so it takes \u201ccourageous leadership\u201d for companies to stick with DEI, said Anthony P. Howard, who has worked in human resources for more than 20 years, including at two Fortune 500 companies.",
      "Standing up to preserve DEI initiatives increases the level of loyalty and commitment to that company, he said, \u201cbecause now they\u2019re standing out among the crowd and against something that doesn\u2019t support equal opportunities.\u201d",
      "Tana M. Session, a veteran diversity and inclusion leader in California, said private organizations like Delta and the Cavaliers are positioning themselves for the future.",
      "\u201cThey are able to let that be their compass and not be dissuaded or discouraged by the noise,\u201d Session said. \u201cThey are standing 10 toes down, holding to the middle ground, and they will see the benefits on the back end.\u201d",
      "Gilliam, from Azara Group, said she has heard from corporate leaders who are fearful of potential repercussions and could waver on keeping DEI. But those sticking with it have \u201cinvested a lot of time, effort and money into building up their infrastructure, as well.\u201d",
      "National Urban League president Marc Morial promised a fight on this front earlier this month.",
      "\u201cWe stand against any effort by anyone through any method to reverse the gains made over the last 70 years,\u201d Morial said in a roundtable about DEI with more than a dozen organizations, thought leaders and attorneys. \u201cAnd we stand against efforts by this administration to repel, to undercut or undermine the hard work of many generations of Americans through what we call unlawful, extra-constitutional and ill-advised acts.\u201d",
      "Some companies, like Target, could feel the wrath of consumers \u2014 especially people of color who may favor other stores for rolling back its DEI program.",
      "\u201cWhat they\u2019re going to see is their consumers making a quick pivot to buying directly from the vendors, especially the vendors of color and women,\u201d Session said. Target, in particular, made efforts to feature products by Black- and Latino-owned businesses on its shelves, and for years has carried LGBTQ Pride-related merchandise. \u201cSo not so much a boycott but taking our consumerism in a different direction. The game is changing and how companies are impacted will change, too.\u201d"

    "summary": "Deepseek collects similar data to American-based AI models, but Chinese laws could make that data more accessible to the government.",
    "story": [
      "China\u2019s DeepSeek, the free artificial intelligence chatbot that\u2019s undercutting American counterparts, has prompted worries about whether it\u2019s safe to use.",
      "While cybersecurity researchers say the app does not immediately appear to be uniquely dangerous, it still carries substantial privacy risks both as an app that follows China\u2019s laws and as an artificial intelligence product that may collect and rearrange everything people tell it.",
      "All large language models, or LLMs \u2014 the type of AI-driven advanced chatbot made famous by OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT \u2014 are built by first amassing massive amounts of data, and work in part by collecting what people type into them. DeepSeek, though more efficient than ChatGPT, is no different.",
      "Under Chinese law, all companies must cooperate with and assist with Chinese intelligence efforts, potentially exposing data held by Chinese companies to Chinese government surveillance. That system differs from the U.S., where, in most cases, American agencies usually need a court order or warrant to access information held by American tech companies.",
      "But it\u2019s possible to use DeepSeek and minimize how much data you send to China. Using the app or the chatbot through deepseek.com requires users to register an account, either with an email address or through a Chinese phone number, which most people outside China don\u2019t have.",
      "Lukasz Olejnik, an independent consultant and a researcher at King\u2019s College London Institute for AI, told NBC News that means people should be wary of sharing any sensitive or personal data with DeepSeek.",
      "\u201cBe careful about inputting sensitive personal data, financial details, trade secrets, or information about healthcare. Anything you type could be stored, analyzed, or requested by authorities under China\u2019s data laws,\u201d Olejnik said.",
      "Ron Deibert, the director of the University of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab, said that means DeepSeek users should be particularly cautious if they have reason to fear Chinese authorities.",
      "\u201cUsers who are high-risk in relation to mainland China, including human rights activists, members of targeted diaspora populations, and journalists should be particularly sensitive to these risks and avoid inputting anything into the system,\u201d Deibert said.",
      "One way to reduce what you send to China is to register DeepSeek with a new email account, not one you already use for other important services. That could keep the app, or potentially Chinese intelligence services, from being able to easily match what you tell DeepSeek with who you are on other parts of the internet.",
      "For the more technologically savvy, it\u2019s possible to download the DeepSeek AI model and ask it questions directly, without having to go through the Chinese company processing those requests. That not only prevents China from seeing whatever information you give the model, but it also means little or no censorship about topics that are blocked in Beijing, Olejnik said.",
      "DeepSeek has also prompted worries because its privacy policy declares that it collects a large amount of sensitive information from users, including what kind of device they\u2019re using and \u201ckeystroke pattern or rhythms.\u201d While some people may find that invasive, it is limited to what a person types into the app and not what they type into other apps, and it is not unheard of: TikTok and Facebook, for example, have had ways of tracking users\u2019 keystrokes and mouse movements.",
      "Deibert cautioned that while there are risks to giving information to a Chinese LLM, American ones carry risks as well.",
      "\u201cThe same risks apply to all AI platforms, including those based in the United States,\u201d Deibert said.",
      "Deibert noted that many U.S. tech companies collect similar sensitive information, and that recently, they\u2019ve worked to court President Donald Trump. \u201cAnyone who is remotely critical of the administration, is a watchdog of the administration, or is part of a vulnerable or at-risk community, should exercise serious caution before using or inputting any data into what are largely \u2018black boxes.\u2019 Remember, as with virtually all social media platforms, users\u2019 data is part of the raw material used to train those systems,\u201d he said."

      "Two months after the couple applied for a marriage license, police say Snyder fatally stabbed a man in Vallejo, California, 30 miles northeast of San Francisco, on Jan. 17.",
      "The victim, Curtis Lind, 82, was killed not long before he was set to testify against two people charged in a horrifying assault on him in 2022.",
      "Lind was \u201cstabbed multiple times, had a sword impaled through his chest and ultimately lost his right eye\" on Nov. 13, 2022, his family said on a GoFundMe page.",
      "A man who was living in a mobile home on Lind\u2019s property, Patrick McMillian, told NBC Bay Area in 2022 that the incident stemmed from an eviction dispute.",
      "\u201cHe banged on my door and I woke up and came out,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cHe said \u2018I\u2019m dying,\u2019 and he had blood squirting out and a sword sticking through him.\u201d",
      "McMillan said Lind managed to shoot two of the attackers during that assault, killing one and wounding the other.",
      "\u201cC.L. was a witness to a crime who was intentionally killed for the purpose of preventing his testimony in a criminal proceeding,\u201d Snyder's criminal complaint says.",
      "No other details were provided. But two of the suspects in the attack on Lind were set to go on trial this year, records show. Snyder's connection to the suspects is unclear, and there are no allegations against Youngblut in the case.",
      "Snyder has been charged with murder. His lawyer declined to comment, and his family could not be reached.",
      "Prosecutors say the California killing may not be the only one carried out by associates of Youngblut's.",
      "Federal prosecutors in Vermont said in court papers that the guns possessed by Youngblut and Felix Bauckholt, the man she was with at the time of the shooting of the Border Patrol agent, were bought by an individual who is a person of interest in a double homicide in Pennsylvania. No other information was provided.",
      "Prosecutors have not said whether they believe Maland, the fallen agent, was struck by one of the bullets Youngblut allegedly fired or by a shot from a fellow officer. Youngblut has been charged with two federal weapons counts. Her lawyer has declined to comment.",
      "Prosecutors have said that Youngblut and Bauckholt were traveling with a large collection of weapons and tactical gear, including 48 rounds of .380-caliber jacketed hollow point ammunition, a ballistic helmet and night vision equipment.",
      "The pair had been under surveillance by Homeland Security Investigations in the days prior to the shooting, according to court documents, after a hotel employee reported concerns about them. The pair were wearing \u201call-black, tactical style clothing with protective equipment,\u201d and Youngblut was seen carrying a gun, court documents say.",
      "When their Toyota Prius was pulled over, Bauckholt, the registered owner, appeared to have an expired visa in a Department of Homeland Security database, according to court documents. But the FBI has said that Bauckholt's visa was, in fact, current."

      "Olympic gold medalist Gabby Thomas asked for advice from her social media followers after, she said, a group of men have been stalking her at airports in multiple cities.",
      "Thomas, a five-time Olympic medalist, said in a TikTok video Tuesday that a group of men have appeared at airports across the country while she's traveling, harassing her and asking her to sign stacks of pictures. She believes the men are resellers but alleges they have been \"aggressive and hostile\" when she rejects them.",
      "\"It doesn't matter what city,\" Thomas said. \"They've come when I was traveling to and from Chicago, they've come when I'm traveling to and from Miami. And they have my flight information.\"",
      "The men, about three to six of them, have shown up at airport doors, she said. But, Thomas said, they have also approached her at her concourses or gates, meaning they appear to have to have flight tickets and go through airport security.",
      "She said the encounters are particularly frightening when she\u2019s traveling alone. The fact that they seem to know exactly where and when she is traveling, she said, is \"freaking\" her out.",
      "\"What scares me is that they have my flight information even when I don't even know what time I'm flying out sometimes \u2014 I don't tell anyone my flight information,\" Thomas said.",
      "Last year in Paris, Thomas ran in her second Olympics and brought home three gold medals. It was a redemption from her second- and third-place finishes at the Tokyo Games a few years before.",
      "Many found Thomas to be an inspiration as she trained for the global competition between taking neurobiology courses at Harvard University and volunteer work at a health clinic in Austin, Texas.",
      "Now, Thomas is turning to the more than 260,000 followers for guidance to help her feel safe again while she is traveling.",
      "\"I don't know what to do,\" Thomas said. \"Any advice is welcome.\"",
      "Commenters expressed sympathy and acknowledged the situation is alarming. Fellow Olympian Ilona Maher wrote that it was \"so scary.\"",
      "\"These guys are done,\" Thomas said in a reply to Maher. \"Once I figure this out they won't be harassing anyone else.\"",
      "Tennis player Coco Gauff said she has had the same experience.",
      "\"This happens to me too, I don't know how it happens,\" Gauff wrote. \"My theory is maybe someone at the airport tips them off.\"",
      "Others offered advice, including to contact the FBI and to check her accounts for any connected apps that the men could be accessing.",
      "A commenter suggested she make a report to her local police and to airport security to start records of the encounters. Another said Thomas should see whether recording the men would scare them off.",
      "She shared a video in reply of two men at Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport. In the video she narrates that the men were \"stalking\" her. One man pulls a hood over his face and walks away as she records.",
      "\"I took this video once when they were following me past TSA,\" Thomas wrote. \"I'll see who I can report it to. I'll continue to take pictures and video. It scared them away.\""

      "Lindsay Haugen, 41, pleaded guilty to strangling her 25-year-old boyfriend, Robert Mast, while the two of them sat in a car in a Walmart parking lot in 2015. She has been serving a 60-year sentence for deliberate homicide since 2016.",
      "On the second season of \u201cI Am a Killer,\u201d a true-crime series on Netflix that spotlights convicted murderers, Haugen said she killed Mast \u2014 whom she had known for less than a month \u2014 out of love after she said he insisted he wanted to die.",
      "But in an interview with police, which was recorded and included in the episode, she told a detective that she also \u201ckinda just wanted to kill somebody with my bare hands, honestly,\u201d the footage shows.",
      "\u201cI saw my opportunity, I guess,\u201d Haugen told the detective, according to the video.",
      "Police say Mast was drunk and could not fight back.",
      "On Wednesday, Haugen told a three-member panel that she is \"haunted\" by that \"outrageous\" statement, claiming she said it to stop a detective's line of questioning.",
      "\"I wish I had not said it, and of course, I didn\u2019t mean it,\" Haugen said at the hearing, appearing virtually from the Montana Women\u2019s Prison in Billings, Montana.",
      "Haugen, who said she was \"drunk and in shock\" during the interrogation, said a prior history of abuse from men caused her to lie.",
      "\"I said what I felt the man wanted to hear in order to make the accusations stop,\" she said. \"I was not looking for an opportunity. I would never purposefully inflict harm on another human being.\"",
      "In her prepared, 10-minute statement, Haugen said she was guilty of the crime and expressed regret and remorse for it. But she asked for a shorter sentence, saying she is a better person, who is treating her alcohol addiction.",
      "\"I appear before you now guilty of homicide, a statement which chills me to the bone,\" she said. \"I know that I don't deserve this, but\u00a0I am hoping for a chance to live in a way that is deserving of this opportunity.\"",
      "In his remarks Wednesday, Steve Hallam, the Billings Police Department detective who interrogated Haugen, told the board that Haugen had made other callous confessions other than the one referring to her bare hands.",
      "Hallam said Haugen also revealed in the recorded interrogation that she planned on burying Mast's body in a scarce area before leaving for Washington state. Haugen also said she would not have gone to police to report the crime, the detective said.",
      "\"Lindsay Haugen does not deserve clemency,\" Hallam said.",
      "In emotional pleas, Mast's family members begged the board to keep Haugen behind bars.",
      "Mast\u2019s stepmother, Mindy Pendleton, who helped raise him from when he was a toddler, said her family lives in \"loss and grief daily as she must live with the consequences of her actions.\"",
      "\"Anything less diminished Robby's existence and the people that love him,\" she added.",
      "Pendleton also said Haugen exploited her stepson's murder when she participated on the Netflix show, which aired in 2020, and should not be \"rewarded\" for any notoriety she may have received from the series.",
      "Pendleton urged the board to remember the crime. \"Envision your child, your loved one. Envision the chokehold, strangling, the suffocation,\" she said.",
      "The Montana Board of Pardons and Parole has 30 days to make its recommendation to Gov. Greg Gianforte, who has the sole authority to grant or deny Haugen\u2019s request.",
      "A spokesperson for Gianforte said the governor has not yet received the request for clemency. The board said the governor does not have a statutory timeline to respond.",
      "Without the clemency, Haugen would be eligible for parole in September 2030, according to the board.",
      "The parole board said it received at least six letters supporting her early release and about three dozen letters opposing it.",
      "Clemency is an extraordinary form of relief from a sentence and is not granted in most cases, Brad Newman, a parole board member on Haugen\u2019s hearing panel, told NBC News.",
      "The board did not have to grant Haugen a public hearing, but it did because there was \u201csufficient cause\u201d to hear her explanation, he said.",
      "Newman said the Netflix episode did not come up as the board reviewed her application.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know her case had ever been discussed on Netflix. I\u2019m not a customer subscriber. That\u2019s news to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess it\u2019s conceivable that a board member has seen or heard about this case.\u201d"

Hamas had not provided the names of the first hostages it planned to free that afternoon, so Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered airstrikes to continue.",

      "The police in Gaza fall under the Hamas-controlled Interior Ministry, and enforce laws set by the militant group after it took control of the Strip in 2007. Israel considers members of the police force to be Hamas terrorists and legitimate military targets, even though some officers also carry out more mundane duties like traffic enforcement and crime prevention.",

    "story": [
      "As if having royalty in your bloodline was not impressive enough, imagine having roots stemming from the first king of Rome.",
      "On the Season 11 episode of \"Finding Your Roots\" that aired on Jan. 28, actor and former fashion model Sharon Stone discovered just that.",
      "After discussing the paper trail of her parents' bloodline, host Dr. Henry Louis Gates Jr. revealed to Stone that her line of heritage from her father's paternal line extended back over a thousand years to medieval times, making Charlemagne her 38th great-grandfather.",
      "Referred to as the \"father of Europe,\" Charlemagne is one of the most important people in history, according to Gates.",
      "The King of the Franks was the first crowned emperor of the Holy Roman Empire in the year 800, over one thousand years before Stone was even born.",
      "Not only did the line of lineage contain Charlemagne, but also two French kings, making up Stone\u2019s bloodline as a one-of-a-kind royal line.",
      "\"Well if you want to see someone whose mind is completely blown, here it is!\" Stone said after Gates revealed the image of Charlemagne.",
      "Stone had multiple revelations about her family history in the episode, including her DNA test, which revealed she was 43% Scottish. Before the episode, she believed her ancestors were almost exclusively Irish, which Gates concluded could be a result of a migration of Scottish people to Ireland, known as Scotch-Irish people.",
      "Contrasted with the royal lineage in her distant bloodline, Stone's parents did not grow up with financial fortitude. Her mother, Dorothy Larson, was born in 1933 in rural Pennsylvania in extreme poverty. Dorothy Larson's parents, Stone's grandparents, could only afford a two-room house for their five children.",
      "\u201cThere wasn\u2019t time or moments to even think about was there anybody before them; there wasn\u2019t the luxury of imagining \u2018who were your ancestors,\u201d Stone explained to Gates. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to know who your people are. It\u2019s really nice to be able to find that out.\u201d",
      "Larson grew up surrounded in tragedy, with her twin dying at birth due to malnourishment and one of her sisters being struck and killed by a drunk driver, according to Stone. She also grew up with rickets and scurvy, and at age 9 moved in with their local dentist to live as their maid.",
      "Stone's third great-grandfather on her mom's side, George Greggs, also suffered from great hardship. A Pennsylvania Union cavalry soldier in the Civil War and during the Battle of Cedar Creek, Greggs potentially suffered from undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder in the later stages of his life.",
      "With hardship on her mother's side, Stone's dad's upbringing also had unfortunate circumstances. Sharon's grandfather, Joseph Stone, managed a lucrative oil well that passed from heart disease, leaving his wife with no inheritance.",
      "Stone explained she believes she inherited her father's work ethic, who was a tool and dye maker. Stone herself battled career challenges herself, including a bounceback from a life-threatening stroke.",
      "\"It's so grounding to find out for the good and the bad of it,\" Stone explained when learning about her family lineage. \"Because them, you can just see yourself and go 'Oh, that's what I'm made of!'\""

    "summary": "Blake Lively's brother-in-law Bart Johnson apologized on X for 'unkind' remarks amid her legal drama with Justin Baldoni.",
    "story": [
      "Blake Lively's actor brother-in-law Bart Johnson is apologizing for any \"unkind\" things he's said amid Lively's legal battle with her \"It Ends with Us\" co-star and director Justin Baldoni.",
      "Johnson, who is married to Lively\u2019s\u00a0older half-sister Robyn Lively,\u00a0 addressed unspecific past remarks of his Jan. 28 on X, writing, \"Anytime I\u2019ve said anything unkind about someone I\u2019ve regretted it. Fortunately that\u2019s almost never and definitely not when I\u2019m at my best. Regardless if it\u2019s true or not, if it\u2019s my opinion, even if I\u2019m trying to speak truth or stand up for someone, it\u2019s never good.",
      "\"Even in times where it might 'feel' justified and doing the right thing, it makes no difference,\" he continued. \"There\u2019s a better way. It\u2019s below the standard I have for myself and I regret it. \"",
      "The \"High School Musical\" franchise star went on to \"sincerely apologize\" to anyone he \"hurt or let down by saying something that sounds mean.\"",
      "\"I\u2019ll do better. If you follow me you know you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find more than 1 time I\u2019ve criticized anyone on social. It\u2019s not my jam,\" wrote Johnson. \"You can easily find a million times I\u2019ve uplifted, support, encourage and uplifted my family, friends, followers & strangers. That\u2019s what I\u2019m committed to and where I find my happiness. \"",
      "Johnson concluded his message, \"We all have flaws and I\u2019m definitely a work in progress and doing my best to grow and be better.\"",
      "Johnson's comments come on the heels of lawsuits filed by both Lively and Baldoni following the promotion and release of \"It Ends with Us,\" which premiered in theaters in August 2024.",
      "In December 2024, after rumors of a feud between the two actors circulated for months, Lively, who co-starred and was a producer on \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d filed a\u00a0sexual harassment complaint\u00a0against Baldoni.",
      "Lively followed up by filing a lawsuit against Baldoni, his production company Wayfarer Studios, producer Jamey Heath, Baldoni's publicist Jennifer Abel, crisis publicist Melissa Nathan and others connected to Baldoni and the film, alleging\u00a0she was the victim of sexual harassment and\u00a0a subsequent smear campaign, according to court documents obtained by NBC News.",
      "Baldoni countered by suing Lively, her husband, actor Ryan Reynolds, and other defendants for $400 million, accusing them of defamation and other contractual claims, according to court documents obtained by NBC News.",
      "Both actors' lawsuits will be addressed in a trial set for March 9, 2026, in New York.",
      "Months before the actors filed their lawsuits, Johnson defended Lively as she battled a social media backlash that her lawsuit alleges was orchestrated by Baldoni and his team.",
      "After Johnson posted\u00a0a birthday tribute\u00a0to Lively on Instagram in August 2024, he responded to a commenter who accused Lively, who plays a victim of\u00a0domestic abuse in \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d of \u201cpromoting happiness in a domestic violence setting without any regard for any victims.\"",
      "\"I\u2019m really sorry you feel that way. I\u2019m sure you have a huge heart and want the best,\" Johnson replied, in part. \"I can promise you the truth has not come out yet. Blake worked harder on this film than anything I\u2019ve seen her do in my entire life. Because it meant so much to her.\u201d",
      "In December 2024, Johnson also reportedly called Baldoni, who hosts a podcast called \"Man Enough\" that explores modern masculinity and gender roles,\" a \"fraud\" in a since-deleted post on X, reported USA Today.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a fraud. He puts on the \u2018costume\u2019 of a hero, man bun and all. Used all of the trendy catchphrases & buzz words for his podcasts. None of it\u2019s genuine. It\u2019s all theater. And everyone fell for it. For years,\u201d Johnson wrote, according to the publication.",
      "On Jan. 29, a day after he said he regretted making \"unkind\" remarks, Johnson posted and then deleted a response to an X user who accused of him of apologizing in the interest of \u201cavoiding litigation.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow I\u2019m gonna get sued? for what? I find those type of podcasts phony. I do. That\u2019s not a crime,\u201d Johnson wrote, seemingly referring to his earlier remarks about Baldoni's podcast.",
      "\u201cBut I do feel bad rippin on them. That\u2019s literally all I said. But\u2026 Just like you and all the toxic and hatful comments I get from his fans wishing me and my children harm and calling me all the vile names you can imagine, it\u2019s not a crime. People are free to do so and I\u2019m not mad,\u201d he added."

      "Amanda Riley drew people in with a story.",
      "She presented herself as a young woman and mother of two battling an aggressive blood cancer, Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma \u2014 who, despite her devastating diagnosis, was not giving up, according to a press release from the United States District Court, Northern District of California.",
      "Riley documented every step of her cancer journey on social media and various blogs for years. She shared raw photos of herself receiving cancer treatment, including pictures of herself with IVs and chemo ports at the hospital, as well as photos of herself with a bald head, per the release.",
      "Over the course of eight years, Riley, now 39, hosted numerous fundraisers, both in person and online, gathering hundreds of supporters who donated more than $100,000 to fund her life-saving treatments.",
      "Then, the truth came out: it had all been a scam. Riley had never had Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and she had staged her illness for years to solicit donations for her non-existent cancer expenses. Riley pleaded guilty to wire fraud.",
      "A new four-part documentary, \u201cScamanda,\u201d explores how Rileypulled off her elaborate scheme. The series, which premieres Jan. 30 on ABC News with episodes streaming on Hulu the next day, includes interviews with friends and family members victimized for years by Riley\u2019s deception.",
      "Keep reading to learn more about what Riley was convicted of, what she has said about her crime, and where she is now.",
      "What was Amanda Riley convicted of?",
      "Riley pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud in October 2011. She was sentenced in May 2022 to 60 months in prison, and required to pay restitution to her victims.",
      "The wire fraud conviction stems from Riley\u2019s actions between 2012 and 2019, when she feigned having cancer, per the release. She used Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and a personal blog to document her supposed cancer journey, staging fake treatment photographs and forging medical records and physicians\u2019 letters, according to the district court\u2019s filing.",
      "Throughout these years, she aggressively fundraised online and through in-person events \u2014 supposedly to help fund her expensive treatments, but in reality the money went directly to her personal bank accounts, according to the district court\u2019s filing. More than 300 people, whose names were included in\u00a0Riley\u2019s criminal judgment, raised over $105,000 for Riley.",
      "What have Amanda Riley's victims said?",
      "Four people delivered victim impact statements about how Riley\u2019s schemes affected them over the years, per a transcript from a May 2022 court hearing in San Jose.",
      "One statement came from Jessa Gonzalez, the daughter of Riley\u2019s husband, Cory Riley, from his previous marriage.",
      "Gonzalez was 10 years old when Amanda Riley told her she had cancer, and she recalled feeling \u201cterrified\u201d that her stepmom \u201cwouldn\u2019t be around much longer.\u201d",
      "As the years went on, though, Gonzalez said she began to suspect something was off.",
      "\u201cAmanda was always sick, never being able to get out of bed, but I would never see her go to appointments. She had always looked healthy,\u201d she said. \u201cI noticed she would starve herself until she would pass out.\u201d",
      "Gonzalez said she once found an \u201cIV wrapped in Saran wrap\u201d in her little brother\u2019s playroom, and when she brought it to Riley, her stepmother grew defensive.",
      "\u201cShe quickly took it from me and said my little brother took it out of her nightstand,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u00a0 knew better than to question her, as she (would) regularly lash out at me.\u201d",
      "Gonzalez, who was 19 when she delivered her victim impact statement, said Riley\u2019s longterm deception had made her depressed and severely anxious.",
      "\u201cMy hair is falling out from severe stress, and some days I can\u2019t physically function because of how bad she has scarred me,\u201d she said.",
      "Gonzalez\u2019s mother and Cory Riley\u2019s ex-wife, Aletta Souza, also delivered a victim impact statement reflecting on the emotional damage she said Riley had inflicted on her daughter.",
      "\u201cAmanda Riley would tell my daughter she had a few months to live, and then a miracle, she was in remission, and then again dying, and then remission, and on and on. The toll that takes on a child, and that damage caused, is immeasurable,\u201d she said.",
      "The court also heard victim impact statements from Lindsey Wilder, who frequently donated platelets in honor of Riley, and Lisa Berry, a former friend of Riley.",
      "Berry said Riley told her about her cancer diagnosis in 2010, and asked her and her husband to help pay for life-saving blood tests.",
      "\u201cWe gave her the needed money. Within a couple days, she posted glamorous photos of herself taken by a professional photographer,\u201d Berry said. \u201cI became suspicious that the money I had given her was used to pay for this photo shoot.\u201d",
      "Berry said she and her husband began to see through Riley\u2019s lies, which they found especially upsetting considering that Berry\u2019s husband\u2019s first wife had died from cancer after a long battle with the disease.",
      "They eventually cut all ties with Riley, and said they were dismayed to learn that Riley was telling others in 2012 that she had been newly diagnosed with cancer.",
      "\u201cAmanda Riley was faking cancer and scamming on an even larger scale,\u201d Berry said. \u201cMy husband and I were revolted to learn that this was happening all over again.\u201d",
      "As part of her sentence, Riley was ordered to pay restitution of more than $105,000 to hundreds of people who donated to her fraudulent cancer-related fundraisers. A 2022 court document includes a list of every person owed restitution, including several people who donated small amounts of $10 or $25, and others who donated several thousand dollars to Riley.",
      "What has Amanda Riley said about her actions?",
      "Riley delivered a statement at her sentencing hearing on May 3, 2022, according to the same court transcript.",
      "\u201cYour Honor, there aren\u2019t enough words to adequately express how horrific I feel and how sorry I am that this happened,\u201d she said. \u201cMy heart aches every day, thinking that I did something that hurt other people. This is the worst thing I\u2019ve ever done and the worst mistake I could have made.\u201d",
      "She also said she felt \u201cashamed\u201d by her actions, and said she had \u201cbeen dealing with the repercussions of this for years.\u201d",
      "\u201cI threw away my dream career, lost all my friends and family. I went from being a nobody, to being negatively covered in dozens of tabloids and news articles,\u201d she said.",
      "Riley also said it was time to \u201cstep forward and be accountable.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m here to accept responsibility and humbly accept my consequences as the first step of showing everyone I want to make this right,\u201d she said. \u201cI will spend the rest of my life working towards the amends for the hurt that I have caused.\u201d",
      "She also directly addressed her stepdaughter, Jessa Gonzalez.",

Around the same time, she also started trying out a high-protein diet, which can help with weight loss by keeping you feeling more full and satisfied.",
      "And the original \"American Idol\" made headlines in May 2024 when she revealed that she was taking a medication to assist in her weight loss.

      "She added that she didn\u2019t notice how much weight she\u2019d gained prior to starting the medication. But catching a glimpse of herself on camera one day prompted her to pause and ask herself \u201cWho the f--k is that?\u201d she recalled.",
      "\"My heaviest, I was like 203, and I\u2019m 5 foot 3 and a half,\" Clarkson continued. \"It\u2019s funny because people assume, \u2018Oh she must\u2019ve been miserable, depressed, whatever,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018No I was not.'\"",
      "\u201cI was never insecure about it, I was happy,\u201d she added.",

Some people need (their) bodies jumpstarted, some have diabetes, there's lots of reasons. She has been walking, but this has helped.\"",
      "Goldberg went on to point out the hypocrisy of the comments. \"They kick her behind when she's bigger, they kick her behind when she's lost the weight, and now they're kicking her behind because she said it out loud.\"",

And 90% of the time I\u2019m really good at it because a protein diet is good for me anyway. I\u2019m a Texas girl, so I like meat \u2014\u00a0sorry, vegetarians in the world!\"",

      "\u201cI know the industry loves the weight gone, but for me, it wasn\u2019t really the weight,\u201d Clarkson said at the time.",
      "Back then, to lose the weight, Clarkson focused on a lectin-free diet, she told Extra. Lectins are the proteins that bind carbohydrates. (Talk to a health professional before making any major changes to your diet, such as removing carbs.)",

      "Kelly Clarkson's weight struggles",
      "Throughout her years in Hollywood, the \"American Idol\" star has had to deal with a lot of commentary about her size.",
      "She told Glamour UK in 2020 that being thin doesn't always give her more confidence, adding that she got her coaching role on \"The Voice\" after gaining some weight.",
      "\u201cI got on the No. 1 television show at my heaviest point, because it was right after I had kids, and it was like they didn\u2019t care,\u201d Clarkson said.",
      "\u201cPaul (Telegdy, chairman of NBC Entertainment) hired me from NBC because he loved my personality, he loved that I connect with people and I\u2019m really raw and real. It had nothing to do with my sex appeal or my look aesthetically. It had to do with me as a person. I think it\u2019s really up to artists to force people to have that mentality.\u201d",

      "The period epic is largely set in the 1950s and in many ways, its production revels in the the aesthetics of a bygone era: it was filmed using vintage VistaVision cameras and it includes a built-in intermission, a feature more associated with old classics like \u201cGone with the Wind\u201d and \u201cBen- Hur.\u201d",
      "At the same time, \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d has sparked controversy for something decidedly modern: its use of artificial intelligence.",

      "The film\u2019s director and editor have defended their use of AI, arguing that the technology was not exploitative, but was merely employed to enhance their sound-editing abilities in post-production.",
      "Keep reading to learn more about the AI controversy surrounding \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d",
      "How exactly was AI used in \u2018The Brutalist\u2019?",
      "Artificial intelligence was used in \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d to enhance the Hungarian accents of stars Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones.",
      "The movie\u2019s editor, D\u00e1vid Jancs\u00f3, said that while Brody and Jones spoke Hungarian in the movie, AI was used at times to tweak their pronunciation of certain difficult vowels.",
      "\u201cI am a native Hungarian speaker and I know that it is one of the most difficult languages to learn to pronounce. \u2026 It\u2019s an extremely unique language,\u201d\u00a0 Jancs\u00f3 said in a recent interview with film technology website RedShark. \u201cWe coached (Brody and Jones) and they did a fabulous job but we also wanted to perfect it so that not even locals will spot any difference.\u201d",
      "Jancs\u00f3 added that he and his team first tried using ADR, or automated dialogue replacement, to fix certain Hungarian sounds. ADR is commonly used in filmmaking, and it involves re-recording pieces of dialogue and syncing them with actors\u2019 visual performances to improve sound quality.",
      "The use of ADR wasn\u2019t successful in \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d Jancs\u00f3 said, and he added that attempts to completely dub Brody and Jones\u2019 dialogue using the voices of other actors \u201cjust didn\u2019t work.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, filmmakers worked with a Ukrainian software company, Respeecher, to generate certain pieces of the stars\u2019 Hungarian dialogue using AI.",
      "Jancs\u00f3 says he even contributed his own voice for some of the pronunciations.",
      "\u201cMost of their Hungarian dialogue has a part of me talking in there. We were very careful about keeping their performances,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s mainly just replacing letters here and there. You can do this in ProTools yourself, but we had so much dialogue in Hungarian that we really needed to speed up the process otherwise we\u2019d still be in post.\u201d",
      "RedShark also reported that Generative AI, or GenAI, was used to create architectural drawings and buildings near the end of the film. However, the film\u2019s director, Brady Corbet, later told Deadline that AI was not used in this way in the movie, and that all images \u201cwere hand-drawn by artists.\u201d",
      "Why was there controversy about the use of AI in 'The Brutalist'?Some viewers have criticized the use of AI in \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d arguing that it undercuts the film\u2019s authenticity.",
      "\u201cGenuinely crushed by the AI scandal surrounding the brutalist,\u201d one person wrote on X. \u201cI get wanting the hungarian dialect portrayed in the movie to be perfect and authentic, but doesn\u2019t using AI completely undo any \u2018authenticity\u2019 that you set out to accomplish right away?\u201d",
      "Another X user argued that Brody \u2014 who won a Golden Globe and has been nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th \u2014 should not be eligible for these accolades because his Hungarian accent was digitally altered.",
      "\u201cMy take on The Brutalist AI thing is it\u2019s a slippery slope to award Adrian Brody knowing his accent was edited with AI,\u201d the user wrote. \u201cIMO altering a performance with AI like that should automatically disqualify someone from these awards shows.\u201d",
      "Others questioned why native Hungarian speakers weren\u2019t cast in the main roles.",
      "\u201cThe brutalist and its actors should\u2019ve become ineligible the minute it came out that AI was used on their voices to help them produce a more authentic\u2019 hungarian accent when there are hungarian actors and speakers in the industry they could\u2019ve used instead,\u201d an X user wrote.",
      "Others on social media defending the film\u2019s use of AI, arguing that enhancing actors\u2019 Hungarian pronunciation did not detract from their performances.",
      "\u201cMy take on Adrien Brody\u2019s AI-helped accent in The Brutalist: it\u2019s complicated. On one hand, it slightly diminishes the detailing, but I can\u2019t say the accent was a deciding factor in his performance\u2019s resonance,\u201d one X user said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t moved by the accent; I was moved by how he conveyed emotion.\u201d",
      "Others argued that using AI to tweak the dialogue in post-production was just a form of clever sound editing.",
      "\u201cI love how the filmmakers went to extra lengths to coach, explore variants of ADR, and then discovered this as the best, subtle and sensitive solution. Brody and Jones don\u2019t seem to have any concerns either \u2014 it\u2019s just good old sound editing, accelerated,\u201d one X user said.",
      "Another X user argued that the film\u2019s use of artificial intelligence was a \u201cgreat example of using AI tools to enhance well-known art creation process, not replace it!\u201d",
      "Ethical questions around the use of AI in the entertainment industry have come to the forefront in recent years.",
      "When writers and actors went on strike in 2023, they demanded stricter regulations around the use of AI, seeking protection for artists whose work or likenesses are used as source material for AI, such as to create AI \u201cdeepfakes.\u201d",
      "Fran Drescher, president of SAG-AFTRA, a labor union that represents about 160,000 people in the entertainment industry, called AI an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the creative professions.",

      "\"The Brutalist\" isn't the only Oscar contender this year to draw attention for its use of AI.",

      "\u201cAdrien and Felicity\u2019s performances are completely their own. They worked for months with dialect coach Tanera Marshall to perfect their accents,\u201d he said.",
      "He added that AI technology was only used \u201cspecifically to refine certain vowels and letters for accuracy.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo English language was changed,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a manual process, done by our sound team and Respeecher in post-production. The aim was to preserve the authenticity of Adrien and Felicity\u2019s performances in another language, not to replace or alter them and done with the utmost respect for the craft.\u201d",
      "He also said that while RedShark originally reported that generative AI had been used to create certain architectural drawings and buildings seen in the movie, this was not the case.",
      "\u201cJudy Becker and her team did not use AI to create or render any of the buildings. All images were hand-drawn by artists,\u201d he told Deadline. \u201cTo clarify, in the memorial video featured in the background of a shot, our editorial team created pictures intentionally designed to look like poor digital renderings circa 1980.\u201d",

    "summary": "Katy Perry talks to \"Access Hollywood\" about starting concerts for her \"Lifetimes Tour\" earlier because of daughter Daisy, whom she shares with Orlando Bloom.",
    "story": [
      "Thanks to Katy Perry's 4-year-old daughter, Daisy, the \"Fireworks\" singer is planning on implementing an earlier start time for her global \"Lifetimes Tour.\"",
      "While talking with \"Access Hollywood\" host Kit Hoover, Perry said that Daisy made her realize just how important it is to go to bed on time.",
      "She revealed this when Hoover asked Perry if Daisy was going to be on tour with her.",
      "\"She'll be there for a part of it, but\u00a0I think what\u00a0I\u2019m really going to implement is an\u00a0earlier time show,\u201d the \"California Gurls\" singer said. \u201cNow that I understand it \u2014 all the dynamics and all of the\u00a0different variables and layers of bringing your kids out to the show.",
      "\u201cSometimes those shows are on weekdays, and they go to school the next day, and they probably will have some sugar at the show, and they\u2019ll be with their friends, and everybody will be super excited, so it\u2019s going to be an 8:30 show,\u201d Perry said.",
      "Perry noted that her \"vibe\" has changed a lot since becoming a mom, so she's no longer interested in starting her shows around 9 or 9:15 p.m. As a mother, she fully understands how hard it is to get a kid ready for bed.",
      "\"Now, it takes an hour for bedtime, at least. You're like, 'OK, another book, another song. All of it! Do you want a banana now? OK, water, yes! Stuffy? Don't you have six in the bed? There's six stuffies, how many more stuffies?!'\" she joked.",
      "Perry shares Daisy with her fianc\u00e9, Orlando Bloom, and she said their kid is just as \"extroverted\" as she and her beau are.",
      "However, she said she doesn't think that she'll bring Daisy onstage with her during the tour.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s not shy, and she loves to sing. And I literally was checking my phone five minutes ago, and she has a ukulele in her hands. So, she loves music and she loves what mommy does and daddy does, and she loves seeing us happy,\u201d Perry said.",
      "One celebrity who will be delighted to know that Perry is starting her concerts earlier is Jamie Lee Curtis. In 2023, the \u201cHalloween\u201d star spoke to TODAY's Savannah Guthrie and former co-anchor Hoda Kotb about her schedule and said she doesn't enjoy going to events at night.",
      "\u201cI would love to go see Coldplay. I would love it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe problem is, I\u2019m not going to see Coldplay if they start their show at 9:00 and there\u2019s an opening act. I want to hear Coldplay at 1:00 p.m.,\" she said.",
      "Curtis noted that she loves to wake up early so that she can \u201ccontrol the universe in the morning.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the time when my brain is working and it\u2019s really quiet and nobody else is up and around,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only people I bother (are) on the East Coast and they\u2019re still waking up, so it\u2019s perfect.\u201d"

      "\"One of the things that I realized the very first time I took a GLP-1 was that all these years I thought that thin people just had more willpower, they ate better foods, they were able to stick to it longer, they never had a potato chip, and then I realized the very first time I took the GLP-1 that, 'Oh, they're not even thinking about it. They're only eating when they're hungry, and they're stopping when they're full,\" she said on the podcast.",
      "The media mogul's weight loss first caught the public's attention when she walked the red carpet at the premiere for the remake of \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d in December 2023.",

      "She first confirmed that she is taking a weight-loss drug in an interview with People published in December 2023, but did not confirm which medication she was taking. Many have speculated it's Ozempic, a brand name GLP-1 agonist that's been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat Type 2 diabetes. Weight loss is a famous side effect.",
      "\"I now use it as I feel I need it, as a tool to manage not yo-yoing,\u201d she told People at the time. \"It quiets the food noise.\"",

I\u2019ve got to do that because otherwise I somehow cheated myself,\u201d Winfrey said in September 2023 during a panel on Oprah Daily, called \u201cThe State of Weight.\u201d",

      "How did Oprah lose weight?",
      "Winfrey has lost her latest weight using a weight-loss drug and with a healthy diet and exercising. She told People the weight-loss medication is just part of her regimen for maintaining a healthy weight.",

      "Oprah's weight loss history",
      "Winfrey has struggled with her weight for decades, famously losing 67 pounds with a liquid diet in 1988 then regaining the weight as soon as she \u201creturned to real food,\u201d she recalled on Oprah.com.",
      "In the March 18 special, she said that she essentially \"starved\" herself for five months before gaining it all back.",
      "In 1992, Winfrey reached 237 pounds, the most she ever weighed, she said during the \u201cThe State of Weight\u201d panel discussion. She recalled feeling frustrated that no matter what she did, her body always wanted to go back to a certain weight.",
      "In 2019, Winfrey revealed she was diagnosed with pre-diabetes before doing WW. She then lost 42 pounds with the program, getting her blood sugar and blood pressure back into normal ranges.",
      "Her goal weight now is 160 pounds, though she told People it\u2019s \u201cnot about the number\u201d but about living \u201ca more vital and vibrant life.\u201d",
      "As she approached her 70th birthday, her No. 1 concern was her health, Winfrey said, noting she doesn\u2019t live with a fear of death, but with \u201ca conscious acknowledgment that it\u2019s possible at any time.\u201d",
      "\u201c(I) recognize what an absolute miracle it is that 70 years on, that heart\u2019s still pumping,\u201d she added.",
      "How do weight-loss drugs work?",
      "Ozempic and similar drugs work by mimicking the hormones the body releases when a person eats food, as TODAY.com previously reported. People have reduced appetite, and when they do eat, they feel full sooner.",
      "Semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, targets one hormone, known as GLP-1. Tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Mounjaro and Zepbound, targets two different hormones, GIP and GLP-1, which can lead to even greater weight loss, research shows.",
      "Wegovy and Zepbound are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for people with obesity or those who have complications from being overweight. Ozempic and Mounjaro are approved to treat Type 2 diabetes.",
      "The most common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, stomach pain and constipation. People self-inject the drugs once a week and have to keep taking them to maintain weight loss.",
      "Patients can expect to lose 15% to 20% of their body weight, says Dr. Christopher McGowan, a gastroenterologist and obesity medicine specialist who runs a weight-loss clinic in Cary, North Carolina.",
      "Using a weight-loss medication is \u201cin no way the easy way out,\u201d he notes.",
      "\u201cYou still have to improve your nutrition. You still have to stay active. You really have to stay quite consistent over time to achieve the results that are seen in the clinical studies,\u201d McGowan tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cThe reason these new medications are such game changers is they really are effective, and it\u2019s quite remarkable to help someone who\u2019s tried oftentimes for years, decades, maybe their entire adult life, to lose weight.\u201d"

I spent a lot of time with her, bringing my laptop to work while she was there. What surprised me most was how fast she is. I couldn\u2019t believe how quickly a song would take shape.

      "The \u201cPoker Face\u201d singer continued, \u201cHe didn\u2019t propose to me at the top. We climbed up to the top and we looked around and we took some photos, and then we went back down. And we were just walking back to the room and talking and he said \u2014 actually, it was very Michael to ask me, if he could ask me.

    "story": [
      "SIXTEEN YEARS AGO, Parvati Shallow was one of the leaders of an all-female alliance on \"Survivor: Micronesia,\" Season 16 of the reality competition show.",
      "\"It's like, the Black Widow Brigade. All the girls are coming together, and we're spinning the guys around as much as we can, just spinning them and spinning them until they don't know which way's up,\" Shallow said in a confessional during the season, which aired in 2008. \"And then we're devouring them.\"",
      "Responsible for some of the most famous blindsides in the game's history \u2014 including convincing one player to give up his individual immunity necklace \u2014 the Black Widow Brigade comprised the final four of \"Survivor: Micronesia.\"",
      "Shallow ended up on top, winning the season, its $1 million prize and a moniker that has lasted to this day: the Black Widow.",
      "After winning \u201cSurvivor\u2019s\u201d 16th season, she went on to place second in the all-returners season \u201cHeroes vs. Villains.\u201d She played again a decade later on Season 40, \u201cWinners at War,\u201d and solidified her status as reality TV royalty in recent years with appearances on \u201cThe Traitors\u201d and now, \u201cDeal or No Deal Island.\u201d",
      "Some of the archetypes that have been ascribed to her throughout her time on TV, which started when she was just 23 on \"Survivor: Cook Islands,\" include: the flirt, a villain, a manipulator and more.",
      "\"I think the Black Widow has served me very well. It's like a persona of its own,\" Shallow, now 42, tells TODAY.com. \"People see me as the Black Widow, and I think it helps people to characterize me. To kind of lock in and understand me, quote unquote, in a way that simplifies me for people and lets them feel like they know me.\"",
      "But, she adds, \"It's not all of me.\"",
      "\"SURVIVOR: MICRONESIA\" ALSO HAPPENS to be the last time Shallow played a reality TV game with newbies to the genre.",
      "Shallow is currently starring in Season 2 of \"Deal or No Deal Island,\" a tropical twist on the classic \"suitcase game,\" as Shallow calls it.",
      "The game involves contestants living on a remote destination known simply as the \"Banker's Island.\" Through a series of challenges, contestants hunt for cases. Having the highest value cases lets that person pick who has to face the Banker in a traditional game of \"Deal or No Deal.\" If that person makes an unfavorable deal, they are eliminated. If they make a good deal, they pick who goes home next.",
      "If it sounds confusing, you're not alone. Shallow describes it as a \"game show within a game show\" \u2014 only with the \"goofiest name.\"",
      "\"Once you get past how silly the name of the show sounds, and you invest yourself in watching it, it's really fun,\" she says. \"It's different to anything I've ever done, and I've done a lot of these games.\"",
      "On the show, she's competing against 11 reality TV newcomers, plus two veterans: David Genat of \"Australian Survivor\" and Will Kirby of \"Big Brother.\"",
      "Shallow describes Genat as her \"male foil,\" citing their similar gameplay and an \"instant connection and respect for each other.\" In essence, she and Genat are playing their own game, from opposite ends of the \"Deal or No Deal Island\" beach.",
      "She's also formed connections with newbies like Phillip Solomon and Dickson Wong. Unlike past shows, Shallow says she's functioning like a coach.",
      "\"Like, 'Let's work together. Let me support you. I'm going to help you see what you're not seeing and just make some moves that might be harder for you to make emotionally,'\" she says. \"I have that experience of doing that, and I can see this as a game rather than as like, real life.",
      "\"Phillip was like, 'People's families. I'm thinking about their families.' I\u2019m like, \u2018No, we\u2019re not doing that right now. Set that aside,'\" Shallow adds. \"We have 10 minutes to get our hair done and makeup done and come up with a strategy to get someone out of this game who's not going to take you out or me out.\"",
      "SHALLOW COMES BY HER ADVICE honestly. Not only is she a life coach by trade, she had a similar experience after her first few bouts on \"Survivor\" in her 20s.",
      "\"There's like a pre-show Parvati, a naive Parvati that played the first few seasons of 'Survivor' when I was very young,\" she says. \"Then I had a good chunk of time, maybe a solid decade, where I stepped out of reality television, and I had a whole life.\"",
      "She got married, welcomed a daughter, Ama, in 2018, got divorced, and in between, essentially figured out \"how to make life work for me,\" she says.",
      "Before that, she says got \"sucked in.\"",
      "\"This label that I got as the Black Widow, this man eater... this person who was willing to betray her friends \u2014\u00a0that stuck with me for a long time and really informed the choices that I made, and I made a big mess of my life from that,\" she says.",
      "That experience, and how she \"climbed out of it,\" is documented in her upcoming memoir, \"Nice Girls Don\u2019t Win: How I Burned It All Down to Claim My Power,\" which publishes July 8.",
      "Shallow says the book's alternate title was \"Torched,\" a play on the \"Survivor\" torches which, if snuffed, mark elimination from the game. Her editors thought it might be too much. But according to Shallow herself, \"the book is intense,\" starting from the story of her childhood.",
      "\"I grew up in a new age, sort of spiritual commune that was run a powerful and controlling guru,\" Shallow says. \"That's why I have a Hindu name, because she was naming the kids.\"",
      "From there, it chronicles her reality TV debut and her experience learning to reject expectations.",
      "\"The book is really a journey of claiming my power, going from being a people-pleaser, wanting to be liked, adapting myself to whatever I thought other people wanted me to be, to then burning all of that down, all of the ways I was trying to fit into society's expectations of me as a woman, as a girl, as a wife, as a mother,\" she says. \"I was like, 'I don't need to do that anymore.'\"",
      "She cites using different \"healing modalities\" over a period of about four years, including about two-and-a-half years of writing the memoir.",
      "\"I was like, 'I need to find a way to make healthy choices because I want to have healthy relationships. I want to build a life that I love that works for me,'\" she says.",
      "Coming out on the other side, she's \"saying yes to these big adventures,\" including more reality TV appearances. She says her season of \"The Traitors,\" which aired in 2024, was a \"test,\" to see if she could truly step back into a game setting and not lose herself in the process.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll be the Black Widow when it serves me to be the Black Widow ... and then I'll also be like a really caretaking mom when it serves me to be that.\"",
      "Parvati Shallow",
      "\"It was a risk,\" she says. \"But when I came home, I was like, 'Oh, yeah. I can do it. I'm OK.'\"",
      "Now, she says the Black Widow role is less of an identity and more of a costume.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll be the Black Widow when it serves me to be the Black Widow. I\u2019ll be the villain when it serves me to be the villain.\"",
      "\"I can step into it,\" she says. \"Just like putting on a pearly headband. I now have that power to put on the costume and take off the costume, whereas in the past, people just put it on me, and I didn't have any control over that.\"",
      "\"I'll be the Black Widow when it serves me to be the Black Widow. I'll be the villain when it serves me to be the villain,\" she adds. \"And then I'll also be like a really caretaking mom when it serves me to be that.\"",
      "IF \"THE TRAITORS\" WAS THE TEST, \"Deal or No Deal Island\" and her upcoming appearance on \"Australian Survivor\" are the rewards.",
      "In addition to Season 2 of the Peacock show, she's set to appear on \"Australian Survivor\" in a special edition of the show titled, \"Survivor: Australia v. The World,\" premiering in 2025.",
      "She filmed the two shows back-to-back, starting with \"Deal.\" Then, she had about one month off before heading out to play \"Survivor\" for the fifth \u2014 and allegedly final \u2014 time.",
      "\"That's it for me. This book is closed on 'Survivor,'\" she says. \"So if people want to see me play 'Survivor,' this is your last opportunity.\"",

      "But as with the previous seasons of \"The White Lotus,\" there are also some darker undertones \u2014 snippets show an apparent robbery, a family on the verge of losing it all and of course, a body bag.",
      "Season 2 of the hit series had viewers gasping, theorizing, dissecting fashion and dreaming of Sicily, all while trying to solve which character winds up dead.",
      "Creator Mike White told Entertainment Weekly in November 2023, nearly a year after the Season 2 finale of \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d aired, that viewers can expect Season 3 to be even \u201ccrazier.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a supersized\u00a0\u2018White Lotus,\u2019\u201d White said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be longer, bigger, crazier. I don\u2019t know what people will think, but I am super excited, so at least for my own barometer, that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d",
      "Natasha Rothwell, who starred in Season 1 and is set to return in Season 3, echoed the hype, revealing during an interview with Vanity Fair in December 2023 that she \u201cgasped\u201d while reading the scripts.",
      "\u201cI gasped out loud a minimum of five times, and this was just me reading them,\u201d Rothwell said. \u201cThe scripts are a testament to Mike\u2019s skill and ability to tell the most smart and entertaining stories. I mean, everything that he does is like a lesson to me as an actor and a performer. And as a writer myself, he takes folks on a journey. Everyone needs to buckle up, because it\u2019s going to get real!\u201d",
      "\u201cThe White Lotus\u201d first premiered in July 2021 and has won multiple Golden Globes and Emmys, including one for outstanding limited series.",

      "TODAY.com confirmed in April 2023 that Rothwell, who played spa manager Belinda in Season 1, will also return. Rothwell\u2019s return as Belinda continues the anthology series\u2019 subtle pattern of bringing back one\u00a0familiar face amid an all-new cast each season.",
      "White\u00a0had told Entertainment Weekly\u00a0he was open to cast members returning for Season 3 \u2014 and beyond.",
      "\u201cIt would be easy to just be full-on anthology, but I think it\u2019s more fun to have little threads through the show,\u201d said White.\u00a0\u201cIf the show goes on for a couple of seasons, it would be fun to have an all-star season.\u201d",
      "Fans of the show know that its cast changes every season \u2014 with the exception of Jennifer Coolidge, who played the wealthy and somewhat stunted Tanya McQuoid, and Jon Gries, who played Tanya\u2019s husband, Greg Hunt, in Seasons 1 and 2.",
      "After Tanya\u2019s stunning demise in Season 2, it seemed unlikely Coolidge would return, though she said during Variety\u2019s \u201cActors on Actors\u201d series that she hopes creator White isn\u2019t done with Greg\u2019s character arc.",
      "\u201cMy hope for (co-star) Jon (Gries) is that he\u2019s not finished with Greg,\u201d Coolidge said. \u201cI hope there\u2019s some comeuppance for evil Greg. I think he should, I don\u2019t know, end up in a meat-grinding machine.\u201d",

      "Where will Season 3 take place?",
      "Certain things about \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d are not expected to change \u2014 starting with the format. Each season takes place in a different White Lotus luxury resort located around the world, and begins with the discovery of a dead body.",
      "The first season was in Hawaii; the second, Sicily. And the third will be filmed in Thailand. (Though Meghann Fahy\u2019s character, Daphne, mentioned in the Season 2 finale that she wanted to vacation in the Maldives, leading fans to speculate that the show would be set in the island nation next.)",
      "The show\u2019s first two seasons were shot at Four Seasons resorts in Hawaii and Italy. Season 3 was filmed in Koh Samui, Phuket and Bangkok, per the Tourism Authority of Thailand.",
      "The Thailand news came after White teased continental and thematic changes for the third season.",
      "\u201cThe first season kind of highlighted money, and then the second season is sex,\u201d White said in an\u00a0interview with HBO\u00a0that aired right after the Season Two finale. \u201cI think the third season would be maybe a satirical and funny look at death and Eastern religion and spirituality. It feels like it could be a rich tapestry to do another round at White Lotus.\u201d",
      "White also hinted at pivoting to a country in Asia during a red carpet interview with Deadline in October 2022.",
      "\u201cWe just turned in our last episode to the network, so it\u2019s hard to think about the next race,\u201d White said. \u201cBut if we did, I think it\u2019d be fun to maybe go to a whole different continent. We did Europe. Maybe Asia ... would be fun.\u201d",
      "What is known about the plot?",
      "The only official information out about the plot of third season is the logline for the series, which reads, \"The social satire is set at an exclusive Thai resort and follows the exploits of various guests and employees over the span of a week.\"",
      "In addition to what White has teased about taking a \u201csatirical and funny look at death and Eastern religion and spirituality\u201d in the upcoming season, he also told Entertainment Weekly in September 2022 that he might return to his original idea he\u2019d pitched for Season 2, which has to do with politics and power.",
      "\u201cI might still do it down the road maybe, if they give us a third season,\u201d White told the outlet.",
      "After visiting Sicily, White decided to change the plot to fit the \u201cvibe\u201d of the country.",
      "\u201cThe kind of mythology of Sicily, at least from the point of view of Americans, is the archetypal sexual politics and role play that you associate with, like, opera and the mafia and Italian romance. I felt like it should be more focused on men and women and relationships and adultery and have an operatic feel to it, so I pivoted,\u201d\u00a0White said."

Israel considers members of the police force to be Hamas terrorists and legitimate military targets, even though some officers also carry out more mundane duties like traffic enforcement and crime prevention.",

      "Kfir\u00a0was just shy of 9 months old when he was kidnapped during the\u00a0Hamas-led terrorist\u00a0attack on Oct. 7, 2023, along with his 5-year-old brother, Ariel, and his parents, Yarden and Shiri Bibas.",
      "He turned 2 earlier this month, having never known a birthday outside captivity.",
      "While all other child hostages were released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners during a one-week ceasefire in November 2023, the Bibas family never emerged from Gaza, and on one of the final days of the brief pause in fighting, Hamas said in a statement that the toddler had been killed in an Israeli airstrike along with his mom and brother.",
      "Around 250 people were taken hostage and 1,200 people were killed on Oct. 7. After Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza in response, more than 47,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to health officials in the enclave."

      "Even before the sun heralded a frigid dawn, a huge and restless crowd set off north along Gaza's coastal road. They were young and old. Many carried large white plastic bags and suitcases, others small children. Some hopped slowly on crutches and others wore flip-flops, while a few even walked barefoot. One pair of young men linked arms as they strode and sang.",
      "As dawn broke in Gaza on Monday, footage and photos captured by NBC News\u2019 crew showed tens of thousands of Palestinians heading toward a checkpoint on the Netzarim corridor, which bisects the enclave, and into the heavily bombed north. The path is named for a former Israeli settlement, and is considered vital by the Israeli military hoping to keep militants from traveling across Gaza.",
      "For many, the journey home after 15 months of Israeli bombardment brought tears as they held onto their loved ones and clutched their belongings tightly.",
      "Others traveled in cars, trucks and rickshaws lined up along the highway, carrying tents and mattresses after seeking shelter in the central and southern parts of the enclave.",
      "Under the terms of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, residents of northern Gaza were slated to return over the weekend before Israel closed the crossings after it said Hamas had breached the deal by failing to release Arbel Yehud, a 29-year-old Israeli civilian hostage.",
      "The hold-up came as President Donald Trump\u00a0said Saturday that Palestinians should leave the Gaza Strip to \u201cclean out\u201d the enclave, adding that he had asked the king of Jordan to take them in.",
      "News that Israel would reopen the first checkpoint in central Gaza at 7 a.m. local time (midnight ET) came Sunday after Qatari mediators announced that Hamas had agreed to hand over Yehud along with two other hostages.",
      "For many displaced residents, the thought of reuniting with family  brought a renewed sense of hope and jubilation. The violence drove some 90% of the enclave's residents from their homes, with many living for months in squalid tent camps.",
      "Palestinians who had been waiting at the roadblocks for two days burst into cheers as Israeli troops monitored from the sidelines.",

    "summary": "Multiple defectors from North Korea spoke to NBC News about the mindset of soldiers sent to fight for Russia in Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Few people understand what may be going through the minds of North Korean soldiers fighting and dying for Russia in the war against Ukraine. But Lee Chul Eun is one of them.",
      "Lee, 38, a North Korean defector and former soldier now living in South Korea, said it is \u201cdevastating\u201d to see troops from the reclusive, communist-ruled North being sent abroad by leader Kim Jong Un, \u201conly to then give up their youth for a land that is not even theirs but the foreign land of Russia.\u201d",
      "He is one of multiple defectors who spoke to NBC News about the training, conditions and mindset of North Korean soldiers, including their willingness to take their own lives if necessary.",
      "Lee said his former colleagues \u201care essentially just sent out to be cannon fodder on the front lines.\u201d",
      "For the first time since they arrived in Russia in the fall, North Korean soldiers have been captured alive by Ukrainian forces, with video and photos showing one man with bandages around his jawline and another with bandaged hands.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who announced the prisoners\u2019 apprehension earlier this month, said they were living proof that North Korea had entered the war, in a major escalation of the yearslong conflict.",
      "The U.S. and allies say there are more than 11,000 North Korean troops fighting in the Russian region of Kursk, where Ukrainian forces launched a cross-border incursion in August. Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang has confirmed the reports.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it is not easy to capture a North Korean soldier,\u201d Ryu Sung Hyu said in an interview in the South Korean capital, Seoul.",
      "All North Korean recruits are taught a song that includes a verse about saving their last bullet for themselves to avoid capture, said Ryu, who served in the North Korean military until 2019, when he escaped to freedom in South Korea.",
      "According to South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service, there was at least one recent incident in which a North Korean soldier, faced with possible capture by Ukrainian forces, tried to detonate a grenade while shouting Kim\u2019s name but was killed before he could succeed.",
      "The South Korean military said last week that North Korea is preparing to send additional troops to Russia after about 300 of its soldiers were killed and 2,700 others were injured. The high casualty rate was due to the soldiers\u2019 poor understanding of modern warfare, as well as the way they were being deployed by Russia, South Korean lawmakers said.",
      "Their willingness to fight and die for Russia could be a major factor in determining the course of the Ukraine war, as well as the level of American military aid to Ukraine under President Donald Trump, who has expressed skepticism over continued U.S. support.Kim is thought to be providing Russian President Vladimir Putin with troops and weapons in hope of receiving technical assistance with his nuclear and ballistic missile programs. His flurry of weapons testing has continued with three launches already this year, including multiple short-range ballistic missiles, a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile and strategic cruise missiles.",
      "Trump drew ire from South Korea on Tuesday after he described the reclusive regime as a \u201cnuclear power,\u201d a phrase that U.S. officials have long refrained from using, as it could signal recognition of North Korea as a nuclear-armed state.",
      "Kim is sending troops to Russia for two reasons, \u201cboth of which are driven by desperation,\u201d said Ahn Chan Il, who served in the North Korean military for over a decade and defected to South Korea in 1979. The first is to earn foreign currency, which is in short supply in North Korea under United Nations sanctions imposed over its weapons programs.The deployment also provides valuable experience for the North Korean military, which has not been deployed overseas since the Vietnam War.",
      "Dorothy Camille Shea, the deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council this month that fighting alongside Russia makes North Korea \u201cmore capable of waging war against its neighbors.\u201d",
      "Lee, who spent five years in the North Korean military, said the troops had been sent to Russia as mercenaries rather than soldiers, noting that they weren\u2019t wearing their uniforms. South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service has said they were given Russian military uniforms and Russian-made weapons, along with forged identification documents.",
      "\u201cEven if they die there it does not matter, because North Korea sent them out without officially recognizing them,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThey were sent there not to bring honor to the country, but to give up their lives and bring back lots of money.\u201d",
      "'No longer a part of the society'",
      "Military service is compulsory in North Korea, which has one of the world\u2019s largest standing armies. Soldiers undergo three months of basic training before being assigned to a unit, said Lee, who came to South Korea in 2016 after swimming for six hours from the North.",
      "\u201cAs soldiers,\u201d Lee said, \u201cthey are told they are individuals who are now no longer a part of the society and their families, and must follow the orders of the supreme leader,\u201d meaning Kim.",
      "They have no trouble believing this, having been indoctrinated by North Korean propaganda from childhood, said Lee.",
      "North Korean soldiers spend most of their time not actually being soldiers but working on farms and construction projects, Lee and others said.",
      "\u201cI think I only fired three bullets per year,\u201d said Lee Hyun-seung, who served in the North Korean military for more than three years. When he moved to a more elite unit, he said, \u201cwe had more like 20 bullets.\u201dAsked whether he thought the North Korean troops could help Russia win the war, Lee \u2014 whose family defected in 2014 and who now lives in the U.S. \u2014 was skeptical.",
      "\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not that sure,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I know their training and I know they are not well trained.\u201d",
      "For North Korean soldiers, who receive food and clothing but are otherwise essentially unpaid, the main enemy is hunger.",
      "North Korea struggles with food shortages as Kim devotes the majority of resources to his weapons programs, meaning that, like most of the broader population, soldiers suffer from malnutrition and can even starve to death.",
      "Meals are made up mainly of plain rice, corn or potatoes, sometimes mixed with grass or even tree bark, said Lee Chun Eul.",
      "He said his feelings about North Korea changed gradually, largely due to his exposure to foreign media that finds its way into the country despite tight government controls \u2014 \u201cJames Bond\u201d was a favorite of his growing up in the 1990s. More recently, the North Korean government has been alarmed by the popularity of South Korean TV dramas, sentencing two teenagers to 12 years of hard labor for watching them.",
      "\u201cWhen I look at North Korean mercenaries sent to Russia, I wonder if they would still have joined if they had watched as much foreign media as I did in North Korea,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI also wonder if the North Korean regime and Kim Jong Un\u2019s dictatorship would still be in place.\u201d",
      "The defectors say they hope the North Korean troops fighting in Russia will take the opportunity to leave like they did.",
      "\u201cWhen North Korean workers, who have lived their entire lives trapped in a restrictive system, experience life abroad, they come to see North Korea as nothing short of a prison,\u201d Ahn said. \u201cOnce they realize what freedom could mean, it\u2019s hard to imagine they wouldn\u2019t consider breaking free to live a freer life.\u201dIn addition to finding freedom, they could provide the U.S. and others with valuable intelligence regarding the North Korean military\u2019s strategies and capabilities, which are often exaggerated by the North Korean government.",
      "Ahn and other North Koreans who defected as soldiers have offered Ukraine their assistance against the North Korean troops.",
      "\u201cHowever, rather than directly participating in the war, our focus is on psychological warfare to change the mindset of North Korean soldiers,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough platforms like YouTube or leaflets, we aim to deliver messages to the North Korean troops, urging them not to die meaningless deaths and instead seek freedom.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, they watch with heavy hearts as casualties mount among North Korean soldiers whose experiences they know only too well.",
      "\u201cThese young people did not go knowing they were going to die,\u201d Lee said, \u201cbut died because they did not know.",

      "Inside the Auschwitz concentration camp complex, the soldiers liberated roughly 7,000 prisoners who had been brutalized by a Nazi regime hell-bent on exterminating the Jewish people. The horrors there defied comprehension.",
      "Eighty years later, some former prisoners returned to mark the 80th anniversary of their deliverance \u2014 a date that is known as International Holocaust Remembrance Day.",
      "In the eyes of so many around the world, the survivors\u2019 very existence is a resounding act of defiance against the world-historic cruelty and vast injustice of Adolf Hitler\u2019s reign of terror. Their stories of survival are also implicit pleas to the world: Never forget humanity\u2019s capacity to commit unthinkable crimes.",
      "Hitler\u2019s regime systematically murdered 6 million Jews during World War II, including roughly 1 million people at Auschwitz. The Nazis also persecuted other peoples, including Poles, the Romani, Soviet prisoners, gay men and mentally and physically disabled people.",
      "The Nazis tried to hide evidence of the genocide they perpetrated, including burning the remains of roughly 900,000 Auschwitz victims who were killed in the gas chambers.",
      "Eva Umlauf was only 2 when she and her mother were liberated from the camp \u2014 too young to remember the actual day. But the Holocaust is etched onto her skin \u2014 A-26,959 tattooed on her left forearm, marking her for life, along with some other Auschwitz survivors.",
      "\u201cYou are just a number,\u201d Umlauf, 82, a pediatrician from Munich, told NBC News, explaining how this number will forever make her feel. \u201cBut this number is not only on the skin. This is deeper.\u201d",
      "For Umlauf, who traveled for the ceremony along with her sister, her son and one of her grandchildren, this was more than a personal journey of memory and reflection. It was a moral responsibility.",
      "\u201cThey have to know that it\u2019s true. You know, because it\u2019s so, so unbelievable, unbelievable that nobody can believe this,\u201d she said.",
      "But even given what has been established about the Third Reich\u2019s crimes against humanity, some of the most vital information has still not been uncovered. Notably, the names of more than a million Jews slaughtered by the Nazis are still unknown, according to Yad Vashem, Israel\u2019s official Holocaust memorial center.",
      "Alexander Avram leads a team at Yad Vashem that has amassed more than 2 million \u201cPages of Testimony\u201d and historical documents to verify more identities. The project is known as the Hall of Names.",
      "\u201cThere are no cemeteries, there are no tombstones \u2026 for most of the Holocaust victims,\u201d Avram told NBC News. \u201cEach additional name that we can recover is, for us, another victory against the Nazis, because the Nazis didn\u2019t [only] want to \u2026 exterminate the Jews physically. They wanted to obliterate even their memory.\u201d",
      "Avram said researchers have started experimenting with artificial intelligence to scour testimonial documents in hope of finding names that might have been overlooked. But that technology is useless without firsthand accounts provided by the shrinking pool of survivors.",
      "The Claims Conference estimates that only 1,000 survivors of Auschwitz are still alive. In that regard, Avram\u2019s team is \u201cin a rush against time,\u201d he said.",
      "The anniversary comes at a troubling and unsettled time. Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack on Israel, Israel\u2019s ensuing war in Gaza and the proliferation of hate speech on social media have fueled a worldwide spike in antisemitism.",
      "In some countries, basic knowledge of the Holocaust is eroding.",
      "The Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, a nonprofit organization that helps Holocaust victims seek compensation, released an eight-country survey last week showing that 46% of adults ages 18-29 in France, for example, \u201chad not heard or weren\u2019t sure if they had heard of the Holocaust prior to taking the survey.\u201d",
      "Nearly half of Americans surveyed were unable to name a single Nazi camp, according to the Claims Conference\u2019s findings, and more than a quarter (26%) of Americans ages 18-29 disagreed with the following statement: \u201cThe Holocaust happened, and the number of Jews who were killed during the Holocaust has been accurately and fairly described.\u201d",
      "World leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, flew in for Monday\u2019s commemoration. Top dignitaries, including Britain's King Charles III, attended, as well.",
      "\u201cWe really believe that this is the last milestone anniversary where we\u2019ll have a visible group of survivors who are still able to tell us their stories,\u201d Pawe\u0142 Sawicki, deputy spokesman for the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum, said in an interview at the camp Saturday.",
      "\u201cThe choice for this year\u2019s anniversary was very simple: We need to put them into the spotlight,\u201d he added.",
      "In recent statements, Western heads of state have tried to underscore the importance of preserving the historical memory of the Holocaust, known in Hebrew as the Shoah.",
      "\u201cI am against turning the page, saying that was long ago,\u201d German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said at a gathering of the Jewish community in Frankfurt this month. \u201cWe keep alive the memory of the civilizational split of the Shoah committed by Germans, which we pass down to each generation in our country again and again.\u201d",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited the grounds of Auschwitz on Jan. 17, describing the \u201csheer horror\u201d he felt there and vowing to fight the rising tide of antisemitism in his country.",
      "Roughly 50 survivors of Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps attended Monday\u2019s commemoration. In recent days, hundreds of visitors from around the world have come to the former camp to pay their respects.",
      "Josh Sesar, 52, of Los Angeles, who made his second trip to Auschwitz on Friday, said he believed it is vital to see the grounds firsthand.",
      "\u201cI think it is not taught enough in school in America, and if you watch the news in America now, you see the philosophies that people are following now and they are happy to pretend that this never happened,\u201d Sesar said.",
      "\u201cIt is scary, because there are not so many survivors left, and so when there [are] no survivors, people even more so try to discredit history,\u201d he added.",
      "Aron Krell, 98, a Holocaust survivor who was imprisoned at Auschwitz and ultimately liberated from the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria, said it is incumbent on Jewish people, educators, historians and other advocates to keep the legacy of the Shoah intact.",

      "LONDON \u2014 All over Europe, there are signs of a continent steeling itself for the unthinkable.",
      "Lithuania plans to lay mines on its bridges to Russia, ready to detonate should Kremlin tanks try to cross. In the nearby Baltic Sea, NATO ships are hunting Russia\u2019s so-called \u201cShadow Fleet\u201d accused of cutting undersea communications cables. And in Europe\u2019s skies there are plans to construct a vast missile defense system, similar to Israel\u2019s \u201cIron Dome\u201d but with the explicit purpose of shooting down rockets launched by Moscow.",
      "European governments and citizens worry that an emboldened Kremlin may turn his armies their way after Ukraine. There is also widespread nervousness that the new U.S. president \u2014 an isolationist \u2014 has suggested he may not defend America\u2019s historical NATO allies if they are attacked by Russia.",
      "While President Donald Trump this week criticized Vladimir Putin,  Trump has showed few signs of a meaningful shift from that position. On Thursday, he said in an interview with Fox News that Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u201cwas fighting a much bigger entity,\u201d and that \u201che shouldn\u2019t have done that, because we could have made a deal.\u201d",
      "He said little new about NATO or Europe, only reiterating his latest demand for European allies to pay 5% of their GDP toward defense \u2014 more than twice the NATO recommendation \u2014 and lamenting how much more Washington has spent than Brussels toward supporting Ukraine\u2019s defense.",
      "\u201cNATO has to pay more,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous because it affects them a lot more. We have an ocean in between.\u201d",
      "The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. European officials have repeatedly stated that Putin is preparing for a war with the West. For many, this is already happening, with think tank analysts, governments and NATO itself accusing Moscow of \u201chybrid warfare\u201d attacks \u2014 from election interference to trying to crash airliners with firebombs.",
      "\u201cThe Europeans are taking this very seriously,\u201d said retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe between 2014 and late 2017.",
      "In particular, countries in Eastern Europe nearer the Russian border \u201cknow that this is for real, because they live there,\u201d Hodges added. \u201cIt\u2019s only those people who live in Western Europe or the U.S., far away from the Bear, who say: \u2018Come on, this is not going to happen.\u2019\u201d",
      "The core tenet of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is that allies will defend any fellow member under attack. The only time this \u201cArticle 5\u201d promise has been triggered was after 9/11, when Europe helped the United States patrol its skies in an act of solidarity. The main message of that stipulation is that if a country attacks Europe, it will also be at war with Washington, and its intended audience is Russia.",
      "But Trump has repeatedly suggested he would ignore Europe\u2019s distress call.",
      "Plenty of those in Europe\u2019s corridors of power agree that a complacent continent has for too long relied on Washington\u2019s protection. French President Emmanuel Macron, a longtime proponent of European self-reliance,\u00a0said Monday that Trump\u2019s second term should serve as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for the continent.",
      "In comments made at a defense conference on Wednesday, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, agreed with Trump\u2019s assessment of European spending, saying that \u201cRussia poses an existential threat to our security today, tomorrow and for as long as we underinvest in our defense.\u201d",
      "Many of these critics remain nonetheless alarmed.",
      "\u201cWhile every president has complained that European countries don\u2019t do enough, there never was a question about American commitment,\u201d said Hodges. \u201cThis causes a lot of anxiety.\u201d",
      "In the short term, Trump and key members of his incoming administration have vowed to quickly end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, likely impossible without huge territorial concessions from Kyiv. Effectively giving Russia a win would be a signal to the Kremlin that aggression is rewarded and the West has no appetite to intervene, critics say.",
      "\u201cRussia is preparing for a war with the West,\u201d German foreign intelligence chief Bruno Kahl said in a November speech.",
      "For years, experts and government officials have accused Moscow of spreading disinformation, launching cyberattacks and using any other means necessary to meddle in the elections of democratic countries.",
      "Though Moscow denies it. Western officials and experts are near united in agreeing that this campaign only seems to be expanding.",
      "Last month, Finnish authorities seized an oil tanker they suspected of having severed undersea power and internet cables. That was among a spate of incidents that prompted NATO to launch operation \u201cBaltic Sentry,\u201d stepping up maritime patrols.",
      "Meanwhile, Western officials said Russia was responsible for sending two incendiary devices to DHL logistics hubs in Germany and the United Kingdom in July as part of a wider sabotage campaign to possibly start fires aboard North America-bound aircraft.",
      "In response, Europe has reversed decades of military underfunding, with most of its big powers now hitting the NATO guideline of 2% of GDP spent on defense. Spending started to increase in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea, although Trump is widely credited for accelerating it.",
      "On Wednesday, the European Union\u2019s defense commissioner, Andrius Kubilius, announced that Lithuania intends to spend between 5% and 6% of its GDP on defense in the coming years.",
      "Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has focused minds further.",
      "In March, the European Union allocated 500 million euros (around $515 million) to double shell ammunition production to 2 million units per year. And 22 countries have now joined the European Sky Shield Initiative, a continentwide missile defense system designed to protect against Russian attacks.",
      "\u201cEurope must be prepared for the most extreme military contingencies,\u201d a spokesperson for the bloc told NBC News in an email when asked whether the continent was preparing for a worst-case scenario of war with Russia. \u201cPut simply: to prevent war we need to spend more. If we wait more, it\u2019ll cost us more.\u201d",
      "Asked if that change was prompted by Trump\u2019s suggestion he may not defend Europe as well as Putin, the spokesperson referred only to the Russian president, whose war in Ukraine they said \u201cchallenges the international rules-based order itself.\u201d",
      "For its part, Ukraine\u2019s reaction to the re-election and inauguration of Trump has been assiduously diplomatic. On Inauguration Day, Zelenskyy said in a post on X that Trump \u201cis always decisive\u201d and that his second term was an opportunity to \u201cachieve a long-term and just peace.\u201d",
      "Whatever the impetus, \u201cthe mindset has changed big time,\u201d said Vytis Jurkonis, who leads the Lithuanian office of Freedom House, an international pro-democracy group.",
      "\u201cWe need to make it very clear to the Kremlin that any attack against a NATO member is going to cost and have consequences,\u201d said Jurkonis, who also teaches politics at Lithuania\u2019s Vilnius University.",
      "The Baltic countries of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are particularly vulnerable, perched on the Baltic Sea between mainland Russia and the heavily militarized Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.",
      "For decades occupied by the Soviet Union, these now-Westernized states are only now constructing \u201cthe Baltic Defense Line,\u201d a frontier hundreds of miles long dotted with anti-tank trenches and pillboxes. Lithuania has already purchased warehouses full of \u201cdragon\u2019s teeth\u201d \u2014 concrete pyramids designed to stop tanks \u2014 and plans to mine its bridges to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, its defense ministry told NBC News.",
      "Lithuania recently said it would raise defense spending to 5% of GDP, the highest in NATO and far more, proportionally, than Washington\u2019s 3.4%. That\u2019s still lower than Russia, with the Kremlin effectively reordering its economy along a war footing and committing at least 6.2% of its inflation-hit finances to its military.",
      "In western Scandinavia, meanwhile, Norway has updated its emergency preparedness booklet that it hands out to all citizens, telling them how much water, food and other supplies to stockpile in case of \u201cacts of war.\u201d The 20-page document has historically focused on extreme weather and accidents, but its most recent version notes that \u201cwe live in an increasingly turbulent world\u201d and warns that \u201cin the event of an act of war, you may be notified that you should seek shelter.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Swedish church authorities \u2014 on guidance from Sweden\u2019s armed forces \u2014 have begun looking for extra cemetery space should such a conflict reach their shores. And Germany committed around 100 million euros to reinstate public sirens that were removed when the Iron Curtain fell.",
      "And yet there are plenty of observers who believe that Europe is not doing nearly enough.",
      "Western European countries such as Germany, France and the United Kingdom have only committed \u201csmall percentage uplifts to defense budgets, which is nothing like the transformative investment\u201d in Eastern Europe, said Keir Giles, a leading defense analyst at London\u2019s Chatham House think tank.",
      "For Giles, author of \u201cWho Will Defend Europe? An Awakened Russia and a Sleeping Continent,\u201d the problem is that \u201ccountries further away are still pretending that war is something that happens to other people.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s more, efforts are further complicated by the political situation. Europe\u2019s mainstream parties are being challenged by populists, who often mix their vehement opposition to immigration with a softer \u2014 and sometimes even friendly \u2014 stance toward Russia.",
      "That\u2019s a problem for those who argue Russia\u2019s war on Europe has already begun.",
      "\u201cAnybody who isn\u2019t worried hasn\u2019t been paying attention,\u201d said Giles."

      "BEIJING \u2014 For women in China, it may feel as if there is little to laugh about these days.",
      "The world\u2019s second-largest economy is struggling to recover from the pandemic, and the government is cracking down on feminist activism as it encourages women to embrace \u201ctraditional\u201d female roles as wives and mothers.",
      "But women were laughing nonetheless, as amateur performers told jokes about office and family life to a small but engaged audience of about 20 people, mostly young women, at a Western restaurant in Beijing on a recent winter evening.",
      "Alex Wang, the only female performer out of about half a dozen that night, said she felt \u201cempowered\u201d when she first got on stage a few years ago.",
      "Though \u201cbeing funny is the most important thing,\u201d she said in an interview after her performance, \u201cI want to grow not just as a comedian but as a woman finding her voice in this space.\u201d",
      "The growing role of women in China\u2019s stand-up scene, along with the recent success of funny female-oriented films, reflect one way feminism is breaking into the Chinese mainstream: through comedy.",
      "The feminist movement is facing strong resistance in China, even as women attain new educational heights and make strides in the workplace.",
      "For the first time in decades, there is not a single woman among the 24 members of the Politburo, the senior leadership of the ruling Chinese Communist Party.\u00a0President Xi Jinping has personally called on women to embrace a \u201cchildbearing culture\u201d as the world\u2019s once-most-populous country struggles with low birth rates.",
      "The government has made no secret of its crackdown on feminist activity. In June, Chinese journalist and #MeToo activist Huang Xueqin was sentenced to five years in prison for subversion.",
      "But even Chinese state media had praise for \u201cHer Story,\u201d a feminist comedy directed by and starring women that was a box-office hit in China late last year. The state-run newspaper People\u2019s Daily lauded the film\u2019s portrayal of the \u201chumorous and absurd\u201d aspects of daily life.",
      "The film has been described as China\u2019s answer to the 2023 hit \u201cBarbie,\u201d openly calling out stereotypes about women, sexuality, single parenting and divorce \u2014 all issues that can be sensitive here.",
      "\u201cHer Story\u201d may be able to get around that in part because its social critique is couched in comedy, said Feng Yuan, the founding director of Beijing Equality, a women\u2019s rights and gender equality nongovernment organization.",
      "In addition to helping evade censors, comedy is a \u201chandy tool to speak out your anger,\u201d she said.",
      "The film tells the story of Wang Tiemei, a newly unemployed single mother of a 9-year-old daughter, and their young female neighbor Xiao Ye in Shanghai. Despite their different personalities, the two women form a strong bond as they navigate personal challenges, including Wang\u2019s abusive ex-husband.",
      "Its frank tone has also inspired discussions about female sexuality akin to those set off by recent U.S. films such as the Nicole Kidman-starring erotic thriller \u201cBabygirl.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty rare to see stories about single moms or just women\u2019s lives in general,\u201d Zhang Tong, 25, said at a Beijing theater last month after seeing \u201cHer Story,\u201d which she called \u201cquite moving.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will help more women, especially young women, understand themselves better and feel empowered to live for themselves,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cHer Story\u201d has made 720 million yuan ($99 million) since its release on Nov. 22, according to the Chinese box office site Maoyan, and has a score of 9.1 out of 10 on Douban, a Chinese film rating site.",
      "Though the film did not crack China\u2019s top 10 highest-grossing films last year, another movie directed by and starring women, \u201cYolo,\u201d topped the list at 3.4 billion yuan ($470 million). Its director, Chinese comedian Jia Ling, also directed the 2021 female-oriented comedy \u201cHi, Mom,\u201d which grossed more than 5.4 billion yuan ($742 million), making her the world\u2019s top-grossing female filmmaker until Greta Gerwig with \u201cBarbie.\u201d",
      "The success of these films marks a shift in the Chinese box office, the second-largest in the world after the United States, where the biggest movies have typically been male-dominated, patriotism-themed blockbusters.",
      "\u201cMy movie delivers something different from others, showing some novelty, so people like it,\u201d Shao Yihui, the director of \u201cHer Story,\u201d told state-run broadcaster CCTV.",
      "Women who perform stand-up comedy in China say they are also offering something different in an industry that only a few years ago was a sea of men.",
      "Wang said her jokes are informed partly by her experience as a woman.",
      "\u201cFor example, earlier I had a bit where I made fun of those awful guys who think everyone in the world is into them,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve also done material on topics like period stigma.\u201d",
      "She cited the influence of Yang Li, who is perhaps the most recognizable female figure in Chinese stand-up comedy. At her peak, she performed in front of millions of viewers on national television, delivering punchlines on the male psyche.",
      "\u201cI think what she and other everyday female comedians talk about, especially from a female perspective, really reflects the current state of society,\u201d Wang said. \u201cTheir material brings attention to issues women face, and you can clearly see how those jokes resonate with people.\u201d",
      "But they don\u2019t resonate with everyone.",
      "In October, Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com ended a promotional campaign featuring Yang after men offended by her ribbing flooded social media with complaints and accused of her of provoking \u201cgender antagonism,\u201d a term also used by Chinese state media to criticize feminism.",
      "As feminists have raised their voices in China, so have those with misogynist views, Feng said, and Yang made for a clear target.",
      "\u201cThey are always looking for some outlet to release their anger,\u201d she said.",
      "Chinese comedians say they have to be mindful of censors as well as fragile egos and cultural sensitivities. In 2023, a Chinese entertainment firm representing a stand-up comic was fined almost $2 million after he was accused of insulting the People\u2019s Liberation Army during a Beijing performance. The entire industry went to ground for more than a year, with stand-up comedy not returning to Chinese television until last fall.",
      "\u201cFor a Chinese audience, a lot of topics, it is kind of like we are not sure if we can laugh at that,\u201d said Nico Toomuch, 34, a stand-up comedian in Beijing.",
      "That hasn\u2019t stopped Toomuch, who has been performing since 2016, from joking about everything from marriage to menstruation and depression \u2014 drawing in part on her strengths as a woman.",
      "\u201cWe are more sensitive, emotional, and we are better at observing things,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we can take a joke, so we can deliver one.\u201d"

      "Speaking in the room where Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece is displayed, Macron said a new entrance to the museum would be built near the River Seine and underground rooms would also be created.",
      "While he did not disclose the cost, it is estimated that it could run into hundreds of millions of euros.",
      "One of the ways of financing the project could be to raise prices for visitors from outside the European Union, he said. \u201cAnother way of financing the project is to increase the number of visitors to 12 million a year,\u201d he added.",
      "Macron visited the museum days after Le Parisien newspapers reported on a confidential memo that the Louvre's director, Laurence des Cars, sent to Culture Minister Rachida Dati.",
      "According to the newspaper, the director warned of \u201ca proliferation of damage to the museum\u2019s spaces, some of which are in a very poor condition.\u201d",

      "The Louvre and the Elysee Palace did not respond to requests for comment on or confirmation of the memo\u2019s contents.",

      "The Chinese startup DeepSeek has made waves after releasing AI models that experts say match or outperform leading American models at a fraction of the cost. The meteoric rise of the previously little-known company spooked U.S. investors Monday, wiping out almost $600 billion in the market value of American chipmaker Nvidia in the biggest drop in the nation's market history.",
      "In China, DeepSeek is being heralded as a symbol of the country\u2019s AI advancements in the face of U.S. export restrictions that Beijing says are aimed at suppressing its technological development.",
      "\u201cThis jaw-dropping breakthrough has come from a purely Chinese company,\u201d said Feng Ji, founder and chief executive of Game Science, the developer behind the hit video game Black Myth: Wukong.",
      "\u201cDeepSeek may be a national-level technological and scientific achievement,\u201d he wrote in a post on the Chinese social media platform Weibo.",
      "Zhou Hongyi, co-founder of the Chinese cybersecurity firm Qihoo 360, said China would \u201cundoubtedly come out on top\u201d in the U.S.-China AI race.",
      "\u201cIf we are to counter America\u2019s AI tech dominance, DeepSeek will definitely be a key member of China\u2019s \u2018Avengers team,\u2019\u201d he said in a video on Weibo.",
      "So how did a little-known startup become a global AI sensation?",
      "Based in the Chinese tech hub of Hangzhou, DeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, who is also the founder of a hedge fund called High-Flyer that uses AI-driven trading strategies.",
      "Liang has said High-Flyer was one of DeepSeek\u2019s investors, though it\u2019s unclear how much it contributed, as well as a source of some of its first employees.",
      "\u201cOur core technical roles are mostly filled by fresh graduates or those with just a year or two of work experience,\u201d he told the Chinese media outlet 36Kr in May 2023, adding that the company was looking for \u201cdown-to-earth individuals with curiosity.\u201d",
      "By 2022, High-Flyer had acquired 10,000 of Nvidia\u2019s high-performance A100 graphics processor chips, according to a post that July on the Chinese social media platform WeChat. The U.S. imposed restrictions on sales of those chips to China later that year.",
      "Liang told 36Kr that he acquired the chips mostly because of \u201ccuriosity about the boundaries of AI capabilities\u201d and that he had no particular commercial goal in mind.",
      "The stock market rout took place a week after DeepSeek\u2019s Jan. 20 release of an open-source language model called R1, which met with widespread acclaim in what venture capitalist Marc Andreessen called \u201cAI\u2019s Sputnik moment.\u201d",
      "Investors and the U.S. tech industry were further unnerved later in the week when DeepSeek published a technical report that said the model took only two months and less than $6 million to build, compared with the billions spent by leading U.S. tech companies.",
      "The comparatively small spend by DeepSeek showed \"a lot of optimization and smart, capable engineering that can be implemented and deployed to keep up in this race,\" Kevin Xu, the U.S.-based founder of Interconnected Capital, a hedge fund that invests in artificial intelligence technologies, told NBC News.",
      "The surge in interest sent DeepSeek\u2019s recently released app to the top of Apple\u2019s App Store on Monday. The company later said that it was temporarily limiting user registrations \u201cdue to large-scale malicious attacks\u201d on its services, CNBC reported.",
      "New users were quick to note that R1 appeared subject to censorship around topics deemed sensitive in China, avoiding answering questions about the self-ruled democratic island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims is part of its territory, or the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown or echoing Chinese government language. The model appears to operate without such restrictions, however, if it is used not through the DeepSeek website but on servers that host it outside mainland China.",
      "DeepSeek did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.",
      "The R1 model is now second only to California-based OpenAI\u2019s o1 in the artificial analysis quality index, an independent AI analysis ranking. It also beats leading models by Google, Meta and the  California-based Anthropic.",
      "Liang, who according to the China's media is about 40, has kept a relatively low profile in the country, where there has been a crackdown on the tech industry in recent years amid concerns by the ruling Chinese Communist Party that its biggest companies and executives might be getting too powerful.",
      "But he appeared on state television last week during a high-profile meeting with Premier Li Qiang, China\u2019s No. 2 official, who invited Liang and other experts from technology, education, science and other fields to share their opinions for a draft government work report. At the meeting, Li called for \u201ctechnological innovation\u201d to foster the economy, according to state media reports.",
      "China has made AI a national priority, with the goal of becoming the global leader in its technology by 2030. The U.S., concerned about the potential military applications, has moved to limit China's access to American technology, including new restrictions on AI chips issued by Joe Biden in the final days of his presidency.",
      "President Donald Trump said Monday that DeepSeek\u2019s rise \u201cshould be a wake-up call\u201d for U.S. tech companies.",
      "The Chinese Foreign Ministry referred a request for comment Tuesday to the relevant department.",
      "R1 has also drawn attention because, unlike OpenAI\u2019s o1, it is free to use and open-source, meaning anyone can study and copy how it was made.",
      "Most Chinese engineers are eager for their open-source projects to be used by foreign companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, in part because \u201cno one in the West respects what they do because everything in China is stolen or created by cheating,\u201d said Kevin Xu, the U.S.-based founder of Interconnected Capital, a hedge fund that invests in AI.",
      "\u201cThey are also aware that Chinese firms have been taking for free lots of open-source tech to advance,\u201d Xu, the former senior director for global expansion at GitHub, said Monday in a post on X, \u201cbut they want to create their own, contribute, and prove that their tech is good enough to be taken for free by foreign firms \u2014 some nationalism, some engineering pride.\u201d",
      "DeepSeek is not the only Chinese AI startup that says it can train models for a fraction of the price. Kai-Fu Lee, founder of 01.AI, has said that it cost $3 million to train its model and that U.S. restrictions on chip exports forced his company to innovate.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese companies are able to watch the innovations, make some themselves and then do better engineering,\u201d Lee, a former president of Google China, said at a conference in Saudi Arabia in October.",
      "\u201cWhen you do excellent, detailed engineering, it is not the case you have to spend a billion dollars to train a great model.\u201d"
