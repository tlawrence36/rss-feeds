      "CARDIFF, Wales -- Oasis ended a 16-year hiatus on Friday with a punchy, powerful trip through one of Britpop's greatest songbooks, kicking off a reunion tour in Cardiff, Wales to a crowd ecstatic for the band's 1990s hits.",
      "And was there brotherly love between the famously feuding Gallagher siblings? Definitely maybe.",
      "Fans traveled to the Welsh capital from around the world for a show that many thought would never happen. Noel and Liam Gallagher, the heart of Oasis, had not performed together since the band's acrimonious split in 2009.",
      "One fan banner summed it up: \u201cThe great wait is over.\u201d",
      "After a montage of headlines about the sparring siblings was capped with the words \u201cthe guns have fallen silent,\u201d Oasis appeared on stage to a deafening roar, opening with the apt \u201cHello\u201d and its refrain of \u201cit\u2019s good to be back.\u201d",
      "The brothers had a brief hand-in-hand moment but largely kept their distance onstage. Noel, 58, focused on his guitar while a parka-clad Liam, 52, snarled into the microphone with a swagger that has not dimmed in the three decades since the band released its first album, \u201cDefinitely Maybe.\u201d",
      "A crowd of more than 60,000 in the Principality Stadium was treated to a well-paced two-hour set that drew heavily on the first album and its 1995 followup, \u201c(What's the Story) Morning Glory,\u201d alongside a smattering of later tracks and fan-favorite B-sides.",
      "Song like \u201cSupersonic,\u201d \u201cRoll With It\u201d and \u201cRock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Star\u201d sounded as thunderous as ever and sparked mass sing-alongs.",
      "\u201cTurn around,\u201d a tambourine-clutching Liam exhorted the crowd before launching into \u201cCigarettes and Alcohol,\" another classic. \u201cPut your arms over each other like you love each other.\"",
      "There was poignancy on \u201cLive Forever\u201d when an image of Liverpool Football Club player Diogo Jota, who was killed in a car crash on Thursday, was projected above the band.",
      "Noel took his turn on lead vocals for several songs, including the touching \u201cHalf the World Away,\u201d and the show ended with encores featuring some of Oasis' most enduring tracks: \u201cDon't Look Back in Anger,\u201d \u201cWonderwall\u201d and \u201cChampagne Supernova.\u201d",
      "Multicolored, sometimes faintly psychedelic projections formed the main technological accoutrement to a show where the focus was squarely on the songs. There was little banter, though Liam paused between songs to check the audience was having a good time.",
      "\u201cWas it worth the 40,000 pounds you paid for the ticket?\u201d he asked at one point, referring to the scramble for seats that saw some fans pay hundreds to see a show.",
      "From the roar of the crowd, it was.",
      "The show in Cardiff kicked off a 19-date Live '25 tour in the U.K. and Ireland. Then come stops in North America, South America, Asia and Australia, ending in Sao Paulo on Nov. 23.",
      "Before the show, the streets around the stadium filled with fans who gathered in groups to sing along to the band's hits and snapped up Oasis-branded bucket hats at 35 pounds ($48) each.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very, very special \u2014 emotional,\" said 44-year old Rob Maule from Edinburgh, Scotland. \"I\u2019m here with three of my friends, childhood friends, and we used to see Oasis across the country.",
      "\u201cFor us, it\u2019s a generational thing. It\u2019s a chapter of our lives,\" he said. \"And then the second generation, as people are taking their kids. It\u2019s really special.\u201d",
      "Vicki Moynehan came from Dorchester, in southwest England. She said her life has changed since she bought her ticket almost a year ago.",
      "\u201cSeven months pregnant \u2014 ain\u2019t gonna stop me,\u201d she said.",
      "Founded in the working-class streets of Manchester, England, in 1991, Oasis was one of the dominant British acts of the 1990s, releasing eight U.K. No. 1 albums.",
      "The band\u2019s sound was fueled by sing-along rock choruses and the combustible chemistry between guitarist-songwriter Noel Gallagher \u2014 a Beatles and glam rock-loving musician with a knack for memorable tunes \u2014 and younger brother Liam.",
      "Then and since, the brothers have often traded barbs \u2014 onstage, in the studio and in interviews. Liam once called Noel \u201ctofu boy,\u201d while Noel branded his brother \u201cthe angriest man you\u2019ll ever meet. He\u2019s like a man with a fork in a world of soup.\u201d",
      "They long resisted pressure to reunite, even with the promise of a multimillion-dollar payday.",
      "Now they have agreed on a tour that sees hem joined by former Oasis members Paul \u201cBonehead\u201d Arthurs and Gem Archer on guitar, bassist Andy Bell and drummer Joey Waronker.",
      "The announcement of the U.K. tour in August sparked a ticket-buying frenzy, complete with error messages, hourslong online queues, dashed hopes and anger at prices that surged at the last minute.",
      "Some fans who waited online for hours at the Ticketmaster site complained that they ended up paying 355 pounds ($485) for regular standing tickets instead of the expected 148 pounds ($202).",
      "The ticketing troubles sparked questions in U.K. Parliament, where Arts Minister Chris Bryant criticized \u201cpractices that see fans of live events blindsided by price hikes.\u201d Britain\u2019s competition regulator has since threatened Ticketmaster \u2014 which sold around 900,000 Oasis tickets \u2014 with legal action.",
      "No plans have been announced for Oasis to record any new music, and the tour is being presented as a one-off.",
      "Music writer John Aizlewood said that it\u2019s an opportunity for Oasis to \u201ctend the legacy\u201d of the band, and remind people of the power of the Oasis brand.",
      "\u201cThere should be a sense of huge joy and life affirmation about these shows. And I think if they can just play it right, then that can be a massive burnishing of their legacy,\u201d he said. \u201c(There is) this enduring love for Oasis \u2014 and love means money.\u201d",
      "Fans were determined to enjoy the moment.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m the oldest sibling of four brothers, so I know they\u2019ll fall out,\u201d said Stephen Truscott, from Middlesbrough in northeast England. \"(But) the first night, they\u2019re going to have an absolute unbelievable blast. It\u2019s going to be the best.\u201d",

      "The U.S. State Department's revelation that it has revoked visas for British punk-rap duo Bob Vylan is the latest indication that the Trump administration appears to have eased privacy restrictions to make public points",
      "WASHINGTON -- When the United States revokes someone's visa, it is typically confidential, with few exceptions. But with British punk-rap duo Bob Vylan and others, the Trump administration appears to have eased privacy restrictions to make a public point when it deems a case particularly egregious.",
      "The State Department\u2019s number two diplomat made headlines when he posted a social media message this week saying visas for the band for an upcoming U.S. tour had been revoked. British police are investigating whether a crime was committed when the duo's frontman led the audience in chants of \u201cDeath to the IDF\u201d \u2014 the Israel Defense Forces \u2014 at a music festival in the U.K.",
      "Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau posted that their visas had been revoked \u201cin light of their hateful tirade at Glastonbury, including leading the crowd in death chants.\u201d",
      "The band rejected claims of antisemitism and said in a statement that it was being \u201ctargeted for speaking up\u201d about the war in Gaza.",
      "Under the Immigration and Nationality Act and certain statutes related to the privacy of government documents, the State Department has for years resisted or refused to discuss specific cases in which visas may have been denied or revoked. Certain exemptions apply, such as when foreign officials and their immediate family members are found to ineligible for entry into the United States for violating anti-corruption or human rights regulations.",
      "However, as the Trump administration pursues a nationwide crackdown targeted at visa holders it believes have engaged in antisemitic or pro-militant behavior, the standard for releasing once-privileged information seems to have been relaxed.",
      "\u201cForeigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said when asked about the public announcement.",
      "She said one reason for announcing the revocations was to make clear that the administration is serious about the standards it will apply to visa holders and applicants.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been public about that standard, and this was a very public event that violated that very basic standard about the nature of who we want to let into the country,\u201d Bruce said.",
      "Other recent cases have been less clear-cut, although some have ended up in public court cases.",
      "Earlier this year, as part of an initiative to expel foreign students who are accused by the Trump administration of engaging in pro-Hamas, anti-Israel or antisemitic activity, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he had rescinded at least 300 visas and expected that number to rise.",
      "Many of those cases were not publicized individually.",
      "One that was: Rumeysa Ozturk, who was detained by immigration authorities in Massachusetts for authoring an opinion piece criticizing Tufts University for not taking a tougher line on alleged Israeli atrocities in Gaza.",
      "U.S. officials said at the time that her visa had been revoked because of adverse foreign policy consequences if she remained in the United States.",
      "Other high-profile and public cases of visa revocations for political reasons date back decades, including actor Charlie Chaplin in 1952 during the Truman administration and an ultimately unsuccessful deportation attempt against Beatles singer John Lennon in the 1970s.",
      "\u201cThe practice of ideological exclusion has a long history in the United States, having been used for decades as a political tool to keep U.S. audiences from being exposed to dissident viewpoints,\u201d the human rights group Amnesty International said in a 2020 report.",
      "\u201cDuring the Cold War, in particular, the U.S. government denied visas to some of the world\u2019s leading intellectuals, writers and artists who, the government thought, might promote Communism or other 'subversive' views,\u201d it said.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- While Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs awaits a jury\u2019s verdict in his federal sex trafficking trial, the once-celebrated music mogul has seen his business empire rapidly unravel.",
      "Combs, 55, who is one of the most influential figures in hip-hop history, now faces charges, including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking involving two former partners and transporting people across state lines for prostitution. Prosecutors have painted a dark portrait of the mogul, whose alleged pattern of violence included drug-fueled sex parties he reportedly called \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights.\u201d",
      "If convicted, the three-time Grammy winner could face life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at how Combs\u2019 business portfolio and public image have crumbled under the weight of the allegations.",
      "Before Combs was arrested and charged, his major business ventures had collapsed: He stepped down and later fully divested from Revolt TV, which was founded in 2013. The network offered a mix of programming focused on hip-hop culture, R&B music, social justice and documentaries.",
      "He also reportedly lost a Hulu reality series deal and saw his once-iconic fashion brand Sean John vanish from Macy\u2019s shelves.",
      "After surveillance footage surfaced last year showing Combs physically assaulting singer Cassie, his then-girlfriend, in 2016, consequences mounted: New York City revoked his ceremonial key, Peloton pulled his music, Howard University rescinded his honorary degree and his charter school in Harlem cut ties.",
      "Last year, Combs settled a legal dispute with Diageo, relinquishing control of his lucrative spirits brands, Ciroc and DeLe\u00f3n. While many of his ventures have unraveled, his music catalog \u2014 for now \u2014 remains intact.",
      "Bad Boy Records may be synonymous with 1990s icons like The Notorious B.I.G., Faith Evans, Ma$e, and 112, but Combs kept the label relevant before his arrest with high-profile releases.",
      "In 2023, Combs dropped \u201c The Love Album: Off the Grid,\u201d which was his first solo studio album in nearly two decades, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e released her critically acclaimed project \u201d The Age of Pleasure \" through Bad Boy. Both albums earned Grammy nominations, with Mon\u00e1e\u2019s effort recognized in the prestigious record of the year category.",
      "Ahead of the \u201cThe Love Album\u201d release, Combs made headlines by returning Bad Boy publishing rights to several former artists and songwriters, years after he was criticized for how he handled their contracts.",
      "Bad Boy Records remains operational, but the label has been significantly shaken by Combs' legal firestorm and it hasn't announced any major upcoming releases.",
      "Last week, a surprise EP called \u201cNever Stop\u201d released by his son, King Combs, and Ye (formerly Kanye West), showed support for the embattled mogul. The project was released through Goodfellas Entertainment.",
      "Bad Boy Records remained active through 2022, backing Machine Gun Kelly\u2019s \u201cMainstream Sellout\u201d under the Bad Boy umbrella. He was a producer on MTV\u2019s reality television series \u201cMaking the Band,\u201d and \u201cMaking His Band,\u201d launching the careers of artists like the girl group Danity Kane and male R&B group Day 26.",
      "Combs has been sued by multiple people who claim to have been victims of physical or sexual abuse. He has already paid $20 million to settle with one accuser, his former girlfriend Cassie. Most of those lawsuits, though, are still pending. It isn\u2019t clear how many, if any, will be successful, or how much it will cost Combs to defend himself in court. Combs and his lawyers have denied all the misconduct allegations and dismissed his accusers as out for a big payday.",
      "Federal prosecutors have also informed the court that if Combs is convicted, they would seek to have him forfeit any assets, including property, \u201cused to commit or facilitate\u201d his crimes. They won\u2019t detail exactly what property that might involve until after the trial is over.",
      "Despite the legal turmoil surrounding Combs, his music catalog remains widely available on major streaming platforms including Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music. None of the streamers have publicly addressed whether they plan to adjust how his music is featured if Combs is convicted.",
      "Interestingly, Combs\u2019 music saw a roughly 20% boost in U.S. streaming between April and May 2025, his biggest monthly spike this year, according to Luminate. The numbers jump coincided with key moments in the trial, including testimonies from Cassie and Kid Cudi.",
      "However, there was a slight drop-off with a 5 to 10% decrease in June compared to the previous month\u2019s streams.",
      "Streaming makes up a fraction of an artist's revenue and is calculated through a complicated process called \u201cstreamshare.\" Most artists see very little pay from digital services.",
      "Sean John, founded in 1998, has gone largely dormant, with its presence disappearing from major retailers like Macy's. There are no clear signs of a relaunch on the horizon.",
      "In 2023, Combs launched Empower Global, an online marketplace designed to uplift Black-owned businesses and strengthen the Black dollar. He positioned the platform as a modern-day \u201cBlack Wall Street,\u201d backing it with a reported $20 million of his own investment.",
      "The platform debuted with 70 brands and planned to expand by onboarding new Black-owned businesses each month, aiming to feature more than 200 by year\u2019s end.",
      "However, as 2023 came to a close, several brands cut ties with Empower Global. It was reported that some cited disappointing performance and growing concerns over the misconduct allegations surrounding Combs.",

      "Members Jin, RM, V, Jimin, J-Hope, Jung Kook and Suga made the announcement Tuesday during a livestream on Weverse, an online fan platform owned by BTS management company Hybe. It was the first time all seven members have broadcast live together since September 2022.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll be releasing a new BTS album in the spring of next year. Starting in July, all seven of us will begin working closely together on new music,\u201d the band said in a statement. \u201cSince it will be a group album, it will reflect each member\u2019s thoughts and ideas. We\u2019re approaching the album with the same mindset we had when we first started.\u201d",
      "They also announced a world tour, their first in nearly four years. The news arrives a few weeks after BTS superstars RM, V, Jimin and Jung Kook were discharged from South Korea\u2019s military after fulfilling their mandatory service.",
      "In South Korea, all able-bodied men aged 18 to 28 are required by law to perform 18-21 months of military service under a conscription system meant to deter aggression from rival North Korea. Six of the group\u2019s seven members served in the army, while Suga, the last to return, fulfilled his duty as a social service agent, an alternative to military service.",
      "Jin, the oldest BTS member, was discharged in June 2024. J-Hope was discharged in October.",
      "South Korea's law gives special exemptions to athletes, classical and traditional musicians, and ballet and other dancers if they have obtained top prizes in certain competitions and are assessed to have enhanced national prestige. K-pop stars and other entertainers aren\u2019t subject to such privileges. However, in 2020, BTS postponed their service after South Korea\u2019s National Assembly revised its Military Service Act, allowing K-pop stars to delay their enlistment until age 30.",

      "The likes of Olivia Rodrigo, Rod Stewart, Neil Young, Charli XCX, Busta Rhymes and Doechii played to tens of thousands onsite, and millions more on TV, during Britain\u2019s biggest and most famous music extravaganza. But it\u2019s little-known rap-punk duo Bob Vylan attracting politicians\u2019 ire \u2014 and a police probe \u2014 after leading a chant calling for \u201cdeath\u201d to the Israeli military.",
      "This isn\u2019t the first time politics has collided with pop at the festival. For half a century, Britain\u2019s big political and cultural divides have found their way onstage at Glastonbury.",
      "The Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts, to give it its full name, was founded by Michael Eavis in 1970 on his Worthy Farm, 120 miles (some 200 kilometers) southwest of London. It\u2019s still run by the 90-year-old farmer and his daughter, Emily Eavis.",
      "Originally a hippie happening with a 1 pound ticket price (about 20 pounds or $27 today), Glastonbury has largely shed its counterculture cachet. These days, tickets for the three-day event cost close to 400 pounds. But it remains famous for its eclectic lineup, unique atmosphere and commitment to environmentalism and other progressive causes.",
      "This year\u2019s event drew about 200,000 people to see almost 4,000 performers on 120 stages, alongside film screenings and live debates on a variety of issues.",
      "Glastonbury was founded in a spirit of hippie idealism that has never entirely faded. In the 1980s, the festival donated some of its profits to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, which protested U.S. nuclear weapons on British soil. It continues to support charities including Oxfam and Greenpeace.",
      "By the late 1980s, attendees included New Age \u201ctravelers\u201d involved with the U.K.\u2019s unofficial and anarchic rave scene. In 1990, some travelers clashed with security at the site, leading to significant damage and more than 200 arrests.",

      "The 2016 festival coincided with the U.K.\u2019s referendum on European Union membership, and the decision to leave the bloc \u2014 which most young people opposed \u2014 overshadowed the event. Many performers mentioned Brexit and the dispirited mood, including headliner Adele, who urged people to \u201clook after each other.\u201d",
      "Performers have often vented their opposition to politicians from the stage. In 2019, rapper Stormzy led the crowd in \u201cF___ Boris\u201d chants aimed at then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson. This year, Irish rappers Kneecap directed the same expletive at Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "In contrast, then-Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn was warmly received at the festival in 2017 after doing better than expected against the Conservatives in a general election.",
      "Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza has provoked heightened emotions that spilled over onto Glastonbury\u2019s stages.",
      "Before the event, some politicians called for Glastonbury to cancel a performance by Irish-language hip-hop trio Kneecap, whose pro-Palestinian comments, critics say, have crossed a line into support for violence.",
      "Kneecap member Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh has been charged under the Terrorism Act with supporting a proscribed organization for allegedly waving a Hezbollah flag at a concert in London in November. He denies the charge, and Kneecap has accused critics of trying to silence the band because of its support for the Palestinian cause.",
      "Kneecap\u2019s energetic set included plenty of pro-Palestinian comments and criticism of the government. But it was the act that preceded them, Bob Vylan, that caused a furor when a member of the duo led chants of \u201cdeath to the IDF,\u201d the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "The Avon and Somerset Police force said officers would review video evidence \u201cto determine whether any offenses may have been committed that would require a criminal investigation.",

      "A top official at the Food and Drug Administration recently overruled government scientists on the availability of two COVID-19 vaccines",
      "WASHINGTON -- The government\u2019s top vaccine official working under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently restricted the approval of two COVID-19 vaccines, disregarding recommendations from government scientists, according to federal documents released Wednesday.",
      "The new memos from the Food and Drug Administration show how the agency\u2019s vaccine chief, Dr. Vinay Prasad, personally intervened to place restrictions on COVID shots from vaccine makers Novavax and Moderna.",
      "Both vaccines were approved by the FDA in May after months of analysis by rank-and-file FDA reviewers.",
      "But internal correspondence show Prasad disagreed with staffers who planned to approve the shots for everyone 12 and older, similar to previous COVID vaccines. The scientists had concluded the benefit from the vaccines and the risk of COVID-19 outweighed the risk of possible side effects, which are rare.",
      "Instead Prasad decided the shots should be limited to those who face special risks from the virus\u2014 seniors or children and adults with underlying medical issues.",
      "Prasad explained that the COVID vaccine benefits must be reconsidered in light of falling rates of death and hospitalization and the possibility for vaccine side effects. It\u2019s the latest in a series of vaccine restrictions imposed by officials working under Kennedy, who has long questioned the benefits of vaccines.",
      "\u201cEven rare vaccination related harms both known and unknown now have higher chance of outweighing potential benefits\u201d Prasad wrote in a five-page memo explaining his decision.",
      "COVID-19 remains a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths and more than 250,000 hospitalizations since last fall, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most at risk for hospitalization are seniors and children under 2 \u2014 especially infants under 6 months.",
      "Top FDA leaders are typically not involved in the review of individual products. Officials like Prasad can overrule staffers, but such cases are rare and often controversial.",
      "News of the FDA documents was first reported by the New York Times.",
      "Prasad was hired to lead the FDA\u2019s vaccine center in May, after the previous director, Dr. Peter Marks, was forced to resign over disagreements with Kennedy. An academic researcher specializing in cancer therapies, Prasad came to prominence during the pandemic for criticizing public health measures, including the FDA\u2019s approval of COVID boosters for healthy adults and children.",
      "Since arriving at the agency he has worked with FDA Commissioner Mark Makary on new guidelines that will limit approvals of future COVID boosters to higher-risk Americans, mainly seniors and those with medical conditions like asthma and obesity.",
      "Those limits match the terms FDA recently approved for Novavax\u2019s shot, Nuvaxovid and Moderna\u2019s mNexspike. Novavax\u2019s vaccine is the only protein-based coronavirus vaccine available in the U.S. Moderna\u2019s vaccine is an updated, lower-dose version of its existing mRNA-based vaccine.",
      "The review team for the Novavax vaccine pointed to data from a study in 30,000 adults, concluding that \u201cthe risk-benefit assessment for this vaccine technology remains favorable.\u201d",
      "FDA staff reached a similar conclusion for the Moderna vaccine, deeming it similar in safety and effectiveness to the company\u2019s original shot.",
      "Last week, the FDA finalized new warning labeling about the risk of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation, on shots from Moderna and Pfizer, the other maker of an mRNA-based shot for COVID.",
      "In his \u201coverride memo,\u201d reversing FDA staff\u2019s decision on the Moderna shot, Prasad pointed to the ongoing risk of myocarditis and questions about its frequency. The agency ordered Moderna to conduct further studies of the risk as a condition for the approving its updated shot.",
      "A spokesman for the administration said Prasad \u201chas raised serious concerns\u201d about the issue.",
      "\u201cWe will not ignore these risks and will ensure that the gold standard of science is used for any decisions,\u201d said Andrew Nixon, in an emailed statement.",

      "\u201cThe executive branch does not have the authority to order, organize, or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress,\u201d DuBose wrote in a 58-page order handed down in U.S. district court in Providence.",
      "Her order blocks the Trump administration from finalizing layoffs announced in March or issuing any further firings. HHS is directed to file a status report by July 11.",
      "The ruling applies to terminated employees in four different divisions of HHS: the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the Center for Tobacco Products within the Food and Drug Administration; the Office of Head Start within the Administration for Children and Families and employees of regional offices who work on Head Start matters; and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation.",

      "The Supreme Court has thrown out appellate rulings in favor of transgender people in four states following the justices\u2019 recent decision upholding a Tennessee ban on certain medical treatment for transgender youths",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday threw out appellate rulings in favor of transgender people in four states following the justices' recent decision upholding a Tennessee ban on certain medical treatment for transgender youths.",
      "But the justices took no action in cases from Arizona, Idaho and West Virginia involving the participation of transgender students on school sports teams. The court could say as soon as Thursday whether it will take up the issue in its next term.",
      "The high court ordered appellate judges to reexamine cases from Idaho, North Carolina, Oklahoma and West Virginia involving access to medical care and birth certificates.",
      "The action was unsurprising because the court had set the cases aside until after it decided the Tennessee case, as typically happens when the same legal issue is being considered.",
      "The rulings all included findings that the restrictions on transgender people imposed by the states violate the Constitution's equal protection clause.",
      "In the Tennessee case, the Supreme Court ruled that there was no constitutional violation in a state law prohibiting puberty blockers and hormone therapy to treat gender dysphoria in people younger than 18.",
      "The justices ordered the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, to review its decision that West Virginia\u2019s and North Carolina\u2019s refusal to cover certain health care for transgender people with government-sponsored insurance is discriminatory.",
      "The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will get back a case from Idaho stemming from the state's ban on certain surgical procedures for Medicaid recipients.",
      "The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver will review its ruling blocking an Oklahoma ban on people changing their gender on birth certificates.",
      "In one other case, from Kentucky, the justices rejected the appeal of transgender minors and their families challenging that state\u2019s ban on gender-affirming care.",

      "A Ukrainian woman, Olha Kurtmalaieva, has endured cancer and war while fighting to bring her husband home from Russian captivity",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 \u201cYou have no moral right to die.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s what Olha Kurtmalaieva told herself as she lay in intensive care, her body shutting down after emergency chemotherapy. Her cancer had progressed to Stage 4, meaning it had spread to other parts of her body and was now incurable. The pain was unbearable. The doctors weren\u2019t sure she\u2019d make it through the night.",
      "She was facing death alone in the Ukrainian capital, while her soldier husband was in Russian captivity in the more than three-year war.",
      "\u201cIf I die now, who will bring him back?\" Olha thought to herself. \"He has no one else in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Against the odds, she learned she was in remission last year. But even after multiple prisoner exchanges, including one that freed over 1,000 people, her husband, a Ukrainian marine, remains a captive.",
      "She hasn\u2019t given up. At nearly every exchange, she\u2019s there waiting, one of hundreds of Ukrainian women still trying to bring home their husbands, sons and brothers.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s everywhere in my life,\u201d Olha said. \u201cHis (photo) is on my phone screen, in my wallet, on the kitchen wall, in every room.\u201d",
      "Day and night, questions circled in her mind: \u201cWhat can I do to speed this up? What did I do today to bring him home?\u201d",
      "Olha was just 21 when she learned she had cancer. It was Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, Stage 2. The tumors were growing but were still treatable.",
      "\u201cAt that age, you\u2019re thinking: cancer? Why me? How? What did I do?\u201d she recalled. Her husband, Ruslan Kurtmalaiev, promised to stay by her side through every round of chemotherapy.",
      "When they met, in 2015, he was 21 and she was just 15. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t love at first sight,\u201d she said with a wide smile, eyes sparkling.",
      "Their attraction blossomed gradually that summer in Berdiansk, in what is now the Russian-occupied zone in the southern Zaporizhzhia region. Three years later, as soon as she turned 18, they wed.",
      "When they first met, it was not long after Russia illegally seized Crimea, Ruslan's homeland, in 2014, and also invaded eastern Ukraine. Ruslan, a professional soldier, had already served on the front line.",
      "From the beginning, Olha understood that life as a military wife meant constant sacrifice \u2014 long separations, missed milestones, and the uncertainty of war. But she never imagined that one day she would be waiting for her husband to return from captivity.",
      "When she describes Ruslan, tears well up in her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s kind, he has a heightened sense of justice,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cFor him, it was a matter of principle to return home and bring our Crimea home,\u201d she said, a loss she fully comprehended only after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "\u201cOnly when I lost my home did I fully understand him.\"",
      "Olha managed to complete only two sessions of chemo before the full-scale invasion. When her long hair began to fall out, she shaved her head. When she sent Ruslan a photo, he didn\u2019t hesitate: \u201cGod, you\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he told her.",
      "Later, he made a confession.",
      "\u201cHe told me, \u2018Yeah, I saw your hair falling out in the mornings. I gathered it all from your pillow before you woke up \u2014 so you wouldn\u2019t get upset.\u2019\u201d",
      "At the time, she believed that losing her hair was the worst thing that could happen to her. But soon after, she discovered what real tragedy meant.",
      "Olha never made it to her third round of chemo.",
      "She stayed in Berdiansk, which was seized by Russian forces in the early days of the war. Cut off from medical care and waiting for news of Ruslan, she quietly began helping the Ukrainian military from inside occupied territory.",
      "\u201cThere was no oncology department in Berdiansk. There was simply nowhere to get treated,\u201d she said. \u201cBut honestly, I didn\u2019t even care that much at the time.\u201d",
      "In early April, she discovered that Russians had captured Ruslan and others from his marine forces\u2019 unit.",
      "\u201cI started to cry, but then I stopped myself. I thought, \u2018Wait. Is this something to cry about? He\u2019s alive. That\u2019s what matters.\u2019\u201d",
      "At the time, she said, their idea of Russian captivity was naive. Only later did it become synonymous with torture, starvation and medical neglect.",
      "Olha left Berdiansk in June of 2022.",
      "\u201cWalking through your own city, but feeling like it\u2019s someone else\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s horrifying,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were Russian flags everywhere. I kept Ukrainian music in my headphones. I was scared my Bluetooth might disconnect, and they\u2019d kill me. But it was worth it.\u201d",
      "She spent several months moving between cities, helping to organize peaceful rallies to raise awareness about Ukrainian POWs. Eventually, she settled in Kyiv. Throughout that time, she paid little attention to her cancer diagnosis, even as her health steadily declined.",
      "Then her condition worsened sharply. Her temperature spiked to 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).",
      "\u201cWhen the doctor looked at my test results, she said, \u2018How are you even walking?\u2019\u201d she recalled.",
      "Her lymphoma, left untreated during occupation, had progressed to Stage 4. Emergency chemotherapy began \u2014 and it hit her hard.",
      "\u201cMy second round of chemo was disastrous,\u201d she said. She developed an intestinal blockage, couldn\u2019t digest food, and was rushed to intensive care. \u201cIt was morphine all night from the pain. I couldn\u2019t stand. I couldn\u2019t sit. They moved me like a dead body.\u201d",
      "In the hospital, she overheard doctors say her condition was inoperable. Then a nurse came to her bedside and spoke plainly.",
      "\u201c\u2018We\u2019re going to try to restart your system manually,\u2019 she told me. \u2018But if it doesn\u2019t work, you may not wake up tomorrow. You must help us however you can.\u2019\u201d",
      "It was the thought of Ruslan, still in captivity, that helped Olha survive.",
      "In April 2024, five days before her birthday, Olha was told she was in remission. Now she juggles civic activism with running an online cosmetics store. She co-founded the Marine Corps Strength Association, representing over 1,000 Ukrainian POWs still in captivity.",
      "In close contact with former prisoners, Olha gathers fragments of information about Ruslan \u2014 she has had only one phone call with him in the past three years. She sent several letters but never received a reply.",
      "Like an investigator, she pieces together every detail. That\u2019s how she discovered that Ruslan had broken ribs and a crushed arm during regular beatings, according to the testimony of one of the POWs.",
      "As part of the psychological torture, he is made to listen to the Russian national anthem repeatedly. A Crimean Tatar and a Muslim, he is given only Christian religious texts to read \u2014 not the worst form of pressure, Olha acknowledges, but still a clear violation of his faith.",
      "One day, a Russian guard struck him eight times on the head with a hammer.",
      "\u201cThe other prisoners said they had never seen bruises like that in their lives,\u201d she said.",
      "Ruslan spent months in solitary confinement. And yet, somehow, he remains emotionally strong.",
      "\u201cHe tells the others about me,\u201d Olha said, her voice softening. \u201cOne of the guys who came back said (Ruslan) told him: \u2018She\u2019s your age, but she\u2019s got a business, she\u2019s strong, she\u2019s fighting for us. She\u2019ll get us out.\u2019\u201d",
      "That story stayed with her.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t afford to be weak. How can a marine\u2019s wife be weak?\u201d Olha said. \u201cWhat matters is that he knows I\u2019ll keep fighting for him \u2014 until the very end.\"",

      "Verny, 59, replaces American Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, the retired archbishop of Boston. O'Malley was the founding president of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, an advisory group Pope Francis established in 2014 to advise the church on best practices to fight abuse and protect children.",

After many years of reform and new members, it has become a place where victims can go to be heard and bishops can get advice on crafting guidelines to fight abuse.",
      "Verny, who is currently the bishop of Chambery, France, has been a member of the commission since 2022 and heads the child protection council of the bishops conference in France, where the church has been rocked by revelations of decades and abuse by priests and bishops. He was among commission members who met with Leo last month.",
      "The bishop has been responsible for doing an annual audit of the French church\u2019s centers for receiving victims, an initiative that was started after a devastating 2021 report into the French scandal estimated 330,000 children in France had been sexually abused over the past 70 years by church personnel.",
      "Cardinal O\u2019Malley praised the appointment, saying Verny has developed in-depth experience helping victims and working with law enforcement and civil authorities to ensure accountability \u201cfor the serious failures of the church in France.\u201d",

      "PARIS -- Cries of \u201cIt is warm!\u201d rang out across the Seine on Saturday morning as Parisians jumped into the river \u2014 legally \u2014 for the first time in more than 100 years.",
      "Public swimming was allowed in designated areas of the Seine, including two newly built wooden decks near the Eiffel Tower and the \u00cele Saint-Louis in central Paris. Before sunrise, a municipal officer skimmed away the last few patches of algae with a fishnet. Soon after, a line of eager Parisians formed, towels in hand, waiting for their chance to jump in.",
      "Woos and cries of joy echoed across the riverbanks as the first swimmers entered the emerald-green water.",
      "Every swimmer wore a bright yellow lifebuoy tied around their waist, part of strict safety measures enforced by a dozen lifeguards in high-visibility vests. The current was weak, just enough to tug gently at their limbs \u2014 a reminder that this is still a living, urban river.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to swim in the heart of the city, especially with the high temperatures we\u2019ve been having lately,\u201d said Amine Hocini, a 25-year-old construction worker from Paris. \u201cI\u2019m surprised because I thought it was going to be cooler and in fact, it\u2019s much warmer than I thought.\u201d",
      "The return to swimming follows a 1.4 billion euro ($1.5 billion) cleanup project tied to last year\u2019s Olympics. Officials now say the Seine meets European water quality standards on most days. Mayor Anne Hidalgo, who already took a dip last year, was there Saturday morning, holding up a transparent bottle filled with river water as a show of confidence. Environmental authorities confirmed bacteria levels were well below official thresholds.",
      "Swimming in the Seine had been illegal since 1923, with a few exceptions, due to pollution and risks posed by river navigation. Taking a dip outside bathing areas is still banned for safety reasons.",
      "From the deck, tourists and morning joggers stopped to watch. Some applauded as swimmers climbed up the steel ladders, grinning and dripping. Others, like Fran\u00e7ois Fournier, remained skeptical.",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t risk it quite frankly,\u201d said Fournier, who lives atop the riverbanks and observed the scene from a bridge above. \u201cI\u2019ve seen things you can\u2019t imagine floating in the Seine, so I\u2019ll wait for it to be really squeaky clean.\u201d",
      "Floating debris still bobbed here and there \u2014 a stray leaf, a plastic wrapper \u2014 but the smell was barely noticeable: no strong sewage odor, just an earthy, river-like scent.",
      "\u201cThis is so chic, to swim in the Seine, next to \u00cele Saint-Louis,\u201d said Lucile Woodward, 43, a resident. \u201cThere are some apprehensions, of course, any time you go to swim somewhere, but I think this is one of the most tested areas in the whole world now.

      "Ukraine said Saturday it struck a Russian airbase in the Voronezh region",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine said it struck a Russian airbase on Saturday, while Russia continued to pound Ukraine with hundreds of drones overnight as part of a stepped-up bombing campaign that has further dashed hopes for a breakthrough in efforts to end the more than 3-year-old war.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s military General Staff said Saturday that Ukrainian forces had struck the Borisoglebsk airbase in Russia\u2019s Voronezh region, describing it as the \u201chome base\u201d of Russia\u2019s Su-34, Su-35S and Su-30SM fighter jets.",
      "Writing on Facebook, the General Staff said it hit a depot containing glide bombs, a training aircraft and \u201cpossibly other aircraft.\"",
      "Russian officials did not immediately comment on the attack.",
      "Such attacks on Russian airbases aim to dent Russia\u2019s military capability and demonstrate Ukraine\u2019s capability to hit high-value targets in Russia. Last month, Ukraine said it destroyed more than 40 Russian planes stationed at several airfields deep in Russia\u2019s territory in a surprise drone attack.",
      "Russia fired 322 drones and decoys into Ukraine overnight into Saturday, Ukraine\u2019s air force said. Of these, 157 were shot down and 135 were lost, likely having been electronically jammed.",
      "According to the air force, Ukraine\u2019s western Khmelnytskyi region was the main target of the attack. Regional Gov. Serhii Tyurin said Saturday that no damage, injuries or deaths had been reported.",
      "Russia has been stepping up its long-range attacks on Ukraine. Waves of drones and missiles targeted Kyiv overnight into Friday in the largest aerial assault since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine began, killing one person and wounding at least 26 others.",
      "The fresh wave of attacks came after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday that he had a \u201cvery important and productive\u201d phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "The two leaders discussed how Ukrainian air defenses might be strengthened, possible joint weapons production between the U.S. and Ukraine, and broader U.S-led efforts to end the war with Russia, according to a statement by Zelenksyy.",
      "Asked Friday night by reporters about the call, Trump said, \u201cWe had a very good call, I think.\u201d",
      "When asked about finding a way to end the fighting, Trump said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t tell you whether or not that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has paused some shipments of military aid to Ukraine, including crucial air defense missiles. Ukraine\u2019s main European backers are considering how they can help pick up the slack. Zelenskyy says plans are afoot to build up Ukraine\u2019s domestic arms industry, but scaling up will take time.",
      "Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said it shot down 94 Ukrainian drones overnight into Saturday, along with 12 further drones on Saturday morning. No casualties were reported.",

      "The Dalai Lama, who is celebrating his 90th birthday on Sunday, made these comments during a ceremony organized by his followers to offer prayers for his long life.",
      "\u201cI have been able to serve the Buddha dharma and the beings of Tibet so far quite well, and I hope to live over 130 years,\u201d the Dalai Lama told thousands of followers who had gathered Saturday in India's northern town of Dharamshala.",
      "Dharamshala has been the Dalai Lama's home in exile since 1959 after he fled Tibet in the wake of a failed uprising against Chinese rule. Since then, he has sustained Tibet\u2019s aspirations for greater autonomy under Chinese Communist Party rule and mobilized Tibetans inside and outside China.",
      "On Wednesday, the Dalai Lama said that he intends to reincarnate, paving the way after his death for a successor to take on a mantle stretching back 500 years. Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama can choose the body into which he is reincarnated.",
      "That announcement ended years of speculation that started when he indicated that he might be the last person to hold the role.",
      "The Nobel Peace Prize-winning spiritual head of Tibetan Buddhism also said that the next Dalai Lama should be found and recognized as per past Buddhist traditions, while stressing that his office will lead the search.",
      "China views the Dalai Lama as a separatist and has insisted that only Beijing has the authority to approve his successor.",
      "Meanwhile, the exiled Tibetan community of more than 20,000 people in Dharamshala is gearing up to celebrate the Dalai Lama\u2019s birthday on Sunday. His followers have put up giant posters and billboards across town, as tens of thousands of people are expected to attend the event, including Buddhist leaders of various sects and followers from across the world.",

      "Abdurrahman Tutdere, the mayor of Adiyaman, and Zeydan Karalar, who heads Adana municipality, were detained in early morning raids, according to Anadolu Agency. Both are members of the main opposition Republican People\u2019s Party, or CHP.",
      "The CHP mayor of Antalya, Muhittin Bocek, was arrested with two other suspects in a separate bribery investigation by the Antalya Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office, Anadolu reported.",
      "Karalar was arrested in Istanbul and Tutdere was arrested in the capital, Ankara, where he has a home. Tutdere posted on X that he was being taken to Istanbul.",
      "Ten people, including Karalar and Tutdere, were arrested as part of an investigation by the Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office into allegations involving organized crime, bribery and bid-rigging.",
      "Details of the charges against them were not immediately released by prosecutors but the operation follows the arrests of scores of officials from municipalities controlled by the CHP in recent months.",

      "The former CHP mayor of Izmir, Turkey\u2019s third-largest city, and 137 municipal officials were detained earlier this week as part of an investigation into alleged tender-rigging and fraud.

      "Also Friday, it was reported by state-run media that the CHP mayor of Manavgat, a Mediterranean resort city in Antalya province, and 34 others were detained over alleged corruption.",
      "CHP officials have faced waves of arrests this year that many consider aimed at neutralizing Turkey\u2019s main opposition party. The government insists prosecutors and the judiciary act independently but the arrest of Istanbul\u2019s Imamoglu led to the largest street protests Turkey has seen in more than a decade.",
      "Imamoglu was officially nominated as his party\u2019s presidential candidate following his imprisonment. Turkey\u2019s next election is due in 2028 but could come sooner.",
      "The crackdown comes a year after the CHP made significant gains in local elections. Adiyaman, which was severely affected by the 2023 earthquake, was among several cities previously considered strongholds for Erdogan to fall to the opposition.",

    "story": [
      "Pope Leo XIV is starting a six-week vacation this weekend at the papal summer retreat south of Rome",
      "VATICAN CITY -- In his very first sermon as pontiff, Pope Leo XIV told the cardinals who elected him that anyone who exercises authority in the Catholic Church must \u201cmake oneself small,\u201d so that only Christ remains.",
      "In word and deed since, Leo has seemed intent on almost disappearing into the role. The shy Augustinian missionary has eschewed the headline-grabbing protagonism of past pontiffs in favor a less showy and more reserved way of being pope.",
      "Leo will disappear further this weekend when he begins a six-week vacation in his first break since his historic election May 8. Leo is resuming the papal tradition of escaping the Roman heat for the relatively cooler climes of Castel Gandolfo, the papal summer retreat on Lake Alban, south of Rome.",
      "People who know and work with Leo expect he will use these weeks away from the public eye and the daily grind of Vatican audiences to get his head around the most pressing problems facing the church. He's a methodical, hard-working and well-prepared manager, they say, who wants to read entire reports, not just the executive summaries, before making decisions.",
      "Here is a look at Leo\u2019s summer homework, the outstanding dossiers he may be studying from now until Aug. 17 in between dips in the pool, walks in the gardens and occasional Masses, prayers and visits in town.",
      "After his election, Leo reappointed all Vatican prefects until further notice, so the Holy See machinery is still working with the old guard in place. But a few major appointments await, most importantly to fill his old job as prefect of the office that vets bishop nominations.",
      "Leo also has to decide who will be his No. 2, the Vatican secretary of state. That job, the equivalent of a prime minister, is still held by Francis\u2019 pick, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, who was himself an unsuccessful contender in the conclave that elected Leo pope.",
      "Even before he gets his people in place, Leo has to get a handle on one of the most pressing problems facing the Holy See: Its troubled finances. The Vatican is running a structural deficit of around 50 million to 60 million euros ($59-71 million) and has a 1 billion euro ($1.18 billion) shortfall in its pension fund.",
      "There are plenty of high-profile clergy sex cases that festered during Francis\u2019 pontificate that are now are on Leo's desk. History\u2019s first American pope will be watched closely to see how he handles them, since he cannot claim ignorance about abuse or its dynamics, given the devastation the scandals have wrought in the United States.",
      "Leo has already said it's \u201curgent\u201d to create a culture of prevention in the church that shows no tolerance for any form of abuse, be it abuse of authority or spiritual or sexual abuse.",
      "On that score, there is no case more pressing than that of the Rev. Marko Rupnik, a famous mosaic artist who was belatedly thrown out of the Jesuits after its superiors determined he sexually, psychologically and spiritually abused two dozen adult women and nuns. Even though the case didn\u2019t involve minors, it became a toxic problem for Francis because of suggestions Rupnik received favorable treatment at the Vatican under the Jesuit pope.",
      "Nearly two years after Francis caved into pressure to reopen the Rupnik file, the Vatican has finally found external canon lawyers to hear the case, the head of the Vatican\u2019s doctrine office, Cardinal Victor Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez, told reporters last week. As recently as March, Fernandez had said he was having trouble finding any willing candidates. Now that Francis is dead, the case may be less politically delicate, even as the priest's supporters maintain his innocence.",
      "Another legal headache facing Leo is what to do about Cardinal Angelo Becciu and the Vatican\u2019s \u201ctrial of the century,\u201d which is heading into the appeals phase in September. The city-state\u2019s criminal tribunal in 2023 convicted Becciu and eight other people of a variety of financial crimes stemming from the Holy See\u2019s bungled 350 million euro ($412 million) investment in a London property.",
      "But the trial was itself problematic, with defense claims that basic defense rights weren\u2019t respected since Francis intervened on several occasions in favor of prosecutors. In the months since the verdicts were handed down, there have been new revelations that Vatican gendarmes and prosecutors were apparently in regular touch with a woman who was coaching the star witness into testifying against Becciu. The once-powerful cardinal has denounced the contacts as evidence that his conviction was orchestrated from the start, from the top.",
      "Leo, a canon lawyer, may want to steer clear of the whole thing to try to give the tribunal the impression of being independent. But Leo will ultimately have to decide what to do with Becciu, who recused himself from the conclave but remains a cardinal with a very unclear status.",
      "Leo has said his priority as pope is unity and reconciliation in the church. Many conservatives and traditionalists hope that means he will work to heal the liturgical divisions that spread during Francis' 12-year papacy, especially in the U.S., over the old Latin Mass.",
      "Francis in 2021 restricted access for ordinary Catholics to the ancient liturgy, arguing that its spread was creating divisions in the church. In doing so, Francis reversed his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, who in 2007 had relaxed restrictions on its celebration.",
      "Cardinal Raymond Burke, a figurehead of the conservative and traditionalist camp, told a recent conference on the Latin Mass that he had spoken to Leo about the need to \u201cput an end to the present persecution of the faithful\u201d who want to worship according to the old rite.",
      "\u201cIt it is my hope that he will as soon as it is possible take up the study of this question and try to restore the situation as it was\u201d under Benedict's reform, Burke said.",
      "Leo has also identified artificial intelligence as a pressing issue facing humanity, suggesting a document of some sort might be in the works.",
      "Also under study is when he will start traveling, and where.",
      "Leo has a standing invitation to undertake Francis\u2019 last, unfulfilled foreign commitment: Marking the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicea, Christianity\u2019s first ecumenical council, with a visit to Turkey. Leo has already said a visit is in the works, possibly in late November.",
      "Beyond that, Leo has received plenty of invitations: Vice President JD Vance extended a Trump invitation to visit the U.S., but Leo demurred and offered a noncommittal \u201cat some point.\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy invited him to visit Kyiv, but the Vatican under Francis had refused a papal visit there unless one could also be arranged to Moscow.",
      "Leo\u2019s old diocese of Chiclayo, Peru, meanwhile, is waiting for their bishop to come home, and then there's Argentina, which never got a papal visit from the first-ever Argentine pope.",
      "The residents of Castel Gandolfo, meanwhile, are aching for a pope to return. Francis had decided not to use the retreat and instead spent his 12 papal summers at home, in the Vatican. The town has recovered from the economic hit of pope-free summers, after Francis instead opened the papal palace and gardens to the public as a museum year-round.",
      "But townsfolks cannot wait for Leo to take up residence and enjoy the town's gorgeous lake views and quiet starry nights. It's the perfect place for a pope to rest, read, write and think in private, they say.",
      "\u201cRemember, many encyclicals were written here,\u201d noted the Rev. Tadeusz Rozmus, the town\u2019s parish priest.",

      "Masked protesters smashed through the windows and looted high-end businesses in the touristic areas of Condesa and Roma, and screamed at tourists in the area. Graffiti on glass shattered glass being smashed through with rocks read: \u201cget out of Mexico.\u201d Protesters held signs reading \u201cgringos, stop stealing out home\u201d and demanding local legislation to better regulate tourism levels and stricter housing laws.",
      "Marchers then continued on to protest outside the U.S. Embassy and chanted inside the city\u2019s metro system. Police reinforcements gathered outside the Embassy building as police sirens rung out in the city center Friday evening.",
      "It marked a violent end to a more peaceful march throughout the day calling out against masses of American tourists who have flooded into Mexico's capital in recent years.",
      "Tension had been mounting in the city since American \u201cdigital nomads\u201d flocked to Mexico City in 2020, many to escape coronavirus lockdowns in the U.S. or take advantage of cheaper rent prices in the Latin American city.",
      "Since then, rents have soared and locals have increasingly gotten pushed out of their neighborhoods, particularly areas like Condesa and Roma, lush areas packed with coffee shops and restaurants.",
      "Michelle Castro, a 19-year-old college student, was among the flocks of people protesting. She said that she's from the city's working class city center, and that she's watched slowing as apartment buildings have been turned into to housing for tourists.",
      "\u201cMexico City is going through a transformation,\" she said. \"There are a lot of foreigners, namely Americans, coming to live here. Many say it's xenophobia, but it's not.

      "NITEROI, Brazil -- A Brazilian hiker who died after falling from the ridge of a volcano in Indonesia was buried on Friday in Rio de Janeiro state.",
      "Juliana Marins\u2019 body arrived in Brazil on Tuesday, a week after authorities confirmed her death. Her family has accused Indonesian authorities of negligence and delays in the rescue and repatriation process.",
      "On June 21, the 26-year-old tourist began summiting on Mount Rinjani, an active 3,726-meter (12,224-foot) volcano on the Indonesian island of Lombok, with a guide and five other foreigners, when she fell about 600 meters (nearly 2,000 feet), Indonesian authorities said.",
      "Indonesian rescuers retrieved her body on June 25. Authorities confirmed her death on Tuesday after the rescuers reached and examined the body, which was found using a thermal drone after four days of intensive searches complicated by terrain and weather. The retrieval took at least five hours because of the rocky and steep terrain and foggy weather.",
      "Millions of people in Brazil followed the rescue efforts. Indonesian authorities and the rescuer team met with Marins\u2019 family to explain the process.",
      "Mount Rinjani, Indonesia\u2019s second-tallest peak, is a popular destination for trekkers.",
      "Manoel Marins, the hiker\u2019s father, told reporters at the burial in her hometown of Niteroi that what happened to his daughter was \u201ca matter of disregard for human life,\u201d blaming what he called Indonesia\u2019s \u201cprecarious public services.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s a tourist destination \u2014 known worldwide, a country that depends on tourism to survive,\" he said. \u201cIt should have better infrastructure, better resources to rescue people.\u201d",

      "For the first time in over a century, Parisians and tourists are getting ready to take a refreshing dip in the Seine",
      "PARIS -- For the first time in over a century, Parisians and tourists are getting ready to take a refreshing dip in the Seine. The long-polluted river is finally opening up as a summertime swim spot following a massive, expensive cleanup project that made it suitable for Olympic competitions last year.",
      "Three new swimming sites on the Paris riverbank are set to open Saturday, including one close to Paris\u2019 Notre Dame Cathedral, another near the Eiffel Tower and a third in eastern Paris.",
      "The River Seine was one of the stars of the Paris Olympics, whether as the scene of the ambitious opening ceremony or the triathlon and marathon swimming competitions. That didn't go without challenging hurdles such as rainfall increasing levels of bacteria, which postponed some competitions.",
      "This time, Paris authorities said all lights are green for the public opening, including hot, sunny weather and water quality results consistently in line with European regulations.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a symbolic moment when we get our river back,\u201d said sports coach and influencer Lucile Woodward, who will participate in the first amateur open water competition in the Seine on Sunday morning.",
      "Woodward already enjoyed a dip alongside Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo just before the Olympics, making her confident things will go well.",
      "\u201cWe're going to enjoy swimming in it, being there and setting an example,\" she said. \"Once people will see that in the end there are hundreds of people who have fun and enjoy it, everyone will want to go!\u201d",
      "\u201cFor families, going to take a dip with the kids, making little splashes in Paris, it\u2019s extraordinary,\u201d Woodward added.",
      "Olympic athletes competing in the river was a spectacular reward for the 1.4 billion-euro ($1.5 billion) cleanup effort.",
      "In the run-up to the Games, authorities opened new disinfection units and created a huge storage basin meant to prevent as much bacteria-laden wastewater as possible from spilling directly into the Seine when it rains.",
      "Houseboats that previously emptied their sewage directly into the river were required to hook up to municipal sewer systems. Some homes upstream from Paris also saw their wastewater connected to treatment plants instead of the rainwater system flowing directly into the river.",
      "Paris Deputy Mayor Pierre Rabadan said water is tested daily to confirm it's safe to swim. Like on French beaches, flags will inform visitors whether they can go.",
      "\u201cGreen means the water quality is good. Red means that it's not good or that there's too much current,\u201d he said.",
      "Tests have been in line with European regulations since the beginning of June, with only two exceptions due to rain and boat-related pollution, Rabadan said.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t make a bet on the numbers of days when we\u2019ll have to close this summer, but water quality seems better than last year,\u201d Rabadan said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a natural environment \u2026 so weather condition variations necessarily have an impact.\"",
      "Last year, several athletes became ill after competing in the triathlon and open water races at the Olympics, though in most cases it was not clear if the river was responsible for their sickness.",
      "World Aquatics stressed the conditions met the sport\u2019s accepted thresholds.",
      "\u201cThe legacy of these efforts is already evident, with the Seine now open for public swimming \u2014 a positive example of how sports can drive long-term community benefits,\u201d the organization said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "Dan Angelescu, founder and CEO of Fluidion, a Paris and Los Angeles-based water monitoring tech company, has routinely and independently tested bacterial levels in the Seine for several years. Despite being in line with current regulations, the water testing methodology has limitations and undercounts the bacteria, he said.",
      "\u201cWhat we see is that the water quality in the Seine is highly variable,\u201d Angelescu said. \u201cThere are only a few days in a swimming season where I would say water quality is acceptable for swimming.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll we can say is that we can raise a hand and say look: the science today does not support the current assessment of water safety used in the rivers around Paris, and we think that there is major risk that is not being captured at all,\u201d he said.",
      "Some Parisians also have shown skepticism toward the idea of swimming in the Seine. The feeling is often reinforced by the water's murky color, floating litter and multiple tourist boats in some places.",
      "Enys Mahdjoub, a real estate agent, said he would not be afraid of swimming, but rather \"a bit disgusted. It\u2019s more the worry of getting dirty than anything else at the moment.\u201d",
      "Swimming in the Seine has been illegal since 1923, with a few exceptions, due to pollution and risks posed by river navigation. Taking a dip outside bathing areas is still baned for safety reasons.",
      "Until the end of August, swimming sites will be open for free at scheduled times to anyone with a minimum age of 10 or 14 years, depending on the location. Lifeguards will keep a watchful eye on those first dips.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity, a dream come true,\" said Clea Montanari, a project manager in Paris. \"It\u2019d be a dream if the Seine becomes drinkable, that would be the ultimate goal, right? But already swimming in it is really good.\u201d",

      "In the sentence, seen by The Associated Press, the court imposed 15-year sentences requested by the prosecution cumulative for each victim, adding up to 60 years. However, the court will follow the maximum sentence allowed at the time of the killings, which was 30 years.",
      "The court also ordered President Nayib Bukele, who is the commander in chief of the armed forces, to issue a public apology to the victims\u2019 families.",

But Salvadoran soldiers armed with assault rifles and machine guns ambushed them and the guerrillas.",
      "The United Nations Truth Commission for El Salvador, which was set up as part of a U.N.-brokered peace agreement in 1992, concluded there was clear evidence that the killings were the result of an ambush set up by Reyes Mena with the knowledge of other officials, based on an intelligence report that alerted of the journalists\u2019 presence.",
      "Other members of the military, including Gen. Rafael Flores Lima and Sgt. Mario Canizales Espinoza were also accused of involvement, but died. Canizales allegedly led the patrol that carried out the massacre of the journalists.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- President Donald Trump campaigned on keeping the United States out of foreign wars, but it didn't take long to convince him to come to the direct aid of Israel, hitting Iranian nuclear targets with bunker-buster bombs dropped by B-2 stealth bombers and Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from a submarine.",
      "Beyond the attack's immediate impact on helping bring the 12-day war to a close, experts say Trump's decision to use force against another country also will certainly be reverberating in the Asia-Pacific, Washington's priority theater.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s strikes on Iran show that he\u2019s not afraid to use military force \u2014 this would send a clear message to North Korea, and even to China and Russia, about Trump's style,\u201d said Duyeon Kim, a senior analyst at the Center for a New American Security based in Seoul, South Korea.",
      "\u201cBefore the strikes, Pyongyang and Beijing might have assumed that Trump is risk averse, particularly based on his behavior his first presidency despite some tough talk,\" Kim said.",
      "Ten days into the war between Israel and Iran, Trump made the risky decision to step in, hitting three nuclear sites with American firepower on June 22 in a bid to destroy the country\u2019s nuclear program at a time while negotiations between Washington and Tehran were still ongoing.",
      "The attacks prompted a pro forma Iranian retaliatory strike the following day on a U.S. base in nearby Qatar, which caused no casualties, and both Iran and Israel then agreed to a ceasefire on June 24.",
      "North Korea, China and Russia all were quick to condemn the American attack, with Russian President Vladimir Putin calling it \u201cunprovoked aggression,\u201d China's Foreign Ministry saying it violated international law and \u201cexacerbated tensions in the Middle East,\u201d and North Korea's Foreign Ministry maintaining it \u201ctrampled down the territorial integrity and security interests of a sovereign state.\u201d",
      "While the strikes were a clear tactical success, the jury is still out on whether they will have a more broad strategic benefit to Washington's goals in the Middle East or convince Iran it needs to work harder than ever to develop a nuclear deterrent, possibly pulling the U.S. back into a longer-term conflict.",
      "If the attack remains a one-off strike, U.S. allies in the Asia-Pacific region likely will see the decision to become involved as a positive sign from Trump's administration, said Euan Graham, a senior defense analyst with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. strike on Iran will be regarded as net plus by Pacific allies if it is seen to reinforce red lines, restore deterrence and is of limited duration, so as not to pull the administration off-course from its stated priorities in the Indo-Pacific,\u201d he said. \u201cChina will take note that Trump is prepared to use force, at least opportunistically.\u201d",
      "In China, many who have seen Trump as having a \u201cno-war mentality\u201d will reassess that in the wake of the attacks, which were partially aimed at forcing Iran's hand in nuclear program negotiations, said Zhao Minghao, an international relations professor at China\u2019s Fudan University in Shanghai.",
      "\u201cThe way the U.S. used power with its air attacks against Iran is something China needs to pay attention to,\u201d he said. \u201cHow Trump used power to force negotiations has a significance for how China and the U.S. will interact in the future.\u201d",
      "But, he said, Washington should not think it can employ the same strategy with Beijing.",
      "\u201cIf a conflict breaks out between China and the U.S., it may be difficult for the U.S. to withdraw as soon as possible, let alone withdraw unscathed,\u201d he said.",
      "Indeed, China and North Korea present very different challenges than Iran.",
      "First and foremost, both already have nuclear weapons, raising the stakes of possible retaliation considerably in the event of any attack.",
      "There also is no Asian equivalent of Israel, whose relentless attacks on Iranian missile defenses in the opening days of the war paved the way for the B-2 bombers to fly in and out without a shot being fired at them.",
      "Still, the possibility of the U.S. becoming involved in a conflict involving either China or North Korea is a very real one, and Beijing and Pyongyang will almost certainly try to assess what the notoriously unpredictable Trump would do.",
      "North Korea will likely be \u201cquite alarmed\u201d at what Israel, with a relatively small but high-quality force, has been able to achieve over Iran, said Joseph Dempsey, a defense expert with the International Institute for Strategic Studies.",
      "At the same time, it likely will be seen internally as justification for its own nuclear weapons program,",
      "\u201cIf Iran did have deployable nuclear weapons would this have occurred?\u201d Dempsey said. \u201cProbably not.\u201d",
      "The U.S. decision to attack while still in talks with Iran will also not go unnoticed, said Hong Min, a senior analyst at South Korea\u2019s Institute for National Unification.",
      "\u201cNorth Korea may conclude that dialogue, if done carelessly, could backfire by giving the United States a pretext for possible aggression,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cInstead of provoking the Trump administration, North Korea is more likely to take an even more passive stance toward negotiations with Washington, instead focusing on strengthening its internal military buildup and pursuing closer ties with Russia, narrowing the prospects for future talks,\" he said.",
      "China will look at the attacks through the visor of Taiwan, the self-governing democratic island off its coast that China claims as its own territory and President Xi Jinping has not ruled out taking by force.",
      "The U.S. supplies Taiwan with weapons and is one of its most important allies, though Washington's official policy on whether it would come to Taiwan\u2019s aid in the case of a conflict with China is known as \u201cstrategic ambiguity,\" meaning not committing to how it would respond.",
      "Militarily, the strike on Iran raises the question of whether the U.S. might show less restraint than has been expected by China in its response and hit targets on the Chinese mainland in the event of an invasion of Taiwan, said Drew Thompson, senior fellow with the Singapore-based think tank RSIS Rajaratnam School of International Studies.",
      "It will also certainly underscore for Beijing the \u201cdifficulty of predicting Trump's actions,\u201d he said.",
      "\"The U.S. airstrike on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities caught many by surprise,\" Thompson said. \"I think it demonstrated a tolerance and acceptance of risk in the Trump administration that is perhaps surprising.\u201d",
      "It also gives rise to a concern that Taiwan\u2019s President Lai Ching-te, who in recent speeches has increased warnings about the threat from China, may be further emboldened in his rhetoric, said Lyle Goldstein, director of the Asia Program at the Washington-based foreign policy think tank Defense Priorities.",
      "Already, Lai's words have prompted China to accuse him of pursuing Taiwanese independence, which is a red line for Beijing. Goldstein said he worried Taiwan may try to take advantage of the American \u201cuse of force against Iran to increase its deterrent situation versus the mainland.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Lai's series of recent speeches appear almost designed to set up a new cross-strait crisis, perhaps in the hopes of building more support in Washington and elsewhere around the Pacific,\u201d said Goldstein, who also is director of the China Initiative at Brown University\u2019s Watson Institute.",
      "\u201cI think that is an exceedingly risky gambit, to put it mildly,\" he said.",

      "The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage fell for the fifth straight week to its lowest level since early April, an encouraging sign for home shoppers facing rising home prices",
      "NEW YORK -- The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage fell for the fifth straight week to its lowest level since early April, an encouraging sign for potential buyers who have wrestled with rising home prices.",
      "The long-term rate fell to 6.67% from 6.77% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.95%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, fell to 5.80% from 5.89% last week. A year ago, it was 6.25%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "High mortgage rates can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers and reduce their purchasing power. That\u2019s helped keep the U.S. housing market in a sales slump that dates back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from the rock-bottom lows they reached during the pandemic.",
      "Last year, sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. They\u2019ve remained sluggish so far this year, as many prospective homebuyers have been discouraged by elevated mortgage rates and home prices that have continued to climb, albeit more slowly.",
      "High borrowing costs are also putting pressure on the new home market. Last week, the government reported that sales of new U.S. homes fell nearly 14% in May from the previous month.",
      "Recent data suggests sales could pick up in the coming months, especially with the recent decline in mortgage rates. A seasonally adjusted index of pending U.S. home sales rose 1.8% in May from the previous month and increased 1.1% from May last year, the National Association of Realtors said last week.",
      "There\u2019s usually a month or two lag between a contract signing and when the sale is finalized, which makes pending home sales a bellwether for future completed home sales.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation.",
      "The key barometer is the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans. The yield was at 4.33% at midday Thursday, down from 4.58% just a few weeks ago.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained relatively close to its high so far this year of just above 7%, set in mid-January. The 30-year rate\u2019s low point this year was in early April when it briefly dipped to 6.62%.",
      "Mortgage rates have now fallen five weeks in a row, reflecting the recent pullback in bond yields.",
      "The recent decline in mortgage rates appears to have encouraged some home shoppers. Last week, mortgage applications rose 2.7% from a week earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.",
      "Economists generally expect mortgage rates to stay relatively stable in the coming months, with forecasts calling for the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain in a range between 6% and 7% this year.",

      "NEW YORK -- Nissan is recalling more than 480,000 of its vehicles across the U.S. and Canada due to potential manufacturing defects that could cause engine failure.",
      "The recall covers certain Nissan Rogues between 2021-2024 model years and 2019-2020 Altimas \u2014 as well as a number of 2019-2022 Infiniti QX50s and 2022 Infiniti QX55s sold under the automaker's luxury brand, according to Nissan and documents published by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration this week.",
      "The vehicles impacted carry specific \u201cVC-Turbo\u201d engines that may have manufacturing defects in their bearings, the NHTSA's recall report notes. This may cause engine damage and possibly lead to engine failure while driving, the regulator warns \u2014 increasing crash risks.",
      "Engine bearing failures \u201care not typically instantaneous and tend to progress over time,\u201d the NHTSA\u2019s recall report notes. That means effected drivers may see multiple warning signs to look out for \u2014 including abnormal noises or malfunction indicator lights.",
      "In the U.S., 443,899 vehicles are covered in this recall, per NHTSA documents. And in Canada, 37,837 are affected, a Nissan spokesperson confirmed to The Associated Press on Thursday.",
      "As a remedy, the NHSTA's recall report notes, Nissan and Infiniti dealers will inspect the engine pan of these-now recalled cars \u2014 and repair or replace the engine if necessary. The recall covers vehicles with either 3-cylinder 1.5L or 4-cylinder 2.0L VC-Turbo engines. Potential repairs \u2014 which will be performed free of charge \u2014 will depend on the engine and whether or not debris is detected during the inspection.",
      "In an emailed statement, Nissan said it initiated this recall as part of its \u201congoing commitment to customer safety.\u201d And in late August, the company added, notification letters will be mailed out to affected owners \"with instructions to bring their vehicle to a Nissan dealer or INFINITI retailer for inspection and repair if necessary.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, drivers can also confirm if their specific vehicle is included in this recall and find more information using the NHTSA site or Nissan's recall lookup.",

      "Ukrainian authorities are enlisting European help to increase domestic military production as the United States pauses some weapons shipments to Ukraine",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- The decision by the United States to pause some weapons shipments to Ukraine has come at a tough time for Kyiv: Russia\u2019s bigger army is making a concerted push on parts of the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line and is intensifying long-range drone and missile attacks that increasingly hammer civilians in Ukrainian cities.",
      "Washington has been Ukraine\u2019s biggest military backer since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbor on Feb. 24, 2022. But the Trump administration has been disengaging from the war, and no end to the fighting is in sight, despite recent direct peace talks.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at Ukraine\u2019s options following the U.S. pause of some arms deliveries:",
      "Amid recurring concerns in Kyiv about how much military support its allies can supply and how quickly, Ukraine has raced to build up its domestic defense industry.",
      "The country's output has gradually grown, especially in the production of more and increasingly sophisticated drones, but Ukraine needs to speedily scale up production.",
      "Crucially, some high-tech U.S. weapons are irreplaceable. They include Patriot air defense missiles, which are needed to fend off Russia\u2019s frequent ballistic missile attacks, but which cost $4 million each. That vital system is included in the pause, and many cities in Ukraine, including Kyiv, could become increasingly vulnerable.",
      "A senior Ukrainian official said Thursday that Patriot systems are \u201ccritically necessary\u201d for Ukraine, but U.S.-made HIMARS precision-guided missiles, also paused, are in less urgent need as other countries produce similar assets.",
      "\u201cOther countries that have these (Patriot) systems can only transfer them with U.S. approval. The real question now is how far the United States is willing to go in its reluctance to support Ukraine,\u201d he told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of sensitivity of the subject.",
      "The official said that Patriot missiles exist in sufficient numbers globally, and he said that accessing them requires political resolve.",
      "\u201cThere are enough missiles out there,\u201d he said, without providing evidence.",
      "He also stated that Ukraine has already scaled up its domestic production of 155 mm artillery shells, which were once critically short, and is now capable of producing more than is currently contracted. \u201cSupplies from abroad have also become more available than before,\u201d he said.",
      "Amid at times fraught relations with U.S. President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been enlisting greater European help for his country\u2019s arms manufacturing plans.",
      "European countries don\u2019t have the production levels, military stockpiles or the technology to pick up all the slack left by the U.S. pause, but Zelenskyy is recruiting their help for ambitious joint investment projects.",
      "Draft legislation to help Ukrainian defense manufacturers scale up and modernize production, including building new facilities at home and abroad, will be put to a vote in the Ukrainian parliament later this month, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced this week.",
      "Zelenskyy said last month that major investments will go to the production of drones and artillery shells.",
      "\u201cThe volume of support this year is the largest since the start of the full-scale war,\u201d he said about commitments from foreign countries.",
      "Under Trump, there have been no new announcements of U.S. military or weapons aid to Ukraine. Between March and April, the United States allocated no new help at all, according to Germany\u2019s Kiel Institute, which tracks such support.",
      "For the first time since June 2022, four months after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, European countries have surpassed the U.S. in total military aid, totaling 72 billion euros ($85 billion) compared with 65 billion euros ($77 billion) from the U.S., the institute said last month.",
      "Without Patriot missiles, as well as the AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile and shorter-range Stinger missiles that are also included in the pause, Ukrainian cities likely will take a bashing as more Russian missiles pierce air defenses.",
      "On the front line, Ukrainian troops haven\u2019t recently voiced complaints about ammunition shortages, as they have in the past. They have always said that during the war, they have never had as much ammunition to as their disposal as Russian forces.",
      "The army faces a different problem: It's desperately short-handed. It's turning to drones to compensate for its manpower shortage, and analysts say the front isn't about to collapse.",
      "Asked about the timing of the U.S. pause, the Ukrainian official emphasized the need for stable, reliable supply lines.",
      "\u201cThis is war \u2014 and in war, steady deliveries are always crucial,\u201d he said.",

      "Americans have one more reason to celebrate this Fourth of July",
      "NEW YORK -- Americans have one more reason to celebrate this Fourth of July: getting all the gear needed to host a pool party costs less than it has in years, according to a market research company's preliminary data.",
      "The total price to buy beach towels, a beverage cooler, bathing suits and other accountrements of summer fun averaged $858 in June, the lowest amount for the month since 2020, consumer data provider Numerator said in an analysis prepared for The Associated Press.",
      "The finding from the firm's seasonal snapshot comports with broader economic measures indicating that U.S. consumers so far have not seen major impacts from President Donald Trump's vigorous application of tariffs on foreign goods.",
      "Numerator tracks U.S. retail prices through sales receipts, online account activity and other information from a panel of 200,000 shoppers. To see how prices are shaping up for the summer, the company looked at the average purchase price for 16 seasonal items typically made in China.",
      "Along with four towels, a cooler and bathing suits for two adults and a toddler, the hypothetical shopping list for a poolside gathering included a grill, four patio chairs, four cushions, a patio umbrella and four outdoor pillows. Recreation supplies included a cornhole set, two pairs of swim goggles, a set of diving rings, two beach balls and two pool floats or noodles.",
      "Leo Feler, Numerator\u2019s chief economist, offered a few theories for why buying all that stuff cost 11% less last month than it did in June 2023, when the average cost reached a high of $966, and 8.4% less than it did in June 2024.",
      "Wholesale suppliers and retailers that order from Chinese manufacturers may have imported too much stock while trying to stay ahead of high tariff bills, Feler said. As declining consumer confidence measures pointed to the possibility of weak sales, those businesses might have offered early discounts rather than risking their merchandise going unsold, he said.",
      "Given wide swings in Trump\u2019s trade posture toward China, retail vendors may have decided to absorb any initial tariff costs instead of trying to figure out how much more to charge their business customers, Feler said. The tariff rate on Chinese products soared to 145% in April before China and the U.S. reached a deal last month that brought the overall rate down to 55%.",
      "Suppliers often work on six-month contracts that are signed in January or February and again in June or July. That means many contracts for patio tables and chairs, for example, were signed before the White House included metal furniture in the aluminum or steel products that would be subject to a 25% tariff that went up to 50% last month.",
      "Customers who want to buy a new set of beach towels or to replace an old cooler still might want to hold off until August since prices will get lower in late summer, Feler said. But waiting until next year may prove costly, if the tariffs on products from China remain in place, he said.",
      "Just because preparing for a backyard bash might be comparatively less expensive right now, many economists and retail industry analysts still expect consumers to feel the weight of Trump's favorite trade negotiation tool. Shoppers are likely to see higher prices for back-to-school items starting in July and August, according to Feler.",
      "The time it's taking for the extra taxes on imports to reach stores could turn out like the pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions that contributed to U.S. inflation in 2021 and 2022.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like there was a sudden surge,\" Feler said. \"It was a few prices increased here, then a few more prices, and a few other prices, and a couple more prices. And it started gaining speed.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration has accused states and schools of using federal education grants to help fund \u201ca radical leftwing agenda.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has accused states and schools of using federal education grants earmarked for immigrants\u2019 children and low-income students to help fund \u201ca radical leftwing agenda.\u201d",
      "The administration this week withheld more than $6 billion intended for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more, saying it would review the grants to ensure they align with President Donald Trump\u2019s priorities. The freeze sent schools and summer camp providers scrambling to determine whether they can still provide programs like day camps this summer or after-hours child care this fall.",
      "On Wednesday, the Office of Management and Budget said an initial review showed schools used some of the money to support immigrants in the country illegally or promote LGBTQ+ inclusion. The administration said it hadn't made any final decisions about whether to withhold or release individual grants.",
      "\u201cMany of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda,\u201d the Office of Management and Budget said in a statement.",
      "It said New York schools had used money for English language instruction to promote organizations that advocate for immigrants in the country illegally. Washington state used the money to direct immigrants without legal status toward scholarships the Trump administration says were \u201cintended for American students.\u201d Grant funds also were used for a seminar on \u201cqueer resistance in the arts,\u201d the office said.",
      "Officials from New York and Washington state didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Advocates for low-income and immigrant children connected the grant freeze to the Trump administration's larger crackdown on immigrants. Two of the five federal programs put on hold were appropriated by Congress to help support English proficiency of students still learning the language and migrant children who move with their parents to follow agricultural and other jobs.",
      "School districts use the $890 million earmarked for English learners in a wide range of purposes, from training teachers' aides who work with English learners, to running summer schools designed for them, to hiring family liaisons who speak the parents\u2019 native languages. The $375 million appropriated for migrant education is often used to hire dedicated teachers to travel close to where students live.",
      "By \u201ccherrypicking extreme examples,\u201d the administration is seeking to conflate all students learning English with people who are in the country illegally, said Amaya Garcia, who directs education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C.",
      "In reality, the majority of English learners in public schools were born in the United States, according to data from the Migration Policy Institute.",
      "\u201cThe way they\u2019re framing it is that we\u2019re using this money for undocumented students and families,\" said Margarita Machado-Casas, president of the National Association of Bilingual Educators. \"It\u2019s a distraction. A distraction from what\u2019s actually happening: that 5.3 million English learners who speak lots of different languages, not just Spanish, will suffer.\u201d",
      "Even if the students lack legal status, states may not deny public education to children in the country illegally under a 1982 Supreme Court decision known as Plyler v. Doe. Conservative politicians in states such as Oklahoma, Texas and Tennessee have pursued policies that question whether immigrants without legal residency should have the right to a public education, raising the possibility of challenges to that landmark ruling.",
      "Meanwhile, states and school districts are still trying to understand what it will mean for their students and their staff if these funds never arrive.",
      "In Oregon, eliminating grants for English learners and migrant students would \"undermine the state\u2019s efforts to increase academic outcomes for multilingual students, promote multilingualism, close opportunity gaps and provide targeted support to mobile and vulnerable student groups,\u201d said Liz Merah, spokeswoman for the state's Department of Education.",

      "The decision appears on a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention webpage but as of Wednesday wasn\u2019t on the agency\u2019s official adult immunization schedule.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, typically is a coldlike nuisance, but it can be severe, even life-threatening, for infants and older adults. The CDC recommends vaccination for certain pregnant women and a onetime shot for everyone 75 or older. But people as young as 60 with health problems that increase their risk can also get it.",
      "In April, the CDC\u2019s influential Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended expanding RSV vaccination to high-risk adults as young as 50, too. But the CDC lacks a director to decide whether to adopt that recommendation and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. didn\u2019t immediately act.",
      "Last month, Kennedy fired all 17 members of that panel and handpicked seven replacements that include several vaccine skeptics.",
      "The new panel alarmed doctors' groups last week by ignoring settled science on a rarely used flu vaccine preservative and by announcing a probe of the children\u2019s vaccine schedule. It didn't revisit RSV vaccination for older adults.",
      "Kennedy already had taken the unusual step of changing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations without consulting the committee.",
      "On Wednesday, a page on CDC's website said that on June 25, Kennedy had adopted the ousted panel's recommendation to expand RSV vaccination to high-risk 50-somethings and it is \u201cnow an official recommendation of the CDC.\u201d",

      "In April, Trump announced a 46% tax on Vietnamese imports \u2014 one of his so-called reciprocal tariffs targeting dozens of countries with which the United States runs trade deficits. Trump promptly suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to allow for negotiations like the one with Vietnam. The pause expires Tuesday, but so far the Trump administration has reached a trade agreement with only one of those countries \u2014 the United Kingdom. (Trump has also reached a \"framework'' agreement with China in a separate trade dispute.)",
      "\u201cVietnam has been very keen to get out from under this,'' said Mary Lovely, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201dThis is forcing a smaller country to eat it, basically. We can do that. It's the big countries that everybody's keeping their eyes on.'' She doubts that Trump will be able to impose such a lopsided agreement on big trading partners such as the European Union and Japan.",
      "The United States last year ran a $122 billion trade deficit with Vietnam. That was the third-biggest U.S. trade gap \u2014 the difference between the goods and services it buys from other countries and those it sells them \u2014 behind the ones with China and Mexico.",
      "In addition to the 20% tariffs, Trump said the U.S. would impose a 40% tax on \"transshipping'' \u2014 goods from another country that stop in Vietnam on their way to the United States. Washington complains that Chinese goods have been dodging higher U.S. tariffs by transiting through Vietnam.",
      "A February study in the Harvard Business Review found that there was \"much less rerouting than previously believed.''",
      "In May, Vietnam approved a $1.5 billion project by the Trump Organization and a local partner to build a massive golf resort complex near Hanoi, covering an area roughly the size of 336 football fields.",
      "Vietnam was a beneficiary of American efforts to counter China\u2019s influence. Companies looking to diversify their supply chains away from China flocked to Vietnam.",
      "In 2023, it became the only country to host both President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping on state visits. That year, the U.S. upgraded Vietnam to its highest diplomatic status\u2014comprehensive strategic partner\u2014placing it on par with China and Russia.",

      "Reporting in Somalia, Afghanistan and Syria was tough work for reporter Jane Ferguson",
      "NEW YORK -- Jane Ferguson has won awards for unflinching reporting from dangerous lands including Afghanistan, Somalia and Yemen. So she was unlikely to be intimidated by seeking financing for a new journalism platform, despite tough times for the news industry.",
      "\u201cIt's very high pressure,\u201d said Ferguson, founder of Noosphere. \u201cI'm used to pressure in the field.\u201d",
      "Started this year, Noosphere offers journalists a place to showcase work to consumers who are attracted by a more personal style of reporting than they'd normally see on traditional outlets.",
      "It's similar to Substack, with a twist. Instead of paying for feeds of individual journalists \u2014 the Substack model \u2014 people who subscribe to Noosphere for $14.99 a month get access to all of its journalists. There are 20 so far, expected to increase to 24 with the site's upcoming British launch.",
      "Noosphere \u2014 named to reference a state of consciousness advanced by Jesuit philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin \u2014 arrives at a time of flux in the news industry. Consumers are fleeing newspapers and television news and trying different approaches springing up in a new media world.",
      "Ferguson raised $1 million to get Noosphere off the ground and is about to announce an additional round of investment.",
      "Ferguson, 40, grew up in Northern Ireland, and was attracted to the high-stakes, high-risk world of international reporting. For CNN International and then PBS NewsHour, she worked largely alone, covering stories about famine and war crimes in South Sudan, the conflict in Syria and Afghanistan following the U.S. withdrawal in 2021.",
      "The latter experience left her shell-shocked and heartbroken, wondering if she'd reached the end of that phase of her career. \u201cI had been on the road for 15 years,\u201d she said. \u201cI was exhausted, and in some respects, burnt out.\u201d",
      "She settled in the United States, teaching \u2014 and learning \u2014 at Princeton. She took classes in entrepreneurship and built contacts in the business world. Ferguson knew how many of her former international colleagues had to hustle to find outlets for their work, and envisioned Noosphere as a landing spot. Her business partner, Seb Walker, worked at Vice Media, known for its strong international reporting before filing for bankruptcy in 2023.",
      "\u201cIt's gotten a lot harder to continue making a living doing this,\u201d said Matthew Cassell, an international correspondent whose credits include Vice. A member of Noosphere's inaugural class of journalists, Cassell has posted videos giving his perspectives on the Israel-Iran war, along with recent reporting from the West Bank.",
      "Shrouq Al Aila contributed video from Gaza, showing efforts to distribute aid as the sound of gunfire is heard in the background. Oren Ziv reported from a missile strike in Israel, walking through a hospital's shattered hallways to show the destruction.",
      "\u201cIt feels like a really high-quality reporter is Face-Timing you from the field,\u201d Ferguson said, \u201cwhich is really cool.\u201d",
      "News consumers, particularly young ones, are souring on more stilted, conventional television news reporting, said veteran journalist Kate O'Brian, who is on Noosphere's board of directors. \u201cThe stage has been set for an audience who wants to hear directly from the journalist,\u201d O'Brian said.",
      "Ferguson envisions a reporting staff that is roughly half international, half based in the United States. Former CNN journalist Chris Cillizza reports on Washington for Noosphere.",
      "Her biggest signing to date is former \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Chuck Todd. He started a Sunday night show in June, with \u201cWar Room\u201d host Steve Bannon and Trita Parsi, founder of the National Iranian American Council, as his first guests. Todd has hired the former producer for Charlie Rose's PBS talk show, a clue to his ambitions for an eclectic show interviewing interesting people from politics and business.",
      "\u201cJane's hard to say no to,\u201d Todd said. \u201cLike any smart executive, she knows what she doesn't know, and goes to find smart people who she thinks know more.\"",
      "Ferguson's bet is that audiences can only afford so many Substack subscriptions to individual journalists, and that Noosphere will offer access to more at a set price. She's also talked to news outlets interested in acquiring some of the reporters' work.",
      "The challenge to getting Noosphere established is an increasingly crowded marketplace, and several of her journalists aren't household names.",
      "Noosphere journalists are paid a percentage of subscription fees, and given a greater amount if a subscriber specifically cites that contributor's work in signing on. Ferguson will not say how many subscribers she has yet.",
      "\u201cSubstack created a market that did not exist before and I give them huge kudos for that,\u201d O'Brian said. \u201cThis is just a different way of approaching it.\u201d",
      "To succeed, \u201cyou have to offer a lot,\u201d Todd said. \u201cYou can't just offer one or two things. Every hot spot around the world, Noosphere will have journalists on the ground. They have a reasonable chance to be very successful in their lane. The question is how big the lane can get.\u201d",
      "Todd said Noosphere's advantage is that it has been created by reporters, a distinction from the lack of journalism experience found among executives in the business, he said.",
      "Ferguson, too, has wondered whether journalism can survive the diminishment or death of news organizations. \u201cThe solution for the problems of the industry are going to come from journalists and not media executives,\u201d she said.",

      "The findings show clear trade-offs from Trump\u2019s import taxes, contradicting his claims that foreign manufacturers would absorb the costs of the tariffs instead of U.S. companies that rely on imports. While the tariffs launched under Trump have yet to boost overall inflation, large companies such as Amazon, Costco, Walmart and Williams-Sonoma delayed the potential reckoning by building up their inventories before the taxes could be imposed.",
      "The analysis comes just ahead of the July 9 deadline by Trump to formally set the tariff rates on goods from dozens of countries. Trump imposed that deadline after the financial markets panicked in response to his April tariff announcements, prompting him to instead schedule a 90-day negotiating period when most imports faced a 10% baseline tariff. China, Mexico and Canada face higher rates, and there are separate 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum.",
      "Had the initial April 2 tariffs stayed in place, the companies in the JPMorganChase Institute analysis would have faced additional direct costs of $187.6 billion. Under the current rates, the $82.3 billion would be equivalent on average to $2,080 per employee, or 3.1% of the average annual payroll. Those averages include firms that don't import goods and those that do.",
      "Asked Tuesday how trade talks are faring, Trump said simply: \u201cEverything\u2019s going well.\u201d",
      "The president has indicated that he will set tariff rates given the logistical challenge of negotiating with so many nations. As the 90-day period comes to a close, only the United Kingdom has signed a trade framework with the Trump administration. India and Vietnam have signaled that they\u2019re close to a trade framework.",
      "There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that more inflation could surface. The investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a report that it expects companies to pass along 60% of their tariff costs onto consumers. The Atlanta Federal Reserve has used its survey of businesses\u2019 inflation expectations to say that companies could on average pass along roughly half their costs from a 10% tariff or a 25% tariff without reducing consumer demand.",
      "The JPMorganChase Institute findings suggest that the tariffs could cause some domestic manufacturers to strengthen their roles as suppliers of goods. But it noted that companies need to plan for a range of possible outcomes and that wholesalers and retailers already operate on such low profit margins that they might need to spread the tariffs costs to their customers.",
      "The outlook for tariffs remains highly uncertain. Trump had stopped negotiations with Canada, only to restart them after the country dropped its plan to tax digital services. He similarly on Monday threatened more tariffs on Japan unless it buys more rice from the U.S.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a Tuesday interview that the concessions from the trade talks have impressed career officials at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and other agencies.",
      "\u201cPeople who have been at Treasury, at Commerce, at USTR for 20 years are saying that these are deals like they\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Bessent said on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d",
      "The treasury secretary said the Trump administration plans to discuss the contours of trade deals next week, prioritizing the tax cuts package passed on Tuesday by the Republican majority in the Senate. Trump has set a Friday deadline for passage of the multitrillion-dollar package, the costs of which the president hopes to offset with tariff revenues.",

      "The blaze that broke out late on Tuesday created an enormous thick plume of ash and smoke that reached 14,000 meters (45,000 feet) of altitude, making it the largest registered by firefighters in Catalonia, a northeastern region of Spain.",
      "Two farmers were killed while apparently trying to flee in a vehicle, local authorities said Wednesday.",
      "Firefighters said that the fire spread at 28 kph (17 mph) at one point as it consumed 6,500 hectares (16,000 acres) mostly of grain fields, making it one of the fastest fires registered in Europe.",

      "At best, Trump's \u201cno tax on Social Security\u201d claim exaggerates the benefits to seniors if either the House or Senate-passed proposals is signed into law.",

      "DEL MAR, Calif. -- Dick Tracy got an atom-powered two-way wrist radio in 1946. Marty Cooper never forgot it.",
      "The Chicago boy became a star engineer who ran Motorola\u2019s research and development arm when the hometown telecommunications titan was locked in a 1970s corporate battle to invent the portable phone. Cooper rejected AT&T\u2019s wager on the car phone, betting that America wanted to feel like Dick Tracy, armed with \u201ca device that was an extension of you, that made you reachable everywhere.\u201d",
      "Fifty-two years ago, Cooper declared victory in a call from a Manhattan sidewalk to the head of AT&T\u2019s rival program. His four-pound DynaTAC 8000X has evolved into a global population of billions of smartphones weighing mere ounces apiece. Some 4.6 billion people \u2014 nearly 60% of the world \u2014 have mobile internet, according to a global association of mobile network operators.",
      "The tiny computers that we carry by the billions are becoming massive, interlinked networks of processors that perform trillions of calculations per second \u2013 the computing power that artificial intelligence needs. The simple landlines once used to call friends or family have evolved into omnipresent glossy screens that never leave our sight and flood our brain with hours of data daily, deluging us with endless messages, emails, videos and a soundtrack that many play constantly to block the outside world.",
      "From his home in Del Mar, California, the inventor of the mobile phone, now 96, watches all of this. Of one thing Cooper is certain: The revolution has really just begun.",
      "Now, the winner of the 2024 National Medal of Technology and Innovation \u2014 the United States\u2019 highest honor for technological achievement \u2013 is focused on the cellphone\u2019s imminent transition to a thinking mobile computer fueled by human calories to avoid dependence on batteries. Our new parts will run constant tests on our bodies and feed our doctors real-time results, Cooper predicts.",
      "\u201cThat will let people anticipate diseases before they happen,\u201d Cooper envisions. \u201cPeople are going to die from old age and accidents but they\u2019re not going to die from disease. That\u2019s a revolution in medicine.\u201c",
      "Human behavior is already adapting to smartphones, some observers say, using them as tools that allow overwhelmed minds to focus on quality communication.",
      "The phone conversation has become the way to communicate the most intimate of social ties, says Claude Fischer, a sociology professor at the University of California, Berkeley and author of \u201cAmerica Calling: A Social History of the Telephone to 1940.\u201d",
      "For almost everyone, the straight-up phone call has become an intrusion. Now everything needs to be preceded by a message. \u201cThere seems to be a sense that the phone call is for heart-to-heart and not just for information exchange,\u201d Fischer says.",
      "And this from a 20-year-old corroborates that: \u201cThe only person I call on a day-to-day basis is my cousin,\u201d says Ayesha Iqbal, a psychology student at Suffolk County Community College. \u201cI primarily text everyone else.\u201d",

Her 18-year-old granddaughter Bryndal Hoover, a senior at nearby Lawrence High School, says she prefers voice calls over texting because then I can understand, \u2018Oh, how should I go about a conversation?\u2019\u201d",
      "When she was a girl, Karen Wilson\u2019s family shared a party line with other phone customers outside Buffalo, New York. Wilson, 79, shocked her granddaughter by telling her about the party line when the girl got a cellphone as a teenager.",
      "\u201cWhat did you do if you didn\u2019t wait?\u2019\u201d the girl asked. Responded her grandmother: \u201c`You went down to their house and you yelled, \u2018Hey, Mary, can you come out?\u2019\u201d",
      "Many worry about the changes exerted by our newly interconnected, highly stimulated world.",
      "We increasingly buy online and get products delivered without the possibility of serendipity. There are fewer opportunities to greet a neighbor or store employee and find out something unexpected, to make a friend, to fall in love. People are working more efficiently as they drown.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no barrier to the number of people who can be reaching out to you at the same time and it\u2019s just overwhelming,\u201d says Kristen Burks, an associate circuit judge in Macon, Missouri.",
      "Most importantly, sociologists, psychologists and teachers say, near-constant phone-driven screen time is cutting into kids\u2019 ability to learn and socialize. A growing movement is pushing back against cellphones\u2019 intrusion into children\u2019s daily lives.",
      "\u201cAt the turn of the millennium, technology companies based on the West Coast of the United States created a set of world-changing products,\u201d New York University social psychologist Jonathan Haidt writes in \u201cThe Anxious Generation,\u201d which has been on The New York Times bestseller list for a year.",
      "\u201cBy creating a firehose of addictive content that entered through kids\u2019 eyes and ears, and by displacing physical play and in-person socializing, these companies have rewired childhood and changed human development on an almost unimaginable scale,\u201d he writes.",
      "Seven states have signed \u2014 and twenty states have introduced \u2014 statewide bell-to-bell phone bans in schools. Additional states have moved to prohibit them during teaching time.",
      "That doesn\u2019t sit well with the smartphone\u2019s inventor, who says there are better solutions than regulation. \u201cAccommodating disruptive technologies requires disruptive solutions,\u201d Cooper wrote from Del Mar. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better for teachers to integrate the cellphone that provides access to all the information in the world?\u201d",
      "That advantage is coming to rich countries faster than poor ones.",
      "The first time that Nnaemeka Agbo had to leave his family in Nigeria for a prolonged period, life shuttled him to Russia for studies, like many other young Nigerians increasingly desperate to relocate to seek better opportunities.",
      "Adjusting to life in Russia when he moved there in 2023 was tough, he says, but one thing kept him going; WhatsApp calls with family. \u201cOne thing that kept me sane was calling home every time, and it made me feel closer to my people,\u201d the 31-year-old says.",
      "In a country that has one of the world\u2019s highest poverty and hunger levels despite being Africa\u2019s top oil producer, Agbo\u2019s experience mirrors many young people in Nigeria increasingly forced to choose between remaining at home with family or aiming at a better life elsewhere. At least 37% of African adults expressed their desire to live somewhere else in 2023, the highest rate in the world, according to a Gallup survey published in October last year.",
      "For many, phone calls blur the distance and offer comfort.",
      "\u201cNo matter how busy my schedule is, I must call my people every weekend, even if that\u2019s the only call I have to make,\u201d Agbo says.",
      "In Africa, where only 37% of the population had internet access in 2023, according to the International Telecommunication Union, regular mobile calls are the only option many have. In northern Nigeria\u2019s Zamfara state, Abdulmalik Saidu says the mobile connectivity rate is so low that \u201csometimes we stay for weeks without network.\u201d",
      "When 19-year-old Shamsu Deen-Cole flew from Sierra Leone to the United States to study international relations in 1971, making a call to his parents in Sierra Leone would take days, starting with telling his parents when to expect the call. Calls would cost around $150 for under 10 minutes. \u201cThere was no time for extra talks or complimentary because it would all add up in cost,\u201d recalls Deen-Cole, 73.",
      "Tabane Ciss\u00e9, who moved from Senegal to Spain in 2023, makes phone calls about investing Spanish earnings at home. Otherwise, it\u2019s all texts, or voice notes, with one exception.",
      "His mother doesn\u2019t read or write, but when he calls \u201cit\u2019s as if I was standing next to her,\u201d Ciss\u00e9 says. \u201cIt brings back memories \u2014 such pleasure.\u201d",
      "He couldn\u2019t do it without the cell phone. And half a world away, that suits Marty Cooper just fine.",
      "\u201cThere are more cell phones in the world today than there are people,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cYour life can be made infinitely more efficient just by virtue of being connected with everybody else in the world. But I have to tell you that this is only the beginning.\u201d",

      "Keys' exit left just one of the top six women in the bracket before the end of Week 1: No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, who was scheduled to face 2021 U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu later in the day.",
      "No. 2 Coco Gauff, No. 3 Jessica Pegula, No. 4 Jasmine Paolini and No. 5 Zheng Qinwen already were out. The men's field also has seen its share of surprises, including a Wimbledon-record 13 seeds gone in the first round.",
      "\u201cAt times, it wasn\u2019t the best quality, let\u2019s say. But I managed, and in the end, it's just important to find solutions and I did that well. Kept my nerves in the end,\" Siegemund said, then added with a laugh: \"There are always nerves. If you don\u2019t have nerves in this moment, you\u2019re probably dead.\u201d",
      "Wimbledon might be the only Grand Slam event where Keys hasn't reached at least the semifinals, but she has participated in the quarterfinals there twice and is enjoying a breakthrough 2025, including her title at Melbourne Park in January.",
      "Keys' power vs. Siegemund's spins and slices offered quite a contrast in styles, and this outcome was surprisingly one-way traffic on a windy afternoon at No. 2 Court. The key statistic, undoubtedly, was this: Keys made 31 unforced errors, 20 more than Siegemund.",
      "When it ended with one last backhand return from Keys that sailed wide, Siegemund smiled broadly, raised her arms and jumped up and down repeatedly.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t not be happy when you beat a great player like Madison,\u201d Siegemund said.",
      "How unexpected is this for Siegemund? Before this year, her career record at the All England Club was 2-5, and she'd never made it past the second round. Taking into account all four Grand Slam tournaments, she had reached the third round only once in 28 previous appearances, getting to the quarterfinals at the 2020 French Open.",
      "\u201cThere is technically no pressure for me,\u201d said Siegemund, at 37 the oldest woman remaining in the tournament. \u201cI try to remember that I only play for myself. I don\u2019t feel like I need to prove anything anymore. My boyfriend often tells me that.\u201d",
      "On Sunday, the German faces another unexpected participant at this stage of the grass-court major: 101st-ranked Solana Sierra of Argentina, who lost in qualifying and made it into the main draw when another player withdrew.",
      "Ben Shelton played for all of four points and about a minute, wrapping up his second-round match against Rinky Hijikata that was suspended Thursday night.

      "It might just be the best deal in all of major professional sports",
      "LONDON -- It might just be the best deal in all of major professional sports: Tennis fans can get a chance to watch stars such as Carlos Alcaraz compete on Centre Court at Wimbledon by forking over just 15 pounds \u2014 about $20 at the current exchange rate.",
      "That's instead of Friday's price of nearly $220 for the best seats at the grass-court Grand Slam tournament's biggest stadium. Face value there rises as the event goes on, hitting nearly $370 by the end of Week 2, then going up again for the singles finals.",
      "The secret to saving so much cash? The official resale service. It allows anyone already on-site with a ticket to sign up via the Wimbledon app for a daily lottery to get into one of the top three courts at a cut rate, including about $13 each for No. 1 Court or No. 2 Court.",
      "Those spots are offered up to the All England Club by spectators who leave before play ends.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an elite tournament in terms of the players, but it\u2019s not elite to get in, which is part of the appeal,\u201d said Ed Hogan, a retired 69-year-old from Reading, which is a little more than an hour west of Wimbledon. \u201cThe concept of resales is great. It\u2019s recycling at its best \u2014 sharing the joy.\u201d",
      "The All England Club wouldn\u2019t say how many tickets get resold.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re selling the same ticket twice,\u201d said the club's operations manager, Michelle Dite, \u201cand the primary reason is to make tennis as accessible to as many people as possible.\u201d",
      "Money from resales goes to charities via the Wimbledon Foundation. Nearly $80,000 was raised through the first three days of this year\u2019s tournament; last year\u2019s total was about $300,000.",
      "Wimbledon has done resales since 1954, but until last year, folks hoping to take advantage of the deal needed to stand in a line once they were on-site, hope they were there soon enough \u2014 and hope enough tickets were returned.",
      "Now, though, that \u201cline\u201d is virtual.",
      "Here's how it works:",
      "After opting in on the app and getting their phone scanned by 2:30 p.m. at kiosks on-site or near the Wimbledon Queue, where thousands of people camp out at a local park for up to 24 hours in hopes of getting full-price tickets for main courts or grounds passes for smaller ones, fans then wait for a text message giving the good news that they were one of the lucky ones chosen for the resale, which runs from 3 p.m. to 9 p.m.",
      "They have 10 minutes to confirm they still want a used ticket for the rest of the day, and another 20 minutes to get themselves to the green-and-brown ticket resale booth behind No. 1 Court to show the QR code that lets them pay for the cheap tickets.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not stuck in one place forever,\" said Henry Thompson, 38, a high school math teacher from Missouri. \u201cThis is much more efficient. Took 30 seconds. Much better.\u201d",
      "Thompson, who was wearing a blue hat with the Wimbledon logo, really wanted to see 10th-seeded American Ben Shelton, so he entered the resale lottery and was able to get a seat for No. 2 Court for $13 instead of $115.",
      "\u201cIt's beneficial to the sport to give people access to those courts for a reasonable price,\u201d said Marcos Giron, a 45th-ranked American who won first-round matches in singles and doubles this week. \u201cIt's a wonderful thing.\u201d",
      "Chen Pinjung, who just finished medical school in Taiwan, waited in the queue for six hours, paid 30 pounds ($40) there for a grounds pass, then also got herself into No. 1 Court via a resale for an additional $13 \u2014 instead of the $150 it could have cost to see 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina win there Thursday.",
      "\u201cIf everybody knew how that works, I'm sure everybody would apply,\u201d said Rafael Garcia, who was with his girlfriend, Diana Meneses, and her brother, Gustavo Meneses. \u201cWe saw that (resale) office last year, but we didn't know how to do it. Now we will.\u201d",

      "The people spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity due to the nature of the investigation.",
      "The investigation is related to in-game prop bets on two pitches thrown by Ortiz that received higher activity than usual during his starts at Seattle on June 15 and his recent outing against St. Louis on June 27. The gambling activity on the pitches was flagged by a betting-integrity firm and forwarded to MLB.",
      "ESPN reported the firm IC360 recently also sent an alert to sportsbook operators regarding Ortiz.",

      "MLB said Ortiz's paid leave is through the end of the All-Star break, when players return to their teams July 17 and games resume the following day. It can be extended if the investigation remains ongoing.",
      "Chris Antonetti, Cleveland\u2019s president of baseball operations, said before Thursday night's game at the Chicago Cubs that the team can continue to have contact with Ortiz, but he can't enter any of the Guardians' facilities. Ortiz returned to Cleveland on Wednesday night.",
      "Ortiz was slated to be the starting pitcher for Thursday night\u2019s series finale. Instead, left-hander Joey Cantillo was recalled from Triple-A Columbus. Cantillo is 1-0 with one save and a 3.81 ERA in 21 appearances this season.",
      "\u201cWe learned very little last night, but knew we needed to get someone here today to start today\u2019s game, and that really was our focus,\u201d Antonetti said. \"A lot has come out today, and that\u2019s far more information than we have.",
      "\u201cOur focus is we\u2019ll let the investigative process play out. To the extent Major League Baseball or anyone needs our support in that, we will obviously cooperate. But beyond that, there\u2019s really not much we can do.\u201d",
      "Manager Stephen Vogt said he and Antonetti addressed the team about Ortiz's situation and tried to answer questions the best they could.",
      "It is another setback for a Guardians squad that has dropped a season-high six straight games and is 9-18 since May 1.",

Every team goes through adversity, maybe different kinds, but this is a resilient group. I\u2019ve been through situations similar to this before in my career as a player, and what would I have wanted to hear? How would I want the manager to have reacted, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do.\u201d",
      "The 26-year old Ortiz is in his first season with Cleveland after he was acquired in a trade with Pittsburgh last December. The right-hander is 4-9 with a 4.36 ERA and 96 strikeouts in 16 starts this season. The nine losses are tied for the most in the American League.",
      "In four big-league seasons, Ortiz is 16-22 with a 4.05 ERA and one save.",
      "The investigation into Ortiz comes a little more than a year after MLB suspended five players for gambling, including a lifetime ban for San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano. MLB said Marcano placed 387 baseball bets totaling more than $150,000 with a legal sportsbook in 2022 and 2023.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Just playing for the U.S. national team was a big opportunity for Claire Hutton.",
      "Then Canada left her a bit too much space at the edge of the 6-yard box \u2014 and Rose Lavelle found her with a perfect corner kick. The 19-year-old midfielder was ready.",
      "Hutton headed home her first international goal, and the Americans easily dispatched Canada 3-0 in a friendly Wednesday for their fifth straight victory. Sam Coffey and Yazmeen Ryan also scored.",
      "\u201cSet pieces are something we focus on. It's what we talk about,\u201d Hutton said. \u201cAt the international level, it's what sets teams apart, especially in big tournaments. So being able to get my head on Rose's perfect ball there was just amazing. Hoping for more in the future.\u201d",
      "The Americans have won five straight friendlies by a combined score of 18-0 since their 2-1 loss to Brazil in early April. The 19-year-old Hutton was making her sixth appearance for the national team, and her goal in the 36th minute gave the U.S. a 2-0 lead.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just amazing. To wear this jersey, wear this badge, it weighs a lot. I know the history behind it,\" said Hutton, who plays for the Kansas City Current. \"We talked about the U.S. legacy this past week. Just knowing that I get to be a part of it, it means the world to me.\u201d",
      "U.S. coach Emma Hayes gave many of her Europe-based options a break for this stretch of three games in seven days, which also included two 4-0 wins over Ireland. That left opportunities for less experienced players like Hutton.",
      "\u201cAs I've said many times, I'm all about improving the whole ecosystem. I think more opportunities for more players with the national team will improve the NWSL,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cBecause it gives players hope and belief that if they perform, that they're going to get an opportunity.\u201d",
      "The U.S. opened the scoring in the 17th minute when Lavelle delivered a free kick into the penalty area from near the left sideline. Canada\u2019s Janine Sonis tried to head clear, but the ball fell to Avery Patterson and then bounced to Coffey about 9 yards from the goal.",
      "Both Coffey and Patterson stabbed at the ball, and both appeared to make contact with it. It went straight into the net. Coffey was credited with the goal and Patterson with an assist.",
      "\u201cI will give her full credit for that. I did not touch it at all,\u201d Patterson said, not entirely believably. \u201cI laid it up for her on a platter.\u201d",
      "Claudia Dickey, who also shut out Ireland in her international debut last Thursday, stopped a shot from in close by Canada\u2019s Jordyn Huitema shortly after Coffey\u2019s goal. But the Americans created far more chances.",

      "Lavelle received a standing ovation when she was subbed out around the midway point of the second half. The crowd also gave a big cheer when Tara McKeown \u2014 who plays locally for the Washington Spirit \u2014 came on as a late sub for the U.S. McKeown assisted on Ryan\u2019s goal in the 89th minute.",

      "Good news, basketball fans: Red Panda intends to be ready for next season.",
      "Red Panda, the popular performer who fell off her unicycle and crashed to the court during halftime of the WNBA Commissioner\u2019s Cup final between the Indiana Fever and the Minnesota Lynx, has a broken left wrist and will need further consultation with an orthopedic surgeon, the agency that represents her said Wednesday.",
      "Red Panda \u2014 her real name is Rong Niu \u2014 spent 11 hours in a Minneapolis hospital, with a pair of Lynx staffers there with her the entire time, agent Patrick Figley said. The Chinese American acrobat was heading home for treatment and recovery, which should take a few months.",
      "\u201cShe is very grateful,\u201d Figley said. \u201cRed Panda thanks everyone for all the kind wishes and support. It means the world to her.\u201d",
      "The fall was caused by part of her unicycle being damaged during transit, Figley said.",
      "The Fever won the game in Minneapolis, and during their postgame locker room celebration Indiana star Caitlin Clark was among those \u2014 on teammate Sydney Colson's live stream on Instagram \u2014 to send Red Panda well-wishes.",
      "\u201cRed Panda, if you're watching, we love you,\u201d Clark said.",
      "Red Panda fell forward off her custom unicycle \u2014 it's about 8 feet high \u2014 onto the court shortly after her performance started Tuesday night. She immediately grabbed at her left wrist and was eventually helped off the floor by wheelchair before being transported by ambulance to a hospital.",
      "She comes from a family of performing acrobats. Her act is composed of her riding on the unicycle and balancing custom-made bowls on her lower leg before flipping them atop her head.",
      "She has performed at countless basketball games, including Game 5 of the NBA Finals last month in Oklahoma City.",
      "\u201cShe very much appreciates all the support she is receiving,\u201d Figley said.",

      "The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal could not yet be announced between the Lakers and Ayton, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2018 NBA draft \u2014 two spots ahead of Luka Doncic.",
      "The Portland Trail Blazers bought out Ayton's contract last weekend, and he has agreed to join Doncic and LeBron James on a one-year deal with a player option for 2026-27. He will be paid more than $25 million by the Blazers while playing for the Lakers in the upcoming season.",
      "Ayton's arrival fills the Lakers' most glaring offseason need. He will provide a lob target for James and Doncic while adding the defensive size in the middle that they have missed since trading Anthony Davis to Dallas for Doncic.",
      "Ayton spent his first five NBA seasons with Phoenix before joining the Trail Blazers two years ago. He struggled in Portland while playing for mediocre teams, but he has averaged 16.4 points and 10.5 rebounds during his seven seasons while making 59% of his shots.",
      "The Lakers struggled without Davis in the paint last season, with Jaxson Hayes playing poorly enough to get benched by coach JJ Redick in the final games.

      "A stark disagreement over regulating AI in Republicans\u2019 tax cut and spending bill is the latest tension among conservatives about whether to let states continue to put guardrails on emerging technologies or minimize such interference",
      "NEW YORK -- A controversial bid to deter states from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade seemed on its way to passing as the Republican tax cut and spending bill championed by President Donald Trump worked its way through the U.S. Senate.",
      "But as the bill neared a final vote, a relentless campaign against it by a constellation of conservatives \u2014 including Republican governors, lawmakers, think tanks and social groups \u2014 had been eroding support. One, conservative activist Mike Davis, appeared on the show of right-wing podcaster Steve Bannon, urging viewers to call their senators to reject this \u201cAI amnesty\u201d for \u201ctrillion-dollar Big Tech monopolists.\u201d",
      "He said he also texted with Trump directly, advising the president to stay neutral on the issue despite what Davis characterized as significant pressure from White House AI czar David Sacks, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and others.",
      "Conservatives passionate about getting rid of the provision had spent weeks fighting others in the party who favored the legislative moratorium because they saw it as essential for the country to compete against China in the race for AI dominance. The schism marked the latest and perhaps most noticeable split within the GOP about whether to let states continue to put guardrails on emerging technologies or minimize such interference.",
      "In the end, the advocates for guardrails won, revealing the enormous influence of a segment of the Republican Party that has come to distrust Big Tech. They believe states must remain free to protect their citizens against potential harms of the industry, whether from AI, social media or emerging technologies.",
      "\u201cTension in the conservative movement is palpable,\u201d said Adam Thierer of the R Street Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank. Thierer first proposed the idea of the AI moratorium last year. He noted \u201cthe animus surrounding Big Tech\u201d among many Republicans.",
      "\"That was the differentiating factor.\u201d",
      "The Heritage Foundation, children\u2019s safety groups and Republican state lawmakers, governors and attorneys general all weighed in against the AI moratorium. Democrats, tech watchdogs and some tech companies opposed it, too.",
      "Sensing the moment was right on Monday night, Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, who opposed the AI provision and had attempted to water it down, teamed up with Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington to suggest striking the entire proposal. By morning, the provision was removed in a 99-1 vote.",
      "The whirlwind demise of a provision that initially had the backing of House and Senate leadership and the White House disappointed other conservatives who felt it gave China, a main AI competitor, an advantage.",
      "Ryan Fournier, chairman of Students for Trump and chief marketing officer of the startup Uncensored AI, had supported the moratorium, writing on X that it \u201cstops blue states like California and New York from handing our future to Communist China.\u201d",
      "\u201cRepublicans are that way ... I get it,\u201d he said in an interview, but added there needs to be \u201cone set of rules, not 50\u201d for AI innovation to be successful.",
      "Tech companies, tech trade groups, venture capitalists and multiple Trump administration figures had voiced their support for the provision that would have blocked states from passing their own AI regulations for years. They argued that in the absence of federal standards, letting the states take the lead would leave tech innovators mired in a confusing patchwork of rules.",
      "Lutnick, the commerce secretary, posted that the provision \u201cmakes sure American companies can develop cutting-edge tech for our military, infrastructure, and critical industries \u2014 without interference from anti-innovation politicians.\u201d AI czar Sacks had also publicly supported the measure.",
      "After the Senate passed the bill without the AI provision, the White House responded to an inquiry for Sacks with the president's position, saying Trump \"is fully supportive of the Senate-passed version of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "Acknowledging defeat of his provision on the Senate floor, Cruz noted how pleased China, liberal politicians and \u201cradical left-wing groups\u201d would be to hear the news.",
      "But Blackburn pointed out that the federal government has failed to pass laws that address major concerns about AI, such as keeping children safe and securing copyright protections.",
      "\u201cBut you know who has passed it?\u201d she said. \u201cThe states.\u201d",
      "Conservatives distrusting Big Tech for what they see as social media companies stifling speech during the COVID-19 pandemic and surrounding elections said that tech companies shouldn\u2019t get a free pass, especially on something that carries as much risk as AI.",
      "Many who opposed the moratorium also brought up preserving states' rights, though proponents countered that AI issues transcend state borders and Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce.",
      "Eric Lucero, a Republican state lawmaker in Minnesota, noted that many other industries already navigate different regulations established by both state and local jurisdictions.",
      "\u201cI think everyone in the conservative movement agrees we need to beat China,\" said Daniel Cochrane from the Heritage Foundation. \u201cI just think we have different prescriptions for doing so.\u201d",
      "Many argued that in the absence of federal legislation, states were best positioned to protect citizens from the potential harms of AI technology.",
      "\u201cWe have no idea what AI will be capable of in the next 10 years and giving it free rein and tying states hands is potentially dangerous,\u201d Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote on X.",
      "Another Republican, Texas state Sen. Angela Paxton, wrote to Cruz and his counterpart, Sen. John Cornyn, urging them to remove the moratorium.",
      "She and other conservatives said some sort of federal standard could help clarify the landscape around AI and resolve some of the party's disagreements.",
      "But with the moratorium dead and Republicans holding only narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress, it\u2019s unclear whether they will be able to agree on a set of standards to guide the development of the burgeoning technology.",
      "In an email to The Associated Press, Paxton said she wants to see limited federal AI legislation \u201cthat sets some clear guardrails\u201d around national security and interstate commerce, while leaving states free to address issues that affect their residents.",
      "\"When it comes to technology as powerful and potentially dangerous as AI, we should be cautious about silencing state-level efforts to protect consumers and children,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "A startup called Gigablue claims to have reached a milestone by selling 200,000 carbon credits for its ocean-based carbon capture technology",
      "The startup Gigablue announced with fanfare this year that it reached a historic milestone: selling 200,000 carbon credits to fund what it describes as a groundbreaking technology in the fight against climate change.",
      "Formed three years ago by a group of entrepreneurs in Israel, the company says it has designed particles that when released in the ocean will trap carbon at the bottom of the sea. By \u201charnessing the power of nature,\u201d Gigablue says, its work will do nothing less than save the planet.",
      "But outside scientists frustrated by the lack of information released by the company say serious questions remain about whether Gigablue\u2019s technology works as the company describes. Their questions showcase tensions in an industry built on little regulation and big promises \u2014 and a tantalizing chance to profit.",
      "Jimmy Pallas, an event organizer based in Italy, struck a deal with Gigablue last year. He said he trusts the company does what it has promised him \u2014 ensuring the transportation, meals, and electricity of a recent 1,000-person event will be offset by particles in the ocean.",
      "Gigablue\u2019s service is like \u201can extra trash can\u201d where Pallas can discard his unwanted emissions, he said.",
      "\u201cSame way I use my trash can \u2014 I don\u2019t follow where the truck that comes and picks up my trash brings it to,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll take their word for it.\u201d",
      "Gigablue has a grand vision for the future of carbon removal. It was originally named \u201cGigaton\u201d after the one billion metric tons of carbon dioxide most scientists say will be necessary to remove from the atmosphere each year to slow global warming.",
      "The company began trials in the South Pacific Ocean last year, and says it will work with country authorities to create a \u201csequestration field\u201d \u2014 a dedicated part of the ocean where \u201cpulses\u201d of particles will be released on a seasonal basis.",
      "Gigablue says its solution is affordable, too \u2014 priced to attract investors.",
      "\u201cEvery time we go to the ocean, we generate hundreds of thousands of carbon credits, and this is what we\u2019re going to do continuously over the upcoming years and towards the future, in greater and greater quantities,\u201d co-founder Ori Shaashua said.",
      "Carbon credits, which have grown in popularity over the last decade, are tokens that symbolize the removal of one metric ton of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. On paper, companies that buy credits achieve a smaller carbon footprint without needing to reduce their own emissions \u2014 for instance, by paying another vendor to plant trees or capture carbon dioxide from the air.",
      "Only a few countries have required local industries to purchase carbon credits. Most companies that buy them, including Microsoft and Google, do so voluntarily.",
      "The credits have helped fund a band of startups like Gigablue that are eager to tackle the climate crisis, but they are also unevenly regulated, scientifically complex, and have in some cases been linked to fraud.",
      "Gigablue\u2019s 200,000 credits are pledged to SkiesFifty, a newly formed company investing in greener practices for the aviation industry. It\u2019s the largest sale to date for a climate startup operating in the ocean, according to the tracking site CDR.fyi, making up more than half of all ocean-based carbon credits sold last year.",
      "And it could beckon a rapid acceleration of the company\u2019s work. Gigablue hopes to reach a goal this year of capturing 10 metric tons of carbon dioxide for each ton of particles it deploys, Shaashua said. At that rate, Gigablue would disperse at least 20,000 tons of particles in the ocean.",
      "Gigablue wouldn\u2019t reveal what it earned in the sale, and SkiesFifty\u2019s team declined to be interviewed for this story. Most credits are sold for a few hundred dollars each \u2014 but a chart on Gigablue\u2019s website suggests its prices are lower than almost any other form of carbon capture on the market.",
      "The startup is the brainchild of four entrepreneurs hailing from the tech industry. According to their LinkedIn profiles, Gigablue\u2019s CEO previously worked for an online grocery startup, while its COO was vice president of SeeTree, a company that raised $60 million to provide farmers with information on their trees.",
      "Shaashua, who often serves as the face of Gigablue, said he specializes in using artificial intelligence to pursue positive outcomes in the world. He co-founded a data mining company that tracked exposure risks during the COVID-19 pandemic, and led an auto startup that brokered data on car mileage and traffic patterns.",
      "\u201cThree years ago, I decided to take the same formula, so to say, to climate,\u201d Shaashua said.",
      "Under his guidance, he said, Gigablue created an AI-driven \u201cdigital twin\u201d of the ocean based on dozens of metrics to determine where to release the particles.",
      "Chief technology officer Sapir Markus-Alford earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in earth and environmental sciences from Israel\u2019s Ben-Gurion University in 2021, shortly before founding Gigablue.",
      "Markus-Alford said she began her studies and eventual path to Gigablue after seeing bleached coral reefs and other impacts of warming waters on a series of diving trips around the world.",
      "\u201cI understood that the best thing we could do for the ocean is to be able to remove CO2,\u201d Markus-Alford said.",
      "A spokesperson for Gigablue did not answer whether the other co-founders have graduate degrees in oceanography or environmental science, but said the company\u2019s broader team holds a total of 46 Ph.D.s with expertise in biology, chemistry, oceanography, and environmental science. Markus-Alford said that figure includes outside experts and academics and \u201ceveryone that supports us.\u201d",
      "The company\u2019s staffing has expanded from Israel to hubs in New York and New Zealand, Shaashua said.",
      "In social media posts advertising open jobs, Gigablue employees encouraged applicants to \u201cJoin Our Mission to Save the World!\u201d",
      "The particles Gigablue has patented are meant to capture carbon in the ocean by floating for a number of days and growing algae, before sinking rapidly to the ocean floor.",
      "\u201cWe are an elevator for carbon,\u201d Shaashua said. \u201cWe are exporting the carbon from the top to the bottom.\u201d",
      "Algae \u2014 sometimes referred to as phytoplankton \u2014 has long been attractive to climate scientists because it absorbs carbon dioxide from the surrounding water as it grows. If the algae sinks to the deep sea or ocean floor, Gigablue expects the carbon to be trapped there for hundreds to thousands of years.",
      "The ultimate goal is to lower carbon dioxide levels so drastically that the ocean rebalances with the atmosphere by soaking up more CO2 from the air. It\u2019s a feat that would help slow climate change, but one that is still under active study by climate scientists.",
      "Gigablue\u2019s founders have said the company\u2019s work is inspired by nature and \u201cvery, very environmentally safe.\u201d The company\u2019s particles and sinking methods simply recreate what nature has been doing \u201csince forever,\u201d Shaashua said.",
      "Gigablue ran its first trial sinking particles in the Mediterranean in March last year.",
      "Later, on two voyages to the South Pacific, the company released 60 cubic meters \u2014 about two shipping containers \u2014 of particles off the coast of New Zealand.",
      "While Gigablue has made several commercial deals, it has not yet revealed what its particles are made of. Partly this is because the company says it will build different particles tailored to different seasons and areas of the ocean.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s proprietary,\u201d Markus-Alford said.",
      "Documents provide a window into the possible ingredients. According to information on the permit, Gigablue\u2019s first New Zealand trial last year involved releasing particles of pure vermiculite, a porous clay often used in potting soil.",
      "In the second New Zealand trial, the company released particles made of vermiculite, ground rock, a plant-based wax, as well as manganese and iron.",
      "A patent published last year hints the particles could also be made of scores of other materials, including cotton, rice husks or jute, as well as synthetic ingredients like polyester fibers or lint. The particles contain a range of possible binding agents, and up to 18 different chemicals and metals, from iron to nickel to vanadium.",
      "Without specifying future designs, Markus-Alford said Gigablue\u2019s particles meet certain requirements: \u201cAll the materials we use are materials that are natural, nontoxic, nonhazardous, and can be found in the ocean,\u201d she said. She wouldn\u2019t comment on the possible use of cotton or rice, but said the particles won\u2019t include any kind of plastic.",
      "When asked about vermiculite, which is typically mined on land and heated to expand, Markus-Alford said rivers and erosion transport most materials including vermiculite to the ocean. \u201cAlmost everything, basically, that exists on land can be found in the ocean,\u201d she said.",
      "The company said it had commissioned an environmental institute to verify that the particles are safe for thousands of organisms, including mussels and oysters. Any materials in future particles, Gigablue said, will be approved by local authorities.",
      "Shaashua has said the particles are so benign that they have zero impact on the ocean.",
      "\u201cWe are not changing the water chemistry or the water biology,\u201d Shaashua said.",
      "Ken Buesseler, a senior scientist with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who has spent decades studying the biological carbon cycle of the ocean, says that while he\u2019s intrigued by Gigablue\u2019s proposal, the idea that the particles don\u2019t alter the ocean is \u201calmost inconceivable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere has to be a relationship between what they\u2019re putting in the ocean and the carbon dioxide that\u2019s dissolved in seawater for this to, quote, work,\u201d Buesseler said.",
      "Buesseler co-leads a nonprofit group of scientists hoping to tap the power of algae in the ocean to capture carbon. The group organizes regular forums on the subject, and Gigablue presented in April.",
      "\u201cI left with more questions than answers,\u201d Buesseler said.",
      "Several scientists not affiliated with Gigablue interviewed by The Associated Press said they were interested in how a company with so little public information about its technology could secure a deal for 200,000 carbon credits.",
      "The success of the company\u2019s method, they said, will depend on how much algae grows on the particles, and the amount that sinks to the deep ocean. So far, Gigablue has not released any studies demonstrating those rates.",
      "Thomas Ki\u00f8rboe, a professor of ocean ecology at the Technical University of Denmark, and Philip Boyd, an oceanographer at the University of Tasmania who studies the role of algae in the Earth\u2019s carbon cycle, said they were doubtful algae would get enough sunlight to grow inside the particles.",
      "It\u2019s more likely the particles would attract hungry bacteria, Ki\u00f8rboe said.",
      "\u201cTypical phytoplankton do not grow on surfaces, and they do not colonize particles,\u201d Ki\u00f8rboe said. \u201cTo most phytoplankton ecologists, this would just be, I think, absurd.\u201d",
      "The rates at which Gigablue says its particles sink \u2014 up to a hundred meters (yards) per hour \u2014 might shear off algae from the particles in the quick descent, Boyd said.",
      "It\u2019s likely that some particles would also be eaten by fish \u2014 limiting the carbon capture, and raising the question of how the particles could impact marine life.",
      "Boyd is eager to see field results showing algae growth, and wants to see proof that Gigablue\u2019s particles cause the ocean to absorb more CO2 from the air.",
      "\u201cThese are incredibly challenging issues that I don\u2019t think, certainly for the biological part, I don\u2019t think anyone on the planet has got solutions for them,\u201d he said.",
      "James Kerry, a senior marine and climate scientist for the conservation group OceanCare and senior research fellow at Australia's James Cook University, has closely followed Gigablue\u2019s work.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve got is a situation of a company, a startup, upfront selling large quantities of credits for a technology that is unproven,\u201d he said.",
      "In a statement, Gigablue said that bacteria does consume the particles but the effect is minimal, and its measurements will account for any loss of algae or particles as they sink.",
      "The company noted that a major science institute in New Zealand has given Gigablue its stamp of approval. Gigablue hired the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, a government-owned company, to review several drafts of its methodology.",
      "In a recent letter posted to Gigablue\u2019s website, the institute\u2019s chief ocean scientist said his staff had confidence the company\u2019s work is \u201cscientifically sound\u201d and the proposed measurements for carbon sequestration were robust.",
      "Whether Gigablue\u2019s methods are deemed successful, for now, will be determined not by regulators \u2014 but by another private company.",
      "Puro.earth is one of several companies known as registries that serve the carbon credit market.",
      "Amid the lack of regulation and the potential for climate startups to overstate their impact, registries aim to verify how much carbon was really removed.",
      "The Finnish Puro.earth has verified more than a million carbon credits since its founding seven years ago. But most of those credits originated in land-based climate projects. Only recently has it aimed to set standards for the ocean.",
      "In part, that\u2019s because marine carbon credits are some of the newest to be traded. Dozens of ocean startups have entered the industry, with credit sales catapulting from 2,000 in 2021 to more than 340,000, including Gigablue\u2019s deal, last year.",
      "But the ocean remains a hostile and expensive place in which to operate a business or monitor research. Some ocean startups have sold credits only to fold before they could complete their work. Running Tide, a Maine-based startup aimed at removing carbon from the atmosphere by sinking wood chips and seaweed, abruptly shuttered last year despite the backing of $50 million from investors, leaving sales of about 7,000 carbon credits unfulfilled.",
      "In June, Puro.earth published a draft methodology that will be used to verify Gigablue\u2019s work, which it designed in consultation with Gigablue. Once finalized, Gigablue will pay the registry for each metric ton of carbon dioxide that it claims to remove.",
      "Marianne Tikkanen, head of standards at Puro.earth, said that although this methodology was designed with Gigablue, her team expects other startups to adopt the same approach.",
      "\u201cWe hope that there will be many who can do it and that it stimulates the market,\u201d she said.",
      "It remains to be seen whether New Zealand officials will grant permission for the expanded \u201csequestration field\u201d that Gigablue has proposed creating, or if the company will look to other countries.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s environmental authority has so far treated Gigablue\u2019s work as research \u2014 a designation that requires no formal review process or consultations with the public. The agency said in a statement that it could not comment on how it would handle a future commercial application from Gigablue.",
      "But like many climate startups, Gigablue was involved in selling carbon credits during its research expeditions \u2014 not only inking a major deal, but smaller agreements, too.",
      "Pallas, the Italian businessman, said he ordered 22 carbon credits from Gigablue last year to offset the emissions associated with his event in November. He said Gigablue gave them to him for free \u2014 but says he will pay for more in the future.",
      "Pallas sought out carbon credits because he sees the signs of climate change all around him, he says, and expects more requirements in Italy for businesses to decarbonize in coming years. He chose Gigablue because they are one of the largest suppliers: \u201cThey\u2019ve got quantity,\u201d he said.",
      "How authorities view Gigablue\u2019s growing commercial activity could matter in the context of an international treaty that has banned certain climate operations in the ocean.",
      "More than a decade ago, dozens of countries including New Zealand agreed they should not allow any commercial climate endeavor that involves releasing iron in the ocean, a technique known as \u201ciron fertilization.\u201d Only research, they said, with no prospect of economic gain should be allowed.",
      "Iron is considered a key ingredient for spurring algae growth and was embedded in the particles that Gigablue dispersed in October in the Pacific Ocean. Several scientific papers have raised concerns that spurring iron-fueled algae blooms on a large scale would deplete important nutrients in the ocean and harm fisheries.",
      "The startup denies any link to iron dumping on the basis that its particles don\u2019t release iron directly into the water and don\u2019t create an uncontrolled algae bloom.",
      "\u201cWe are not fertilizing the ocean,\u201d Markus-Alford said.",
      "\u201cIn fact, we looked at iron fertilization as an inspiration of something to avoid,\u201d Shaashua said.",
      "But the draft methodology that Puro.earth will use to verify Gigablue\u2019s work notes many of the same concerns that have been raised about iron fertilization, including disruptions to the marine food web.",
      "Other scientists who spoke with AP see a clear link between Gigablue\u2019s work and the controversial practice. \u201cIf they\u2019re using iron to stimulate phytoplankton growth,\u201d said Kerry, the OceanCare scientist, \u201cthen it is iron fertilization.\u201d",
      "For now, scientific concerns don\u2019t seem to have troubled Gigablue\u2019s buyers. The company has already planned its next research expedition in New Zealand and hopes to release more particles this fall.",
      "\u201cThey mean well, and so do I,\u201d said Pallas, of his support for Gigablue. \u201cSooner or later, I\u2019ll catch a plane, go to New Zealand, and grab a boat to see what they\u2019ve done.\u201d",

      "Shriners Children\u2019s Research Institute intends to conduct research into cell and gene therapies, other biotechnology therapies, robotics, artificial intelligence, medical devices and the study of data.",
      "Shriners Children's operates 17 hospitals in the United States and one each in Mexico and Canada, plus clinics. The system is owned by Shriners International, a Masonic order. It specializes in treating children with orthopedic problems, burns, urology disorders and craniofacial conditions including cleft lips and palates. While the organization accepts insurance payments, it says that it treats patients regardless of their ability to pay.",
      "\u201cThis is a decision of the health care system to expand the role we play in pediatric research,\u201d said Mel Bower, a spokesperson for Shriners Children's. He said the institute will be financed using the Shriners Children's resources and should be operating within a year to 18 months.",
      "The institute projects it will have 470 employees, many of them new hires, and Georgia Tech said it will be the largest tenant at Science Square. That is a mixed-use development that Georgia Tech is developing along with the Trammell Crow Co.",
      "Georgia Tech owns the land adjoining its campus near downtown Atlanta, while the company built labs that opened last year. The development aims to emulate Georgia Tech's success in joint developments with technology companies in Atlanta's Midtown neighborhood. That tech sector has been a major driver of growth in Atlanta in recent years, and officials are now trying to bolster growth from biomedical research.",
      "Leanne West, the chief engineer of pediatric technology at Georgia Tech, said the university has already conducted 25 projects with Shriners Children's. She said both Georgia Tech and Emory University will lend research expertise to the institute, and she hopes institute employees can work alongside Georgia Tech researchers.",
      "\u201cThe goal is to really help embed some of their researchers here with Georgia Tech, to walk across campus, to work in the same labs, to have that physical presence together,\u201d West said. \u201cI think we can accomplish great things by doing that.\u201d",
      "The state and local governments are providing incentives to Shriners Children\u2019s, although it is not exactly clear how that would work because nonprofits are generally exempt from income and property taxes. In Georgia, nonprofit organizations do have to pay sales taxes, which means the state could waive such taxes on equipment purchases. Jessica Atwell, a spokesperson for the Georgia Department of Economic Development, said the state won\u2019t release documents until they are finalized.",

      "The 13% plunge in global sales over a year earlier suggests the damage to Tesla's brand from Musk's embrace of U.S. President Donald Trump and far-right European politicians is much deeper, widespread and lasting than some investors had expected. The figures reported by Tesla on Wednesday also signal that its quarterly earnings report due later this month could disappoint as rival electric-vehicle makers pounce on its weakness and steal market share. v",
      "Sales fell to 384,122 in April through June, down from 443,956 in the same three months last year.",
      "During the latest period, Musk formally left the Trump administration as a cost-cutting czar, and hopes rose that sales would recover. The Tesla CEO himself recently said the company was in the midst of a \u201cmajor rebound\u201d in sales, a statement contradicted by the latest figures.",
      "Still, some parts of the report were encouraging. Sales of the Models 3 and Y totaled 373,728, above the estimate of 356,000 from Wall Street analysts. Tesla shares rose 5% on the news.",

Cooper rejected AT&T\u2019s wager on the car phone, betting that America wanted to feel like Dick Tracy, armed with \u201ca device that was an extension of you, that made you reachable everywhere.\u201d",
      "Fifty-two years ago, Cooper declared victory in a call from a Manhattan sidewalk to the head of AT&T\u2019s rival program. His four-pound DynaTAC 8000X has evolved into a global population of billions of smartphones weighing mere ounces apiece. Some 4.6 billion people \u2014 nearly 60% of the world \u2014 have mobile internet, according to a global association of mobile network operators.",
      "The tiny computers that we carry by the billions are becoming massive, interlinked networks of processors that perform trillions of calculations per second \u2013 the computing power that artificial intelligence needs.

      "And this from a 20-year-old corroborates that: \u201cThe only person I call on a day-to-day basis is my cousin,\u201d says Ayesha Iqbal, a psychology student at Suffolk County Community College. \u201cI primarily text everyone else.\u201d",

      "The U.S. government is preparing to breed billions of flies and drop them from airplanes over Mexico and even southern Texas",
      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- The U.S. government is preparing to breed billions of flies and dump them out of airplanes over Mexico and southern Texas to fight a flesh-eating maggot.",
      "That sounds like the plot of a horror movie, but it is part of the government's plans for protecting the U.S. from a bug that could devastate its beef industry, decimate wildlife and even kill household pets. This weird science has worked well before.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an exceptionally good technology,\u201d said Edwin Burgess, an assistant professor at the University of Florida who studies parasites in animals, particularly livestock. \u201cIt\u2019s an all-time great in terms of translating science to solve some kind of large problem.\u201d",
      "The targeted pest is the flesh-eating larva of the New World Screwworm fly. The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to ramp up the breeding and distribution of adult male flies \u2014 sterilizing them with radiation before releasing them \u2014 so they can mate ineffectively with females and over time cause the population to die out.",
      "It is more effective and environmentally friendly than spraying the pest into oblivion, and it is how the U.S. and other nations north of Panama eradicated the same pest decades ago. Sterile flies from a factory in Panama kept the flies contained there for years, but the pest appeared in southern Mexico late last year.",
      "The USDA expects a new screwworm fly factory to be up and running in southern Mexico by July 2026. It plans to open a fly distribution center in southern Texas by the end of the year so that it can import and distribute flies from Panama if necessary.",
      "Most fly larvae feed on dead flesh, making the New World screwworm fly and its Old World counterpart in Asia and Africa outliers \u2014 and for the American beef industry, a serious threat. Females lay their eggs in wounds and, sometimes, exposed mucus.",
      "\u201cA thousand-pound bovine can be dead from this in two weeks,\u201d said Michael Bailey, president elect of the American Veterinary Medicine Association.",
      "Veterinarians have effective treatments for infested animals, but an infestation can still be unpleasant \u2014 and cripple an animal with pain.",
      "Don Hineman, a retired western Kansas rancher, recalled infected cattle as a youngster on his family's farm.",
      "\u201cIt smelled nasty,\u201d he said. \u201cLike rotting meat.\u201d",
      "The New World screwworm fly is a tropical species, unable to survive Midwestern or Great Plains winters, so it was a seasonal scourge. Still, the U.S. and Mexico bred and released more than 94 billion sterile flies from 1962 through 1975 to eradicate the pest, according to the USDA.",
      "The numbers need to be large enough that females in the wild can't help but hook up with sterile males for mating.",
      "One biological trait gives fly fighters a crucial wing up: Females mate only once in their weekslong adult lives.",
      "Alarmed about the fly's migration north, the U.S. temporarily closed its southern border in May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison and it won't be fully open again at least until mid-September.",
      "But female flies can lay their eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal, and that includes humans.",
      "Decades ago, the U.S. had fly factories in Florida and Texas, but they closed as the pest was eradicated.",
      "The Panama fly factory can breed up to 117 million a week, but the USDA wants the capacity to breed at least 400 million a week. It plans to spend $8.5 million on the Texas site and $21 million to convert a facility in southern Mexico for breeding sterile fruit flies into one for screwworm flies.",
      "In one sense, raising a large colony of flies is relatively easy, said Cassandra Olds, an assistant professor of entomology at Kansas State University.",
      "But, she added, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give the female the cues that she needs to lay her eggs, and then the larvae have to have enough nutrients.\"",
      "Fly factories once fed larvae horse meat and honey and then moved to a mix of dried eggs and either honey or molasses, according to past USDA research. Later, the Panama factory used a mix that included egg powder and red blood cells and plasma from cattle.",
      "In the wild, larvae ready for the equivalent of a butterfly\u2019s cocoon stage drop off their hosts and onto the ground, burrow just below the surface and grow to adulthood inside a protective casing making them resemble a dark brown Tic Tac mint. In the Panama factory, workers drop them into trays of sawdust.",
      "Security is an issue. Sonja Swiger, an entomologist with Texas A&M University\u2019s Extension Service, said a breeding facility must prevent any fertile adults kept for breeding stock from escaping.",
      "Dropping flies from the air can be dangerous. Last month, a plane freeing sterile flies crashed near Mexico\u2019s border with Guatemala, killing three people.",
      "In test runs in the 1950s, according to the USDA, scientists put the flies in paper cups and then dropped the cups out of planes using special chutes. Later, they loaded them into boxes with a machine known as a \u201cWhiz Packer.\u201d",
      "The method is still much the same: Light planes with crates of flies drop those crates.",
      "Burgess called the development of sterile fly breeding and distribution in the 1950s and 1960s one of the USDA\u2019s \u201ccrowning achievements.\u201d",
      "Some agriculture officials argue now that new factories shouldn\u2019t be shuttered after another successful fight.",
      "\u201cSomething we think we have complete control over \u2014 and we have declared a triumph and victory over \u2014 can always rear its ugly head again,\u201d Burgess said.",

Maria Cantwell of Washington on Monday night to introduce an amendment to strike the entire proposal. Voting on the amendment happened after 4 a.m. Tuesday as part of an overnight session as Republican leaders sought to secure support for the tax cut bill while fending off other proposed amendments, mostly from Democrats trying to defeat the package.",

      "The 33\u2014page opinion from U.S. District Judge Xavier Neals in New Jersey will enable an antitrust lawsuit that the U.S. Justice Department filed against Apple 15 months ago to proceed. Neals has set a timetable that could see the case come to trial in 2027.",

      "But Neals decided there is enough evidence to support the Justice Department's market definitions and concluded the case's key allegations merited further examination at trial.",
      "The case seeks to pierce the digital fortress that Apple Inc., based in Cupertino, California, has built around the iPhone, iPad and other products to create a so-called \u201cwalled garden\u201d allowing its hardware and software to mesh seamlessly for users.",
      "The Justice Department alleges that walled garden has mostly turned into a shield against competition, creating market conditions that enable it to charge higher prices and stifle innovation.",

The judge also concluded the Justice Department had pointed toward enough areas of troubling conduct that raised the \u201cdangerous possibility\u201d that Apple has turned the iPhone into an illegal monopoly.",
      "In a Monday statement, Apple reiterated its position that the Justice Department's case \u201cis wrong on the facts and the law, and we will continue to vigorously fight it in court.\u201d",

It says investigators found Harvard was at times a \u201cwillful participant in anti-Semitic harassment of Jewish students, faculty, and staff\u201d and that campus leaders allowed antisemitism to fester on the campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
      "\u201cFailure to institute adequate changes immediately will result in the loss of all federal financial resources and continue to affect Harvard\u2019s relationship with the federal government,\u201d officials said in the letter, which was obtained by The Associated Press and first reported by The Wall Street Journal.",
      "Harvard did not immediately comment.",
      "It\u2019s the latest intensification in the White House\u2019s battle with Harvard, which lost more than $2.6 billion in federal funding after rejecting a list of federal demands calling for sweeping changes to campus governance, hiring and admissions.",

      "Giving Funds is GoFundMe\u2019s latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered",
      "NEW YORK -- GoFundMe CEO Tim Cadogan had some complications while fundraising on his own website last fall.",
      "Several friends wanted to help Cadogan reach his $28,000 goal as he crowdfunded for a Los Angeles area wilderness rescue team. But they tried to donate through a lesser-known wealth management tool called a donor-advised fund, or a DAF, a no-frills investing vehicle for money earmarked as eventual charitable gifts. After cutting checks and waiting three weeks, Cadogan said, the money finally arrived.",
      "\u201cIt was just a bit of a thing,\u201d he added. \"If they were using a Giving Fund, it would take ten seconds.\u201d",
      "Giving Funds are GoFundMe's latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered. But the for-profit company's DAF, announced Monday, enters a crowded market of more than a thousand providers \u2014 products often with older, wealthier clienteles that are often criticized for warehousing gifts.",
      "To transform the way that everyday users plan their donations, Cadogan will have to widen the appeal of DAFs beyond the likes of the technology entrepreneur's circles. And he wants to change public perceptions of his company as just a crowdfunding site.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re also hopeful that more people will start using GoFundMe for a broader set of things in their lives: not just that one fundraiser they\u2019re supporting, not just that one nonprofit. But they\u2019re coming in and they\u2019re managing their giving portfolio with us and through us,\u201d Cadogan said. \u201cThat connects directly to our mission, which is we want to help people help each other.\u201d",
      "Donor-advised funds grew popular over the last decade among ultra-high net worth individuals as a tax-efficient instrument for grantmaking without the hassle of a more sophisticated charitable foundation. Donors can immediately write the contribution off on their taxes but face no deadline for giving the money to a nonprofit.",
      "The idea: account holders could invest money they wanted to ultimately donate, let the funds grow tax-free while they sit and give themselves time to identify the recipients best aligned with their giving goals.",
      "There's since been a rush to court average givers. Legacy financial services firms such as Fidelity Charitable lowered the minimums to open accounts. Fintech startups such as Daffy contrast their flat fees with the hidden expenses they allege their competitors charge. All that traction brought IRS proposals last year to impose penalties on those who abuse DAFs and Congress has considered legislation that would require some deadlines for disbursements.",
      "GoFundMe's Giving Funds will have no minimum balances, zero management fees and donations starting at $5. Users can load their DAF through their bank accounts or direct deposits for free. Credit card payments will be covered through the end of the year and then face the company's standard transaction fee of 2.2% plus 30 cents. Contributions can then be invested in a choice of exchange traded funds from managers including Vanguard, Blackrock and State Street Global Advisors.",
      "Cadogan pitches Giving Funds as a way to be more intentional about giving \u2014 something he said user feedback suggests more people want. As he sees it, widespread adoption hasn't occurred because DAFs have been framed as \u201cwealth management products.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a giving product,\u201d Cadogan said. \u201cIt\u2019s something for everybody. And you don\u2019t need to know the words \u2018donor advised fund.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t show up.\u201d",
      "DAFs remain scrutinized for allowing donors to reap tax benefits before they ever redistribute any money to charitable causes \u2014 even if the notion that the channel is being exploited is fiercely debated in the nonprofit sector. Opaque disclosure requirements make it difficult to put a number on the overall assets held within the funds. The National Philanthropic Trust placed the total at more than $250 billion in 2023.",
      "Cadogan believes GoFundMe's culture is uniquely suited to nudge users with targeted spotlights of the 1.5 million charities already active on the platform. Giving Funds holders will be peppered with information about local nonprofits, crisis responders, their friends' charities of choice and potential beneficiaries that address their selected issue areas.",
      "That \u201cdynamic, alive community\u201d is very different from the \u201cfairly static, passive\u201d financial vehicles in the current market, according to Cadogan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s essentially inspiring the money to move,\u201d he said.",
      "Other features seek to encourage contributions by simplifying things. Users can set annual giving goals by a percentage of their income or a fixed number. Their gifts will tally up in real-time records to track their progress and ease year-end tax planning.",
      "Streamlining the process was one area for improvement identified in the DAF Research Collaborative's recent survey of more than 2,100 donors. But Jeff Williams, one of the researchers, said DAFs are currently hitting the \u201csweet spot of convenience and connection to nonprofits.\u201d",
      "The challenge for any new player, he said, is that it's a competitive environment with many different options. Plus, he added, many DAFs already are \u201cavailable-to-everyone vehicles\" considering that half run balances under $50,000.",
      "\u201cGivers are voting with their feet that DAFs are increasing with popularity. More options are generally better,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnything that makes sure we maintain or enhance the ease of giving, it makes me happier.\u201d",
      "But Direct Relief CEO Amy Weaver, previously the CFO at Salesforce, described GoFundMe's entrance as \u201ca game changer\u201d that could unlock additional funds. Direct Relief, a nonprofit that supplies free medical resources worldwide, reported receiving more than 18,000 DAF gifts totaling $116 million over the past five years.",
      "Weaver acknowledged DAFs have been traditionally used by those with more substantial wealth. But she encouraged people to view them as a \u201csavings account\" for \"good works.\"",
      "\u201cAnd GoFundMe, with its name familiarity and the fact that it really attracts people making smaller gifts, I think could be incredibly powerful if they can bring DAFs to that group of people,\u201d she said.",

      "BEIJING -- While China's men's soccer team hasn't generated much excitement in recent years, humanoid robot teams have won over fans in Beijing based more on the AI technology involved than any athletic prowess shown.",
      "Four teams of humanoid robots faced off in fully autonomous 3-on-3 soccer matches powered entirely by artificial intelligence on Saturday night in China's capital in what was touted as a first in China and a preview for the upcoming World Humanoid Robot Games, set to take place in Beijing.",
      "According to the organizers, a key aspect of the match was that all the participating robots operated fully autonomously using AI-driven strategies without any human intervention or supervision.",
      "Equipped with advanced visual sensors, the robots were able to identify the ball and navigate the field with agility",
      "They were also designed to stand up on their own after falling. However, during the match several still had to be carried off the field on stretchers by staff, adding to the realism of the experience.",
      "China is stepping up efforts to develop AI-powered humanoid robots, using sports competitions like marathons, boxing, and football as a real-world proving ground.",
      "Cheng Hao, founder and CEO of Booster Robotics, the company that supplied the robot players, said sports competitions offer the ideal testing ground for humanoid robots, helping to accelerate the development of both algorithms and integrated hardware-software systems.",
      "He also emphasized safety as a core concern in the application of humanoid robots.",
      "\u201cIn the future, we may arrange for robots to play football with humans. That means we must ensure the robots are completely safe,\u201d Cheng said. \u201cFor example, a robot and a human could play a match where winning doesn\u2019t matter, but real offensive and defensive interactions take place. That would help audiences build trust and understand that robots are safe.\u201d",
      "Booster Robotics provided the hardware for all four university teams, while each school\u2019s research team developed and embedded their own algorithms for perception, decision-making, player formations, and passing strategies\u2014including variables such as speed, force, and direction, according to Cheng.",
      "In the final match, Tsinghua University\u2019s THU Robotics defeated the China Agricultural University\u2019s Mountain Sea team with a score of 5\u20133 to win the championship.",
      "Mr. Wu, a supporter of Tsinghua, celebrated their victory while also praising the competition.",

And having seen this up close and personal, I can assure you that he is only interested in using the American military to accomplish American people's goals. Whatever he does, that is his focus.\"",

But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"",

      "In November, following the election, a source close to the vice president told ABC News that Vance had been tasked to ensure that all of the priorities of the Trump administration move forward and would work on any of the issues Trump needed him to further, signaling that the vice president would not be assigned one specific issue to work on, but would be involved in several policy issues.",
      "It was also expected that Vance would be Trump's \"eyes and ears\" in the Senate to ensure that his agenda moves forward, the source also said. It's familiar territory for Vance, who was elected to the Senate in 2022.",
      "All this comes as Vance is viewed by some as the MAGA heir apparent to Trump ahead of the 2028 election. At the same time, he is working to raise as much money as possible for Republicans ahead of the 2026 midterms as chair of the Republican National Committee -- the first time a vice president has ever held the role.",
      "Joel Goldstein, a vice-presidential scholar and former professor at Saint Louis University Law School, told ABC News that Vance is working in a different timeline compared to his predecessors, as he will serve only one term as vice president under Trump.",
      "\"Every vice presidency is different and one of the things that is unique about Vance's is that every other vice president, you know, with the possible exception of Harris, entered office with the expectation that the president was going to run for reelection,\" Goldstein said.",
      "\"I think he's in a very unique position in that his first term as vice president is his last, and so his presidential ambitions, the time for reckoning comes up, you know, much quicker than is normally the case.\"",
      "Following his tie-breaking votes in the Senate, several Democrats who might be opponents in the 2028 presidential election attempted to make Vance the face of Trump's spending bill.",
      "In a post on X, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg called out Vance for casting the tie-breaking vote to allow the bill to move forward.",
      "\"VP Vance has cast the deciding vote in the Senate to cut Medicaid, take away food assistance, blow up the deficit, and add tax breaks for the wealthiest,\" Buttigieg wrote. \"This bill is unpopular because it is wrong,\" he continued.",
      "California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom told Americans on X to \"bookmark\" this moment, writing that \"JD Vance is the ultimate reason why 17 million Americans will lose their healthcare.\"",
      "In an interview with NBC News, Trump pointed to Vance and Secretary of State and interim national security adviser Marco Rubio as possible successors, and said, when asked, that he believes his MAGA movement can survive without him.",
      "Asked about the president's comments, Vance said that if he does end up running for president, he's \"not entitled to it.\"",

    "summary": "Three years after the launch of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, the service is seeing increased call, chat and text volume and reductions in specialized offerings.",
    "story": [
      "Critics say LGBTQ youth are more than four times as likely to attempt suicide.",
      "Three years after the launch of the three-digit 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, the service is seeing increases in call volume, state-level support and reported effectiveness, as well as reductions in specialized offerings, including one designed to help LGBTQ youth.",
      "\"This year, the 988 Lifeline continued to provide life-saving help to millions of people, with about a 20% higher volume of calls, texts and chats compared to the year prior,\" Dr. John Palmieri, acting director of SAMHSA's 988 Lifeline Office, told ABC News via email.",
      "SAMHSA is the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the division of the Department of Health and Human Services which oversees 988.",
      "\"Recent evaluation work affirms the effectiveness of the 988 Lifeline, with studies showing that the vast majority of suicidal callers saying they thought their crisis call helped them and stopped them from killing themselves,\" he added.",
      "A network of more than 200 crisis call centers field calls, chats and texts on behalf of the Lifeline, offering support to callers experiencing suicidal crises and other forms of mental distress. This network has existed in some form for at least a couple of decades, beginning with the precursor to 988 -- the 10-digit National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which was started in 2005.",
      "During his first term, President Donald Trump signed into law the National Suicide Hotline Improvement Act of 2018, which designated 988 as the new three-digit number to call in case of a mental health emergency. The new number, intended to be easier to remember and access in times of crisis, officially launched on July 16, 2022.",
      "13 million contacts so far",
      "Since that launch date, the Lifeline has answered over 13 million calls, chats and texts across the U.S. and its territories, according to SAMHSA.",
      "\"The transition to 988 three years ago sparked coordinated efforts across the country -- inspiring local governments, states, Tribes and healthcare providers to improve crisis care response systems in communities nationwide,\" Palmieri said.",
      "Despite increasing state-level support for the Lifeline, recent downsizing efforts across the federal government have had an impact on the ability to \"build out a crisis continuum of care across the country,\" Hannah Wesolowski, chief advocacy officer for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, told ABC News.",
      "\"Interestingly, the administration has proposed flat funding for 988 for fiscal year 2026, so that was really encouraging that they're proposing keeping funding levels at [$519.6 million],\" Wesolowski said. \"But with a lot of the changes within HHS, we've seen a fair number of the staff within the 988 behavioral health crisis coordinating office depart the administration.\"",
      "The Trump administration has implemented significant workforce reductions for HHS and SAMHSA over the last few months. HHS also recently announced a major restructuring effort, which includes plans for additional staffing cuts and and the reorganization of some of the department's agencies, including SAMHSA, under a new entity called Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "Asked how these changes to SAMHSA's place within the federal government may impact its oversight of 988, SAMHSA told ABC News via email that, \"The 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline will continue daily, life-saving work, helping thousands of people every day and millions of people every year.\"",
      "In addition to the federal funding of 988, states offer varying levels of funding to support the Lifeline's operation. Many states have chosen to either adopt fees or recurring state appropriations in order to maintain efficient service and availability of counselors.",
      "Currently, twelve states charge a small tax on phone bills every month to fund 988 operations. This funding structure is modeled after the one used to fund 911 call centers. Those twelve states include Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Colorado, Minnesota, Illinois, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and Vermont.",
      "The permanent funding fees range from no cost in New York to $0.60 in Delaware.",
      "An additional five states -- Arizona, Utah, Kansas, Georgia, Florida -- have implemented recurring state appropriations, meaning those states' legislatures offer funding through their annual budget.",
      "\"We've seen an increased commitment by states to create sustainable funding mechanisms for the service and a growth in local response to people in crisis,\" Palmieri said via email.",
      "While states have been increasing resources to support 988, the Lifeline's offerings nationwide are about to change.",
      "Currently, callers to the Lifeline are prompted to press numbered options for certain specialized services -- 1 for the Veterans' Crisis Line, 2 for the Spanish-language subnetwork and 3 for LGBTQ-youth centered care.",
      "'Press 3' option for LGBTQ youth",
      "SAMHSA recently announced that the Press 3 option, which provides specialized care for LGBTQ youth, will no longer be a part of the Lifeline. That repeal was announced during LGBTQ Pride Month, just under three years after the subnetwork was first established as a pilot program in 2022.",
      "The cut came as a surprise to those working on the specialized line, including The Trevor Project, which has been operating this type of service for ten years, according to Interim Vice President of Advocacy and Government Affairs Mark Henson.",
      "Henson told ABC News that the federal funding for the service allowed The Trevor Project and other organizations to \"double our capacity to serve youth.\"",
      "Since the launch of Press 3, Henson says the option has fielded over 1.3 million calls, chats and texts. Monthly calls have also increased from 1,752 at the option's launch to 69,057 answered contacts in its last reported data from SAMHSA in May 2025.",
      "In a letter to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., a bipartisan group of Congressional representatives responded to the cut announcement, noting that the subnetwork has averaged approximately 2,100 contacts per day.",
      "\"These numbers reflect the critical, ongoing demand for this targeted support,\" the members said. \"To a young person feeling alone and scared, 988 is truly a lifeline.\"",
      "In a statement announcing the discontinuation, SAMHSA said the move comes in response to significant operation costs and \"to focus on serving all help seekers, including those previously served through the Press 3 option.\"",
      "\"The Fiscal Year 2023 Omnibus included a Congressional directive for $29.7 million to fund the specialized services,\" SAMHSA said. \"Federal funding in FY24 for the Press 3 services increased to $33 million. As of June 2025, more than $33 million in funds have been spent to support the subnetworks, fully expending the monies allocated for 988 Lifeline LGB+ subnetwork services.\"",
      "Despite the evident utility of the specialized option, \"Press 3 option has run out of Congressionally directed funding,\" an HHS spokesperson wrote in a statement to ABC News, adding, \"continued funding of the Press 3 threatened to put the entire 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in danger of massive reductions in services.\"",
      "The Trevor Project remains adamant that the change to the program will do more harm than good because it neglects the specific challenges that people in the LGBTQ community face.",
      "\"I think there's a fundamental lack of understanding that suicide prevention is about risk and not about identity,\" Henson told ABC News. \"It's because of the life experiences and the stigma and the bullying associated with LGBTQ+ young people that make them more than four times as likely to attempt suicide.\"",
      "\"It's their life experiences and the unique drivers that have increased their risk of suicidality and therefore, have tailored care,\" he added.",
      "For NAMI's part, Wesolowski said the organization is, \"continuing to advocate with Congress,\" to reverse the decision to remove press 3, saying that, \"members of Congress on both sides of the aisle express some concern around this.\"",
      "Despite the federal shifts, Wesolowski says she hopes the foundation of 988 is strong enough to withstand political changes, both now and in the future.",
      "\"The goal has always been that anyone who's in a mental health crisis or emotional distress gets appropriate mental health care response,\" she said. \"And I think right now, the [political] uncertainty is creating a lot of concern. [But] I think there's still strong bipartisan support and cross systems support.\"",
      "If you are experiencing suicidal, substance use or other mental health crises, or are worried about a friend or loved one, please call or text the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. You will reach a trained crisis counselor for free, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. You can also go to 988lifeline.org.",

      "Though Trump campaigned on protecting Medicaid, the program that provides health care for low-income and elderly Americans is one of the largest federal programs targeted in the bill.",
      "The bill imposes new 80-hour per month work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients aged 19 to 64 who don't have dependents. These requirements include working or other approved activities, such as volunteering.",
      "There are exemptions for parents or guardians of children under age 14 and those with disabilities.",
      "These work requirements won't kick in until 2026.",
      "Health policy experts say the population of able bodied Americans on Medicaid who don\u2019t work is fairly small \u2014 but that many more might lose their coverage because of the burdensome paperwork requirements that will come with regularly proving work status.",
      "Another Medicaid funding cut will come from a change to provider taxes, or taxes on health care organizations, which states use to fund their Medicaid programs. The biggest impacts will felt through the closing of health centers in rural areas, health care employers say, because there are already longstanding struggles to stay open for many of them.",
      "Health policy experts and health care workers say the biggest impacts will felt through the closing of health centers throughout the country, especially in rural areas that were heavily funded by Medicaid. Others will lose coverage because of the work requirements and the additional paperwork required under the bill.",
      "The original measure passed by the House made around $600 billion in cuts to Medicaid, but that grew with the Senate bill: new estimates from the non partisan Congressional Budget Office project federal spending on Medicaid will be reduced by $1 trillion and the number of uninsured people will increase by nearly 12 million by 2034.",
      "The Senate added a $50 billion rural hospital fund to the package to placate senators who had concerns about the impact of Medicaid cuts on their constituents, but it's unclear how the funding will be distributed or whether it will be sufficient to make up the anticipated shortfall from changes to the Medicaid provider tax.",
      "There are also proposed changes to the Affordable Care Act that take effect in 2026 and could result in millions more people losing coverage, increasing the number to 17 million.",
      "Under the bill, automatic renewal processes would be eliminated and open market insurance applicants would also be subjected to more paperwork.",
      "The bill changes work requirements for adults who are part of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, which would greatly reduce the number of eligible Americans.",
      "The bill raises the work requirement age from 54 to 64 and adds parents with children older than 6. Parents with dependent children at home, regardless of age, are currently exempt from these requirements.",
      "Those changes will go into effect as early as this year.",
      "The Republican spending bill also forces states to shoulder at least 5% of SNAP benefit costs starting in 2028. Currently, the program is 100% federally funded.",
      "The SNAP cuts total an estimated $230 billion over 10 years.",
      "Some of the tax changes will go into effect this year and be reflected when Americans file their taxes in 2026.",
      "The bill allows tax deductions on tips and overtime pay. Deductions on tips is capped at $25,000 per year while deductions on overtime is capped at $12,500 per year.",
      "The standard deduction would rise by $750 for single filers and $1,500 for those filing jointly.",
      "One of the biggest changes was the state and local taxes (SALT) deduction, which allows taxpayers to itemize state and local taxes in their filing, including property taxes.",

    "summary": "The University of Pennsylvania decided to ban transgender female athletes from competing in women's sports.",
    "story": [
      "\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing, dangerous and ill-advised,\" said an LGBTQ rights lawyer.",
      "The University of Pennsylvania's decision to ban transgender female athletes from competing in women's sports to resolve a civil rights complaint by the Department of Education is being slammed by LGBTQ activists and legal experts as unconstitutional.",
      "The Trump administration announced this week that the Ivy League school has agreed to follow the Department of Education's interpretation of Title IX, the landmark civil rights law that prohibits sex-based discrimination in education programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance.",
      "The administration had previously suspended $175 million in federal contracts awarded to Penn, citing the participation of openly transgender athlete Lia Thomas on the women's swimming team during the 2021-2022 season.",
      "\"It's embarrassing, dangerous and ill-advised. I think they made a very big mistake that they will come to regret,\" Shannon Minter, legal director for the National Center for LGBTQ Rights, told ABC News. \"It's bizarre behavior, and it just seems humiliating that such a powerful, respected university is just caving in to these cruel and gratuitously hurtful positions.\"",
      "Minter added, \"I think extortion is a very good metaphor for what's going on here. It is the federal government threatening to withhold funding if the university doesn't agree to take a position.\"",
      "'Legally it makes no sense'",
      "As part of the agreement, Penn will adhere to two of President Donald Trump's executive orders that the White House says defend women from \"gender ideology extremism.\"",
      "The university is also required to strip Thomas of her swimming awards, including her win in the 500 freestyle at the 2022 NCAA Division I Swimming & Diving Championships, and send a letter of apology to female swimmers who competed against Thomas.",
      "The school also agreed to keep student-athlete bathrooms and locker room access strictly separate on the basis of sex.",
      "\"Legally, it makes no sense,\" Minter said. \"I mean, the position of the Trump administration is that Penn somehow did something wrong by following the law that was recognized to be the law by federal courts and by the Department of Education and the Department of Justice at the relevant time, and they were complying with NCAA policy. So, to punish them after the fact because the administration now has taken a different position on what they think the law should be, is pretty outlandish.\"",
      "When asked for comment, the university directed ABC News to a letter to the school community by University of Pennsylvania President Dr. J. Larry Jameson.",
      "In the letter, Jameson said the university's \"commitment to ensuring a respectful and welcoming environment for all of our students is unwavering.\"",
      "The letter added: \"At the same time, we must comply with federal requirements, including executive orders, and NCAA eligibility rules, so our teams and student-athletes may engage in competitive intercollegiate sports.\"",
      "White House: 'Common-sense' victory",
      "U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon applauded Penn's decision as a \"common-sense\" victory for women and girls.",
      "\"Thanks to the leadership of President Trump, UPenn has agreed both to apologize for its past Title IX violations and to ensure that women's sports are protected at the University for future generations of female athletes,\" McMahon said in a statement.",
      "During his presidential campaign, Trump pledged to get \"transgender insanity the hell out of our schools\" and \"keep men out of women's sports.\"",
      "\"This Administration does not just pay lip service to women's equality: it vigorously insists on that equality being upheld,\" Riley Gaines, a former University of Kentucky swimmer who tied with Thomas for fifth place in the 200 freestyle at the 2022 NCAA championships, said in a statement about the UPenn decision.",
      "Gaines said she hoped Penn's decision would prompt other educational institutions to refrain from violating women's civil rights, and \"renews hope in every female athlete that their country's highest leadership will not relent until they have the dignity, safety, and fairness they deserve.\"",
      "In a 2022 interview with ABC's \"Good Morning America,\" Thomas, who originally competed on Penn's men's swim team, denied she had an unfair advantage over swimmers who were born female.",
      "\"There's a lot of factors that go into a race and how well you do and the biggest change for me is that I'm happy, and sophomore year, where I had my best times competing with the men, I was miserable,\" Thomas told GMA. \"So, having that be lifted is incredibly relieving and allows me to put my all into training, into racing. Trans people don't transition for athletics. We transition to be happy and authentic and our true selves.\"",
      "Minter said it was \"shocking\" that Penn would agree retroactively to punishment for something lawful at the time.",
      "\"In my view, it's still lawful. The only thing that has changed is the administration has taken a different view,\" Minter said. \"This is just classic intimidation, bullying and harassment. It's really sad to see a university like Penn just knuckle under, I'm sure in hopes that they will not be further targeted if they do so. It's a shameful day for the university, for our country.\"",
      "Minter said he believes Penn's agreement is opening the university up to \"all kinds of liability\" moving forward.",
      "\"They have now stated publicly that they were violating the law, and so what's to stop all kinds of other third parties from coming back and suing them now and saying, 'Well, you've admitted that what you were doing is unlawful.' I mean, it wasn't, but they've now said it was and so they're creating liability for themselves,\" Minter said.",
      "Supreme Court to hear trans athlete case",
      "Naiymah Sanchez, senior organizer for the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, told ABC News that she fears other universities that are subject to the Department of Education's civil rights investigation will follow in Penn's footsteps.",
      "\"The anti-trans movement is allowing the building of power amongst people who are ignorant because they don't know and people who feel like if only we can remove these folks, we will have a better life,\" said Sanchez. \"There's nothing that the University of Pennsylvania did that was unlawful. It followed standard guidelines.\"",
      "State bans on transgender students participating in girls' and women's sports have become flashpoints across the country.",
      "On Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court announced it would hear appeals from two states seeking to uphold such laws.",
      "The cases from West Virginia and Idaho -- which will be scheduled for argument next term in the fall -- will decide whether the Constitution and the Civil Rights Act prohibit the bans based on an athlete's sex assigned at birth.",
      "Lower courts in those cases sided with the student athletes in finding the state laws violated either the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause or Title IX of the Civil Rights Act.",
      "The decision to hear the cases follows a decision by the court's conservative majority last month upholding state bans on gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors. Chief Justice John Roberts said the laws did not violate the 14th Amendment or discriminate on the basis of sex, even though the same medical treatments are widely available to cisgender minors.",
      "Sanchez noted that in 2024, then-NCAA President Charlie Baker, the former Republican governor of Massachusetts, testified at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that out of more than 500,000 student athletes competing at the college level, fewer than 10 were transgender.",
      "\"As a trans person, we try not to get too emotionally attached to the issues that are happening, even if we're not the ones who are being denied the right,\" Sanchez said. \"But the reality is that a new administration came in and they set their targets to a certain thing. They're going after the easiest fruit on the tree. But it's not just about picking the easiest fruit on the tree, it's about uprooting the entire tree.\"",

      "President Donald Trump's major tax cut and spending bill passed the House on Thursday, but not without some Republican opposition.",
      "Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania voted against the legislation alongside the entire House Democratic Caucus.",
      "While Massie and Fitzpatrick were the only GOP members to vote no, several House GOP hardliners were angered by the changes made to the bill by the Senate and there was an overnight scramble by Speaker Mike Johnson to secure the necessary support to proceed. Some of the hardliners who ultimately voted yes say President Trump made promises to get their votes, including that he'd make the bill \"better\" in the future.",
      "On Thursday, Massie said he did not vote for the bill because of its projected impact on the national debt. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill could add $3.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.",
      "\"Although there were some conservative wins in the budget reconciliation bill (OBBBA), I voted No on final passage because it will significantly increase U.S. budget deficits in the near term, negatively impacting all Americans through sustained inflation and high interest rates,\" Massie wrote on X. Massie also opposed the House version of the megabill that passed back in May.",
      "Trump's been a vocal critic of Massie, lambasting him last month in a lengthy social media post as not being \"MAGA.\"",
      "\"Actually, MAGA doesn\u2019t want him, doesn\u2019t know him, and doesn\u2019t respect him,\" Trump wrote at the time.",
      "The president accused Massie of being a \"grandstander\" who routinely votes no on key Republican-led legislation. Trump suggested Massie should be challenged in the upcoming Republican primary, even before this latest vote.",
      "\"The good news is that we will have a wonderful American Patriot running against him in the Republican Primary, and I\u2019ll be out in Kentucky campaigning really hard,\" Trump wrote.",
      "Rep. Fitzpatrick did vote for the House bill in May, but said on Thursday that the Senate changes to the bill (which resulted in deeper cuts to Medicaid) as the reason for his change in position.",
      "As I\u2019ve stated throughout these negotiations, with each iteration of legislative text that was placed on the House Floor, I\u2019ve maintained a close and watchful eye on the specific details of these provisions, and determined the specific district impact, positive or negative, on our PA-1 community,\" Fitzpatrick said in a statement.",
      "\"I voted to strengthen Medicaid protections, to permanently extend middle class tax cuts, for enhanced small business tax relief, and for historic investments in our border security and our military,\" he added/ \"However, it was the Senate\u2019s amendments to Medicaid, in addition to several other Senate provisions, that altered the analysis for our PA-1 community. The original House language was written in a way that protected our community; the Senate amendments fell short of our standard.\"",
      "\"I believe in, and will always fight for, policies that are thoughtful, compassionate, and good for our community. It is this standard that will always guide my legislative decisions,\" Fitzpatrick said.",

      "President Donald Trump campaigned on keeping the United States out of foreign wars, but it didn\u2019t take long to convince him to come to the direct aid of Israel",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- President Donald Trump campaigned on keeping the United States out of foreign wars, but it didn't take long to convince him to come to the direct aid of Israel, hitting Iranian nuclear targets with bunker-buster bombs dropped by B-2 stealth bombers and Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from a submarine.",
      "Beyond the attack's immediate impact on helping bring the 12-day war to a close, experts say Trump's decision to use force against another country also will certainly be reverberating in the Asia-Pacific, Washington's priority theater.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s strikes on Iran show that he\u2019s not afraid to use military force \u2014 this would send a clear message to North Korea, and even to China and Russia, about Trump's style,\u201d said Duyeon Kim, a senior analyst at the Center for a New American Security based in Seoul, South Korea.",
      "\u201cBefore the strikes, Pyongyang and Beijing might have assumed that Trump is risk averse, particularly based on his behavior his first presidency despite some tough talk,\" Kim said.",
      "Ten days into the war between Israel and Iran, Trump made the risky decision to step in, hitting three nuclear sites with American firepower on June 22 in a bid to destroy the country\u2019s nuclear program at a time while negotiations between Washington and Tehran were still ongoing.",
      "The attacks prompted a pro forma Iranian retaliatory strike the following day on a U.S. base in nearby Qatar, which caused no casualties, and both Iran and Israel then agreed to a ceasefire on June 24.",
      "North Korea, China and Russia all were quick to condemn the American attack, with Russian President Vladimir Putin calling it \u201cunprovoked aggression,\u201d China's Foreign Ministry saying it violated international law and \u201cexacerbated tensions in the Middle East,\u201d and North Korea's Foreign Ministry maintaining it \u201ctrampled down the territorial integrity and security interests of a sovereign state.\u201d",
      "While the strikes were a clear tactical success, the jury is still out on whether they will have a more broad strategic benefit to Washington's goals in the Middle East or convince Iran it needs to work harder than ever to develop a nuclear deterrent, possibly pulling the U.S. back into a longer-term conflict.",
      "If the attack remains a one-off strike, U.S. allies in the Asia-Pacific region likely will see the decision to become involved as a positive sign from Trump's administration, said Euan Graham, a senior defense analyst with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. strike on Iran will be regarded as net plus by Pacific allies if it is seen to reinforce red lines, restore deterrence and is of limited duration, so as not to pull the administration off-course from its stated priorities in the Indo-Pacific,\u201d he said. \u201cChina will take note that Trump is prepared to use force, at least opportunistically.\u201d",
      "In China, many who have seen Trump as having a \u201cno-war mentality\u201d will reassess that in the wake of the attacks, which were partially aimed at forcing Iran's hand in nuclear program negotiations, said Zhao Minghao, an international relations professor at China\u2019s Fudan University in Shanghai.",
      "\u201cThe way the U.S. used power with its air attacks against Iran is something China needs to pay attention to,\u201d he said. \u201cHow Trump used power to force negotiations has a significance for how China and the U.S. will interact in the future.\u201d",
      "But, he said, Washington should not think it can employ the same strategy with Beijing.",
      "\u201cIf a conflict breaks out between China and the U.S., it may be difficult for the U.S. to withdraw as soon as possible, let alone withdraw unscathed,\u201d he said.",
      "Indeed, China and North Korea present very different challenges than Iran.",
      "First and foremost, both already have nuclear weapons, raising the stakes of possible retaliation considerably in the event of any attack.",
      "There also is no Asian equivalent of Israel, whose relentless attacks on Iranian missile defenses in the opening days of the war paved the way for the B-2 bombers to fly in and out without a shot being fired at them.",
      "Still, the possibility of the U.S. becoming involved in a conflict involving either China or North Korea is a very real one, and Beijing and Pyongyang will almost certainly try to assess what the notoriously unpredictable Trump would do.",
      "North Korea will likely be \u201cquite alarmed\u201d at what Israel, with a relatively small but high-quality force, has been able to achieve over Iran, said Joseph Dempsey, a defense expert with the International Institute for Strategic Studies.",
      "At the same time, it likely will be seen internally as justification for its own nuclear weapons program,",
      "\u201cIf Iran did have deployable nuclear weapons would this have occurred?\u201d Dempsey said. \u201cProbably not.\u201d",
      "The U.S. decision to attack while still in talks with Iran will also not go unnoticed, said Hong Min, a senior analyst at South Korea\u2019s Institute for National Unification.",
      "\u201cNorth Korea may conclude that dialogue, if done carelessly, could backfire by giving the United States a pretext for possible aggression,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cInstead of provoking the Trump administration, North Korea is more likely to take an even more passive stance toward negotiations with Washington, instead focusing on strengthening its internal military buildup and pursuing closer ties with Russia, narrowing the prospects for future talks,\" he said.",
      "China will look at the attacks through the visor of Taiwan, the self-governing democratic island off its coast that China claims as its own territory and President Xi Jinping has not ruled out taking by force.",
      "The U.S. supplies Taiwan with weapons and is one of its most important allies, though Washington's official policy on whether it would come to Taiwan\u2019s aid in the case of a conflict with China is known as \u201cstrategic ambiguity,\" meaning not committing to how it would respond.",
      "Militarily, the strike on Iran raises the question of whether the U.S. might show less restraint than has been expected by China in its response and hit targets on the Chinese mainland in the event of an invasion of Taiwan, said Drew Thompson, senior fellow with the Singapore-based think tank RSIS Rajaratnam School of International Studies.",
      "It will also certainly underscore for Beijing the \u201cdifficulty of predicting Trump's actions,\u201d he said.",
      "\"The U.S. airstrike on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities caught many by surprise,\" Thompson said. \"I think it demonstrated a tolerance and acceptance of risk in the Trump administration that is perhaps surprising.\u201d",
      "It also gives rise to a concern that Taiwan\u2019s President Lai Ching-te, who in recent speeches has increased warnings about the threat from China, may be further emboldened in his rhetoric, said Lyle Goldstein, director of the Asia Program at the Washington-based foreign policy think tank Defense Priorities.",
      "Already, Lai's words have prompted China to accuse him of pursuing Taiwanese independence, which is a red line for Beijing. Goldstein said he worried Taiwan may try to take advantage of the American \u201cuse of force against Iran to increase its deterrent situation versus the mainland.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Lai's series of recent speeches appear almost designed to set up a new cross-strait crisis, perhaps in the hopes of building more support in Washington and elsewhere around the Pacific,\u201d said Goldstein, who also is director of the China Initiative at Brown University\u2019s Watson Institute.",
      "\u201cI think that is an exceedingly risky gambit, to put it mildly,\" he said.",

      "The home of the world's premier film festival is joining a growing global backlash against overtourism, which recently saw uproar over Jeff Bezos\u2019 and Lauren Sanchez' Venice wedding this weekend, water-gun protests in Spain and a surprise strike at the Louvre Museum.",
      "\u201cLess numerous, less big, less polluting and more esthetic\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s the aim of Cannes city councilors who voted Friday to introduce new limits on cruise ships in its ports starting Jan. 1. Only ships with fewer than 1,000 passengers will be allowed in the port, with a maximum of 6,000 passengers disembarking per day. Larger ships will be expected to transfer passengers to smaller boats to enter Cannes.",

      "KABUL, Afghanistan -- By plane, motorbike, camper van and even on bicycles, tourists are beginning to discover Afghanistan, with solo travelers and tour groups gradually venturing into a country that until recently was wracked by war.",
      "And the country\u2019s Taliban government, which seized power more than three years ago but has yet to be formally recognized by any other nation, is more than happy to welcome them.",
      "\u201cThe Afghan people are warm and welcoming and wish to host tourists from other countries and engage with them,\u201d Deputy Minister of Tourism Qudratullah Jamal told The Associated Press in an early June interview. \u201cTourism brings many benefits to a country. We have considered those benefits and aim for our nation to take full advantage of them.\u201d",
      "Tourism is a vital, multi-billion-dollar industry for many countries.",
      "Afghanistan\u2019s isolation on the international stage, largely because of the Taliban\u2019s restrictions on women and girls, has left much of its 41 million people mired in poverty. As it struggles to attract foreign investment, the lucrative potential of tourism is far from lost on the government.",
      "\u201cWe are currently earning a considerable amount of revenue from this industry, and we are hopeful it will grow even more in the future,\u201d Jamal said, noting money spent by visitors can reach more layers of society than revenue from other industries. \u201cWe are optimistic this sector will evolve into a large economy, bringing significant benefits. It plays an important role in strengthening our national economy.\u201d",
      "Tourist visas are quick and easy to obtain and flights from major transit hubs such as Dubai and Istanbul operate several times a week. The government has even set up a training institute for men \u2014 and it is only for men \u2014 seeking jobs in the hospitality and tourism sector.",
      "While visitor numbers are still very much a trickle rather than a flood, they are increasing. Nearly 9,000 foreign tourists visited Afghanistan last year, while nearly 3,000 people visited in the first three months of this year, Jamal said.",
      "Four decades of near-continuous conflict kept nearly all vacationers away from this landlocked country of towering mountains, deep gorges and millennia of history.",
      "The Taliban\u2019s takeover from a U.S.-backed government in August 2021 stunned the world and sent thousands of Afghans fleeing. But with the insurgency over, the bloodshed from frequent bombings and suicide attacks all but ended too.",
      "Attacks still occur, however. An Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan remains active and gunmen killed six people, including three Spanish tourists, in a May 2024 attack in Bamiyan, one of the country\u2019s main tourist attractions where centuries-old giant Buddhas carved into the cliffs were blown up by the Taliban in 2001.",
      "While Western countries still advise against travel to Afghanistan, a drop in violence from the two decades of U.S.-led military presence is indisputable, as the government is keen to point out.",
      "\u201cAfghanistan has gone through many years of war and hardship. Now, we want tourists to come and see the true traditions and customs of Afghans, to understand Afghan life, creativity and resilience,\u201d Jamal said, noting there was \u201ccomprehensive security across Afghanistan.\u201d",
      "Critics question the ethics of foreigners visiting Afghanistan for pleasure when its government discriminates so heavily against half the country\u2019s population.",
      "Education beyond primary school level is banned for girls and women and few professions are open to them. Women cannot enter parks, gardens or gyms.",
      "Beauty salons are forbidden. Authorities dictate how women dress and have demanded they cover their faces in public, a decree still flouted by many, particularly in Kabul.",
      "Some visitors say they contemplated the ethics, but ultimately wanted to see the situation for themselves.",
      "French-Peruvian Illary Gomez said she and her British partner, James Liddiard, debated for about a year whether to drive through Afghanistan as part of their U.K.-to-Japan camper van journey.",
      "\u201cSome things didn\u2019t feel morally right,\u201d she said.",
      "But once here, they said they found a warm, hospitable and welcoming people and beautiful landscapes. They didn\u2019t feel their presence was any form of support for the Taliban.",
      "By traveling, \u201cyou put money in the hands of the people, not the government,\u201d Liddiard said.",
      "The treatment of women is particularly sensitive for government officials. Jamal declined to comment on the subject beyond saying male and female visitors were welcome.",
      "\u201cThose who respect our laws and traditions have already come and can continue to come,\u201d he said.",
      "While most restrictions are strictly enforced on Afghan women, they are far more relaxed for foreigners. Although they must still wear a headscarf in public, foreign women are more likely to gain entry into some restricted areas such as parks and are rarely asked to cover their faces in public.",
      "Opening the country to foreign visitors was also a way of building bridges, Jamal said.",
      "\u201cIt is a great way to promote interaction between the people of different countries. It helps build international relations and is also beneficial for trade,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cWhen foreigners come here, Afghans also learn a lot from them. In addition to expanding commerce, tourism also helps foster mutual understanding, cultural exchange and strengthens talents as people learn from one another.\u201d",
      "A foreign traveler seeing the country with his own eyes \u201ccreates closeness, builds connections and fosters trust among people,\u201d Jamal said. \u201cThey will respect each other\u2019s culture and the distance between peoples will diminish.",
      "\u201cSo this is not just economic development; it also brings spiritual and political benefits,\u201d he said.",

None are from South Sudan, which is enmeshed in civil war and where the U.S government advises no one should travel before making their own funeral arrangements.

      "Fireworks are a cornerstone of America's Fourth of July celebrations, but that can make the spirited holiday dangerous",
      "St. Louis -- The Fourth of July is Americana at its core: parades and cookouts and cold beer and, of course, fireworks.",
      "Those pyrotechnics also make it an especially dangerous holiday, typically resulting in more than 10,000 trips to the emergency room. Yet fireworks remain at the center of Independence Day, a holiday 247 years in the making.",
      "Here are five things to know about July Fourth, including the origin of the holiday and how fireworks became part of the tradition.",
      "The holiday celebrates the Second Continental Congress\u2019 unanimous adoption of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, a document announcing the colonies\u2019 separation from Great Britain.",
      "One year later, according to the Library of Congress, a spontaneous celebration in Philadelphia marked the anniversary of American independence.",
      "But across the burgeoning nation, observations didn\u2019t become commonplace until after the War of 1812. It quickly took off: The Library of Congress notes that major historic events in the 19th century, such as groundbreaking ceremonies for the Erie Canal and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, were scheduled to coincide with Fourth of July festivities.",
      "The display of pyrotechnics has been a big part of Independence Day from the outset. Founding Father John Adams saw it coming.",
      "Commemoration of America\u2019s independence \u201cought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more,\u201d Adams wrote in a letter to his wife, Abigail, dated July 3, 1776.",
      "Fireworks were around centuries before America became a nation. The American Pyrotechnics Association says many historians believe fireworks were first developed in the second century B.C. in ancient China by throwing bamboo stalks into fires, causing explosions as the hollow air pockets overheated.",
      "By the 15th century, fireworks were widely used for religious festivals and public entertainment in Europe and early U.S. settlers carried on those traditions, the association said.",
      "Presidents from George Washington to Donald Trump have celebrated the nation\u2019s birth on the Fourth of July, with one exception: Adams.",
      "His letter to his wife aside, Adams refused to celebrate the holiday on July 4 because he felt July 2 was the real Independence Day. Why? It was on July 2, 1776, that the Continental Congress voted in favor of the resolution for independence, though the Declaration of Independence wasn\u2019t formally adopted until two days later.",
      "Adams was so adamant that he turned down invitations to festivals and other events, even while serving as the nation\u2019s second president. Ironically, Adams and Thomas Jefferson, the primary author of the Declaration of Independence, both died on the 50th anniversary of the document\u2019s formal adoption, July 4, 1826.",
      "Consumer sales of fireworks have grown rapidly over the past two decades.",
      "Statistics from the American Pyrotechnics Association show that in 2000, American consumers spent $407 million on fireworks. By 2024, that figure rose to $2.2 billion. The biggest jump came during the COVID-19 pandemic, when public fireworks displays were shut down. Consumer sales jumped from $1 billion in 2019 to $1.9 billion in 2020.",
      "The cost of fireworks could soar if the trade war between the U.S. and China continues \u2014 most aerial shells, paper rockets and sparkly fountains that transfix the eyes of Americans every Fourth of July are imported from China. A 90-day pause on Trump's hefty tariffs on Chinese imports brought some temporary relief, but industry experts are uncertain as they watch for an agreement.",
      "Despite widespread education efforts, thousands of Americans are badly injured by fireworks each year.",
      "The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission reports that in 2024, 11 deaths were blamed on fireworks, up 38% from 2023. An estimated 1,700 people were treated at emergency rooms for sparkler-related injuries and 14,7000 people were injured from fireworks \u2014 a 52% increase compared to 2023.",
      "Burns were the most common injury. People hurt their hands and fingers most often, and head, face and ear injuries were frequent, too.",
      "For those planning to shoot off fireworks, experts urge finding a flat, hard, level surface away from structures and other things that could catch fire. The person responsible for the fireworks should avoid alcohol. Children should never ignite them.",
      "Experts have also encouraged having a bucket or hose nearby in case of fire or explosion. Shoot off one at a time and walk away quickly after igniting, she said, and never relight or handle a malfunctioned firework. When done, shovel up the remains and soak them before disposing.",

      "Millions of protesters have denounced President Donald Trump as a would-be autocrat and marched under the banner \u201cNo Kings.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- Alarmed by the policies of President Donald Trump, millions turned out last month for protests around the United States and overseas. Mindful of next year\u2019s 250th anniversary of American independence, organizers called the movement \u201cNo Kings.\u201d",
      "Had the same kind of rallies been called for in the summer of 1775, the response likely would have been more cautious.",
      "\u201cIt ('No Kings') was probably a minority opinion in July 1775,\u201d says H.W. Brands, a prize-winning scholar and chair of the history department at the University of Texas at Austin.",
      "\u201cThere was a lot of passion for revolution in New England, but that was different from the rest of the country,\u201d says Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Joseph Ellis. \u201cThere were still people who don't want to drawn into what they feared was an unnecessary war.\u201d",
      "This month marks the 250th anniversary \u2014 the semiquincentennial \u2014 of a document enacted almost exactly a year before the Declaration of Independence: \u201cThe Olive Branch Petition,\u201d ratified July 5, 1775 by the Continental Congress. Its primary author was John Dickinson, a Pennsylvanian whose writing skills led some to call him the \u201cPenman of the Revolution,\u201d and would stand as a final, desperate plea to reconcile with Britain.",
      "The notion of \u201cNo Kings\u201d is a foundation of democracy. But over the first half of 1775 Dickinson and others still hoped that King George III could be reasoned with and would undo the tax hikes and other alleged abuses they blamed on the British Parliament and other officials. Ellis calls it the \u201cAwkward Interval,\u201d when Americans had fought the British in Lexington and Concord and around Bunker Hill, while holding off from a full separation.",
      "\u201cPublic opinion is changing during this time, but it still would have been premature to issue a declaration of independence,\u201d says Ellis, whose books include \u201cFounding Brothers,\u201d \u201cThe Cause\u201d and the upcoming \u201cThe Great Contradiction.\"",
      "The Continental Congress projected unity in its official statements. But privately, like the colonies overall, members differed. Jack Rakove, a professor of history at Stanford University and author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning \u201cOriginal Meanings,\u201d noted that delegates to Congress ranged from \u201cradicals\u201d such as Samuel Adams who were avid for independence to such \u201cmoderates\u201d as Dickinson and New York's John Jay.",
      "The Olive Branch resolution balanced references to \u201cthe delusive pretences, fruitless terrors, and unavailing severities\u201d administered by British officials with dutiful tributes to shared ties and to the king's \u201croyal magnanimity and benevolence.\u201d",
      "\u201c(N)otwithstanding the sufferings of your loyal Colonists during the course of this present controversy, our Breasts retain too tender a regard for the Kingdom from which we derive our Origin to request such a Reconciliation as might in any manner be inconsistent with her Dignity or her welfare,\u201d the sometimes obsequious petition reads in part.",
      "The American Revolution didn\u2019t arise at a single moment but through years of anguished steps away from the \u201cmother\u201d country \u2014 a kind of weaning that at times suggested a coming of age, a young person\u2019s final departure from home. In letters and diaries written in the months before July 1775, American leaders often referred to themselves as children, the British as parents and the conflict a family argument.",
      "Edmund Pendleton, a Virginia delegate to the Continental Congress, urged \u201ca reconciliation with Our mother Country.\u201d Jay, who would later help negotiate the treaty formally ending the Revolutionary War, proposed informing King George that \u201cyour majesty\u2019s American subjects\u201d are \u201cbound to your majesty by the strongest ties of allegiance and affection and attached to their parent country by every bond that can unite societies.\u201d",
      "In the Olive Branch paper, Dickinson would offer tribute to \u201cthe union between our Mother country and these colonies.\u201d",
      "The Congress, which had been formed the year before, relied in the first half of 1775 on a dual strategy that now might be called \u201cpeace through strength,\u201d a blend of resolve and compromise. John Adams defined it as \u201cto hold the sword in one hand, the olive branch in the other.\u201d Dickinson's petition was a gesture of peace. A companion document, \u201cThe Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms,\" was a statement of resolve.",
      "The 1775 declaration was drafted by Thomas Jefferson, who a year later would be the principal writer of the Declaration of Independence, revised by Dickinson and approved by the Congress on July 6. The language anticipated the Declaration of Independence with its condemnation of the British for \u201ctheir intemperate Rage for unlimited Domination\u201d and its vows to \u201cmake known the Justice of our Cause.\u201d",
      "But while the Declaration of Independence ends with the 13 colonies \u201cabsolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown,\u201d the authors in 1775 assured a nervous public \u201cthat we mean not to dissolve that Union which has so long and so happily subsisted between us, and which we sincerely wish to see restored.\u201d",
      "\u201cNecessity has not yet driven us into that desperate Measure, or induced us to excite any other Nation to war against them,\u201d they wrote.",
      "John Adams and Benjamin Franklin were among the peers of Dickinson who thought him naive about the British, and were unfazed when the king refused even to look at the Olive Branch petition and ruled that the colonies were in a state of rebellion. Around the same time Dickinson was working on his draft, the Continental Congress readied for further conflict. It appointed a commander of the newly-formed Continental Army, a renowned Virginian whom Adams praised as \u201cmodest and virtuous ... amiable, generous and brave.\"",

      "States and rural health advocacy groups are sounding the alarm that Congress\u2019 slashing of Medicaid will devastate already financially fragile rural hospitals",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Tyler Sherman, a nurse at a rural Nebraska hospital, is used to the area's aging farmers delaying care until they end up in his emergency room.",
      "Now, with Congress planning around $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts over 10 years, he fears those farmers and the more than 3,000 residents of Webster County could lose not just the ER, but also the clinic and nursing home tied to the hospital.",
      "\u201cOur budget is pretty heavily reliant on the Medicaid reimbursement, so if we do see a cut of that, it\u2019ll be difficult to keep the doors open,\u201d said Sherman, who works at Webster County Community Hospital in the small Nebraska town of Red Cloud just north of the Kansas border.",
      "If those facilities close, many locals would see their five-minute trip to Webster County hospital turn into a nearly hour-long ride to the nearest hospital offering the same services.",
      "\u201cThat's a long way for an emergency,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cSome won't make it.\u201d",
      "States and rural health advocacy groups warn that cutting Medicaid \u2014 a program serving millions of low-income and disabled Americans \u2014 would hit already fragile rural hospitals hard and could force hundreds to close, stranding some people in remote areas without nearby emergency care.",
      "More than 300 hospitals could be at risk for closure under the Republican bill, according to an analysis by the Cecil G. Sheps Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which tracks rural hospital closures. Even as Congress haggled over the controversial bill, a health clinic in the southwest Nebraska town of Curtis announced Wednesday it will close in the coming months, in part blaming the anticipated Medicaid cuts.",
      "Bruce Shay, of Pomfret, Connecticut, fears he and his wife could be among those left in the lurch. At 70, they're both in good health, he said. But that likely means that if either needs to go to a hospital, \u201cit's going to be an emergency.\u201d",
      "Day Kimball Hospital is nearby in Putnam, but it has faced recent financial challenges. Day Kimball's CEO R. Kyle Kramer acknowledged that a Senate bill passed Tuesday \u2014 estimated to cut federal Medicaid spending in rural areas by $155 billion over 10 years \u2014 would further hurt his rural hospital's bottom line. Roughly 30% of Day Kimball\u2019s current patients receive Medicaid benefits, a figure that\u2019s even higher for specific, critical services like obstetrics and behavioral health.",
      "\u201cAn emergency means I\u2019m 45 minutes to an hour away from the nearest hospital, and that\u2019s a problem,\" Shay said. And he and his wife wouldn't be the only ones having to make that trip.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got, I\u2019m sure, thousands of people who rely on Day Kimball Hospital. If it closed, thousands of people would have to go to another hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge load to suddenly impose on a hospital system that\u2019s probably already stretched thin.\u201d",
      "Rural hospitals have long operated on the financial edge, especially in recent years as Medicaid payments have continuously fallen below the actual cost to provide health care. More than 20% of Americans live in rural areas, where Medicaid covers 1 in 4 adults, according to the nonprofit KFF, which studies health care issues.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s $4.5 trillion tax breaks and spending cuts bill, which passed Thursday, would worsen rural hospitals' struggles by cutting a key federal program that helps states fund Medicaid payments to health care providers. To help offset the lost tax revenue, the package includes $1.2 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and other social safety net programs \u2014 cuts they insist only root out fraud and waste in the system.",
      "But public outcry over Medicaid cuts led Republicans to include a provision that will provide $10 billion annually to buttress rural hospitals over the next five years, or $50 billion in total. Many rural hospital advocates are wary that it won't be enough to cover the shortfall.",
      "Carrie Cochran-McClain, chief policy officer with the National Rural Health Association, said rural hospitals already struggle to break even, citing a recent American Hospital Association report that found that hospitals in 2023 got nearly $28 billion less from Medicaid than the actual cost of treating Medicaid patients.",
      "\u201cWe see rural hospitals throughout the country really operating on either negative or very small operating margins,\" Cochran-McClain said. \"Meaning that any amount of cut to a payer \u2014 especially a payer like Medicaid that makes up a significant portion of rural provider funding \u2014 is going to be consequential to the rural hospitals' ability to provide certain services or maybe even keep their doors open at the end of the day.\u201d",
      "A KFF report shows 36 states losing $1 billion or more over 10 years in Medicaid funding for rural areas under the Republican bill, even with the $50 billion rural fund. No state stands to lose more than Kentucky.",
      "The report estimates the Bluegrass State would lose a whopping $12.3 billion \u2014 nearly $5 billion more than the next state on the list. That's because the bill ends Kentucky's unique Medicaid reimbursement system and reduces it to Medicare reimbursement levels.",
      "Kentucky currently has one of the lowest Medicare reimbursement rates in the country. It also has one of the highest poverty rates, leading to a third of its population being covered by Medicaid.",

      "The U.S. military wants to keep training at this spot, called Pohakuloa, so it's ready to quickly send troops to Asia and the Pacific. Its importance to the U.S. is only growing as China becomes more assertive, particularly regarding Taiwan.",
      "But the Army's lease for state lands beneath a key part of the training range expires in 2029. Native Hawaiians upset with the U.S. military\u2019s history of damaging Hawaiian lands with target practice and fuel leaks want the Army out.",
      "\u201cThey have bombed and contaminated not just our land but our waters,\u201d said Healani Sonoda-Pale, a community organizer with the Hawaiian sovereignty group Ka Lahui Hawaii. \u201cWhen does this end?\u201d",

      "The Navy turned the island of Kahoolawe, off Maui, into a bombing range after the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. The Navy returned it in 1994 after years of protests. But subsequent cleanup efforts have been incomplete. Live grenades and bombs remain scattered across a quarter of the island.",
      "Memories are still fresh from when the Navy spilled jet fuel into Pearl Harbor\u2019s drinking water from a network of underground fuel storage tanks and pipes in 2021. The leak prompted 6,000 people to seek medical care for rashes, nausea and other ailments and contaminated a Honolulu aquifer. The disaster occurred after admirals spent years dismissing community calls to move the tanks. On Tuesday, Honolulu's water utility sued the Navy seeking to recoup an estimated $1.2 billion that it has had to spend because of the spill.",
      "Also on Oahu, environmental advocates say Army live-fire training in Makua Valley sparked wildfires and destroyed native forestland and sacred cultural sites. A legal settlement stopped such training in 2004.",
      "Pohakuloa consists of rocky plains, hills and brush about 6,200 feet (1,900 meters) above sea level between the Big Island\u2019s tallest volcanoes, Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa. It hosts endangered species including the Hawaiian catchfly shrub.",
      "Early Hawaiians ventured across the plateau to reach a Mauna Kea quarry that produced high-quality basalt for stone tools and to travel between coastal towns.",
      "In 2022, Army staff discovered ancient wooden \u201ckii,\u201d or figures, in a lava tube, an underground passageway created by molten rock. Consultants said the figures are from human burials, and state preservationists say they're among Hawaii's most significant archaeological finds.",
      "Pohakuloa Training Area spans more than 200 square miles (518 square kilometers). The section in question is only 17% of that total, but it\u2019s critically located in between two larger federal parcels. Troops fire munitions from the state-owned parcel onto federal lands.",
      "Other live-fire training areas in Hawaii are too small to accommodate battalions and brigades.",
      "Commanders say it would take too long to send troops, trucks and helicopters to the U.S. mainland for drills.",
      "\u201cWhat we anticipate in a future fight is that we will not have the time to recover that equipment and to position ourselves back into the region,\u201d said Maj. Gen. James Bartholomees, U.S. Army Pacific chief of staff.",

      "The Marine Corps, Navy and Air Force exercise there, as do allied and partner militaries. The Hawaii National Guard accounts for one-quarter of Pohakuloa's training. County fire and police departments use it too.",
      "The Army prepared an environmental impact statement, including public feedback, that analyzed how the military's continued use of the land would affect plants, animals and cultural heritage.",
      "On May 9, the state land board rejected it after hearing hours of often emotional testimony in opposition. Among other issues, the board cited inadequate inventory of unexploded ordnance and insufficient inventory of ancient burials and associated artifacts.",
      "The Army is considering whether to appeal. It could also negotiate a land exchange with the state instead.",
      "Such talks can't begin until the Army finalizes its environmental study with a decision about its plans. The defense secretary's office then must sign off on acquiring land.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists from the University of Miami, the Florida Aquarium, and Tela Coral in Honduras are transplanting crossbred coral fragments onto a reef off Miami's coast",
      "KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. -- A team of scientists from the University of Miami, the Florida Aquarium and Tela Coral in Honduras is working together to transplant crossbred coral fragments onto a reef off Miami\u2019s coastline that was devastated by coral bleaching two years ago.",
      "They\u2019re looking for ways to help reefs survive increased ocean temperatures caused by global warming and climate change.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the end of a very long process,\" Andrew Baker, professor of marine biology and ecology at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School and director of the Coral Reef Futures Lab, said Tuesday as divers planted the corals off Miami.",
      "The plan of introducing corals from the Caribbean evolved over the past few years.",
      "\"We had this idea that we really needed to try to help Florida\u2019s coral reef by introducing more diversity from around the Caribbean, recognizing that some of the biggest threats to corals, like climate change, are really global phenomena and if you try to have Florida\u2019s reefs save themselves on their own, we could give them some outside help,\u201d Baker said.",
      "Coral breeding has also been done in Hawaii, where in 2021, scientists were working to speed up the coral\u2019s evolutionary clock to breed \u201csuper corals\u201d that can better withstand the impacts of global warming.",
      "Baker's group teamed with the Florida Aquarium and Tela Coral, bringing in fragments of corals from a warm reef off of Tela, Honduras, which spawned in tanks at the aquarium.",
      "\u201cWe were able to cross the spawn from those corals, the sperm and the eggs, to produce babies. One parent from Florida, one parent from Honduras,\u201d Baker said.",
      "They chose the reef off of Tela because the water is about 2 degrees Celsius (35.6 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than the water off the coast of Florida.",
      "\u201cAnd yet the corals in those environments, and especially the Elkhorn corals, are really thriving,\u201d Baker said.",
      "He noted that there are extensive beds that are hundreds of meters long, full of flourishing Elkhorn.",
      "\u201cAnd yet they survive there despite really warm conditions and also quite nutrient-polluted waters,\u201d Baker said.",
      "The conditions are similar to those Florida will face over the next century, Baker said.",
      "It's also the first time international crossbreeding of corals has been permitted for planting onto wild reefs.",
      "\u201cSo we're really excited to see how these do,\u201d he said.",
      "The hope is the corals will be more \u201cthermally tolerant,\u201d which Baker and the team will be testing throughout the summer.",
      "Elkhorn corals are some of Florida's most iconic species and are valuable because they form the crest of the reef, Baker said.",
      "\u201cAnd the reef is what protects shorelines from storms and flooding. So if you have healthy Elkhorn coral populations, you have a great reef that is acting almost like a speed bump over which waves and storms pass and dissipate their energy before they hit the coast,\u201d he said.",
      "Elkhorn corals are in serious decline, thanks in part to the coral bleaching in 2023 and warming sea temperatures, Baker said.",
      "While coral get their bright colors from the colorful algae that live inside them, prolonged warmth causes the algae to release toxic compounds. The coral ejects them, and a stark white skeleton \u2014 referred to as coral bleaching \u2014 is left behind, and the weakened coral is at risk of dying.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve lost maybe more than 95% of the Elkhorn corals that were on Florida\u2019s reefs at that point,\u201d Baker said.",
      "Some of the corals spawned in the Florida Aquarium's laboratory arrived there in 2020, said Keri O\u2019Neil, director and senior scientist with the aquarium's Coral Conservation Program.",
      "She said more fragments from Honduras and Florida will continue to live at the center.",
      "\u201cWe hope that every year in the future we can make more and more crosses and continue to figure out which parents produce the best offspring,\u201d O'Neil said.",
      "The tiny Elkhorn coral fragments were placed onto small concrete bases along the reef on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve arranged them in a certain way that we can compare the performance of each of corals,\u201d Baker said.",
      "The team will study how the corals that have a Honduran parent compare to the ones that are entirely from Florida.",
      "\"But it\u2019s really the future that we\u2019re looking to and in particular, a warming future and a warming summer, how these corals do and do they have more thermal tolerance than the native Florida population, because that\u2019s really what the goal of the whole project is,'' he said.",
      "Baker said it's the most exciting project he's worked on during his 20-year stint at the University of Miami.",
      "If the corals thrive, it could provide a blueprint for working across the Caribbean to share corals.",
      "\u201cThis is a project about international collaboration, about the fact that our environment really doesn\u2019t have closed borders, that we can work together to make things better in the world,\u201d said Juli Berwald, co-founder of Tela Cora. \u201cAnd it shows that when we talk to each other, when we work together, we can really do something that might be life-changing, not just for us but for the corals and the reefs and all the animals that rely on the reefs.\u201d",

      "This seasonal dance choreographed by Mother Nature marks a special time for the southwestern United States and Mexico. It is when residents clasp their hands, hoping for much-needed moisture to dampen the threat of wildfire and keep rivers flowing.",
      "Forecasters say it has been a wet start to this year\u2019s monsoon season, which officially began June 15 and runs through the end of September. Parts of New Mexico and West Texas have been doused with rain, while Arizona and Nevada have been hit with dust storms, which are a common hazard of the season.",
      "In other parts of the world, monsoons often mean months of never-ending rain.",
      "In North America, the season can have considerable variability. The bursts and breaks depend on how much moisture is circulating and which way the wind blows.",
      "The monsoon relies on the buildup of summer heat and shifting wind direction, which helps funnel moisture from distant bodies of water to areas where rain is sparse.",
      "Just ahead of the monsoon, officials with the Navajo Nation declared an emergency because of worsening drought conditions across the reservation, which spans parts of New Mexico, Arizona and Utah.",
      "Below-average precipitation month after month has left little forage for livestock, and fire danger has ramped up as pockets of moderate and severe drought expand. Ranchers and farmers are being urged to reduce their herds, shift to drought-tolerant crops and limit irrigation.",
      "New Mexico\u2019s governor also declared an emergency in May because of severe drought and escalating fire risk.",
      "Forecasters with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Integrated Drought Information System say monsoonal rainfall only provides a fraction of the West\u2019s water supplies, with the majority coming from snowpack. Still, summer rains can reduce drought impacts by lessening the demand for water stored in reservoirs, recharging soil moisture and groundwater, and reducing the risk of wildfires.",
      "New Mexico and Arizona typically stand to benefit the most from the North American monsoon, getting anywhere between 10% to 60% of their annual precipitation during the season. It has a lesser influence in Nevada and California, though southern Nevada on average gets 20% to 25% of its precipitation during the summer.",
      "Along the Rio Grande at the base of the Jemez Mountains, Santa Ana Pueblo farmers are eagerly watching the afternoon skies. Pueblo Gov. Myron Armijo said they have already had several good downpours, and he wouldn\u2019t mind more.",
      "But that will be for the spirits to decide, Armijo said. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s not up to us,\u201d he said.",
      "With summer rains come increased river flows and in some cases flooding in normally dry washes and across the scars left by wildfires.",
      "Sandbag stations have been set up in communities across the region \u2014 from Tucson, Arizona, to Albuquerque and San Antonio, Texas. In Espa\u00f1ola, state transportation workers have closed a historic bridge that funnels traffic across the Rio Grande, citing concerns about higher flows further eroding a concrete pier.",
      "On the edge of the Gila National Forest, New Mexico National Guard troops have delivered dozens of pallets of filled sandbags for residents who are preparing for flooding following a blaze that has charred about 74 square miles (192 square kilometers).",
      "Meanwhile, hundreds of firefighters are hoping for higher humidity and rain to tamp down a wildfire that is racing through a mountainous area of the Navajo Nation. Fire officials reported that the flames made a 6-mile (9.66-kilometer) run in a matter of hours.",
      "Once the fire is out, land managers acknowledge that the monsoon will be a mixed blessing, as rainfall on the charred hillsides will surely result in surges of runoff filled with ash and debris.",
      "Just as light and shadow move across the mesa tops beyond artist Daniel McCoy\u2019s studio, the Rio Grande pulses with each downpour, turning into what looks like a sudsy caramel concoction as it carries away sediment.",
      "The river and the desert badlands and purple mountain peaks that border it are the inspiration for the giant canvasses McCoy is preparing for an upcoming show at the Hecho a Mano gallery in Santa Fe.",
      "McCoy, who is Muskogee (Creek) and Potawatomi, grew up working on a farm with his grandfather in Oklahoma. He and his green thumb faced new challenges when he moved to the arid Southwest, where water shortages often lead to mandatory rationing and pleas for prayers.",
      "A sign down the street from his studio reads in Spanish: \u201cEl Agua No Se Vende. El Agua Se Defiende.\u201d It means water isn\u2019t for sale, and the right to access the finite resource should be defended.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s made me mindful more than I ever thought I would be,\u201d he said of hearing stories from longtime locals about the preciousness of water.",

    "story": [
      "A volunteer searching the archives of the American Baptist in Massachusetts has found a nearly 180-year-old document shedding light on the church's support for ending slavery",
      "GROTON, Mass. -- Jennifer Cromack was combing through the American Baptist archive when she uncovered a slim box among some 18th and 19th century journals. Opening it, she found a scroll in pristine condition.",
      "A closer look revealed the 5-foot-long (1.5-meter-long) document was a handwritten declaration titled \u201cA Resolution and Protest Against Slavery,\" signed by 116 New England ministers in Boston and adopted March 2, 1847. Until its discovery in May at the archives in Groton, Massachusetts, American Baptist officials worried the anti-slavery document had been lost forever after fruitless searches at Harvard and Brown universities and other locations. A copy was last seen in a 1902 history book.",
      "\u201cI was just amazed and excited,\u201d Cromack, a retired teacher who volunteers at the archive, said. \u201cWe made a find that really says something to the people of the state and the people in the country. ... It speaks of their commitment to keeping people safe and out of situations that they should not be in.\"",
      "The document offers a glimpse into an emerging debate over slavery in the 18th century in the Northeast. The document was signed 14 years before the start of the Civil War as a growing number of religious leaders were starting to speak out against slavery.",
      "The document also shines a spotlight on a critical moment in the history of the Baptist church.",
      "It was signed two years after the issue of slavery prompted southern Baptists to split from northern Baptists and form the Southern Baptist Convention, the nation\u2019s largest Protestant denomination. The split in 1845 followed a ruling by the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society prohibiting slave owners from becoming missionaries. The northern Baptists eventually became American Baptist Churches USA.",
      "\u201cIt comes from such a critical era in American history, you know, right prior to the Civil War,\u201d said Rev. Mary Day Hamel, the executive minister of the American Baptist Churches of Massachusetts.",
      "\u201cIt was a unique moment in history when Baptists in Massachusetts stepped up and took a strong position and stood for justice in the shaping of this country,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s become part of our heritage to this day, to be people who stand for justice, for American Baptists to embrace diversity.\u201d",
      "Deborah Bingham Van Broekhoven, the executive director emerita of the American Baptist Historical Society, said many Americans at the time, especially in the North, were \u201cundecided\u201d about slavery and weren't sure how to respond or were worried about speaking out.",
      "\u201cThey thought it was a southern problem, and they had no business getting involved in what they saw as the state\u2019s rights,\u201d Van Broekhoven said. \u201cMost Baptists, prior to this, would have refrained from this kind of protest. This is a very good example of them going out on a limb and trying to be diplomatic.\u201d",
      "The document shows ministers had hoped \u201csome reformatory movement\u201d led by those involved in slavery would make their action \u201cunnecessary,\u201d but that they felt compelled to act after they \u201cwitnessed with painful surprise, a growing disposition to justify, extend and perpetuate their iniquitous system.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnder these circumstances we can no longer be silent,\u201d the document states. \u201cWe owe something to the oppressed as well as to the oppressor, and justice demands the fulfillment of that obligation. Truth and Humanity and Public Virtue, have claims upon us which we cannot dishonor.\u201d",
      "The document explains why the ministers \u201cdisapprove and abhor the system of American slavery.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith such a system we can have no sympathy,\u201d the document states. \u201cAfter a careful observation of its character and effects and making every deduction with the largest charity can require, we are constrained to regard it as an outrage upon the rights and happiness of our fellow men, for which there is no valid justification or apology.\u201d",
      "Rev. Diane Badger, the administrator of the American Baptist Church of Massachusetts who oversees the archive, teamed up with Rev. John Odams of the First Baptist Church in Boston to identify what she called the \u201cHoly Grail\u201d of abolitionist-era Baptist documents. Her great-grandfather was an American Baptist minister.",
      "Since its discovery, Badger has put all the ministers' names on a spreadsheet along with the names of the churches where they served. Among them was Nathaniel Colver, of Tremont Temple in Boston, one of the first integrated churches in the country, now known as Tremont Temple Baptist Church. Another was Baron Stow, who belonged to the state's anti-slavery society.",
      "Badger also is working to estimate the value of the document, which is intact with no stains or damage, and is making plans to ensure it is protected. A digital copy could eventually be shared with some of Massachusetts' 230 American Baptist churches.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been kind of an interesting journey and it\u2019s one that\u2019s still unfolding,\u201d Badger said. \u201cThe questions that always come to me, OK, I know who signed it but who didn\u2019t? I can go through my list, through my database and find who was working where on that and why didn\u2019t they sign that. So it\u2019s been very interesting to do the research.\u201d",
      "Rev. Kenneth Young \u2014 whose predominantly Black Calvary Baptist Church in Haverhill, Massachusetts, was created by freed Blacks in 1871 \u2014 called the discovery inspiring.",
      "\u201cI thought it was awesome that we had over hundred signers to this, that they would project that freedom for our people is just,\u201d Young said. \u201cIt follows through on the line of the abolitionist movement and fighting for those who may not have had the strength to fight for themselves against a system of racism.\u201d",

      "A stark disagreement over regulating AI in Republicans\u2019 tax cut and spending bill is the latest tension among conservatives about whether to let states continue to put guardrails on emerging technologies or minimize such interference",
      "NEW YORK -- A controversial bid to deter states from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade seemed on its way to passing as the Republican tax cut and spending bill championed by President Donald Trump worked its way through the U.S. Senate.",
      "But as the bill neared a final vote, a relentless campaign against it by a constellation of conservatives \u2014 including Republican governors, lawmakers, think tanks and social groups \u2014 had been eroding support. One, conservative activist Mike Davis, appeared on the show of right-wing podcaster Steve Bannon, urging viewers to call their senators to reject this \u201cAI amnesty\u201d for \u201ctrillion-dollar Big Tech monopolists.\u201d",
      "He said he also texted with Trump directly, advising the president to stay neutral on the issue despite what Davis characterized as significant pressure from White House AI czar David Sacks, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and others.",
      "Conservatives passionate about getting rid of the provision had spent weeks fighting others in the party who favored the legislative moratorium because they saw it as essential for the country to compete against China in the race for AI dominance. The schism marked the latest and perhaps most noticeable split within the GOP about whether to let states continue to put guardrails on emerging technologies or minimize such interference.",
      "In the end, the advocates for guardrails won, revealing the enormous influence of a segment of the Republican Party that has come to distrust Big Tech. They believe states must remain free to protect their citizens against potential harms of the industry, whether from AI, social media or emerging technologies.",
      "\u201cTension in the conservative movement is palpable,\u201d said Adam Thierer of the R Street Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank. Thierer first proposed the idea of the AI moratorium last year. He noted \u201cthe animus surrounding Big Tech\u201d among many Republicans.",
      "\"That was the differentiating factor.\u201d",
      "The Heritage Foundation, children\u2019s safety groups and Republican state lawmakers, governors and attorneys general all weighed in against the AI moratorium. Democrats, tech watchdogs and some tech companies opposed it, too.",
      "Sensing the moment was right on Monday night, Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, who opposed the AI provision and had attempted to water it down, teamed up with Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington to suggest striking the entire proposal. By morning, the provision was removed in a 99-1 vote.",
      "The whirlwind demise of a provision that initially had the backing of House and Senate leadership and the White House disappointed other conservatives who felt it gave China, a main AI competitor, an advantage.",
      "Ryan Fournier, chairman of Students for Trump and chief marketing officer of the startup Uncensored AI, had supported the moratorium, writing on X that it \u201cstops blue states like California and New York from handing our future to Communist China.\u201d",
      "\u201cRepublicans are that way ... I get it,\u201d he said in an interview, but added there needs to be \u201cone set of rules, not 50\u201d for AI innovation to be successful.",
      "Tech companies, tech trade groups, venture capitalists and multiple Trump administration figures had voiced their support for the provision that would have blocked states from passing their own AI regulations for years. They argued that in the absence of federal standards, letting the states take the lead would leave tech innovators mired in a confusing patchwork of rules.",
      "Lutnick, the commerce secretary, posted that the provision \u201cmakes sure American companies can develop cutting-edge tech for our military, infrastructure, and critical industries \u2014 without interference from anti-innovation politicians.\u201d AI czar Sacks had also publicly supported the measure.",
      "After the Senate passed the bill without the AI provision, the White House responded to an inquiry for Sacks with the president's position, saying Trump \"is fully supportive of the Senate-passed version of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "Acknowledging defeat of his provision on the Senate floor, Cruz noted how pleased China, liberal politicians and \u201cradical left-wing groups\u201d would be to hear the news.",
      "But Blackburn pointed out that the federal government has failed to pass laws that address major concerns about AI, such as keeping children safe and securing copyright protections.",
      "\u201cBut you know who has passed it?\u201d she said. \u201cThe states.\u201d",
      "Conservatives distrusting Big Tech for what they see as social media companies stifling speech during the COVID-19 pandemic and surrounding elections said that tech companies shouldn\u2019t get a free pass, especially on something that carries as much risk as AI.",
      "Many who opposed the moratorium also brought up preserving states' rights, though proponents countered that AI issues transcend state borders and Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce.",
      "Eric Lucero, a Republican state lawmaker in Minnesota, noted that many other industries already navigate different regulations established by both state and local jurisdictions.",
      "\u201cI think everyone in the conservative movement agrees we need to beat China,\" said Daniel Cochrane from the Heritage Foundation. \u201cI just think we have different prescriptions for doing so.\u201d",
      "Many argued that in the absence of federal legislation, states were best positioned to protect citizens from the potential harms of AI technology.",
      "\u201cWe have no idea what AI will be capable of in the next 10 years and giving it free rein and tying states hands is potentially dangerous,\u201d Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote on X.",
      "Another Republican, Texas state Sen. Angela Paxton, wrote to Cruz and his counterpart, Sen. John Cornyn, urging them to remove the moratorium.",
      "She and other conservatives said some sort of federal standard could help clarify the landscape around AI and resolve some of the party's disagreements.",
      "But with the moratorium dead and Republicans holding only narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress, it\u2019s unclear whether they will be able to agree on a set of standards to guide the development of the burgeoning technology.",
      "In an email to The Associated Press, Paxton said she wants to see limited federal AI legislation \u201cthat sets some clear guardrails\u201d around national security and interstate commerce, while leaving states free to address issues that affect their residents.",
      "\"When it comes to technology as powerful and potentially dangerous as AI, we should be cautious about silencing state-level efforts to protect consumers and children,\u201d she said.",

      "The hearing is expected to address whether Vance Boelter should remain in custody without bail and affirm that there is probable cause to proceed with the case. He's not expected to enter a plea. Prosecutors need to secure a grand jury indictment first, before his arraignment, which is when a plea is normally entered.",
      "An unshaven Boelter, 57, of Green Isle, was wearing a green padded suicide prevention suit and orange slippers when he was brought into court last Friday. Federal defender Manny Atwal then asked Magistrate Judge Douglas Micko to continue the hearing. She said Boelter had been sleep deprived due to harsh conditions in the Sherburne County Jail, making it difficult for them to communicate.",

      "Sherburne County Sheriff Joel Brott, whose jail houses both county and federal prisoners, rejected Boelter's claims of poor conditions as absurd. \u201cHe is not in a hotel. He\u2019s in jail, where a person belongs when they commit the heinous crimes he is accused of committing,\" Brott said in a statement Friday.",
      "Boelter faces separate cases in federal and state court on charges of murder and attempted murder for what the state's chief federal prosecutor, Acting U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, has called \u201ca political assassination\u201d and \u201ca chilling attack on our democracy.\u201d The feds are going first.",
      "Authorities say Hortman and her husband, Mark, were shot to death in their home in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park in the early hours of June 14 by a man disguised as a police officer who was driving a fake squad car.",
      "Boelter also allegedly shot and seriously wounded state Sen. John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette, earlier that morning at their home in nearby Champlin. The Hoffmans are recovering, but Hortman's golden retriever, Gilbert, was seriously injured and had to be euthanized.",
      "Boelter surrendered near his home the night of June 15 after what authorities called the largest search in Minnesota history, a hunt of around 40 hours.",
      "Atwal told the court last week that Boelter had been kept in what\u2019s known as a \u201cGumby suit,\u201d without undergarments, ever since his first court appearance June 16. She said the lights were on in his area 24 hours a day, doors slammed frequently, the inmate in the next cell would spread feces on the walls, and the smell would drift to Boelter\u2019s cell.",
      "The attorney said transferring him to segregation instead, and giving him a normal jail uniform, would let him get some sleep, restore some dignity, and let him communicate better. The judge granted the delay.",
      "Boelter\u2019s lawyers have declined to comment on the charges themselves, which could carry the federal death penalty. Thompson has said no decision has been made whether to seek it. Minnesota abolished its death penalty in 1911. But Attorney General Pam Bondi has said from the start that the Trump administration will be more aggressive in seeking capital punishment.",
      "Prosecutors allege Boelter also stopped at the homes of two other Democratic lawmakers. They also say he listed dozens of other Democrats as potential targets, including officials in other states. Friends described Boelter as an evangelical Christian with politically conservative views. But prosecutors have declined so far to speculate on a motive.",
      "Former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris joined the mourners at the Hortmans' funeral last Saturday. Gov. Tim Walz, Harris's running mate on the 2024 Democratic presidential ticket, eulogized Hortman as \u201cthe most consequential speaker in Minnesota history.\u201d",
      "Hortman served as speaker from 2019 until January. She then yielded the post to a Republican in a power-sharing deal after the House became tied in the 2024 elections, and became speaker emerita.",

      "In the state that served as the model for Obamacare, advocates and health care workers fear the Trump administration is trying to dismantle the program piece-by-piece",
      "BOSTON -- In the state that served as the model for Obamacare, advocates and health care workers fear the Trump administration is trying to dismantle piece-by-piece a popular program that has provided insurance, preventive care and life-saving medication to hundreds of thousands of people.",
      "Provisions contained in both the Senate and House versions of the massive tax and spending cuts bill advancing in Congress \u2014 a centerpiece of President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda \u2014 could strip health insurance from up to a quarter of the roughly 400,000 people enrolled in the Massachusetts Health Connector, according to state estimates.",
      "The changes would create anew the coverage gaps state leaders were working to close when Massachusetts in 2006 became the first U.S. state to enact a law requiring nearly every resident to have health insurance, state officials say. Beyond the effect on residents' health, losing care could have broader repercussions \u2014 both for the program's finances and residents' ability to make a living.",
      "\u201cThe idea of needing to unwind that now and pull back on that promise and commitment is really frustrating and heartbreaking and cruel and counterproductive,\u201d said Audrey Morse Gasteier, executive director of Massachusetts\u2019 health insurance marketplace.",
      "Trump and Republican supporters in Congress say the changes, which include new documentation requirements and limitations on who can apply for tax credits to help pay for insurance, are necessary to root out what they call fraud, waste and abuse. The Affordable Care Act changes proposed in both versions of the bill, along with massive cuts to Medicaid and other programs, would eliminate roughly $1.1 trillion in health care spending over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "In Lawrence, a mill community of around 90,000 people on the Merrimack River, where more than 80% of the population is Hispanic or Latino, Kesia Moreta said she's already seeing people slip out of the state's health care network because of the Trump administration's aggressive effort to crack down on illegal immigration.",
      "Moreta, who manages a program created under the ACA that helps people sign up for coverage, said clients have been missing meetings out of fear that being enrolled for health insurance will harm their effort to stay in the U.S. legally.",
      "Recently, a father of a U.S.-born teenage son with epilepsy deleted every email related to his health plan and stopped answering calls from the Connector after watching reports about deportations on social media. When his son\u2019s medication ran out, Moreta said the father finally reached out, whispering over the phone, \u201cIs this going to get me deported?\u201d",
      "\u201cThat breaks our hearts,\u201d Moreta said.",
      "More than 98% of Massachusetts residents have health insurance, the lowest rate of uninsurance in the country, according to the Massachusetts Health Insurance Survey.",
      "Vicky Pulos, an attorney for the Mass Law Reform Institute who helps low-income people gain access to health care, said Republicans who tried and failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act during the first Trump administration have decided to take it apart incrementally despite its growing popularity.",
      "\u201cIt really seems like this is just a less transparent way of effectively dismantling the accomplishments of the Affordable Care Act in both Medicaid and the marketplace,\u201d Pulos said.",
      "The changes, she added, \u201cwill massively drive up the number of uninsured but without openly repealing the ACA.\u201d",
      "Another provision included in both the House and Senate bills would require people applying for or renewing coverage to provide more documentation of their income, household size and immigration status to be eligible for premium tax credits when the state marketplace already has that information, which Morse Gasteier said would cause \u201cfriction, red tape and delays.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has said the proposals will \u201cput a stop\u201d to immigrants \u201cstealing taxpayer-funded health care benefits meant for American citizens.\u201d",
      "No states use federal money to provide health insurance to people who are in the U.S. illegally. Some, like Massachusetts, use state tax dollars to do so to provide basic primary care services for a small population of vulnerable residents, like children.",
      "No undocumented immigrants receive insurance through the state marketplace.",
      "Of the 400,000 enrolled in the state marketplace, around 60,000 are noncitizens who are in the U.S. legally and would lose access to federal premium tax credits if either chamber's version of the bill becomes law. The number includes domestic violence and human trafficking victims, refugees, people granted asylum or humanitarian parole, temporary protected status and other work-authorized immigrants.",
      "Without the credits, premiums will cost upwards of $500 or $600 \u2014 an increase many people can't afford, Morse Gasteier said. Around half are green-card holders with an annual income of $15,000 a year or less.",
      "The remaining 40,000 people expected to lose coverage are U.S. citizens Morse Gasteier said could be stymied in applying or recertifying coverage by provisions like the increased documentation requirements.",
      "Morse Gasteier said Massachusetts' marketplace worked \u201ctirelessly\u201d to enroll vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations after the state program \u2014 formed under the leadership of then-Gov. Mitt Romney and known as \u201cRomneycare\" \u2014 was created.",
      "She worries that if people hear help is no longer available, \u201centire populations will just sort of give up on health insurance.\u201d",
      "In addition to affecting residents' health, that could have an economic impact in the state.",
      "Immigrants with legal status enrolled in the state marketplace tend to be younger than the rest of the population, Morse Gasteier said. Their presence brings premiums down for others because they tend to be healthier.",
      "In Lawrence, advocates who help people obtain insurance coverage though the ACA marketplace say the burden would fall disproportionately on people with chronic health issues like diabetes and chronic heart disease.",
      "The Greater Lawrence Community Action Council assists around 10,000 people a year with either signing up for or renewing health insurance.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re not healthy, let me tell you, you can\u2019t work. If you can\u2019t work, you can\u2019t pay your bills. It\u2019s just as simple as that,\u201d said GLCAC CEO Vilma Martinez-Dominguez.",
      "Moreta said one man who called her from the emergency room recently said he discovered his health insurance had lapsed. Moreta said she could help him renew it, and urged him to wait at the hospital.",
      "He told her not to do anything. He was leaving the hospital. She has no idea what became of him.",

      "A top official at the Food and Drug Administration recently overruled government scientists on the availability of two COVID-19 vaccines",
      "WASHINGTON -- The government\u2019s top vaccine official working under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently restricted the approval of two COVID-19 vaccines, disregarding recommendations from government scientists, according to federal documents released Wednesday.",
      "The new memos from the Food and Drug Administration show how the agency\u2019s vaccine chief, Dr. Vinay Prasad, personally intervened to place restrictions on COVID shots from vaccine makers Novavax and Moderna.",
      "Both vaccines were approved by the FDA in May after months of analysis by rank-and-file FDA reviewers.",
      "But internal correspondence show Prasad disagreed with staffers who planned to approve the shots for everyone 12 and older, similar to previous COVID vaccines. The scientists had concluded the benefit from the vaccines and the risk of COVID-19 outweighed the risk of possible side effects, which are rare.",
      "Instead Prasad decided the shots should be limited to those who face special risks from the virus\u2014 seniors or children and adults with underlying medical issues.",
      "Prasad explained that the COVID vaccine benefits must be reconsidered in light of falling rates of death and hospitalization and the possibility for vaccine side effects. It\u2019s the latest in a series of vaccine restrictions imposed by officials working under Kennedy, who has long questioned the benefits of vaccines.",
      "\u201cEven rare vaccination related harms both known and unknown now have higher chance of outweighing potential benefits\u201d Prasad wrote in a five-page memo explaining his decision.",
      "COVID-19 remains a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths and more than 250,000 hospitalizations since last fall, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most at risk for hospitalization are seniors and children under 2 \u2014 especially infants under 6 months.",
      "Top FDA leaders are typically not involved in the review of individual products. Officials like Prasad can overrule staffers, but such cases are rare and often controversial.",

      "Prasad was hired to lead the FDA\u2019s vaccine center in May, after the previous director, Dr. Peter Marks, was forced to resign over disagreements with Kennedy. An academic researcher specializing in cancer therapies, Prasad came to prominence during the pandemic for criticizing public health measures, including the FDA\u2019s approval of COVID boosters for healthy adults and children.",
      "Since arriving at the agency he has worked with FDA Commissioner Mark Makary on new guidelines that will limit approvals of future COVID boosters to higher-risk Americans, mainly seniors and those with medical conditions like asthma and obesity.",
      "Those limits match the terms FDA recently approved for Novavax\u2019s shot, Nuvaxovid and Moderna\u2019s mNexspike.

      "A veteran who died in Chicago without any recollection of their life has been memorialized in a funeral service with military honors",
      "CHICAGO -- Standing near the gravestone for the relative he never met, Mark Bailey accepted the crisply folded American flag from the Army officer, hugged it to his chest and closed his eyes.",
      "Though the person he called his aunt \u2014 born Reba Caroline Bailey \u2014 had been estranged, missing for decades and died in 2015 as an unidentified ward of the state, he felt connection and a sense of closure.",
      "\u201cI want to let Reba know we\u2019re part of the circle and part of the family,\u201d he said.",
      "Mark Bailey was among dozens of attendees at an unusual funeral service with military honors this week for an Illinois veteran with memory problems so severe that they died an unnamed person. The ceremony became possible because of an extraordinary cold case investigation that identified the 75-year-old postmortem.",
      "Investigators unearthed the mystery of how the Women\u2019s Army Corps veteran ended up homeless in Chicago with few recollections of their own life, aside from identifying as a man named Seven.",
      "\u201cI never knew I had this family member,\u201d said Mark Bailey\u2019s 19-year-old son Cole, who also drove from central Illinois for the service. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know I have somebody that\u2019s been found and isn\u2019t lost anymore.\u201d",
      "Since the investigation\u2019s conclusion, the numbered cement cylinder that marked the unidentified grave has been replaced with a rectangular plague with a cross that reads: \u201cReba Caroline Bailey, PFC US Army.\u201d",
      "The case of Seven Doe, the name appearing in some official records, came to Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart\u2019s office in 2023. The unidentified body belonged to a person who died of natural causes in an assisted living facility. They were a ward of the state, unable to remember a legal name or family.",
      "The cause of death was heart disease with diabetes and dementia as contributing factors and the body was buried in a section for unclaimed people at Mount Olivet Catholic Cemetery on Chicago's Far South Side. The medical examiner marked it as the 4,985th case of the year and put the number on the headstone.",
      "In 2023, investigators ran fingerprints taken postmortem and found a 1961 Army record for the veteran, formerly of Danville, about 140 miles (225.31 kilometers) south of Chicago. The search for close living relatives came up short; five siblings and an ex-husband had all died.",
      "The family members they did locate had only heard stories of a relative who had disappeared. After making the identification, detectives ordered a new headstone with the same name on military records. It was quietly installed last year.",
      "Commander Jason Moran, who oversees the sheriff\u2019s missing persons unit, said it was rewarding to make sure the identified veteran got the benefit of a funeral with military honors.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a privilege to be able to help families and really close the story,\u201d said Moran, whose work on other high-profile cold cases has gained notoriety.",
      "Several generations of the Bailey family have told stories about what happened to their missing relative since leaving the military to get married.",
      "They've wondered about the possibility of children or their relative's gender identity. Some believe that there was a family dispute but the stories about its origins vary from the decision to join the military to sexual orientation.",
      "Family members tried to find their missing relative over the years, including Amanda Ingram, who would have been a great-niece. She maintains a meticulous family tree with Census records and photos.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how somebody can just disappear like that and not know what happened,\u201d Ingram said this week. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re never going to know the details.\u201d",
      "On a winter day in the late 1970s, a person wearing a military-style jacket and aviator cap was curled up on the porch of St. Francis Catholic Worker House in Chicago. Residents who stayed there at the time told the Associated Press that the person asked to be called Seven, spoke in the third person and identified as a man.",
      "Seven quickly became the house cook. The meals drew crowds to the neighborhood where several homeless advocacy groups operated, according to former residents' accounts.",
      "Investigators have tried to explain the memory loss and floated theories about brain damage related to a 1950 car accident that killed Bailey's mother or to military service. That included stints at Fort Ord in California, a polluted former Army base, and Fort McClellan in Alabama, formerly used for chemical weapons training, and where the federal government has acknowledged potential exposure to toxins.",
      "Neither family, investigators nor residents of the worker house figured out the meaning behind the name Seven.",
      "Ingram, who lives in Alabama, couldn\u2019t make the ceremony this week. But she asked volunteers from an Illinois chapter of Daughters of the American Revolution to attend on her behalf.",
      "\u201cEverybody who comes to visit that cemetery will pass by it and know who she was,\u201d said Ingram, whose detailed family trees include records using Bailey's birth name.",
      "Mark Bailey said he and his son wanted to bring something to the service that would honor both parts of their long-lost relative's life.",
      "They had heard their relative had an affinity for the Cubs and looked for a jersey with the number \u201c7\u201d on it, but settled on a blue team cap. They set it on the headstone.",
      "The service held Tuesday included prayers, a 21-gun salute and a bugler playing taps \u2014 a chilling, 24-note salute that is traditionally played at funerals of U.S. military veterans. Attendees included Cook County sheriff's investigators and Archdiocese of Chicago staff.",
      "\u201cI just wish the rest of them could be identified as well,\u201d Mark Bailey told those attending while pointing to the rows of unidentified graves.",
      "Dart, the Cook County sheriff, said the ceremony left him nearly speechless, saying the Illinois veteran deserved military honors and a flag from the U.S. president \u201cinstead of being forgotten and left as an anonymous number somewhere.\u201d",
      "Relatives said they planned to eventually display the flag at the American Legion in Potomac, near where the Bailey family has roots.",
      "Mark Bailey said the acknowledgement of military service was particularly meaningful with so many veterans in the extended family. He hoped the memory would stay with his son Cole, who plans to enlist.",
      "\u201cFor him, it\u2019ll be something he\u2019ll have forever,\u201d he said.",

    "summary": "The feuding Gallagher brothers kicked off a reunion tour in Cardiff, Wales, their first performance since their acrimonious split in 2009.",
    "story": [
      "Oasis ended a 16-year hiatus on Friday with a punchy, powerful trip through one of Britpop's greatest songbooks, kicking off a reunion tour in Cardiff, Wales to a crowd ecstatic for the band's 1990s hits.",
      "And was there brotherly love between the famously feuding Gallagher siblings? Definitely maybe.",
      "Fans traveled to the Welsh capital from around the world for a show that many thought would never happen. Guitarist-songwriter Noel Gallagher and his singer brother Liam, the heart of Oasis, had not performed together since their acrimonious split in 2009.",
      "One fan banner summed it up: \"The great wait is over.\"",
      "After a montage of headlines about the sparring siblings was capped with the words \"the guns have fallen silent,\" Oasis appeared on stage to a deafening roar, opening with the apt \"Hello\" and its refrain of \"it's good to be back.\"",
      "The brothers had a brief hand-in-hand moment but largely kept their distance onstage. Noel, 58, focused on his guitar while a parka-clad Liam, 52, snarled into the microphone with a swagger that has not dimmed in the 31 years since the band released its first album, \"Definitely Maybe.\"",
      "A crowd of more than 60,000 in the Principality Stadium was treated to a well-paced two-hour set that drew heavily on the first album and its 1995 followup, \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory,\" alongside a smattering of later tracks and fan-favorite B-sides.",
      "Song like \"Supersonic,\" \"Roll With It\" and \"Rock 'n' Roll Star\" sounded as thunderous as ever and sparked mass sing-alongs.",
      "\"Put your arms over each other like you love each other,\" a tambourine-clutching Liam exhorted the crowd before launching into \"Cigarettes and Alcohol.\"",
      "There was poignancy on \"Live Forever\" when an image of Liverpool Football Club player Diogo Jota, who was killed in a car crash on Thursday, was projected above the band.",
      "Noel took his turn on lead vocals for several songs, including the touching \"Half the World Away,\" and the show ended with encores featuring some of Oasis' most enduring tracks: \"Don't Look Back in Anger,\" \"Wonderwall\" and \"Champagne Supernova.\" The brothers shared a half-hug as they ended the final song.",
      "Multicolored, sometimes faintly psychedelic projections formed the main technological accoutrement to a show where the focus was squarely on the songs. There was little banter, though Liam paused between songs to check the audience was having a good time.",
      "\"Was it worth the 40,000 pounds you paid for the ticket?\" he quipped at one point, referring to the scramble for seats that saw some fans pay hundreds to see a show.",
      "From the roar of response, it was.",
      "The show in Cardiff kicked off a 19-date Live '25 tour in the U.K. and Ireland. Then come stops in North America, South America, Asia and Australia, ending in Sao Paulo on Nov. 23.",
      "Before the show, the streets around the stadium filled with fans who gathered in groups to sing along to the band's hits and snapped up Oasis-branded bucket hats at 35 pounds ($48) each.",
      "\"It's very, very special \u2014 emotional,\" said 44-year old Rob Maule from Edinburgh, Scotland. \"I'm here with three of my friends, childhood friends, and we used to see Oasis across the country.",
      "\"For us, it's a generational thing. It's a chapter of our lives,\" he said. \"And then the second generation, as people are taking their kids. It's really special.\"",
      "Vicki Moynehan came from Dorchester, in southwest England. She said her life has changed since she bought her ticket almost a year ago.",
      "\"Seven months pregnant \u2014 ain't gonna stop me,\" she said.",
      "Founded in the working-class streets of Manchester, England, in 1991, Oasis was one of the dominant British acts of the 1990s, releasing eight U.K. No. 1 albums.",
      "The band's sound was fueled by sing-along rock choruses and the combustible chemistry between guitarist-songwriter Noel Gallagher \u2014 a Beatles and glam rock-loving musician with a knack for memorable tunes \u2014 and younger brother Liam.",
      "Then and since, the brothers have often traded barbs \u2014 onstage, in the studio and in interviews. Liam once called Noel \"tofu boy,\" while Noel branded his brother \"the angriest man you'll ever meet. He's like a man with a fork in a world of soup.\"",
      "After a backstage bustup at a concert in France in 2009, they long resisted pressure to reunite, even with the promise of a multimillion-dollar payday.",
      "Now they have agreed on a tour that sees hem joined by former Oasis members Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs and Gem Archer on guitar, bassist Andy Bell and drummer Joey Waronker.",
      "The announcement of the U.K. tour in August sparked a ticket-buying frenzy, complete with error messages, hourslong online queues, dashed hopes and anger at prices that surged at the last minute.",
      "The ticketing troubles sparked questions in U.K. Parliament, where Arts Minister Chris Bryant criticized \"practices that see fans of live events blindsided by price hikes.\" Britain's competition regulator has since threatened Ticketmaster \u2014 which sold around 900,000 Oasis tickets \u2014 with legal action.",
      "No plans have been announced for Oasis to record any new music, and the tour is being presented as a one-off.",
      "Music writer John Aizlewood said that it's an opportunity for Oasis to \"tend the legacy\" of the band, and remind people of the power of the Oasis brand.",
      "\"There should be a sense of huge joy and life affirmation about these shows. And I think if they can just play it right, then that can be a massive burnishing of their legacy,\" he said. \"(There is) this enduring love for Oasis \u2014 and love means money.\"",
      "Fans were determined to enjoy the moment.",
      "\"I'm the oldest sibling of four brothers, so I know they'll fall out,\" said Stephen Truscott, from Middlesbrough in northeast England. \"(But) the first night, they're going to have an absolute unbelievable blast. It's going to be the best.\"",

However, it seems that Joey and his managers have prioritized a new partnership with a different hot dog brand over our longtime relationship.\"",
      "Chestnut ended up competing against his old rival, Takeru Kobayashi, in a hot dog eating competition that streamed on Netflix on Labor Day last year. Chestnut won that contest, which followed the same rules as the Nathan's competition.",

      "Who is expected to win the hot dog eating contest?",
      "Chestnut and Sudo are far and away the favorites to win the men's and women's contests, respectively. Chestnut comes in at an enormous -2000 favorite. Bertoletti is +1200, but comes in at +155 in the Winner Without Chestnut market, according to CBS Sports.",
      "Many sportsbooks aren't even offering odds on the women's side due to Sudo's dominance, according to CBS Sports. However, betting expert Matt Severance told CBS Sports the Under 45.5 for Sudo at -105 could be a worthwhile wager.",
      "Check out CBS Sports for a more detailed breakdown of the hot dog eating contest's odds and predictions.",

      "Chestnut holds both the official and unofficial world records for most hot dogs eaten in a competition. He downed 83 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes during his Labor Day competition against Kobayashi, but since that event wasn't sanctioned by Major League Eating, it's not considered official.",
      "The official world record is 76, also set by Chestnut during the 2021 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest.",
      "What are the rules for Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest?",
      "The rules for the hot dog eating contest are fairly simple. Competitors have 10 minutes to eat as many hot dogs and buns as possible. They can break the hot dogs up with their hands and separate them from the buns, but the entire thing, hot dog and bun, has to be swallowed for it to count.",
      "Utensils and condiments are prohibited.",
      "Water is provided, but contestants can bring other non-alcoholic beverages if they want. Contestants can dunk the buns in the water or their beverage, but only for a maximum of five seconds.",
      "If a contestant throws up, they're disqualified.",
      "Whoever downs the most hot dogs and buns in the 10-minute time period is the winner.",

He was wonderful in that production and you could see his future success from the outset. He will be missed.\"",

      "\"His work reflects the same gritty realism and emotional undercurrent that defines his acting,\" his representatives said in a statement. \"In addition to acting and writing, he is an accomplished photographer and has produced a number of independent projects.\"",

      "Red Panda \u2014 whose real name is Rong Niu \u2014 spent 11 hours in a Minneapolis hospital, with a pair of Lynx staffers there with her the entire time, agent Patrick Figley said. The Chinese American acrobat was heading home for treatment and recovery, which should take a few months.",

    "summary": "The verdict in the Sean \"Diddy\" Combs trial comes after the high-profile proceedings started in May.",
    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was found guilty Wednesday of transportation to engage in prostitution in his federal trial in New York City, but the music mogul was acquitted of the more severe charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking.",
      "Combs will remain in detention while he awaits his sentencing. Judge Arun Subramanian said later Wednesday he denied bail because he disagreed with the defense's argument that the crimes shouldn't trigger mandatory detention. Combs will get 10 months credit for time served so far, the judge said, proposing a sentencing date of Oct. 3.",
      "Combs was convicted of two counts of the prostitution-related charge. Each count carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Prosecutors said their preliminary calculations indicate Combs should get at least 51 to 63 months imprisonment on the two convictions, or a sentence of roughly four to five years.",
      "How did Sean \"Diddy\" Combs react to the verdict?",
      "As the jury foreperson announced not guilty on the racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charge involving Combs' former girlfriend, Casandra Ventura \u2014 the R&B singer known as Cassie \u2014 Combs put his hand to his face, his fingers resting on his temples.",
      "When he heard the word \"guilty\" for Count 3, the first prostitution-related charge, he was startled. But then \"not guilty\" came for the second sex trafficking count involving another former girlfriend who testified under the pseudonym \"Jane.\" Combs held hands with attorney Teny Geragos and leaned in to talk to her.",
      "Combs looked at his family and made prayer hands. He nodded as each juror affirmed the verdict, shaking his fists triumphantly under the table. He made prayer hands to the jury, hugged Geragos and smiled. He mouthed \"thank you\" to attorney Marc Agnifilo.",
      "Combs turned to his family, clasped his hands together and appeared to say: \"I'm coming home.\"",
      "He looked toward the reporters in the courtroom and again shook his fist under the table. Combs leaned forward and nodded in agreement at the jury as the judge thanked them. He then put his face in his hands and smiled. Combs made prayer hands and mouthed \"thank you\" to the jurors a number of times. Then he clasped his hands and kept thanking them. He leaned back and tilted his head up, again putting his face in his hands as though in disbelief.",
      "Combs\u00a0kneeled down on the ground, put his hands on his chair and prayed. He and his family erupted in loud applause, cheering loudly and whistling.",
      "Following the decision, Combs' lawyers argued for him to be released from custody immediately and be able to return to his Miami home, emphasizing that this was his first conviction. Prosecutors opposed the defense's request and urged Judge Arun Subramanian to keep Combs detained until his sentencing.",
      "Subramanian acknowledged that Combs didn't want to return to a federal detention center in Brooklyn where he'd been in custody since his arrest last September. Combs shook his head no.",
      "The judge asked both the prosecution and defense to submit letters as to why Combs should be released Wednesday or remain detained.",
      "Combs' attorneys proposed in their letter that a million-dollar bond be posted for him and that his travel be restricted to parts of Florida, California, New York and New Jersey. New Jersey and New York were included to accommodate Combs traveling to attend court and meet with his attorneys.",
      "Combs' attorneys also proposed surrendering his passport and undergoing drug testing when required by the court.",
      "Prosecutors proposed that Combs continued to be detained and his bail application be denied.",
      "The developments come after jurors said Tuesday they'd agreed on four of the five counts against Combs but disagreed on racketeering conspiracy. They reached a verdict on all five counts Wednesday morning.",
      "Jurors began deliberating in U.S. District Court in lower Manhattan on Monday. They said they'd reached a partial verdict Tuesday, but Subramanian sent them back to continue deliberating on the remaining count.",
      "What were the charges against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs?",
      "The grand jury indictment against the 55-year-old Combs, unsealed in September 2024, initially charged the hip-hop mogul with three counts following his arrest at a Manhattan hotel. In April, before the trial began, prosecutors filed additional charges, bringing the total number of counts against him to five.",
      "Combs pleaded not guilty to all the charges.",
      "The charges against Combs and each verdict were:",
      "Count 1: Racketeering conspiracy - NOT GUILTYCount 2: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (Casandra Ventura) - NOT GUILTYCount 3: Transportation to engage in prostitution (Casandra Ventura) - GUILTYCount 4: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (\"Jane\") - NOT GUILTYCount 5: Transportation to engage in prostitution (\"Jane\") - GUILTY",
      "Count 1: Racketeering conspiracy - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 2: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (Casandra Ventura) - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 3: Transportation to engage in prostitution (Casandra Ventura) - GUILTY",
      "Count 4: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (\"Jane\") - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 5: Transportation to engage in prostitution (\"Jane\") - GUILTY",
      "What is the Mann Act?",
      "The prostitution-related charges allege violations of the Mann Act, a law that makes it a federal crime to transport someone across state lines for prostitution.",
      "Before jurors began their deliberations, Subramanian gave them instructions on how to apply the law to the facts presented during the trial. Jurors were told that, in order to find Combs guilty of the prostitution-related charges, prosecutors must have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly transported an individual in \"interstate or foreign commerce\" and intended that the individual \"engage in an act of prostitution.\"",
      "Subramanian noted that it wasn't necessary for prosecutors to prove that engaging in prostitution was Combs' sole purpose in transporting a person across a state line or foreign border. However, prosecutors needed to prove that a \"significant or motivating purpose\" of the trip was prostitution.",
      "The charge of racketeering conspiracy requires prosecutors to prove a number of elements: that there was an agreement among two or more people to participate in a pattern of activity that would affect interstate commerce; that the defendant willfully joined it; and that members of the conspiracy committed two or more racketeering acts. The charging document lists a number of alleged racketeering acts, including kidnapping, bribery, sex trafficking and forced labor.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Combs' business empire created a criminal enterprise that he used for years to cover up acts of violence and abuse and to coerce women into fulfilling his sexual desires. Jurors heard from more than 30 witnesses over the course of seven weeks as the prosecution went through its case.",
      "Combs denied the accusations but chose not to take the stand to testify in his defense. His attorneys did not call any witnesses during the trial, though they did conduct extensive cross-examinations of the government's witnesses. Combs' lawyers argued the prosecution failed to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.",
      "\"Freak-offs\" part of emotional and graphic testimony",
      "The high-profile trial, which started in May, included graphic and emotional testimony from two of Combs' former girlfriends.",
      "Ventura, who spent more than a decade with him, testified about drug-fueled sex sessions that Combs allegedly referred to as \"freak-offs.\" Ventura testified that he directed all the encounters, which could last for days, and that she felt forced to participate to make him happy.",
      "Ventura testified that Combs controlled every aspect of her life, and that she often did things out of fear, since physical abuse was \"frequent.\"",
      "Combs' attorneys argued that the encounters were consensual. During cross-examination, the defense showed the jury a 2009 message from Ventura to Combs that read, \"I'm always ready to freak off.\"",
      "Ventura also testified about a 2016 incident which was caught on surveillance video showing Combs beating and kicking her in a California hotel hallway. Combs apologized at the time, saying his behavior was \"inexcusable\" and that he took \"full responsibility\" for his actions.",
      "Ventura testified that the attack happened as she was trying to leave a \"freak-off\" that had turned violent. A former hotel security officer testified that Combs offered him cash after the attack, which the officer said he understood to be a bribe.",
      "Ventura had filed a civil lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of physically and sexually abusing her. Combs denied the claims and quickly reached a settlement with her. In his closing argument to the jury Friday, Agnifilo said, \"If you had to pick a winner in this whole thing, it's hard not to pick Cassie.\"",
      "Another former girlfriend of Combs testified under the pseudonym \"Jane\" to protect her identity. She told the court she often participated in what she called \"hotel nights,\" which also involved drugs. Jane testified she would have sex with a male escort while Combs watched. She said she told Combs many times that she didn't want to have sex with other men and didn't like the \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Combs' lawyers displayed messages showing her setting up \"hotel nights.\" Jane said she felt pressured and that she had grown financially dependent on Combs.",
      "In the prosecution's closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik described Combs as \"the leader of a criminal enterprise. He doesn't take no for an answer. And now you know about many crimes he committed with members of his enterprise.\"",
      "She said he used a \"small army\" of employees to harm women and then cover it up. \"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law,\" Slavik said.",
      "Agnifilo countered by arguing that prosecutors \"badly exaggerated\" evidence of a swinger lifestyle and threesomes, combining it with recreational drug use and calling it a racketeering conspiracy.",
      "\"He did not do the things he's charged with. He didn't do racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking,\" Combs' lawyer said.",

      "After leaving court, Combs' attorney declined to comment on the bail denial, saying \"a lot of these things are still in process.\"",
      "\"We are not nearly done fighting,\" defense attorney Marc Agnifilo told reporters outside U.S. District Court in lower Manhattan. \"Today was a major, major step in the right direction, but we fight on and we're gonna win, and we're not gonna stop until he walks out of prison a free man to his family.\"",
      "Prosecutors previously said their preliminary calculations indicate Combs should get at least 51 to 63 months imprisonment on the two convictions, or a sentence of roughly four to five years. They told the judge Wednesday that Combs is wealthy and capable of fleeing.",
      "Combs has also shown no remorse or regret in abusing his ex-girlfriend \"Jane,\" the prosecution said, adding that the defense's suggestion that Combs slapping Jane while she was in the shower was in self-defense is \"insulting.\"",
      "Combs was found guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution involving Jane. He was also accused of sex trafficking Jane by force, fraud or coercion, a charge the jury found him not guilty of.",
      "Jane had told the court she often participated in what she called \"hotel nights,\" which also involved drugs. She testified she would have sex with a male escort while Combs watched. She said she told Combs many times that she didn't want to have sex with other men and didn't like the \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Prosecutors said Combs had drugs and supplies for another act of prostitution in the New York hotel where he stayed \u2014 and also invited Jane to come \u2014 before he was arrested.",
      "Following the seven-week jury trial, Combs' attorneys moved to have him released from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn where he has been held during the trial. They argued that the 55-year-old had been acquitted of the most serious charges and that \"continued detention of Mr. Combs is inappropriate.\"",
      "\"He is a man who's in the process of working on himself. He's been a model prisoner,\" Combs' lawyer told the judge. \"I just think we should trust him\" that he's not going to flee, the defense said.",
      "The defense said Combs should be able to return to his Miami home, emphasizing that this was his first conviction. In a filing submitted to the judge on Wednesday, Combs' legal team said he came to New York to surrender because he was \"committed to showing his innocence\" and that Combs should be released pending sentencing.",
      "The attorneys cited conditions under the Bail Reform Act that states \"a defendant who has been found guilty of an offense is entitled to release pending sentencing if the Court finds by 'clear and convincing evidence' that he 'is not likely to flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community if released.'\"",
      "Federal prosecutors, however, argued that the Bail Reform Act dictates that Combs should remain in custody.",
      "In their filing to the judge, prosecutors said the crimes Combs was convicted of \"constitute crimes of violence and mandate detention following the defendant's conviction.\"",
      "\"As detention is mandatory following a conviction of a Mann Act offense, the Government has been unable to locate a case in which a defendant was released from custody following such a conviction,\" prosecutors said.",

      "Last year, CNN aired surveillance video from 2016 showing what appears to be Combs assaulting Ventura at a California hotel. Combs apologized at the time, and said his behavior was \"inexcusable\" and he takes \"full responsibility\" for his actions. Ventura testified during the trial that the attack happened as she was trying to leave a \"freak-off\" that turned violent. A former hotel security officer testified that Combs offered him cash after the attack, which the officer said he understood to be a bribe.",
      "Ventura had filed a civil lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of physically and sexually abusing her. Combs denied the claims and quickly settled with her. In his closing argument to the jury Friday, defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said, \"If you had to pick a winner in this whole thing, it's hard not to pick Cassie.\"",
      "Singer Dawn Richard, who was part of two bands tied to Combs, testified that she often saw Combs being violent toward Ventura. She said that after one incident in 2009, Combs allegedly threatened her and a bandmate, saying they could go missing if they didn't stay quiet.",
      "The defense focused on inconsistencies in Richard's testimony, and she said it takes time to remember things she tried to forget. Separately, Richard has made allegations against Combs in a civil lawsuit, accusing him of physical and psychological abuse, which he has denied.",
      "Another former girlfriend of Combs testified under the pseudonym Jane in court. During their relationship between 2021 and 2024, she told the court she often participated in what she called \"hotel nights,\" which also involved drugs. Jane testified she would have sex with a male escort while Combs watched.",
      "She said she told Combs she didn't like the \"hotel nights.\" Combs' lawyers displayed messages showing her setting them up. Jane said she felt pressured to meet her partner's expectations and that she had grown financially dependent on Combs.",
      "Jane said she got into a fight with Combs last year over another woman. She said she slammed his head on a marble table and he allegedly grabbed her by the neck, punched and kicked her.",

    "summary": "With no verdict reached in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal sex trafficking trial on the first day of deliberations\u200b, jurors gathered again Tuesday to continue their work.",
    "story": [
      "The jury in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal sex trafficking and racketeering trial wanted to review some of the testimony from the hip-hop mogul's former longtime girlfriend Cassie Ventura during the second day of deliberations Tuesday.",
      "The panel of eight men and four women continued deliberating the charges against Combs after not reaching a verdict on the first day of deliberations.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian began the day by addressing with the prosecution and defense a question posed Monday from the jury about one of the alleged racketeering acts \u2014 possession with intent to distribute drugs \u2014 which relates to the racketeering conspiracy charge Combs is facing. The jury sent a note asking for clarification on the part of the instructions addressing drug distribution.",
      "Subramanian said he would remind jurors of the instructions he gave them on that part of the case before they started deliberating on Monday. Combs' lawyers had pushed for a more expansive response, but prosecutors argued \u2014 and Subramanian agreed \u2014 that doing so could end up confusing jurors more.",
      "An exchange between Subramanian and Combs' defense team got a little testy as they wrangled over the response.",
      "\"Can you do what I'm asking or no?\" the judge asked.",
      "\"Of course I can do what your honor is asking,\" one of the defense lawyers responded.",
      "About 75 minutes into Tuesday's deliberations, the jury requested the testimony from Ventura, one of the prosecution's most important witnesses, when she gave her account of Combs allegedly beating, kicking and dragging her at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016 \u2014 an assault captured on now-infamous security camera footage. Combs apologized after the video surfaced.",
      "The jury also asked to see Ventura's testimony about an incident in which she said Combs accused her of taking drugs from him and kicked her off of their yacht at the Cannes Film Festival in France in 2013. On their way back to the U.S., she said, he threatened to release explicit videos of her having sex.",
      "In addition, the jury asked for Ventura and stripper Daniel Phillip's testimony about her jumping into his lap at a New York City hotel after, as Phillip testified, he suspected Combs had been slapping and slamming her around an adjacent room.",
      "\"Her whole entire body was shaking, like she was terrified,\" said Phillip, who was at the hotel for a sexual encounter with Ventura sometime between 2012 and 2014.",
      "Phillip testified that he asked Ventura why she was with Combs if he was hitting her and beating her. He said he told her she was in real danger. Ventura, he said, \"basically tried to convince me that it was OK, it's OK. I'm fine, I'll be OK.\"",
      "Combs, 55, has\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to\u00a0federal charges\u00a0of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking, and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for allegedly arranging to fly sex workers across state lines.",
      "The first day of deliberations saw several notes from the jury, as well as Combs and his supporters bowing their heads in prayer in the courtroom. One of the notes came not long after jurors started deliberating and raised concerns from several jurors about another member of the panel. They told the judge they thought \"he cannot follow your honor's instructions.\"",
      "After a discussion between the judge, attorneys for Combs and prosecutors, the judge reminded the jurors of their obligation to follow the law and sent them back to resume their deliberations, but said if more issues should arise, the foreperson should send another note.",
      "To help them come to a verdict, jurors were provided with a laptop loaded with all of the exhibits shown in court, including text messages, photographs and videos of the sexual encounters at the heart of the case.",
      "Five alternate jurors\u00a0are also on standby in case they're needed to fill in on the main jury.",
      "The jury will sift through seven weeks of at times\u00a0graphic and emotional testimony about the rap, fashion and reality TV impresario's propensity for violence and his sexual predilections, including drug-fueled sex marathons dubbed \"freak-offs\" or \"hotel nights.\" Defense lawyers argued that there was no conspiracy and that his conduct did not violate federal laws.",

    "story": [
      "The jury in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' sex trafficking case in New York shared concerns about an individual juror with the judge not long after they started deliberating Monday. The first day of deliberations ultimately ended without a verdict.",
      "After more than two hours of legal instructions from federal Judge Arun Subramanian, the jury of eight men and four women headed behind closed doors to deliberate at around 11:30 a.m. Subramanian told the five alternate jurors to remain on standby in case they're needed to fill in on the main jury who are weighing charges that could put the hip-hop mogul in prison for life.",
      "About 10 minutes into deliberations, the jury sent a note indicating they'd completed their first order of business: electing a foreperson.",
      "Less than two hours later, at about 1:25 p.m., a note from the jury was read in court  to inform the judge of concerns regarding one juror's ability to follow the instructions. The jury asked the judge to question this juror. The judge discussed the response with the prosecution and defense and decided to remind the jury of their obligation to follow the law and resume their deliberations.",
      "After the judge originally proposed asking the jury foreperson the nature of concerns about the fellow juror, defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo suggested caution and that less be said rather than more.",
      "\"We can always ratchet it up. We can't ratchet it down,\" Agnifilo said.",
      "In the late afternoon, the jury sent the judge a new note with a question about one of the alleged racketeering acts \u2014 possession with intent to distribute drugs \u2014 stemming from the racketeering conspiracy charge Combs is facing. The judge told the court he'd answer them on Tuesday and dismissed the jury for the day.",
      "Jurors are being provided with a laptop loaded with all of the exhibits shown in court, including text messages, photographs and videos of the sexual encounters at the heart of the case.",
      "Subramanian had stressed to the jury the importance of delivering a unanimous verdict, but also said no juror should surrender their beliefs in order to reach unanimity.",
      "Ahead of the deliberations, CBS News legal contributor Caroline Polisi, a criminal defense attorney, discussed on \"CBS Mornings\" what judges typically tell juries.",
      "\"The judge will instruct the jurors, 'maintain your own integrity with respect to what you believe, but keep an open mind, engage in discussions with other jurors, look at the evidence, see other people's point of view, and if you can with integrity really come over to, you know, the other side, then you can get to unanimity,'\" Polisi said.",
      "As the deliberations got underway, Combs faced his family and supporters in the courtroom gallery. They bowed their heads in prayer \u2014 his family members holding hands with each other. When they finished, they all applauded.",
      "The judge granted Combs' request to have some books with him during the deliberations. On his way out of the courtroom on Monday, Combs showed two books to reporters: \"The Power of Positive Thinking\" and \"The Happiness Advantage.\"",
      "The jury will sift through seven weeks of sometimes graphic and emotional testimony about the rap, fashion and reality TV impresario's propensity for violence and his sexual predilections, including drug-fueled sex marathons dubbed \"freak-offs\" or \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking \u2014 relating to two of his ex-girlfriends \u2014 and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for allegedly arranging to fly sex workers across state lines.",
      "Polisi said the prosecution's best chance at getting a conviction could be with the sex trafficking charges.",
      "\"The prosecution made clear there only has to be one instance, out of these hundreds of 'freak-offs,' one instance where it was coerced by force, fraud or coercion, and that can include threats of harm that doesn't even include physical harm,\" Polisi said. \"So that can include fear of financial harm, fear of reputational harm. Remember, he videotaped all of these encounters, and the government laid out specific instances where he threatened to release those tapes.\"",
      "In closing arguments last week, federal prosecutors and Combs' defense team took their last shots at convincing jurors to convict or acquit the Grammy Award-winning founder of Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"The defendant used power, violence and fear to get what he wanted,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said. \"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law.\"",
      "She said that he used his \"close inner circle and a small army of personal staff, who made it their mission to meet the defendant's every desire, promote his power and protect his reputation at all costs.\"",
      "Agnifilo countered, \"This isn't about crime. It's about money.\" He noted that one of Combs' accusers in the criminal case also sued him in civil court.",
      "\"He is not a racketeer. He is not a conspirator to commit racketeering. He is none of these things. He is innocent. He sits there innocent. Return him to his family, who have been waiting for him,\" the lawyer told jurors.",
      "In all, 34 witnesses testified, headlined by Combs' former girlfriends Cassie \u2014 the R&B singer born Casandra Ventura \u2014 and \"Jane,\" who testified under a pseudonym. Both women said he often was violent toward them. Cassie said he forced her into hundreds of sexual encounters with paid male sex workers while Jane recounted numerous \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Jurors also saw now-infamous security camera video of Combs beating, kicking and dragging Cassie at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016 and clips from videos of sexual encounters.",
      "Combs chose not to testify, and his lawyers didn't call any witnesses in their defense case. His attorneys elected instead to challenge the accusers' credibility during lengthy cross-examination questioning.",
      "The defense has acknowledged that Combs veered into violence, but his lawyers maintain that the sex acts were consensual. They contend that prosecutors are intruding in Combs' personal life and that he's done nothing to warrant the charges against him.",

The [BBC broadcasting] team were dealing with a live situation but with hindsight we should have pulled the stream during the performance. We regret this did not happen.\"",
      "The BBC, which is CBS News' partner network in the U.K., quickly acknowledged that the language used on Saturday was \"deeply offensive,\" but the network was criticized \u2014 including by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and members of his cabinet \u2014\u2014 for not reacting more quickly after the chant started.",
      "Glastonbury festival's organizers also condemned the chant in a statement, saying: \"Their chants very much crossed a line and we are urgently reminding everyone involved in the production of the festival that there is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.\"",

      "The band's website shows more than a dozen scheduled tour dates in the U.S., from coast to coast, starting in late October.",

    "summary": "The fighter for Truth, Justice and the American Way is back on the big screen. Director James Gunn talks about his re-imagining of the Man of Steel, and actor David Corenswet discusses the challenges of taking on the iconic role.",
    "story": [
      "He was born on the planet Krypton. But the Man of Steel comes to life in California, inside an edit room in Burbank. It's there that James Gunn is reviewing a scene from what Warner Brothers hopes is a summer blockbuster: \"Superman.\" With a reported budget of at least $225 million, it arrives in theaters July 11.",
      "It's the first feature from DC Studios, a division of Warner Brothers.\u00a0 Gunn is not only the film's director; he wrote the screenplay, and he's DC's CEO.",
      "\"I feel good about the movie,\" he said. \"And I'm excited about that. And I think we've done something that's different.\"",
      "Among those differences: \"My Superman is not indestructible,\" Gunn said. \"We see him bleed, immediately. At times, I've thought, 'He's too strong.' You don't want him to be able to punch a planet in half or, for that matter, go around a planet a billion times and make time go backwards, you know? I wanted a Superman who was a little bit more down-to-Earth.\"",
      "And few things are more down-to-Earth than a dog. \"The dog is the whole reason \u2013 [it] was the start of the movie for me, a thousand percent,\" Gunn said. \"I adopted a dog. His name is Ozu. And he didn't want to be touched, he had never known human beings. He chewed up all our furniture. He was, you know, chasing the cat, and just being the worst dog you can imagine. And I thought, 'Wow. What if this terrible dog had super powers? I'd really be screwed!'\"",
      "The first Superman feature film came in 1951 with George Reeves, who later played the role on TV. In this century, Superman has been played by Brandon Routh and Henry Cavill. But in the last 75 years, only one big screen Superman has fully captured the audience's imagination: Christopher Reeve.",
      "Trained in the theater, Reeve was a graduate of the Juilliard School in New York \u2013 as is the new Superman, David Corenswet. He is 31 \u2013 seven years older than Reeve was when he made his debut in 1978. \"I don't think there's any way or reason to try to sort of live up to Christopher Reeve,\" Corenswet said. \"I just feel grateful to get to play that character that he embodied and put into the public consciousness in such a positive and strong way.\"",
      "We met Corenswet at the Arden Theatre in Philadelphia. It's Corenswet's hometown, where he still lives, and it's at the Arden where he landed his first paid gig, when he was nine years old: \"All My Sons\" by Arthur Miller.",
      "Like his Superman, Corenswet is immediately disarming, as well as vulnerable, as in a scene with Superman's girlfriend, reporter Lois Lane (played by Rachel Brosnahan).",
      "\"He is definitively different from everybody else on Earth,\" Corenswet said. \"He is not human. He's an alien, and he has these powers that nobody else has. And at the same time, he wants desperately to be a part of humanity. So ultimately, the dramatic stakes of Superman as a character is that he is lonely and he doesn't want to be.\"",
      "He also has a sense of humor about those red shorts. \"Without the trunks, the uniform can look very military,\" Corenswet said. \"So he puts the red underwear on, a) so that everybody can see him, against the blue sky you can see the red trunks, b) so that everybody knows he doesn't take himself too seriously. He's not trying to look cool.",
      "\"Now, that doesn't in any way undermine how badass and cool he is when he's up in the sky fighting the bad guys. But once he touches down, he wants to be the one that people can laugh or make fun of, because he can take it.\"",
      "Superman has been saving the world for nearly nine decades. Created by Jerry Siegel and drawn by Joe Shuster, he first appeared in a comic in 1938.",
      "Asked if Superman represents the signature American movie character, critic and filmmaker Elvis Mitchell said, \"I think he's bigger than that. Spider-Man is tortured. You know, he has to support himself and his aunt, and he's responsible for the death of his uncle. And Batman's responsible for the death of everybody in his line of sight. They're all sufferers.",
      "\"But Superman, he stands tall, and there's a pride of authorship, literally, in the character. 'Cause he's creating his own narrative as his alter ego. People want to see that. They want to believe that you can create your own narrative in a way that is benevolent, even if you have all the power in the world. It's wrong of you to turn away from people who need your help.\"",
      "Asked what he wants audiences around the world to take away from his Superman, Gunn said, \"I think, just culturally, being able to place a little bit more importance on being a good human being. I think we're surrounded by a lot of meanness. I think Superman is surrounded by a lot of meanness in the movie. But he stands against that grain. And that's what makes him rebellious.",
      "\"And in a way, I think today, in today's world, Superman's the edgier, more rebellious character because he's the one who's standing up for the values that most people are not,\" he said.",
      "Corenswet is embracing the challenge, fully aware that success could mean Superman defines his career. He said, \"When you take a role that's gonna be this visible and this iconic, even just visually iconic, and it's your face and the underwear, yeah, I wanted to be prepared for the possibility that it wouldn't lead to a bunch of other things, that this would be the thing.",
      "\"And I felt really lucky that when I asked myself that question the answer came back, somebody's gotta play this part, and if you're the person to play it and you give up everything else to do it, it would be worth doing.\"",

      "Former NFL player Corey Parchman appeared on \"CBS Mornings\" Wednesday to discuss his new book \"IVF Playbook for Men,\" sharing his personal experience with infertility and advocating for greater awareness of male fertility issues.",
      "Parchman, now a real estate developer, wrote the book after struggling to find resources for men going through infertility treatments. At least 30% of infertility cases are related to male factors, yet men are less likely to discuss the issue or seek support.",
      "\"As I went through the process, there was nothing out there for men that were going through the process,\" Parchman said. \"There's a ton of information for women, and it should be, because women carry 99% of the load ... So I wanted to create this book as a resource for men.\"",
      "Parchman and his wife, Elisha, endured five IVF cycles over two-and-a-half years, including multiple miscarriages, before welcoming their son. He described receiving the initial diagnosis of male factor infertility as shocking.",
      "\"I asked the doctor to do a recheck. You're not talking about me, are you?\" Parchman recalled. \"It's a shock because as you grow up you think this is the process of having kids. It's as simple as ABC.'\"",
      "The former athlete said he felt like he was being \"the weakest link on the team,\" and worried he had let his partner down. Throughout the process, he struggled with feeling sidelined during a time when he wanted to be actively involved.",
      "\"I'm a person that's a fixer. I fix things. This situation I had to sit back and put the faith in my doctors and my wife,\" he explained. \"Once you get out of your own way and realize it's not about you, it's about your family, the process becomes easier.\"",
      "Parchman said there's an importance of open communication between partners during fertility treatments. He and his wife created what he called a \"safe space\" where they could express their feelings without judgment.",
      "The book also addresses how to handle well-meaning but often misguided advice from friends and family. Parchman advised giving people grace while recognizing that their suggestions may not be helpful.",
      "\"I had friends tell me, 'Eat three eggs and spin around and jump,'\" he said. \"Thanks for the advice, but I'm listening to the doctors.\"",
      "Beyond becoming a father, Parchman said the IVF journey transformed his understanding of masculinity. He now advocates for men to be more vulnerable and open about their struggles.",
      "\"It's being vulnerable, creating a space to express how you feel with your partner or friends,\" he said. \"I want to speak out and tell men it's okay to speak out about your feelings and thoughts because we all have them.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 29 Jun 2025 09:20:33 -0400",
    "summary": "Scientists conducting medical research are facing an existential crisis: Layoffs and budget cuts pushed by President Trump that, they say, jeopardize finding a cure for cancer.",
    "story": [
      "They might easily be mistaken for Congressional staffers, reluctant to face the day, but these are among the most accomplished cancer specialists in the country, meeting with Representatives, Senators and staff. Among them: Dr. Elizabeth Jaffee, deputy director of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, from up the road in Baltimore; and Dr. George Weiner, a cancer specialist in Iowa for more than 35 years, who has flown in frequently to lobby Congress for more research funds.",
      "Lobbying for cancer research, he says, used to be like pushing on an open door. \"Most of the time when I've come, I've met with Democrats and Republicans, and we talked about the bipartisan support for cancer research,\" Weiner said. \"This is the first time that I felt there was an existential crisis in our ability to make the type of progress that I see in front of us.\"",
      "These days, the conversation is all about thousands of layoffs \u2026 delays in research \u2026 massive budget cuts \u2013 close to a 40% proposed cut in funding for the National Cancer Institute.",
      "\"I wake up every morning looking at my phone: Did I get an email from the National Cancer Institute saying I'm no longer receiving my grants?\" said Jaffee.",
      "Has she felt the impact yet? \"Oh, yeah, we certainly have felt the impact, to the point where people are leaving,\" Jaffee replied. \"So, in our clinical research operation, which takes years to build, train research nurses, takes two years to train coordinators, takes six to 12 months, these people are leaving because the funding isn't coming in.\"",
      "I asked, \"If they keep cutting back, how long before Dr. Jaffee says, 'That's it'?\"",
      "\"I have to be honest, there are days when I do feel that,\" she replied. \"But I look around and I feel like I would be disloyal to our patients. We are in a technological revolution in cancer research. We are rapidly making discoveries that we couldn't even do ten years ago.\"",
      "\"What price do you put on life?\"",
      "Kevin Callahan was a Marine in Vietnam when he barely survived stepping on a land mine. Decades later, he was diagnosed with a killer disease: pancreatic cancer. First came surgery and chemo. Now, he's part of a clinical trial, which is where Dr. Jaffee and her colleague Dr. Neeha Zaidi come in, working to develop a vaccine to prevent pancreatic cancer from recurring.",
      "I asked Callahan, \"When you see some of the debates that are going on right now, and it relates to the National Cancer Institute and NIH \u2026\"",
      "\"It raises the hair on the back of my neck,\" he replied.",
      "Beth Callahan wasn't all that sure about the clinical trial at first, but Kevin couldn't stop thinking about all that had gone into it \u2013 getting chemotherapy as an approved treatment. \"They would shoot me up with three drugs, and the fourth one I would go home with a little bag on my chest, and it wouldn't come out until Friday. It had to be done over 40 hours. I thought to myself, 'How many poor bastards went through tests to get that done?' So I thought, 'If there's anything that I can do, I'm more than happy to go in with the study and see if I can help somebody else later on, [to] develop this vaccine.'\"",
      "Pancreatic cancer is particularly nasty, even when, as with Kevin, it's detected early. The experimental vaccine they've been administering to him is promising, but according to Jaffee, the chances of recurrence are 80%, and the chances of a patient being alive in five years is 20%.",
      "Yet, Kevin is four-and-a-half years out, without recurrence, \"part of a small cohort of patients who received the vaccine on that trial who are, like him, doing well without recurrence,\" Jaffee said.",
      "I asked, \"Could it be anything other than the vaccine?",
      "Jaffee replied, \"We don't believe so. This is not a cancer where sometimes it looks less aggressive than other times. This is a cancer that uniformly \u2013 it doesn't matter who you are \u2013 it comes back.\"",
      "And so far, it has not. Kevin says, \"Bottom line, I'm cancer free.\"",
      "Now the Callahans are concerned the cuts at the NIH could interfere with \u2013 or even stop \u2013 Kevin's vaccine trial.",
      "I said, \"They claim that they're not cutting back on any of the science, on any of the people who are really doing the research.\"",
      "\"I don't believe that for a minute,\" said Kevin.",
      "Asked if it is worth the money invested by taxpayers, Beth responded: \"What price do you put on life? It's our lives. It's our children's lives. It's our grandchildren's lives. What price do you put on that? We're not just talking about cutting funding to individual research programs. We're talking about NIH, which is a gift that we have had in this country for decades. Why would we give that up as a country?\"",
      "Located just outside of Washington, D.C., the National Cancer Institute is the crown jewel of the National Institutes of Health. It is also the most expensive. Its budget last year was $7 billion.",
      "Dr. Weiner noted, \"Mary Lasker, who was a brilliant woman and a force of nature who worked with Richard Nixon on the original war on cancer, would say, 'If you think research is expensive, try disease.'\"",
      "The Trump administration is proposing cutting that $7 billion cancer budget down to about $4.5 billion. Weiner thinks that America's widely-recognized position as the world's leader in medical research is at a tipping point. \"Progress is gonna be proportional to investment,\" he said. \"So, progress is not gonna totally stop if funding drops dramatically. But the more it drops and the longer it drops, the slower progress will be.",
      "\"But that's not the case for patients,\" he said. \"Our job as researchers is to bring those advances to help those patients as soon as possible, because those patients can't wait.\"",
      "That would describe Natalie Phelps' dilemma to a T.",
      "\"When is cancer political?",
      "Natalie Phelps has Stage 4 metastatic colorectal cancer. \u00a0She and her husband, Jeff, live out in Washington State.",
      "\"We have one boy, one girl, and a giant German Shepherd, very average American,\" she said. \"And I had always hoped, if I needed a clinical trial, I was like, 'I'm gonna get to the NIH. I'm gonna go to the top place in the world.'\"",
      "Phelps was invited to NIH for testing to determine if she qualified for a promising breakthrough immunotherapy treatment that has shrunk tumors in about a quarter of the patients with gastrointestinal cancers. \u00a0She said, \"When I was invited to go back, I had cancer patients congratulating me. They were like, 'You made it!' It's like making it into the Olympics when you're a cancer patient.\"",
      "The clinical trial is run by Dr. Steven Rosenberg, a legend in the field of cancer research who is still practicing in his mid-eighties. \"Well, she's a young woman with a metastatic cancer, and so that's a desperate situation. Every patient we see here at the National Cancer Institute has been through all standard treatments that haven't worked. And they come here to the NIH, the National Institutes of Health, of Hope, trying to see if some experimental treatments might be of help to them.\"",
      "In late May, Natalie Phelps finally qualified for Rosenberg's clinical trial. But budget cuts at NIH had already slowed the trial down. NIH has lost about 1,500 employees.",
      "\"We did lose two technicians that are involved in producing the materials that are used to treat patients,\" Rosenberg said.",
      "\"And would that cause a significant delay?\" I asked. \"When I say 'significant,' I mean in Natalie's case she feels that it has been delayed by a month. Is that correct?\"",
      "\"That's correct.\"",
      "\"A month could be critical for her.\"",
      "\"It certainly can when you have metastatic cancer that's growing,\" Rosenberg said.",
      "That one-month delay means Natalie's specialized immune cell therapy won't be ready until late July. I said to her, \"I don't even know what seems like an appropriate question. You must be devastated.\"",
      "\"Well, yeah, Ted,\" she replied. \"I was diagnosed in 2020 during COVID, after giving birth to my second child. And I had to spend the first bit of my child's life changing diapers and doing bottles with the chemotherapy pump attached to me. I've done 48 rounds of chemotherapy. I've had multiple aggressive surgeries and radiation. And I have been in treatment for five years, hoping that I can raise her, but at the very least let her have a memory of who her mother was.",
      "\"I have endured so much, and now I have another hurdle just because of funding cuts?\" she said. \"I mean, my husband and I can't believe it. When is cancer political?\"",
      "In a recent online statement, NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya pushed back on concerns about budget cuts and employee layoffs. He said, \"As to the current re-organization, no clinical trial has been delayed, nor has any participant been dropped from any clinical trial\u2026\"",
      "Natalie Phelps is just one patient, one case out of many; but her participation in a clinical trial was delayed, because two specialized technicians were let go.",
      "And that delay has proved to be devastating. She sent us a video message a couple of days ago from NIH:",
      "\"I got my test results back today and I didn't pass,\" she said. \"I have several new brain tumors, and it's not safe for me to participate in the trial. The earliest I could get back here for treatment would be about six weeks after having the tumors radiated, provided that the radiation's successful. I don't know. It's a long time.\"",
      "As for the budget cuts that caused the layoffs that produced the delay, it probably won't help much to learn that they were nothing personal.",

    "published": "Fri, 04 Jul 2025 20:17:26 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump pushed to eliminate taxes on Social Security. Does his \"one big, beautiful bill\" deliver?",
    "story": [
      "As Congress was approving President Trump's\u00a0\"big, beautiful bill\" on Thursday, the Social Security Administration touted the legislation by stating that it \"eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most beneficiaries.\"",
      "That claim, which echoes\u00a0previous promises by Mr. Trump to remove taxes on Social Security, may have come as welcome news for the millions of older and disabled people who depend on the program for income. So does the bill deliver? Not entirely.",
      "In a press release, SSA said that the tax and spending package, which the president is set to sign into law on Friday, \"ensures that nearly 90% of Social Security beneficiaries will no longer pay federal income taxes on their benefits.\"",
      "That figure draws on a June\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the White House's Council of Economic Advisers that said 88% of seniors \u2014 or 51.4 million people \u2014 on Social Security will pay no tax on their payments under the measure because their deductions would exceed their taxable benefits.",
      "The bill \"includes the largest tax break in American history for our nation's seniors,\" CEA said, adding that \"the deductions ensure that seniors who earned their Social Security through years of hard work get more money back in their pockets.\"",
      "Yet while it's true that the bill offers fresh tax relief for some people on Social Security, it is misleading to suggest that the measure does away with taxes on Social Security benefits, policy experts told CBS MoneyWatch. Rather, the bill offers relief by creating a new \"bonus\" tax deduction for beneficiaries.",
      "\"While the deduction does provide some relief for seniors, it's far from completely repealing the tax on their benefits,\" Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C., think tank, told The Associated Press this week ahead of Congress approving the bill.",
      "The Social Security Administration did not respond to a request for comment. The White House declined to comment.",
      "How does the \"big, beautiful bill\" impact Social Security?",
      "The bill doesn't eliminate taxes on Social Security, but rather introduces a temporary deduction that beneficiaries can claim to lower their federal income tax. Notably, that deduction applies to all of a senior's income \u2014 not just to Social Security benefits.",
      "Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS MoneyWatch the bill doesn't change the taxation of Social Security benefits. Eliminating taxes on Social Security under the bill was impossible because of a congressional restriction (dubbed the Byrd Rule\u00a0after late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd) that limits what the Senate can include in a reconciliation bill like the Republican budget measure.",
      "What the bill does do is provide a temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older. The tax break is available to people with an adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 or less and $150,000 or less for couples filing jointly. The deduction is set to expire at the end of 2028.",
      "\"Each spouse can take the deduction, for a total of $12,000, if both are 65-plus,\" AARP explains in its analysis of the budget bill. The deduction phases out for people who earn above those amounts.",
      "Social Security recipients under 65 and people above the specified income thresholds are ineligible to claim the new tax deduction. It also won't benefit the many low-income seniors who already pay no federal income tax because they earn too little.",
      "\"Boosting the amount that you get to write off when you already get to write off everything does not help you at all,\" Kogan said.",
      "The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan policy research group, said in a June\u00a0report\u00a0that exempting Social Security benefits from taxation would not change the after-tax income for the bottom 20% of taxpayers, noting that \"those taxpayers are already exempt from taxation on their Social Security benefits.\"",
      "The biggest beneficiaries of the bill will be higher-income seniors, said Martha Shedden, president and co-founder of the National Association of Registered Social Security Analysts, which focuses on Social Security education.",
      "\"The people who benefit by definition have to be richer, and people who benefit the most are the richest people,\" Kogan added.",
      "More pressure on Social Security?",
      "Providing a temporary tax deduction is likely to help some Social Security recipients, but it could also worsen the retirement program's fragile financial state, Kogan said. Social Security is on track to\u00a0deplete its trust fund by 2034 if Congress does not take action.",
      "\"We already have a problem of not enough money going into the trust fund. This bill makes even less money go into the trust fund,\" he said.",
      "The Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania think tank that studies fiscal issues, estimates that eliminating income taxes on Social Security benefits would lower federal revenue by $1.5 trillion over 10 years and increase the federal debt by 7%\u00a0 by 2054.",
      "As the debate continues over how to shore up Social Security while offering tax relief to older Americans, one thing is clear, and perhaps politically unpalatable: cutting benefits. According to a AARP-funded survey from the National Academy of Social Insurance released in January, 85% of Americans think benefits should not be reduced, or that they should be increased, even if it means raising taxes on some or all Americans.",
      "\"Virtually all Americans want their Social Security benefits to be preserved and are willing to do what it takes to ensure the program continues to provide meaningful support for future generations,\" said AARP Chief Public Policy Officer Deb Whitman in a statement after the survey was released.",

    "story": [
      "Merit Street Media, the multiplatform network owned by former daytime talk show host Dr. Phil McGraw, has filed for bankruptcy less than two years after its launch.",
      "The television and entertainment company filed the motion for Chapter 11 protection on Wednesday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Northern District of Texas. The filing comes just weeks after the struggling company laid off 40 employees\u00a0in a second wave of job cuts following the dismissal of roughly a third of its staff in August of 2024.",
      "Merit Street Media launched in 2023 with ambitions of becoming \"one of the most widely distributed startup networks in modern history,\" according to an announcement at the time. The company's broadcast network, formed in partnership with Christian-based Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN), offered a broad lineup of programming featuring popular TV personalities including Nancy Grace, Bear Grylls and Steve Harvey, in addition to McGraw, the face of the network.",
      "\"Merit Street Media will be a resource of information and strategies to fight for America and its families, which are under a cultural 'woke' assault as never before,\" said McGraw at the time of the announcement. \"I love this country and I believe family is the backbone of our society. Together we are going to stand strong and fight for the very soul and sanity of America and get things that matter back on track.\"",
      "In its bankruptcy filing, the Fort Wort, Texas-based company reported assets and liabilities of between $100 million and $500 million, court records show.",
      "The company on Wednesday also filed a lawsuit against TBN, according to a Merit Street spokesperson.",
      "\"Trinity Broadcasting Network is being sued by Merit Street Media for failing to provide clearly agreed upon national distribution and other significant foundational commitments critical to the network's continuing success and viability,\" the spokesperson told CBS News in a statement. \"The suit is part of a restructuring proceeding also initiated by MSM.\"",
      "Merit Street Media did not immediately reply to a request for comment from CBS MoneyWatch. Both live and streaming content were still available on the Merittv.com website as of Wednesday.",

    "published": "Fri, 04 Jul 2025 15:14:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The GOP tax and spending bill creates a tax deduction for workers in tipped occupations. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's promise to eliminate federal income tax on worker tips will become a reality Friday when he signs the\u00a0massive budget package\u00a0into law.",
      "After narrowly squeaking through the House\u00a0on Thursday, the \"big, beautiful bill\" now heads to the president's desk for his signature. As part of the legislation, workers who rely on tips for a large share of their income, such as waiters, bartenders and hairdressers, will see relief from federal income tax on those tips.",
      "The White House has framed the tax cuts as a win for the working class. But critics such as the Independent Restaurant Coalition have pushed back on that notion, saying the benefits for tipped workers would be temporary and that this apparent tax cut wouldn't help most low-wage workers.",
      "How does \"no tax on tips\" work?",
      "The \"no tax on tips\" provision in the spending bill creates a new deduction for tipped workers, eliminating what they owe in federal income tax. Tipped workers still have to pay state and local income tax and payroll taxes.",
      "The House and Senate versions\u00a0of the tax and spending bill vary on a few key points, including how much a worker could claim in deductions. The Senate proposal limits that deduction to $25,000, while the House version is uncapped.",
      "Under the House measure, meanwhile, only people with annual income of $160,000 or less would qualify for the tipping tax break, while the Senate version would phase out benefits for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000 or couples whose income exceeds $300,000.",
      "Notably, however, under the budget bill those tip tax cuts would extend only through 2028, and so Congress could restrict or even abolish the tax break in future.",
      "Who benefits?",
      "A May\u00a0report\u00a0from the White House's Council of Economic Advisers estimates that eliminating taxes on tips for eligible workers would increase their average take-home pay by $1,675 per year.",
      "According to the White House, a June survey found that 83% of hourly workers support eliminating taxes on tips. \"These results suggest that any measure increasing the amount of immediately available income \u2014 such as untaxed tips \u2014 would provide meaningful, stabilizing support for a large segment of the hourly workforce,\" according to that report.",
      "Data\u00a0from the Yale Budget Lab shows that roughly 4 million people \u2014 2.5% of the American workforce \u2014 worked in tipped jobs as of 2023. But given the way the budget bill is written, not all will necessarily benefit. The nonpartisan policy research center notes in a recent\u00a0analysis that over a third of tipped workers in the U.S. are already exempt from federal income tax because their earnings are too low.",
      "\"A deduction for tipped work is actually a pretty horrible way to help low-wage workers,\" Ernie Tedeschi, the director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You're only helping a narrow slice of them, and it's not helping the lowest of low-wage workers because they don't have any federal tax liability to begin with.\"",
      "Only about 4% of workers who earn less than $25 per hour also get tips, the group has found. As a result, low-wage servers at many restaurants could\u00a0qualify for the tax break, but fast-food employees might not\u00a0despite earning similar incomes.",
      "\"It's going to help some very, very high earners, along with some middle earners,\" Sylvia Allegretto, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lion's share of low-wage workers, it's not going to touch because they're not tipped workers.\"",
      "A better way to helps low-wage workers, labor advocates say, would be to raise the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009.",
      "\"It's not that these workers pay too much in taxes or that taxes are a problem,\" Allegretto said. \"The problem is they just don't earn enough money.\"",

    "summary": "Trump administration faces pressure to clinch more trade deals, with a temporary tariff freeze on dozens of countries set to expire.",
    "story": [
      "A\u00a090-day freeze\u00a0on sweeping U.S. tariffs is set to expire on July 9, sowing economic uncertainty as the Trump administration works to revamp the terms of global trade.",
      "The stakes for millions of U.S. consumers and businesses are high. Economists warn that the barrage of import duties announced on April 2, which President Trump called \"Liberation Day,\" could trigger another bout of inflation, put smaller companies out of businesses and dent financial markets.",
      "As next week's deadline approaches, the Trump administration has touted new trade agreements with countries including China, the U.K. and\u00a0Vietnam, while the status of other pacts remains under wraps. Mr. Trump told reporters on Friday that the the U.S. is likely to start informing some countries on Friday what tariffs their exports will face. Earlier in the week, he said doesn't plan to extend the July 9 deadline, leaving little time to clinch bilateral deals with dozens of other countries.",
      "Under the April 2 tariffs, imports from some nations would only face a 10% universal tariff, while some Asian nations, such as Cambodia, would also be subject to duties of 49%. If the new tariffs take effect next week, country-specific rates would be added to the baseline 10% charge on all U.S. imports.",
      "That 10% duty has been in effect since early April, while the so-called reciprocal rates have largely been temporarily suspended. Additionally, many goods from Canada and Mexico have been exempted from 25% tariffs under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Chinese goods, which were temporarily subject to levies of as high as 145%, are currently subject to 30% across-the-board tariffs.",
      "If the U.S. fails to arrange trade deals with some nations by the deadline, country-specific tariffs would take effect after midnight on July 9, substantially hiking duties on billions of dollar in foreign imports from all corners of the globe.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a question about whether it could announce more trade deals by the July 9 deadline.",
      "Kicking the can?",
      "Given the complexity of trade deals, some experts think the U.S. is likely to extend the tariff freeze pause for some nations.",
      "\"It can take a lot more time [than 90 days] to truly iron these things out,\" Clark Packard, a trade policy expert and research fellow at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Countries that Trump administration officials see as negotiating in good faith could be given a longer runway, while tariffs are likely to rise on July as scheduled for nations viewed as less compliant, he added.",
      "\"I think countries the administration believes are not bending at the knee or kissing the ring are likely going to face tariff snapbacks,\" Packard said.",
      "Although imposing sharply higher tariffs on dozens of countries could scare some investors and fuel concerns about higher prices in the U.S., extending the tariff freeze would prolong uncertainty for millions of U.S. businesses.",
      "\"The threat of tariffs, and this uncertainty, causes capital to sit on the sidelines. You cannot plan out a year from now if you if you can't even figure out what your costs are going to be in a week,\" Packard said. \"All of that causes uncertainty, and that's the enemy of investment and broader economic growth, which are the kinds of things we want in the economy.\"",
      "3 buckets",
      "Patrick Childress, an international trade police attorney at law firm Holland & Knight, expects the countries subject to higher U.S. tariffs to fall into three different broad categories as the clock strikes on July 9.",
      "First, he thinks \"a modest number\" of trade agreements will be finalized before the deadline. Under the new U.S. deal with Vietnam, for example, Mr. Trump said the country's imports would be subject to levies of 20%, plus a 40% tariff on goods that pass through Vietnam from other countries. In return, Vietnam will allow the U.S. to sell products in the country tariff-free, Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump has also announced the framework of what he called a \"breakthrough\"\u00a0deal with the U.K. that includes \"billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports.\" Mr. Trump added that the under the terms of the deal, the U.K. would \"reduce or eliminate\" numerous nontariff barriers. A broad agreement with China has also been reached, according to both nations.",
      "A number of other nations are likely to fall into a second category in which the U.S. keeps a 10% baseline tariff in place as trade talks continue, Childress said.",
      "A third group of U.S. trading partners, having either failed to nail down a trade deal or viewed as uncooperative by American trade officials, will be hit with sharply higher tariffs as of 12:01 a.m. on July 9.",
      "\"We don't know which trading partners will fall into which of the three buckets, or how many trading partners will end up in each of three groups,\" Childress said.",
      "What could happen next",
      "\"If no action is taken by the executive, the higher rates automatically go into effect,\" David Murphy, a customs and trade attorney with law firm GDLSK, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If he makes deals like he's done with the U.K., that pulls them out of the whole mess \u2014 their deal stands. So if he comes up with other deals and announces them before July 9, they are in that bucket as well.\"",
      "Countries that fail to come to terms with the Trump administration face potentially large tariff increases. For example, Mr. Trump has threatened to hit EU members with a 50% flat tariff.",
      "\"If this happens, the EU will likely feel compelled to respond in kind, potentially sparking a full trade war and market instability,\" analysts with investment adviser Gavekal\u00a0said in a report.",
      "Because trade policy experts don't expect all, or even most, deals to be finalized by Mr. Trump's deadline, uncertainty will likely persist, they say.",
      "\"The most likely outcome seems to be some combination of very limited agreements which would allow the U.S. to grant further extensions without losing face,\" analysts with Capital Economics, an investor advisory firm, said in a report. \"Indeed, Trump has stated that a longer pause would be 'no big deal'. But given his unpredictability, we wouldn't rule out the possibility that some countries face Liberation Day tariffs from next week.\"",
      "Some experts also think a number of countries are unlikely to fold to U.S. pressure regardless of Mr. Trump's self-imposed deadline. That includes the European Union's 27-member nations, which account for a quarter of all U.S. exports, giving them significant leverage.",
      "Meanwhile, much of Mr. Trump's trade agenda could end up in tatters after the U.S. Court of International Trade in May ruled that most of his tariffs were illegal. Although a federal appeals count in Washington, D.C., has temporarily blocked, a final ruling is pending.",

    "summary": "Dozens of cities across the U.S. will host drone shows on the Fourth of July this year, seeing them as preferable to fireworks. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "July 4 celebrations may look different in some cities this year as they swap the crackle of fireworks for synchronized drone displays.",
      "Independence Day drone shows are planned for dozens of cities across the country, from Salt Lake City to Sarasota, Florida. The shows, produced by a variety of vendors, involve hundreds of illuminated drones programmed to carry out choreographed routines set to catchy songs like \"Firework\" by Katy Perry.",
      "Not everyone is on board with the shift from old-school pyrotechnics, but the companies behind the drone shows promise to deliver all the pomp and circumstance of traditional fireworks shows and more, using awe-inspiring displays that capture the spirit of American independence.",
      "Salt Lake City will be hosting a drone show for the third year in a row. Andrew Wittenberg, a spokesperson for the city's mayor's office, said the main reason for adopting the new Fourth of July display was safety. Drone shows reduce the risk of fires and are touted as a more environmentally friendly option than fireworks which can leave behind debris.",
      "\"We're in drought conditions right now,\" Wittenberg said. \"And so it's a matter of practicality over any sort of other preference.\"",
      "Drone shows are also far much quieter than fireworks, making them more inclusive for people with PTSD and dogs, Jana Cunningham, a communications manager at the Salt Lake City Public Lands Department, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The city expects some 7,500 people for this year's show, which will include the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty, among other iconic American images, she said.",
      "That said, drone shows are not accident-proof. Last year, a 7-year-old boy suffered severe injuries after a\u00a0drone crashed and fell\u00a0onto his head during a holiday light show in Florida. The incident prompted New York Road Runners to cancel a drone show it had planned for its annual New Year's Eve run in Central Park.",
      "Read on for more details about drone shows and what ignited their popularity.",
      "How do drone shows work?",
      "Drone shows use the remotely controlled mini-aircrafts to create patterns and animated scenes in the night sky. In the case of Sky Elements Drones \u2014 a big player in the industry for movie events (Marvel, Star Wars), sports events (Seattle SeaHawks half-time show) and more \u2014 the displays can involve thousands of drones and span up to 400-feet high and 400-feet wide.",
      "To produce the shows, Rick Boss, CEO of Sky Elements, said that his design team works with clients to create storyboards, and then programs the drones to get them ready for flight.",
      "\"A 300-drone show might take as much as 80 hours of programming just to make sure every drone knows exactly where it's supposed to be, what color it's supposed to be, throughout its flight path,\" Boss said.",
      "During the drone show performance, Sky Elements has a pilot and co-pilot monitoring a computer to make sure everything is running smoothly. Drones are programmed to stay within a \"geofence,\" Boss said, which sets limits on where the devices can fly and turns off their motors if they fly outside the boundaries.",
      "Some cities, like Nashville,Tennessee, have opted to combine drones with traditional firework displays as a way of\u00a0 increasing the wow factor. This year, the capital city is incorporating 400 drones into its Independence Day show.",
      "Sky Elements said it also has permits to load its drone shows with traditional pyrotechinics, giving them the ability to shoot off fireworks directly.",
      "Growing business",
      "Drone shows have exploded in popularity in recent years as Americans search for safer and more environmentally friendly ways to mark major events. Among the biggest adopters are\u00a0Major League Baseball and the Grammy Awards.",
      "Industry revenue is around $338 million, according to a recent\u00a0report from the Rockefeller Institute of Government, a public policy think tank.",
      "Drone shows started to appear pre-pandemic and really picked up around four years ago, according to Boss. \"The demand has just gone through the roof,\" he said.",
      "In fact, the only thing stopping Sky Elements from hosting more shows is a lack of supply, he added. The company has a fleet of 7,000, which may sound like a lot, but is still not nearly enough to keep up with demand. The company's Fourth of July shows are already sold for next year, he said.",
      "\"Bringing back the boom!\"",
      "Not all places are not ready to break up with traditional firework displays quite yet.",
      "Tahoe City and Kings Beach, which both border Lake Tahoe in California, introduced drone displays two years ago, but are now reversing course this year amid pushback from residents. Kristen Guinn, marketing director of a nonprofit group called North Tahoe Community Alliance, said the two towns made the call after a community survey found that 80% of respondents wanted regular fireworks back.",
      "\"After two years of doing a drone show for Fourth of July festivities, the community has spoken loud and clear \u2014 and the Tahoe City Downtown Association is bringing back the boom!\" reads a statement\u00a0on the group's website.",
      "Galveston, Texas, also returned to traditional fireworks in 2023 after switching to drones in 2022, according to the Rockefeller Institute of Government.",

      "Employers across the U.S. added 147,000 jobs in June, with the labor market remaining resilient despite slowing economic growth this year. That figure is in line with the average monthly gain of 146,000 over the last year,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Labor Department.",
      "The numbers",
      "Job growth was stronger\u00a0than expected in June. Payroll gains sailed past the 115,000 predicted by economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The nation's unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, down from 4.2% in May and the lowest since February. The jobless rate came in below economist forecasts of 4.3%, according to FactSet.",
      "What it means",
      "June's employment data shows that the labor market remains solid even amid significant uncertainty over U.S. trade and fiscal policy. The upshot is that employers continued to add jobs at a steady pace.",
      "Government employment rose the most in June with 73,000 jobs added, driven by gains in the state and local government education sectors. The federal workforce continues to shed jobs, with 7,000 lost in June. Massive cuts in federal jobs by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, earlier this year have gutted several key agencies. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas says DOGE layoffs have accounted for nearly 287,000 cuts so far this year.",
      "The health care sector added 39,000 jobs.",
      "The Labor Department also revised up its numbers for April and May by a collective 16,000, a further indication the job market remains on solid ground.",
      "While the labor market remains sturdy, economists expect growth to slow in the second half of the year. Federal Chair Jerome Powell has\u00a0said tariffs could start to hobble economic activity and drive up inflation this summer. At a gathering of central bankers in Portugal earlier this week, Powell said\u00a0the Fed has held off lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "What the experts are saying",
      "Economists underlined that the labor market continues to persevere despite considerable economic uncertainty.",
      "\"Today's stronger jobs report confirms a still resilient U.S. labor market, defying, at least for now, the signs of weakness seen in some leading indicators,\" Simon Dangoor, head of fixed income macro strategies at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said in a research note.",
      "The healthy level of job growth likely means the Fed will hold off cutting rates at its meeting this month, experts say. At its most recent meeting, the central bank penciled in two rate cuts by year-end, although some economists predict just one.",
      "Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, thinks U.S. inflation stemming from tariffs is likely to peak by the fourth quarter, giving the Fed room to lower rates in December to propel economic growth.",
      "\"While there were some elements of softness beneath the better-than-expected headlines, the June employment report was strong enough to allow the Federal Reserve to keep policy on hold as it monitors the impact of tariffs on inflation,\" she said in a research note.",

    "published": "Thu, 03 Jul 2025 16:30:30 -0400",
    "summary": "The budget bill passed by Congress on Thursday pulls the plug on federal tax incentives for electric vehicles.",
    "story": [
      "The massive tax and spending cut bill that Congress passed Thursday ends federal tax incentives for electric vehicles.",
      "Buyers have until Sept. 30 to qualify for the federal tax credits on EVs before they are terminated. But experts say there are still strong financial reasons to consider buying the vehicles even without those incentives.",
      "Before the bill passed, new electric vehicles came with a $7,500 federal tax credit, and used EVs included up to $4,000. Those incentives were originally designed to help make the vehicles more affordable.",
      "According to the latest data from Kelley Blue Book, the average purchase price of a new EV is roughly $9,000 higher in the United States than the average new gas-powered car. Used EVs on average cost $2,000 more than comparable gas cars.",
      "Pricier EVs",
      "Those credits, paired with other incentives in many states, helped bridge that price gap. Without them, Senior Policy Director Ingrid Malmgren of the nonprofit advocacy group Plug In America said they will become unaffordable to many lower- and middle-income Americans.",
      "\"That's really disappointing because ... they're just a really great way to reduce transportation energy cost burden,\" Malmgren said.",
      "The up-front cost of an electric vehicle might be higher, but for those who can afford to consider the lifetime fuel and maintenance savings, Malmgren said the EV is still a good financial and environmental move in every state.",
      "That is because electric vehicles might not be cheaper to buy, but they are cheaper to drive. Malmgren said that even without the federal tax credits, an electric vehicle owner would still come out ahead.",
      "\"Quickly you'll end up paying less than a gas car because it costs much less to fuel, and it needs almost nothing for maintenance,\" Malmgren said.",
      "Malmgren said the point at which an EV driver's savings on fuel and maintenance outweigh the higher initial price varies. It depends on the kind of car and how often they are driven, as well as the cost of gasoline and electricity in an area. She said EV owners pay less in upkeep because the cars typically have fewer moving parts to maintain and require less frequent servicing. There are multiplecalculators online that pinpoint that moment based on some of those criteria.",
      "How much you save",
      "A 2020 study in the academic journal Joule found that the average EV in the U.S. charged with a typical mix of public and private chargers saves the driver $7,700 in fuel costs over a 15-year life span, compared to filling a car with gas.",
      "Savings vary by state. The study found that someone charging a car at home during off-peak hours, deemed as a best-case scenario, could save more than $14,000 over 15 years in Washington, where electricity is relatively affordable. The study said that an EV driver in any state exhibiting typical driving and charging behavior would save money on fuel costs. The study did not account for the car's purchase price, its maintenance cost or associated tax credits.",
      "Manufacturing an electric vehicle typically creates more pollution than making a traditional gas-powered one. But experts say that driving an EV over the long-term is still less polluting than a gas car.",
      "Once they both drive about 15,000 miles (24,000 km) \u2014 slightly more than the average American drives in a year \u2014 the total pollution that has gone into making and driving each type of car has evened out, said Peter Slowik, U.S. Passenger Vehicles Lead for the International Council on Clean Transportation.",
      "Every mile after that widens the gap between the cleaner electric car and the more pollutive gas car. By the end of the car's life, emissions caused by the average EV are roughly half the average gas car, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.",
      "Cleaner machine",
      "So unless you buy a new car each year, the EV is the cleaner choice, he said.",
      "\"They are a no-brainer,\" Slowik said. \"Electric vehicles are already inherently so much more efficient.\"",
      "A 2023 analysis by Yale Climate Connections found that electric vehicles are responsible for less carbon dioxide pollution even in areas where the electricity used to charge them comes from coal. An EV in West Virginia, which is one of the most coal-reliant states, still pollutes 31% less than an equivalent gas-powered car, according to the analysis.",
      "Slowik said that is because electric cars are better at translating energy into forward motion. For example, the most popular EVs in the U.S., the Tesla Model Y and the Tesla Model 3, can drive more than 100 miles (161 km) on energy equivalent to what is provided by a gallon of gasoline.",
      "\"If you compare that to a 25-mpg gasoline vehicle, that's already four to five times more efficient,\" Slowik said.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is withholding over $6 billion in funding for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction and more.",
    "story": [
      "Day camp providers and schools say the Trump administration's funding freeze could ruin summer for low-income American families and jeopardize some after-school programs next year.",
      "The administration is holding back over $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more as it conducts a review to ensure grants are aligned with President Trump's priorities.",
      "The move creates uncertainty for states and schools as they budget for programs this summer and in the upcoming school year because they don't know if or when they'll receive the funding. Democrats say the administration is flouting the law by holding back congressionally appropriated money.",
      "Without the funds, schools say they won't be able to provide free or affordable after-school care for low-income kids while their parents work and may not be able to hire staff to teach children who are learning English. Classes or camps underway this summer could be in jeopardy, too.",
      "The Boys and Girls Clubs of America depend on some of this funding to run their camps and other summer programming for low-income students. If it's not restored soon, the programming could end mid-season, said Boys and Girls Club President Jim Clark.",
      "After-school programming in the fall could also take a hit. \"If these funds are blocked, the fallout will be swift and devastating,\" Clark said. As many as 926 Boys and Girls Clubs could close, affecting more than 220,000 kids, the group said.",
      "Programs relying on the money were expecting it to be distributed July 1, but an Education Department notice issued Monday announced the money would not be released while the programs are under review. The department didn't provide a timeline and warned that \"decisions have not yet been made\" on grants for the upcoming school year.",
      "\"The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President's priorities and the Department's statutory responsibilities,\" Education Department officials wrote in the notice, which was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The department referred questions to the Office of Management and Budget, which did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In Gadsden City Schools in Alabama, officials say they'll have no choice but to shutter their after-school program, which serves more than 1,200 low-income students, if federal funds aren't released. There's no other way to make up for the frozen federal money, said Janie Browning, who directs the program.",
      "Families who rely on after-school programs would lose an important source of child care that keeps children safe and engaged while their parents work. The roughly 75 employees of the district's after-school programs may lose their jobs.",
      "\"Those hours between after school and 6 o'clock really are the hours in the day when students are at the most risk for things that may not produce great outcomes,\" Browning said. \"It would be devastating if we lost the lifeline of afterschool for our students and our families.\"",
      "Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, said withholding the money could cause lasting damage to the economy.",
      "Some advocates fear the grants are being targeted for elimination, which could force schools to cut programs and teachers. Mr. Trump's 2026 budget proposal called on Congress to zero out all of the programs under review, signaling the administration sees them as unnecessary.",
      "Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington pressed the Trump administration to spend the money as Congress intended.",
      "\"Every day that this funding is held up is a day that school districts are forced to worry about whether they'll have to cut back on afterschool programs or lay off teachers instead of worrying about how to make sure our kids can succeed,\" Murray said in a statement.",
      "The six grant programs under review include one known as 21st Century Community Learning Centers. It's the primary federal funding source for after-school and summer learning programs and supports more than 10,000 local programs nationwide, according to the Afterschool Alliance. Every state runs its own competition to distribute the grants, which totaled $1.3 billion this fiscal year.",
      "Also under review are $2 billion in grants for teachers' professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read.",
      "These programs account for over 20% of the federal money the District of Columbia receives for K-12 education, according to an analysis by the Learning Policy Institute, a think tank. California alone has over $800 million in limbo, while Texas has over $660 million.",
      "\"Trump is illegally impounding billions of dollars appropriated by Congress to serve students this fiscal year,\" said Tony Thurmond, California's state superintendent, in a statement. \"The Administration is punishing children when states refuse to cater to Trump's political ideology.",
      "The loss of funds could \"put several more school districts in extreme financial distress,\" said Chris Reykdal, superintendent of public instruction in Washington state. Districts have already adopted budgets, planned programming and hired staff, assuming they'd receive the money, Reykdal said.",
      "If the funding freeze remains, children learning English and their parents would be especially affected. Some districts use the money to pay for summer programming designed for English learners, family engagement specialists who can communicate with parents and professional development training for staff. Rural districts would be hit the hardest.",
      "\"They're trying to send a message,\" said Amaya Garcia, who oversees education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank. \"They don't believe that taxpayer funding should be used for these children.\"",
      "Umatilla School District in rural eastern Oregon \u2014 with a sizable population of migrant families and students learning English \u2014 relies heavily on federal funding for its after-school and summer school programs. Superintendent Heidi Sipe says she is meeting with state officials soon to find out if the district will have to plan an early end to summer school, an option 20% of students are using. Come this fall, if federal money stays frozen, she'll have to lay off staff and eliminate after-school programs attended by around half the district's students.",
      "\"It's an essential service in our community because we don't have any licensed child care centers for school-age children,\" she said.",
      "Sipe said it's particularly frustrating to deal with these funds being put into limbo because the school district was in the middle of a five-year grant period.",
      "\"It feels preventable,\" she said, \"and it feels as though we could have done a better job planning for America's children.\"",
      "Associated Press correction: In a story published July 1 about the Trump administration withholding more than $6 billion for schools, The Associated Press erroneously reported the amount of money in limbo in California and Texas. California has at least $800 million in limbo, not $800,000, and Texas has more than $660 million in limbo, not $660,000. This article has been updated.",

      "Lululemon is suing Costco, accusing the discount retailer of selling \"confusingly similar\" replicas of its jackets, sweatshirts and pants.",
      "In a lawsuit filed Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the athletic and lifestyle apparel company claims that certain Costco products imitate its own designs so closely that it constitutes \"trade dress\" infringement, which occurs when a product mimics another so closely that it confuses consumers.",
      "The apparel company claims that Costco's \"knockoff\" designs, or product \"dupes,\" violate trademark law because \"some customers incorrectly believe these infringing products are authentic Lululemon apparel.\" In other cases, \"customers specifically purchase the infringing products because they are difficult to distinguish from authentic Lululemon products,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "\"Indeed, one of the purposes of selling 'dupes' is to confuse consumers at the point-of-sale and/or observers post-sale into believing that the 'dupes' are Plaintiffs' authentic products when they are not,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Lululemon refers to itself in the lawsuit as a \"path-breaking\" apparel company that has set a new standard for performance athletic wear, adding that its \"construction techniques\" and \"strategic fits\" help it stand out to consumers. Reached for comment, the Vancouver, Canada-based company said it fiercely defends its products.",
      "\"As an innovation-led company that invests significantly in the research, development and design of our products, we take the responsibility of protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights very seriously and pursue the appropriate legal action when necessary,\" a Lululemon company spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Costco did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "While copycat products can be so poorly constructed and designed that they pose no threat to the originals, Costco's dupes have caused a stir for their verisimilitude to the authentic Lululemon goods. A January headline in The Washington Post\u00a0read, \"Is that hoodie Lululemon or a Costco dupe? No one has to know but you.\" On social media, users post images and videos of Costco athletic-wear products with the hashtag #luludupe or #lululemondupes.",
      "What items does Lululemon say Costco copies?",

      "Lululemon's Scuba hoodie retails for $118, while its Define jacket sells for $128. The ABC pants cost $128.",

      "Musk has acknowledged that his work as head of the Department of Government Efficiency and his embrace of European far-right candidates have hurt the company.

    "story": [
      "Small businesses facing higher import costs because of steeper U.S. tariffs are having to find different ways of handling the added expense.",
      "Facing hefty tariffs on parts shipped from China, one small business owner took the hit by redeeming over 1.8 million reward points on his American Express card. Robert Keeley, owner of Keeley Electronics, a roughly 33-person guitar pedal company in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, told CBS MoneyWatch he used the points, rather than cash, to cover the tariffs.",
      "That unusual approach, first reported by Bloomberg, highlights the challenges many smaller enterprises are facing in coping with higher import duties.",
      "Keeley's operation makes pedals used to create effects for electric and some acoustic guitars in a 17,000 square-foot warehouse in Oklahoma. But he's been unable to source one of the pedals' key components, a so-called potentiometer from anywhere other than China, leading to ballooning tariff charges.",
      "\"We manufacture and build nearly every part of the pedals in our factory, including the aluminum enclosures and all the circuit boards,\" Keeley told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I really love manufacturing and giving someone a job.\"",
      "Keeley said his team has tried to find a provider of potentiometers, which control voltages, outside of China, but to no avail.",
      "\"We can't find a source outside of China for our potentiometer, which is critical for our designs,\" Keeley said. \"Even when we call companies in Taiwan, they say they get theirs from China.\"",
      "$11,000 credit card bill",
      "Tariffs on the key component have surged since the start of President Trump's second term in January, according to Keeley. His business was on the hook for tariffs of 25% until March, when the duties temporarily shot up to more than 100%. Now the company pays a rate of 55% for potentiometers, he said.",
      "A 90-day freeze on country-based tariffs, including those in place on China, expires on July 9. Keeley is hoping the current rate will come down, but uncertainty lingers. Trade experts also say Mr. Trump could again extend the tariff pause if trade deals are not reached by the deadline.",
      "Keeley's most recent credit card bill, which included shipping and tariff fees, totaled nearly $11,000, according to a copy of the statement viewed by CBS MoneyWatch. Instead of paying cash, Keeley used the credit card points he'd accrued by paying previous tariff charges with plastic.",
      "\"I decided to use my points because I wasn't redeeming them for other things like gift cards. So I thought it would be clever to apply them to my bills for tariffs,\" Keeley said, noting that the charge is only a sliver of his tariff-related cost. \"It sounds like a lot of points, and that gives you a sense of how much I am paying in tariffs.\"",
      "Keeley emphasized he doesn't like depending on China for manufacturing his company's wares, saying that amounts to what he described as a \"single point of failure.\" Although he hasn't yet raised prices for customers to offset the higher costs, the business may have no choice but to do so if stiff tariffs on Chinese imports remain in place, he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I want to make sure I am releasing exciting products that the world wants to buy,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If I don't pay attention to what I'm trying to sell and what people want, then I will go out of business. But for now, I am in a stable place.\"",

      "CBS News' parent company worked with a mediator to resolve the lawsuit. Under the agreement, $16 million will be allocated to Mr. Trump's future presidential library and the plaintiffs' fees and costs. Neither Mr. Trump nor his co-plantiff, Texas Rep. Ronny Jackson, will be directly paid as part of the settlement.",
      "The settlement did not include an apology.",
      "Paramount also agreed that \"60 Minutes\" will release transcripts of interviews with presidential candidates in the future, \"subject to redactions as required for legal or national security concerns,\" the statement said.",
      "Mr. Trump's lawsuit, filed last October when he was still a candidate for president, was widely viewed as an attack on the First Amendment. He took issue with CBS News airing two different portions of Harris' response to a question about the Middle East, one in an early excerpt on \"Face the Nation\" and the other on the full broadcast of \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "The lawsuit was filed in Amarillo, Texas, a portion of a federal district court where the sole judge is a 2019 Trump appointee, and it was based on a state consumer protection law that is intended to prevent advertisers from misleading the public about a product being sold. CBS News is not headquartered in Texas, nor did the interview take place there.",
      "He initially sought $10 billion in damages when he filed suit last October but upped his demand to $20 billion in February after adding a federal claim alleging false advertising and unfair competition. Jackson, a Texas Republican, joined Mr. Trump as a plaintiff in the amended complaint.",
      "Paramount has maintained that the lawsuit was completely without merit and that \"60 Minutes\" followed a standard editing process. The show's executive producer, Bill Owens, stood behind the show's interview and said he would not apologize. He announced in April that he would depart the network, citing a loss of editorial independence.",
      "Weeks later, Wendy McMahon, who served as president and CEO of CBS News and Stations and CBS Media Ventures, announced she was also departing. \"It's become clear that the company and I do not agree on a path forward,\" she wrote in a note to staffers.",
      "First Amendment scholars and constitutional experts largely viewed the lawsuit as a frivolous misapplication of the law.",
      "Geoffrey R. Stone, a First Amendment scholar and law professor at the University of Chicago, explained, \"That statute is about sales \u2014 a salesperson can be held liable for stating that a product has certain positive effects when he knows it doesn't. But CBS is not engaged in advertising here.\"",
      "Constitutional law expert and Harvard professor Noah Feldman called the case an \"outrageous violation of First Amendment principles.\"",
      "Politicians had also spoken out about the suit, urging Paramount Global Chair Shari Redstone not to settle. The day after McMahon announced her departure, Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden sent a letter to Redstone raising concerns that efforts to settle with Mr. Trump would amount to bribery. Redstone had recused herself from settlement talks.",
      "In an April Truth Social post, Mr. Trump said he was \"honored\" to be suing CBS and Paramount. He also urged Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr to \"impose the maximum fines and punishment\" against CBS in connection with a news distortion complaint, which was filed by a conservative group over the same Harris interview. Outgoing FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel dismissed the complaint in January before former President Biden's term ended, but Carr reopened it days after Mr. Trump took office and appointed him to the role.",
      "Back in February, CBS complied with an FCC inquiry to hand over the transcript and videos from the Harris interview, simultaneously releasing those files to the public.",
      "CBS sought dismissal of the FCC complaint in a March filing, writing, \"The Complaint filed against CBS for 'news distortion' envisions a less free world in which the federal government becomes a roving censor \u2014 one that second guesses and even punishes specific editorial decisions that are an essential part of producing news programming.\"",
      "The news distortion complaint remains open and under investigation.",
      "The FCC's approval is necessary for Paramount's $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media to move ahead, and the agency didn't make a decision on the transaction by the informal 180-day deadline to review mergers, which passed in May. Carr said Thursday that the FCC was still reviewing the transaction.",
      "If completed, the Paramount-Skydance merger will cap off a long, turbulent sales process that attracted multiple potential bidders. Talks between Skydance and Paramount's corporate parent, National Amusements, were briefly called off before the sides resumed negotiations and clinched a deal in July 2024.",

      "The Senate bill also scales back or eliminates renewable energy tax breaks that have been in place since 2005 and revised and expanded a few times since then, including in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The most recent expansion contained tax breaks for individuals for electric vehicles, wind and solar development, and energy efficient appliances and provided tax credits for clean electricity-generating projects that went into service from 2023 through the end of 2032.",
      "Both the Senate and the House would end the renewable energy tax credits, but the Senate would accelerate the timeline in the House version, which would end the tax credits for renewable energy projects placed in service after 2028, a year later than the Senate would.",
      "Eliminating the existing tax credits would likely kill up to 72% of the new wind and solar installations that were to be completed in the U.S. over the next decade, according to analysis from Rhodium Group, a research firm.",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who until Saturday was silent on the bill after his social media spat with President Trump over the House version, said of the Senate bill that it was \"Utterly insane and destructive.\"",
      "\"It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,\" he said in a post on X. And he predicted it would \"destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!\" Musk also said, \"A massive strategic error is being made right now to damage solar/battery that will leave America extremely vulnerable in the future.\"",
      "According to Politico, President Trump asked Senate Majority Leader John Thune to further \"crack down\" on wind and solar energy by phasing out clean energy credits faster, rather than sunsetting the tax incentives more slowly, which moderate senators favored. Some asked for help easing the hit their states would take as a result of cancelled projects, job losses and higher energy prices.",
      "The renewable energy industry, manufacturing unions and even some conservatives also criticized the new tax.",
      "Conservative energy expert Alex Epstein, advocates ending the green tax credits, but he appeared to be taken by surprise by the excise tax, saying in a post on X, \"I just learned about the excise tax and it's definitely not something I would support.\"",
      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also quickly condemned the tax.",
      "Neil Bradly, the Chamber's executive vice president, said on social media, \"taxing energy production is never good policy, whether oil & gas or, in this case, renewables.\u00a0 Electricity demand is set to see enormous growth & this tax will increase prices. It should be removed.\"",
      "The North American Building Trades Union, in a statement, called the bill potentially \"the biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country.\"",
      "\"Simply put, it is the equivalent of terminating more than 1,000 Keystone XL pipeline projects,\" the statement continued. \"In some cases, it worsens the already harmful trajectory of the House-passed language, threatening an estimated 1.75 million construction jobs and over 3 billion work hours, which translates to $148 billion in lost annual wages and benefits.\"",

    "summary": "Assistant Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the deportation flight carrying the deportees landed in South Sudan just before midnight EST on Friday.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration said it deported a group of eight men convicted of serious crimes in the United States to the conflict-ridden African country of South Sudan, following a weeks-long legal saga that had kept the deportees in a military base in Djibouti for weeks.",
      "Assistant Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the deportation flight carrying the deportees landed in South Sudan just before midnight EST on Friday. A photo provided by the department showed the deportees, with their hands and feet shackled, sitting inside an aircraft, guarded by U.S. service members.",
      "The deportations to South Sudan \u2014 a country plagued by armed conflict and political instability that the U.S. government warns Americans not to visit \u2014 mark an unprecedented new frontier in President Trump's government-wide crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "None of the deportees is from South Sudan. They hail from Cuba, Mexico, Laos, Myanmar, Sudan and Vietnam, and were ordered deported from the U.S. after being convicted of crimes, including murder, homicide, sexual assault, lascivious acts with a child and robbery.",
      "The high-profile legal battle over the fate of the men culminated when two federal judges on Friday denied a last-ditch attempt by immigration rights advocates to halt the deportations, saying their hands were tied by recent orders from the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The deportations signify a major political victory for the Trump administration, which has sought to convince countries around the world \u2014 irrespective of their human rights record \u2014 to accept deportees who are not their citizens, including those convicted of serious crimes.",
      "\"A district judge cannot dictate the national security and foreign policy of the United States of America,\" said McLaughlin, the DHS spokeswoman. \"This Independence Day marks another victory for the safety and security of the American people.\"",
      "The deportations have also alarmed human rights advocates, who fear the men could face jail time, torture or other harms in South Sudan. They've argued the deportations to South Sudan are designed to punish the men for their crimes, even though they have already served criminal sentences in the U.S.",
      "\"The U.S. State Department warns Americans against all travel to South Sudan, yet deported these men there without any due process,\" said Trina Realmuto, an attorney for the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, which tried to halt the deportations. \"Make no mistake about it, these deportations were punitive and unconstitutional.\"",
      "It's unclear exactly how the deportees will be treated in South Sudan. A Justice Department attorney told a federal judge Friday that South Sudan informed the U.S. it would offer the men a temporary immigration status, but the lawyer could not confirm whether they would be detained. The Trump administration has said in court filings that South Sudanese officials have made assurances that the deportees will not face torture.",
      "The men's deportation was made possible by a Supreme Court order earlier this week. At the request of the Trump administration, the Supreme Court on Thursday clarified the scope of an earlier order it had issued to pause a lower court ruling barring deportations to third-party countries without a degree of due process and notice.",
      "That April lower court ruling by U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy in Massachusetts had required the Trump administration to give detainees sufficient notice and a chance to be interviewed by a U.S. asylum officer before any deportation to a country where they did not hail from. That case thwarted several deportation efforts, including a plan to send detainees to Libya.",
      "When he learned of the administration's plan to deport the eight men to South Sudan in May, Murphy blocked that effort, mandating the U.S. to retain custody of the detainees and to offer them a chance to contest their deportation. The administration transferred the detainees to the Camp Lemonnier naval base in Djibouti, where U.S. officials described dangerous conditions, including concerns about malaria, rocket attacks, inadequate security protocols and triple-digit outdoor temperatures.",
      "But the Supreme Court last month suspended Murphy's ruling from April. And on Thursday, it said Murphy could no longer require the government to allow the detainees in Djibouti to contest their deportation, since the order underpinning that requirement had been paused.",
      "Hours later, immigrant rights advocates asked a different federal judge, Randolph Moss in Washington, D.C., to halt the deportations to South Sudan. He did so on Friday, but only briefly before saying the request should be handled by Murphy.",
      "Moss expressed concern about risks to the men's \"physical safety\" and said the U.S. government should not be in the business of inflicting \"pain and suffering\" on people who have already served their sentence, even for a \"terrible crime.\" But he said his hands were tied, telling the advocates they needed to ask Murphy for any intervention.",
      "Later on Friday, Murphy denied the advocates' request, saying the Supreme Court orders were \"binding.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 04 Jul 2025 20:17:26 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump pushed to eliminate taxes on Social Security. Does his \"one big, beautiful bill\" deliver?",
    "story": [
      "As Congress was approving President Trump's\u00a0\"big, beautiful bill\" on Thursday, the Social Security Administration touted the legislation by stating that it \"eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most beneficiaries.\"",
      "That claim, which echoes\u00a0previous promises by Mr. Trump to remove taxes on Social Security, may have come as welcome news for the millions of older and disabled people who depend on the program for income. So does the bill deliver? Not entirely.",
      "In a press release, SSA said that the tax and spending package, which the president is set to sign into law on Friday, \"ensures that nearly 90% of Social Security beneficiaries will no longer pay federal income taxes on their benefits.\"",
      "That figure draws on a June\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the White House's Council of Economic Advisers that said 88% of seniors \u2014 or 51.4 million people \u2014 on Social Security will pay no tax on their payments under the measure because their deductions would exceed their taxable benefits.",
      "The bill \"includes the largest tax break in American history for our nation's seniors,\" CEA said, adding that \"the deductions ensure that seniors who earned their Social Security through years of hard work get more money back in their pockets.\"",
      "Yet while it's true that the bill offers fresh tax relief for some people on Social Security, it is misleading to suggest that the measure does away with taxes on Social Security benefits, policy experts told CBS MoneyWatch. Rather, the bill offers relief by creating a new \"bonus\" tax deduction for beneficiaries.",
      "\"While the deduction does provide some relief for seniors, it's far from completely repealing the tax on their benefits,\" Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C., think tank, told The Associated Press this week ahead of Congress approving the bill.",
      "The Social Security Administration did not respond to a request for comment. The White House declined to comment.",
      "How does the \"big, beautiful bill\" impact Social Security?",
      "The bill doesn't eliminate taxes on Social Security, but rather introduces a temporary deduction that beneficiaries can claim to lower their federal income tax. Notably, that deduction applies to all of a senior's income \u2014 not just to Social Security benefits.",
      "Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS MoneyWatch the bill doesn't change the taxation of Social Security benefits. Eliminating taxes on Social Security under the bill was impossible because of a congressional restriction (dubbed the Byrd Rule\u00a0after late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd) that limits what the Senate can include in a reconciliation bill like the Republican budget measure.",
      "What the bill does do is provide a temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older. The tax break is available to people with an adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 or less and $150,000 or less for couples filing jointly. The deduction is set to expire at the end of 2028.",
      "\"Each spouse can take the deduction, for a total of $12,000, if both are 65-plus,\" AARP explains in its analysis of the budget bill. The deduction phases out for people who earn above those amounts.",
      "Social Security recipients under 65 and people above the specified income thresholds are ineligible to claim the new tax deduction. It also won't benefit the many low-income seniors who already pay no federal income tax because they earn too little.",
      "\"Boosting the amount that you get to write off when you already get to write off everything does not help you at all,\" Kogan said.",
      "The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan policy research group, said in a June\u00a0report\u00a0that exempting Social Security benefits from taxation would not change the after-tax income for the bottom 20% of taxpayers, noting that \"those taxpayers are already exempt from taxation on their Social Security benefits.\"",
      "The biggest beneficiaries of the bill will be higher-income seniors, said Martha Shedden, president and co-founder of the National Association of Registered Social Security Analysts, which focuses on Social Security education.",
      "\"The people who benefit by definition have to be richer, and people who benefit the most are the richest people,\" Kogan added.",
      "More pressure on Social Security?",
      "Providing a temporary tax deduction is likely to help some Social Security recipients, but it could also worsen the retirement program's fragile financial state, Kogan said. Social Security is on track to\u00a0deplete its trust fund by 2034 if Congress does not take action.",
      "\"We already have a problem of not enough money going into the trust fund. This bill makes even less money go into the trust fund,\" he said.",
      "The Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania think tank that studies fiscal issues, estimates that eliminating income taxes on Social Security benefits would lower federal revenue by $1.5 trillion over 10 years and increase the federal debt by 7%\u00a0 by 2054.",
      "As the debate continues over how to shore up Social Security while offering tax relief to older Americans, one thing is clear, and perhaps politically unpalatable: cutting benefits. According to a AARP-funded survey from the National Academy of Social Insurance released in January, 85% of Americans think benefits should not be reduced, or that they should be increased, even if it means raising taxes on some or all Americans.",
      "\"Virtually all Americans want their Social Security benefits to be preserved and are willing to do what it takes to ensure the program continues to provide meaningful support for future generations,\" said AARP Chief Public Policy Officer Deb Whitman in a statement after the survey was released.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday cleared the way for the Trump administration to deport a group of migrants with criminal records held at a U.S. naval base in Djibouti, clarifying the scope of its earlier order that lifted restrictions on removals to countries that are not deportees' places of origin.",
      "Shortly after the ruling, Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin announced, \"these sickos will be in South Sudan by Independence Day,\" calling it a \"win for the rule of law.\"",
      "In a social media post Thursday evening in response to the ruling, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote, \"Yet another rogue district court judge has been rebuked by the Supreme Court thanks to the tireless work of dedicated DOJ attorneys. @POTUS will continue to exercise his full authority to remove killers and violent criminal illegal aliens from our country.\"",
      "The high court's follow-up ruling came after it paused a federal judge's April injunction that prevented the Trump administration from deporting migrants to so-called third countries without first giving them notice of the destination and a chance to contest their deportation there by raising fears of torture, persecution or death.",
      "Soon after that order by the Supreme Court last month, U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy of Massachusetts said that a decision he issued in May requiring the Trump administration to provide interviews with U.S. asylum officers to the men detained in Djibouti before removing them to South Sudan remained \"in full force and effect.\"",
      "Those men \u2014 who hail from Latin America and Asia, and have been convicted of serious crimes in the U.S. \u2014 have been held at the Djibouti base for weeks after Murphy ordered the Department of Homeland Security to retain custody of them. The Trump administration has described deplorable and dangerous conditions faced by the personnel sent to guard the men in Djibouti, including concerns about malaria, rocket attacks, inadequate security protocols and triple-digit outdoor temperatures.",
      "Murphy issued his order in May after finding that the Trump administration violated his initial injunction when it attempted to swiftly remove the migrants to South Sudan with less than 24 hours' notice and no chance to raise fear-based claims. The world's youngest country, South Sudan remains plagued by violence and political instability, with the State Department warning Americans not to travel there.",
      "According to the Justice Department, the State Department has received \"credible diplomatic assurances\" from South Sudan that the migrants will not be subject to torture.",
      "The Supreme Court on Thursday said Murphy's May order \"cannot now be used to enforce an injunction that our stay rendered unenforceable,\" referring to the April injunction from Murphy that the high court paused last month. Justice Elena Kagan wrote in a concurring statement that, while she opposed the Supreme Court's initial pause, \"I do not see how a district court can compel compliance with an order that this Court has stayed.\"",
      "In a dissent that was joined by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the high court's majority was effectively allowing the Trump administration to pursue \"unlawful ends,\" expressing concern about the safety of the deportees.",
      "\"What the Government wants to do, concretely, is send the eight noncitizens it illegally removed from the United States from Djibouti to South Sudan, where they will be turned over to the local authorities without regard for the likelihood that they will face torture or death,\" Sotomayor wrote.",
      "On Friday, U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss of the District of Columbia briefly paused the deportation of the eight men to South Sudan, issuing an administrative stay in response to a last-ditch emergency motion filed by their attorneys.",
      "However, in a subsequent hearing later Friday, Moss said he would allow his stay to expire at 4:30 p.m. ET. He also said he would transfer the case back to Judge Murphy.",
      "Murphy subsequently denied the migrants' request to block the deportation, writing in his order Friday: \"This Court interprets these Supreme Court orders as binding on this new petition, as Petitioners are now raising substantially similar claims, and therefore Petitioners motion is denied.\"",
      "The deportation flight to South Sudan had been scheduled to depart from Djibouti at 7 p.m. ET, the Justice Department told Moss during the earlier hearing. It was unclear on Friday night if it departed at that time.",
      "The legal fight",
      "The Supreme Court's original order last month was a significant legal victory for President Trump and his mass deportation campaign. As part of that effort, administration officials have sought to convince countries around the globe, including in far-flung parts of Africa, to accept deportees who are not their citizens. Several countries \u2014 including El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama and Kosovo \u2014 have already agreed to host migrants from other nations who have been deported from the U.S.",
      "The high court's decision in June was unsigned and did not contain any reasoning, prompting questions as to whether the Trump administration could move to deport the migrants being held in Djibouti to South Sudan, as it was initially trying to do. The three liberal justices \u2014 Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson \u2014 dissented.",
      "After Murphy clarified that the Department of Homeland Security could not yet remove the men without first providing them additional process, Solicitor General D. John Sauer sought further word from the justices.",
      "Sauer, who represents the government before the court, argued that the justice's decision meant there is no injunction in place barring the deportation of the migrants in Djibouti. Murphy's ruling, he wrote, \"is a lawless act of defiance that, once again, disrupts sensitive diplomatic relations and slams the brakes on the executive's lawful efforts to effectuate third-country removals.\"",
      "\"This court should immediately make clear that the district court's enforcement order has no effect, and put a swift end to the ongoing irreparable harm to the executive branch and its agents, who remain under baseless threat of contempt as they are forced to house dangerous criminal aliens at a military base in the Horn of Africa that now lies on the borders of a regional conflict,\" Sauer said.",
      "Immigration attorneys disagreed and told the Supreme Court in a filing that Murphy's May order \"is the only shield that preserves and protects their statutory, regulatory, and due process rights to seek protection from torture in South Sudan.\"",
      "They said that the judge's order requiring the government to retain custody of the eight deportees and provide them reasonable-fear interviews was simply a remedy that was issued to address the Trump administration's violation of his injunction.",
      "Plus, the immigration attorneys said that when the Justice Department first sought the Supreme Court's intervention to resume third-country deportations, it did not seek relief from that follow-up order regarding the attempted removals to South Sudan.",
      "\"Because the district court's remedial order is not before the court, it remains in effect,\" they argued. \"Any other conclusion would reward the government's defiance of the district court's orders.\"",
      "The back-and-forth over the third country removals before the Supreme Court has played out on its emergency docket, where the Trump administration has requested relief while legal proceedings play out. Decisions on those requests are typically made only with written briefing and no oral argument, and the court's decisions often do not include its reasoning or how its members voted.",
      "The Trump administration has filed more than a dozen emergency appeals with the Supreme Court, many arising from its efforts to curtail illegal immigration into the U.S. The high court has allowed the government to end two programs protecting nearly 1 million migrants from deportation while the challenges move forward.",
      "But it has also said that migrants facing swift deportation under a 1798 law known as the Alien Enemies Act must receive notice and an opportunity to challenge their removals in court.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump brought pomp and circumstance to his signing of the \"big, beautiful bill\" on Friday, with an Independence Day ceremony at the White House that included a B-2 bomber flyover.",
      "Some Republican members of Congress who voted to pass the legislation attended the event in which the president put his signature on his sweeping domestic policy bill. They stood around Mr. Trump with their thumbs up as he signed the bill.",
      "The final bill hasn't appeased all Republicans, but the president and Congress managed to pass it ahead of their self-imposed July Fourth deadline.",
      "\"What we've done is put everything into one bill,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I liked it because we had so much in there that no matter who you are, there was something in that bill that would make your congressman or your senator or your congresswoman, much more importantly, raise their hand and support it.\"",
      "The president praised Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, for their work in holding the conference together to get the bill over the finish line.",
      "\"Those two are a team that is not going to be beat,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The president watched coverage of the bill's passage from the White House on Thursday. Mr. Trump took a victory lap during a speech in Iowa Thursday night, calling the first five months of his second term \"a declaration of independence from a, really, national decline.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the legislation \"an encapsulation of all of the policies that the president campaigned on and the American people voted on,\" and said it's a \"victorious day for the American people.\"",
      "Following days of handwringing and negotiations, and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries breaking the record for the longest speech on the House floor, the House passed the legislation Thursday afternoon in a 218-214 vote. Republican Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick and Thomas Massie voted against the legislation, and no Democrats voted for it. GOP leadership and the White House spoke with Republican holdouts for hours to advance the bill early Thursday morning.",
      "A senior Trump White House official told reporters on a press call Thursday that the president was \"deeply\" involved in the process of the bill, and through \"late-night phone calls,\" helped move the bill forward in Congress. Vice President JD Vance was also closely involved, the official said.",
      "Mr. Trump also spent part of Friday's event honoring the military members involved in the U.S. strikes against some of Iran's nuclear facilities last month.",
      "What's in the \"big, beautiful bill\"?",

    "summary": "The House and Senate passed the massive spending and tax bill that includes signature policies of President Trump's second-term agenda this week. Here's what's in it.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House passed a massive spending and tax bill that includes signature policies of President Trump's second-term agenda Thursday, sending the so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" to the president's desk ahead of a July 4 deadline. Mr. Trump\u00a0signed the bill\u00a0into law on Friday afternoon.",
      "The House approved the bill in a 218 to 214 vote Thursday, after the Senate narrowly approved\u00a0the bill Tuesday in a 51-50 vote that required Vice President JD Vance to break a tie.",
      "At the center the \"big, beautiful bill\"\u00a0is an extension of Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was slated to sunset at the end of the year. The legislation would make most of the tax cuts permanent, while increasing spending for border security, defense and energy production.",
      "The bill is partially paid for by significant cuts to health care and nutrition programs, like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add $3.4 trillion to federal deficits over the next 10 years and leave millions without health insurance. Republicans and the White House dispute those forecasts.",
      "Senate Republicans used a process known as budget reconciliation to pass the bill, which limits the types of policies that can be included in a simple majority vote. A handful of provisions that initially appeared in the bill were ultimately removed, including one that would have ordered the sale of public lands and another that would have paused state regulations on artificial intelligence.",
      "The House passed its own initial version of the legislation last month, with some key differences\u00a0to the final Senate-crafted version. The lower chamber approved the Senate's changes Thursday, sending the measure to the president's desk.",
      "Here's what is in the 887-page bill:",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes restrictions on Medicaid, which provides government-sponsored health care for low-income and disabled Americans. The bill imposes work requirements for some able-bodied adults and more frequent eligibility checks. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill would result in 11.8 million Americans losing health coverage under Medicaid over the next decade.",
      "The Senate parliamentarian determined that a measure cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants, along with banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services, wasn't in compliance with Senate reconciliation rules. The parliamentarian also weighed in on what's known as the provider tax, which states use to help fund their portion of Medicaid costs, in a blow to the Senate GOP's initial plan.",
      "Senate Republicans proposed steeper cuts to Medicaid funding, in part by incrementally lowering provider taxes from 6% to 3.5% by 2032. The timeline is delayed by one year from the Senate GOP's initial proposal, after the issue became one of the bill's sticking points in recent weeks. It's a departure from the initial House-passed bill, which sought to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes.",
      "The bill also includes a rural hospital stabilization fund after some GOP senators expressed concern over how rural hospitals could be impacted by the Medicaid restrictions, allocating $50 billion for rural hospitals over the same period that the provider taxes would be lowered.",
      "Homeland security and immigration",
      "The legislation includes more than $46.5 billion for border wall construction and related expenses, $45 billion to expand detention capacity for immigrants in custody and about $30 billion in funding for hiring, training and other resources for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "It also includes a minimum $100 fee for those seeking asylum, down from the $1,000 fee outlined in the initial House bill. The Senate parliamentarian ruled out the $1,000 fee for anyone applying for asylum.",
      "Increasing the state and local tax deduction, or SALT",
      "The package also includes an increase to the cap on the state and local tax deduction, raising it from $10,000 to $40,000. After five years, it would return to $10,000, a departure from the initial House-passed bill.",
      "The issue was a major sticking point in the House, where blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support without the increase to the deduction. But with no Republicans hailing from blue states in the Senate, the upper chamber has been contending with its own dynamics.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "Green energy policies",
      "The final bill passed by the Senate would largely terminate numerous tax incentives from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for clean energy, electric vehicles and energy efficiency programs that benefited consumers.",
      "It would end tax credits for new and used electric vehicles, installation of home EV charging equipment and insulation or energy efficient heating and cooling systems.",
      "The bill also ends the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which gives funding to nonprofit organizations providing financing for projects that reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in communities. Existing contracts and grants under the program are not affected.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The bill still shifts the costs of SNAP, or food stamps, to some states. The program is currently fully funded by the federal government.",
      "The federal government would continue to fully fund the benefits for states that have an error payment rate below 6%, beginning in 2028. States with error rates\u00a0above 6% would be on the hook for 5% to 15% of the costs. States are also given some flexibility in calculating their share.",
      "The package also aligns with the initial House version on age requirements for able-bodied adults to qualify for SNAP benefits. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18 and 54 must meet work requirements. Both the Senate and House bills would update the age requirement to 18 and 64, with some exemptions for parents.",
      "Alaska and Hawaii could receive waivers for the work requirements if it's determined that they're making a \"good faith effort\" to comply.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "The legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, going beyond the $4 trillion outlined in the initial House-passed bill. Congress faces a deadline to address the debt limit later this summer.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid-July, saying that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as early as August, when Congress is on recess.",
      "By addressing the debt ceiling as part of the larger package, Republicans in Congress aimed to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue. Unlike most other legislation in the Senate, the budget reconciliation process that governs the package requires a simple majority, rather than the 60-vote threshold to move forward with a bill.",
      "Child tax credit",
      "The current $2,000 child tax credit is set to return to the pre-2017 level of $1,000 in 2026. The tax credit would permanently increase to $2,200 under the bill, $300 less than the initial House-passed hike.",
      "Limits on overtime and tips deductions",
      "The bill would allow individuals to deduct a certain amount of tip wages and overtime from their taxes. The provisions would expire in 2028.",
      "The \"no tax on tips\" provision in the spending bill would create a new deduction for tipped workers, eliminating what they owe in federal income tax. Tipped workers would still have to pay state and local income tax and payroll taxes.",
      "The Senate\u00a0version\u00a0varies from the initial House-passed provisions on a few key points, including how much a worker could claim in deductions. The Senate proposal limits that deduction to $25,000, while the early House version was uncapped.",
      "Under the initial House measure, meanwhile, only people with annual income of $160,000 or less would have qualified for the tipping tax break, while the Senate version phases out benefits for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000 or couples whose income exceeds $300,000.",
      "Changes to standard deduction",
      "The bill seeks to permanently expand the basic standard deduction, which was nearly doubled in 2017. The increases will expire at the end of the year.",
      "Tracy J.  Wholf and \n                                                  \n                                  Mary  Cunningham\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with documentary filmmaker Ken Burns and \"CBS Evening News\" co-anchor John Dickerson that will air on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 6, 2025.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: So Ken, let's imagine it's July 3, 1776, what is happening in America?",
      "KEN BURNS: Well, this house is empty. What's happening in America is that in Philadelphia, the Second Continental Congress are debating this Declaration of Independence that a committee of five has drawn up. They've handed it off to Thomas Jefferson, one of the youngest, but who has a great felicity, someone said, with language to draft because you've got a pretty large geopolitical situation going on that people don't necessarily appreciate that we've got the French who are kind of interested in maybe helping us because they're so anti-British. But first of all, you have to say that you're a part and then you have to win a battle which is even harder to come by. And so we are here in this, you know, the early, early summer of 1776 debating, and the next day we'll sign this thing, and we will become the United States of America. Someone had suggested earlier in June in a newspaper anonymously signed Republicus, that we ought to have a real name, and suggested it should be the United States of America just, just a few weeks before it's, it's a pretty wonderful moment.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Was America United though in 1776 when they were about to make this big step?",
      "KEN BURNS: No, we'd been fighting for a year and a quarter. Lexington and Concord are as- is, is in April of '75 there- this is a civil war that's going on. More than likely you might be a loyalist. You've lived under the, you know, the British constitutional monarchy. You know, there's no better form of government on earth. Why would I risk anything for this, you know, upstart ideas that have zero chance of success? And what happens is that this document that Jefferson principally crafts is a document that is distilling a century of enlightenment thinking into one sentence, the second sentence of the Declaration, which is, you know, next to I love you, I can't think of a better sentence in the English language.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: America- you call the Revolutionary period a civil war.",
      "KEN BURNS: It is.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Was that always your conception of the\u2013",
      "KEN BURNS: No.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: How did you come to think of it that way?",
      "KEN BURNS: I think because there are no photographs and there's no newsreels, and they're in, you know, stockings and breeches and powdered wigs. There's a sense of distance from them. I think we also are so proud, rightfully, of the power of the big ideas that we we just don't want to get into the fact that it was this bloody civil war, patriots against loyalists, disaffected people, Native people, enslaved and free people within it, foreign powers that are ultimately engaged in this. This is a big world war by the end. I think we perhaps, are fearful that those big ideas are diminished, and they're not, in any way. They're, in fact, become even more inspiring that they emerge from the turmoil. You could even look at our civil war and say, it's not really a civil war, not a lot of civilian deaths, and it's a sectional war, but the revolution, you definitely do not want to be in New Jersey or South Carolina, because people are in kind of open revolt. People, there are guerilla actions. There's little assassinations, taking things out on your neighbor who's a loyalist, when the Patriots are dominant, taking things out on your neighbor who's a patriot, when the British and the Loyalists are dominant in a particular area. It's really, really bad.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: How should we think about the Declaration of Independence, this period in America, in our present day?",
      "KEN BURNS: First of all, I think the American Revolution is the most important event since the birth of Christ in all of world history.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Why?",
      "KEN BURNS: I mean, it turned the world upside down, which is the cliche. Before this moment, everyone was a subject, essentially under the rule of somebody else. We had created, in this moment, a very brand new thing called a citizen and this has had powerful effects. It's going to set in motion revolutions for the next two plus centuries, all around the world, all attempting to sort of give a new expression to this idea that all men are created equal, that they're endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, and that's a big, big deal in world history. So what happens here is, I suppose you could, you know, miss the point, and say it's a quarrel between Englishmen, but it is the beginning of something absolutely new in the world, and that is something to celebrate and to understand too, that it comes out of so much division that's going on between the states. People in New Hampshire and Georgia are, they're from different countries. They believe different things. That you could have the divisions of loyalists and patriots. You could have this, all the things that are roiling in these colonies, and understand that out of that, we could still figure out a way to come together.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Americans think they're pretty divided right now. They weren't nearly as divided as they were during the Revolutionary period.",
      "KEN BURNS: Here's the simple thing, we're always divided, so it ebbs and flows a little bit, but we're always have big differences. You know, Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal is not met with universal approval. The Civil War kills 750,000 Americans, we think, over the issue of slavery. We have our own revolution. There are lots of periods, the Vietnam period, when we're so particularly divided. So I think there's a little bit of chicken little, you know, oh, the sky is falling because it's now. Things are always worse now than they ever were. The only- the reason why historians, and God knows, I'm an amateur historian, feel a kind of optimism, is because there's something familiar. There's, you know, the Bible says there's nothing new under the sun, human nature essentially doesn't change, and that's true. What's great about the Revolution is, for a moment, things actually, there was something new in the world, and that's the thing that we need to use. That's the leverage we have to bring us back to the ability to speak to one another, to understand how you solve your differences, as opposed to the sort of soup of anger and distrust that seem to be, you know, everywhere now.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: John Dos Passos said that when men, in times of where men feel quick sand under their feet, history is a lifeline to the- from the past to the present. What lifeline do you see from the Revolutionary period, if we're always divided, what's the lifeline to the present from the Revolutionary period?",
      "KEN BURNS: That's a wonderful phrase. I think it's manifest in so many different ways. Obviously, we're the only country, we know exactly when we were born, and we're the country that's held together, not by language, not by religion, not by even geography, we're held together by words. And so I think, to me, it always comes back to words, and why being here, you begin to realize the incredible power and import of those words that we hold these truths to be self evident. And you know, John, there was nothing self evident about those words. As someone said in an earlier film we made about, about Benjamin Franklin, this is the lawyers dodge, right? It's like there's nothing self-evident about this. But if you say it's self-evident, we just like we, of course, all agree this is true, and then say something that is so new in the world that it is still inspiring. I mean, I would normally be home on July 4 reading to my children the Declaration of Independence, because it has so much import and so much meaning, even today. And I think it doesn't take as much effort as we think it does to reinvest in those things that we share in common.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: What's, what are, what is a citizen's obligation now?",
      "KEN BURNS: A citizens obligation now is the same as it's ever been, and that's the most important thing. There's a wonderful phrase a little bit later from the famous words where Jefferson says, All experience has shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable, meaning we all kind of have gravitated to be under authoritarian rule. You know, the trains run on time, or we get at least this, but we're going to require of you to be a citizen something more. It's got to be active. The Pursuit of Happiness is is not the acquisition of things in a marketplace of objects, but lifelong learning in a marketplace of ideas. That's what the founders said, to be virtuous, to live a virtuous life, to continually educate yourself, is what was required to sustain this republic and I think that's what we've gotten away from. Everything is sort of all individualized. We're all free agents. We don't realize that freedom, the thing that we tout, is not just what I want, but also that's intention with what we need. And I think what happens is that when we study these words, we can go back to the sense of newness and freshness that they represented and rededicate ourselves, and that means me for me, and you for you, to this idea that the pursuit of happiness is about lifelong learning. It's about becoming ever more educated, to the responsibility of citizenship and that's a huge, huge responsibility, not just to take your feed, not just to go with this flow, not just to get your information that sort of ratifies what you already thought, but to actually explore what my neighbor thinks.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Being an American, as Jefferson saw it, as the founders saw it, was a continuing obligation to engage with its history.",
      "KEN BURNS: That's exactly right, and this is really important. In order to form the government, they had to reach back through the Middle Ages, through the Dark Ages, back to antiquity, to bring up these ideas like virtue and temperance and moderation and all of the things that all of them were looking for. I mean, the amazing thing is, we're here at Thomas Jefferson's house, but we don't have a country without his words. But also we don't have a country without George Washington. And yet, we know about all of these men. They're deeply flawed in many important ways. And I think today, in our binary culture, you know, where everything's a one or a zero or it's a red state or a blue state, it's my or the highway, we've forgotten that it's possible to tolerate, as we do among with the people we love, their strengths and their weaknesses. So heroism is not perfection, right? The Greeks told us that heroism was a negotiation within someone, sometimes a war between somebody's great strengths and their great flaws, like Achilles had his heel and his hubris to go along with his great strengths. And so I think that if we can take a historical view that permits us to see a Jefferson and a Washington in these very complicated understanding of them, then it's possible to then breathe, to have some room to understand who we are now, who we were then, and where we might be, which is, of course, the most important thing, all the anxiety about this present moment is really not so much about the present moment, but about will we survive, where will we be and and you can go back to this moment and be completely inspirited by possibility.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Is it necessary to understand the flaws of the founders so that they become more real and therefore their lessons are more accessible?",
      "KEN BURNS: I think so. I think we know what a superficial story means; its half life is so insignificant when you put everything into sort of cartoon stuff, into the white hat and the black hat and what that means. Yes, when you understand, Keats said that Shakespeare possessed this thing called negative capability that you could hold in tension someone's strengths and someone's weaknesses for as long as you possibly could and then, even then, you didn't necessarily have to make a decision. So you can understand George Washington as flawed as rash. He rides out on the battlefield of making bad decisions as a general. And yet, without him, we do not have a country. You know, we're speaking English or we're speaking French or Spanish, whatever it is, but, but we're a different, we're a different place without his, the leadership that he exhibited, and of course, that leadership was exhibited most spectacularly when he resigned his military commission and then left the presidency because he was giving up power and setting in motion an American example, that it isn't the person, it's the law. It's the- it's the form of government and these sorts of things have held us in good stead for 249 years.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: You've named so many instances in which, basically America was thought into being, in other words, a set of ideas, just words, just the stuff that was going on in a bunch of heads of people ended up shaping an entire nation, and as you're saying, a course of history.",
      "KEN BURNS: So it isn't just Jefferson's words, right? You've have before it, in January, this Englishman who comes ashore at Philadelphia, half dead. He's a failure in everything in life, and he writes this little, tiny pamphlet called Common Sense. His name is Thomas Paine, and he gives just spectacular, almost poetic voice to this impulse. Like heretofore, people are not sure they want to separate from Britain, not sure about independence. They certainly would like to believe it's really not the king's fault, it's really Parliament's fault. And all of a sudden, he reminds people what monarchical and authoritarian rule is all about, and that you know, this idea that you could install yourself by virtue of your family for generation after generation isn't right, and so lots of words earlier, Sam Adams is keeping everybody alive to their grievances, he said, that's his job, right? He's, he's a failure as a brewer and as a tax collector, but boy, he's really good at keeping people upset at what the British are doing, or maybe not even doing, but may do, right? And so words are hugely important, and we are the sum total of the words we've talked about, rather than just, necessarily always the actions or the money or the place or the position or the celebrity. It's, it's, you know, Washington is interesting in that he's also a great judger of character. He knows how to pick subordinate talent like you can't believe, like you can't believe. I mean, even this committee that essentially (INAUDIBLE)\u00a0by his age, that- that Benjamin Franklin is the sort of the senior of all seniors. But Adam says, you know, to Jefferson, you write it because, like, I'm short and fat and ugly and people don't like me. I'm obnoxious, but you have this great felicity of, with words.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: We're here in Jefferson's house. What if Tom walked in? What would you want to ask him?",
      "KEN BURNS: Oh, my goodness, a lot of them are deeply personal questions about his own life and what he couldn't deal with. He knew, as everyone knew, that slavery was immoral. It's only later generations that are going to try to justify it as the abolition movement grows in the 19th century, we're going to have to make Black people inferior in all of this. But there is a- there's a sense that, you know- he- Jefferson himself said slavery was like holding a wolf by the ears. You didn't like it, but you didn't dare let go. I'd want to ask him, deeply question, why don't you let it go? Your neighbor freed his slaves, your cousin freed his slaves. They both urged you to do the same thing, and you couldn't do that. You temporized. You bought more statuary and more wine from Europe and- and what was that about? Because, of course, you could articulate these universal, self evident truths, and yet couldn't live that out in his own lifetime.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Can you talk about the genius and brilliance of his words without sitting right in the middle of Jefferson's owning of slaves, enslaved people? You- can you talk about the two- I mean, can you talk about Jefferson's words without talking about--",
      "KEN BURNS: No, I think this is the important thing. And- and somehow we've- we've gotten to the idea that you just don't want to mess with the good stuff. And let's just pretend- pay no attention to that man behind- like you can't do that. A good story is a good story is a good story. And this is a really good part of the story. It's complicated, it's dark. There are human beings in this house who are owned by a person who has articulated universal rights for everyone. And what's so great is that the vagueness of the words has allowed everybody to plow through and make it their own, not just here, but all around the stuff so- so when he says pursuit of happiness, that may be the key word. When we say a more perfect union in the Constitution later on, that may be the key word that this is process that we're engaged in. And so maybe the- the poetry, but also the vagueness of the words, have opened a door that have allowed women to come through, that have allowed enslaved people to have citizenship, that have expanded in so many different ways and all around the world, that that's- this is progress. This is, you know, this is- and also the course of human events, right? Where you don't flick the switch, and it's all perfect, all at once. And so I think going back and understanding them for the deep undertow that's present and sometimes really discomforting undertow about it is okay. Nothing is diminished. Nothing is diminished. In fact, I think it's made more familiar. You know what? When it is- when you're in a conversation with a friend and the friend says, you know, I should have said this before, but I really hate this. Or, you know what, I did this, there's something suddenly, there's dimension now to the possibilities of the connection, one to the other. And I think when we look back and don't try to sanitize it. Don't make a Madison Avenue version of- of- of our past, but celebrate the grittiness, and I think, in this case, the violence of the American Revolution, we do a service to those ideas that we think need to be protected. I mean- what- this is not ideas that are fixed in amber. You know, this is, this is- this is gritty, gritty stuff. People died. Lots of people died fighting for this in just horrific struggles when the main form of killing was a bayonet. That's not fun.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: More authentic, more true, and therefore more real and accessible.",
      "KEN BURNS: Yeah. And then I think more powerful. That's- what we're looking for is meaning. At the end of the day, it's all about meaning. And so the stories that we tell, the truer, the more complicated they get, actually, the meaning increases. It's not decreased. It's only an authoritarian that wishes to, you know, in the old Soviet thing, where all of a sudden that photograph no longer has so and so in it, he's no longer there watching the May Day parade. They've cut him out because he's out of favor. We don't need to do that in this country. We can actually be big enough to accept these contradictions within our founding and within ourselves. Jefferson is certainly the embodiment of deep and- and very complicated, you know, differences, internal psychology.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: President Trump has issued an executive action in which he says basically, history has gotten out of balance. Says that the American government either funds it through museums or national parks, and he said instead that this federal role in history should instead focus on the greatness of the achievements and the progress of the American people. So President Trump thinks there's an imbalance in the way we talk about history. How do you see that?",
      "KEN BURNS: I don't see the imbalance. I think we need to celebrate the greatness of the American people. The greatness of the American people comes from telling these complicated stories, and that's a good story. A good story is a good story. That's what you're looking for. You don't want to just say it otherwise, it's just sort of slogans that are- that are put up on the wall. We want to feel that we know who Thomas Jefferson is. We need to understand the internal struggles that Abraham Lincoln had. We have to understand what was going through Rosa Parks' mind when she, you know, refused to give up her seat on the bus. This, in no way takes away from the glory, it just makes the story fuller and richer and and permits purchase for everyone you want a history to be complicated because it gives everybody a chance to own or have access to it. There is my door where I'm going through. There's a wonderful scholar, Maggie Blackhawk in our film, who says, after our scene on the Declaration of Independence, that it's deeply significant to people at the margins. That these words that do not include them. They do not include women, they do not include the poor, they do not include any enslaved or free African Americans. They do not include Native Americans. But the words themselves are so inspirational that they begin to suggest a much larger and more, what we would say, kind of American polity. That a bunch of us all together, of different varieties, doing lots of different things and pursuing happiness, this- this idea of virtue and lifelong learning.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Along those lines, that- the stories you tell in this documentary and the people who tell it are-\u00a0 there's a real diversity. Was that an important part of your storytelling?",
      "KEN BURNS: Absolutely, I think that, you know, we tend to have the Revolution, we think of it as just the guys in Philadelphia, which is really important, thinking great thoughts and writing them down. The boldface names, if you will. What we wanted to do is take those boldface names and make them not just kind of inaccessible, but real. So you could understand dimension to them. But then also realize they're scores of other people that have voices and that are important, and they, you know, they're .01% of people had their portraits painted. That doesn't mean that everybody else didn't exist, or everybody else didn't do something, particularly if you gave your life on Bunkers Hill to start this new nation, or- or- or- at Yorktown, or at Brandywine or Long Island. You know, just because you don't have a portrait painted, it doesn't mean that you're not somebody. So we're trying to give everyone a voice, and so that what you have is a chorus. So it all goes back to music. Always goes back to music that, you know, Lincoln talks about, the mystic chords of memory. These are not ropes. These are celestial chords that- that the chorus of Americans has an emotional power to it, that the singularity of just making it about a great man theory. You- the problem has been in that, at times- and may have to do with Trump's initiatives, is that we've- in order to tell a bottom up story, we sometimes thrown out a top down story. There's no need. You can do a top down and a bottom up. And that's actually the most vigorous and active and most powerful form of history is when they meet. When- as you are in a tent a few 100 yards from Rochambeau's tent outside Yorktown, you being George Washington, that you also know that that group that's taking Redoubt Number 10 has, led by Lafayette, includes Alexander Hamilton, but also has Joseph Plumb Martin, who signed up a couple days after the declaration at age 15, and has just seen unbelievable action and violence and whatever, is rushing the abattis, the spiked logs that are going to protect them, along with Rhode Islanders who have been promised their freedom after the war is over, both runaway and enslaved Rhode Island- I mean, this is who takes Redoubt Number 10 that permits us, along with Redoubt Number 9 that the French take to roll the big guns in to make Cornwallis painfully aware, if he has not been aware of it at to the- up to that point that his cause is lost, and will precipitate the surrender that will come a few days later.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Diversity of voice and storytelling was important to you, that also is under assault at the moment. The president basically is trying to remove all efforts to keep diversity in mind. Is there something that is lost in that?",
      "KEN BURNS: Well, you know, there's a strength in a wagon wheel of all the different spokes into the hub. We're all looking for the hub, whatever the hub is. Meaning, you know, something that pulls us together, that chorus, that's what we're all about. And so that the strength of that wheel has to do with having the spokes and having a multitude of perspectives. The impulse for some is to say there's only one perspective, and that's true of many different things, and it isn't just from a top down, sort of a sense, so let's make this simpler. It's also- a lot of people mistake, and what we've tried to do is be liberated from any fashion of what's called historiography. Sorry, to you know, on a Sunday morning, make the words so big, but it's sort of the fashions of the way we study history. Sometimes say it's got to be only from this perspective. It's got to be Freudian, or it's got to be Marxist economic, or it's got to be symbolic, or it's got to be, you know, post-modern or whatever. The thing is, you don't need that. You- all you need to do is say, if a kid was involved, I want to understand what that kid felt. If a great, you know, person that George Washington, I want to know what he- what he did and what he felt. Did he really need to ride out into the battle at Kips Bay and risk his own life. I mean, at one time at Princeton, he does the same thing, and his own aides are covering their eyes, afraid they're going to see their commander in chief- if he's shot it's all over. There's no country, right? And then watch him make mistakes, and at the same time, see the way he held like the strongest of glues the country together as it's going.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: You say history is the best teacher we have. What did working on this documentary about the Revolution teach you?",
      "KEN BURNS: You know, here's- here's the- the lead that has been buried. This is the most important experiment in human government that the world has seen. And we- we bury that light under a bushel all the time, either through our internal doubts, either through our struggles with one another, through this kind of binary sense of, you know, I'm wrong. You're- you know, you're right. I'm right, you're wrong. Whatever it might be, we- we've- we've missed the most important thing that the creation of the United States of America was one of the great things that have ever taken place in human history, and that's something to celebrate.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: So in looking in the past, you discovered something that should be and is, and you're seeing very much alive today.",
      "KEN BURNS: This is what makes history the best teacher, because it permits you to understand that there- it wasn't always some beautiful, great time beforehand. It's always been complicated. There's always been enormous divisions, and we always have had an ability by using the force of the system we created. I mean, these guys at the Constitutional Convention, they are worrying constantly about, you know- how to- well, what if this happens? Well, what if that happened? How do we protect about this? How do we protect about that? And they're all trying to, I mean, with the exception of the Preamble, the Constitution is extraordinarily just boilerplate language. It's an operating system, right? But it's so good, and the fact that it's immediately amended, it wouldn't have even been able to go into effective use without the Bill of Rights that were sort of essentially codifying what everybody thought they had been fighting for over the last many, many, many years. And remember, this is a battle that's been, you know, with the British the struggle has been going on from well before Lexington and Concord, with the Boston Massacre or the Tea Party or other, you know, acts of collective disobedience. But in April 19, 1775, it begins. And it's not over until 71 when the surrender happens in the fall, so six and a half years. But it's not going to be till the last British troop leaves, another two years, and the Treaty of Paris is formalized. I see you're talking about a huge period of time that we're engaged in a revolution, and there's lots of stuff going on.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Why did you originally want to make this?",
      "KEN BURNS: I thought it was impossible to do. When we were finishing our film on the Vietnam War in 2015- we began this when Barack Obama had, you know, 13 months left in his pres- presidency. People often say, why the Revolution and why now? I said, this is a really long now. I- having done the Civil War and World War Two and Vietnam, I realized the last big remaining thing was to sort of peel away the layers of sentimentality and nostalgia that has smothered the revolution and to try to get at that. And I didn't think, because there are no photographs and newsreels, that we would be able to do that, but I remember seeing a map of the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam, a kind of animated, almost 3-D map that we had made. And I went, wait this- this could easily be just following the British West in Long Island towards Brooklyn. And if you- we can do this, then we have a way- we can treat the paintings like they're photographs. We can take live cinematography and treat them like they're paintings. We can collect reenacting footage, not to replace, you know, telling this our traditional way of telling a battle, but as grist for the mill of how we could make it come alive. And all of those things, graphics and maps and live cinematography and paintings and drawings, all of them, I suddenly had this thing. I remember just turning to Sarah Botstein and saying, we're doing the revolution next. Now, next meant 10 years, or almost 10 years.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: What layer of sentimentality about the revolution to you is most dangerous to the true history or to the complexity of histories?",
      "KEN BURNS: I think the most dangerous thing is to not understand how incredibly violent it was and how many different parties were involved. We'd like to believe that our revolution is our own wonderful thing that we did, but we can't do it without the French. This is a global war at the end, in which not only the- France is on our side, but so is Spain and the Netherlands, but they have ulterior motives. They really just want to see the British, who have the largest and most far flung empire, diminish. So you've got all these wonderful competing things that people go, \"it's too complicated.\" It's not too complicated. Everybody gets it. If you can watch Shogun and figure it out, if you can watch The Bear, if you can watch Succession, you know, it's all- we know how to handle complicated stories. And I kind of resent the idea that we're told that we can't. That for the most important stories that Americans could ever have, that is the story of us, not just the upper case U.S., but of us intimately, that somehow we have to dumb it down. Sometimes- somehow we have to sort of sanitize it. Somehow we have to make it free of the \"yes, buts.\" All of life is a \"yes, but.\"",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: What about attention? Do you also- What about attention? The idea that people just don't have the time for all this?",
      "KEN BURNS: When I made the Civil War series, people said, oh, this is really good, but no one's going to watch it because there are these things called MTV videos, and they're like, two minutes, and they've eroded the attention span. People have always had their attention drawn to little, tiny, frivolous things. Always, forever. And they've also been able to realize that the greatest meaning accrues in duration, that the work you're proudest of, the relationships you care the most about, have benefited from your same attention- sustained attention. So what do we do now in this tsunami of content? We binge. What? You mean, you look at something for days on end, the whole thing over and over? We- the attention is there. It is true that there are lots of distractions to that attention. But the way we self, you know, medicate from the sheer amount of stuff there is, is by saying, I'm going to choose to watch this for a really long time. I see that in my kids who do TikTok stuff, but they'll sit there and watch four seasons of whatever it is in one sitting. So I'm not worried that there's not an audience anymore out there for 12 hours on- on sort of the Rosetta Stone, of what- of where we came from, what our birth was about.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Going back to this idea of ongoing nourishment of history, part of- go back to the revolution to learn who we are, now. Do you ever think of this work as an intervention in- we've gotten- people don't- people don't reread the Declaration every fourth of July, as Thomas Jefferson wanted. People, in your telling, seem to have lost sight of some of the parts of our founding. Maybe we don't even know them because we've been told different kinds of stories. Is this an intervention?",
      "KEN BURNS: No. Intervention imposes between the storyteller, that would be us, and the story we're trying to tell and our audience some sort of larger highfalutin purpose. A good story is a good story is a good story, and that's all we're interested in doing. I do still read the Declaration of Independence to my children now, grandchildren every single Fourth of July. I think there are lots of Americans who do that. Certainly, there are lots of people who go, great a day off and hot dogs and hamburgers, what could be better? And tell me, what could be better than that? It's okay. Everybody likes the fireworks display. There's- there's still it's- once again, it's back to this idea of chorus. The Fourth of July is my favorite holiday, because you sit there on a blanket on a field looking at these fireworks with all these other people in the dark, and you share with them in common that we agree to, basically, a sentence in a document written, you know, by a Virginian who lived here, you know, 249 years ago. That's really powerful stuff. And then John Adams, he said it, you know, this is so great, we should be celebrating this every year with bonfires and fireworks and demonstrations. And we do. We followed exactly what they told us to do. So, the fact that it can be misinterpreted by some, this is always going to be the case. Manipulated by others, this will always be the case. Sort of, you know, genuinely embraced, but for the wrong reasons, this will always be the case. But we still- we know, we understand that we hold these truths to be self-evident, even though they weren't, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Doesn't get any better than that.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: What is your- How do you receive the polling that shows people are having different views of what it means to be patriotic, and maybe even being patriotic at all is something, maybe, somebody doesn't want to be.",
      "KEN BURNS: Well, I think- I notice that, particularly among a younger generation, that they have lost a kind of connection with the glories of the American experiment because of what they've seen. You know, if you're seven or eight years old and you see George Floyd murdered, you've got a different sense of how much we've delivered on these original promises or not. I think this is- these are ebbing and flowing figures that we can't spend too much of our time being caught up with. We have to spend more of our time working towards it, the pursuit of happiness. It may involve somebody or groups of somebodies telling our stories. It may be, for somebody else, it might be helping out at a food kitchen. It may be somebody else going to school and in their form of scholarship, in science or in the humanities, have figured out something new that we need. Maybe it's in business, where you've discovered some product. Or maybe it's in public service, which is an essential part of all of this. And that public service is not necessarily the president. George Washington understood that the best office was citizen. That's why he resigned. So maybe you begin and it's your school board, maybe it's you know, you're doing something local. But I think that we're- the polling sometimes reflects just a particular anxiety, and these are shifting all the time, all the time. And it- and I can tell you, just in the time it's taken us to work on this film, how much things have- have changed and gone back and changed again. And it doesn't matter, Democrat, Republican, red state, blue state. These are superficial, binary considerations. The more important thing is that is the- that's the tip of the iceberg, right? It's the- it's the massiveness of what's underneath it. And I think a lot of people still share it, and all you need is a story or an anthem or a chorus to sort of provide the opportunities to reconfigure. That's what it is.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: You've told a lot of- You've told a lot of your stories on PBS. PBS is under threat.",
      "KEN BURNS: All of them, all of them.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Are you worried about the future of PBS?",
      "KEN BURNS: Of course, I am, and I've always been worried about it. In the 1990s I think I testified in the House or the Senate in Appropriations or Authorization about the endowments or about the Corporation for Public Broadcasting a half dozen times.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Make the case for PBS.",
      "KEN BURNS: It is the Declaration of Independence applied to the communications world. It's a bottom up. It's the largest network in the country. There's 330 stations. It mostly serves \u2013\u00a0 and this is where the elimination of funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is so short sighted \u2013 it mainly serves rural areas in which the PBS signal may be the only signal they get. They also have not only our good children's and prime time stuff, they have classroom on the air continuing education, homeland security, crop reports, weather emergency information. That we're going to take away? This seems foolhardy and seems misguided, mainly because there is a perception among a handful of people that this is somehow a blue or a left wing thing, when this is the place that, for 32 years, gave William F. Buckley a show, right? I mean, it's- and it's- that show is, by the way, is still going on and moderated by a conservative. So I just think that maybe we're throwing the baby out with the bath water. And I couldn't do- let me personalize it, and I didn't want to. John, I couldn't do any of the films I've done without them being on PBS. I could go into a streaming service or a premium cable tomorrow and get every one of the millions of dollars it took to do this in one pitch, but they wouldn't give me 10 years. They want it in a year or a year and a half, and that's the deal. I can't do that. Same with Vietnam, same with the Civil War, same with Jazz, same with the National Parks, same with, you know, the Roosevelts, all of those- Country Music, all of those have taken time to incubate, and that has been under the system that has one foot tentatively in the marketplace and the other proudly out, kind of like the National Parks or the Declaration of Independence applied to the landscape. These are really good American institutions that represent everybody from the bottom up, which is what it's always about. That's the essence of what Thomas Jefferson was talking about.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: As someone who worked so hard on telling the story of slavery and enslaved people in various different ways, what did you learn about slavery in America from working on this?",
      "KEN BURNS: It's so complicated and so interesting. I- I think the thing that was most striking that's come to me is that it was really clear that our founders, even those founders who owned other human beings, knew that the institution of slavery was indefensible. It's only later in the 19th century that you'll sort of make- you'll try to make excuses for why it's okay and that they're really wrestling with ways, but there are human beings that are owned by other human beings. There are slaves from New Hampshire to- to Georgia. And one person, the scholar Annette Gordon-Reed, says it's important to understand that the South is a slave society and the North is a society with slaves, and there's a big difference. So even within the United States, I was learning constantly. Maybe 20,000 Black people fought in the Revolution, probably 15 for the British who had cynically offered them their freedom. Not freedom of loyalists, right? And how you're going to tell I don't know, but- but they are- and then 5,000 fought valiantly for the Patriot cause. It's very, very complicated, and you can never say a categorical them about anybody, and that's all we do. Look, I have- I have made films about the U.S. for all of my professional life, but I've also made films simultaneously about us, all of the intimacy of that, all the majesty and complexity and contradiction and controversy of the U.S. And the thing I've learned, if I've learned anything, is that there's only us, there's no them, and we're constantly being told: there's a them. There's no them and that's what this document produced by the man who- who sat in this room, you know, and looked at, you know, heard his troubled secretary Meriwether Lewis, say, you know what, 15 million got you? It got you this. And, by the way, there's no Northwest Passage, but look what you have here. And you've got, you know, the Lewis and- this is- this is- this is where you know he- he- he learns the whole thing.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: If there is only us and no them, it is also a strain in American history: look at them, go get them.",
      "KEN BURNS: That's right. It's the simplest thing. It's the authoritarians' playbook. That's what you always do. You make- if you make an enemy and you say, you know, your problem is that there's that thing happening, but there's really not that. All of the religious traditions remind us that, or try to remind us that, and- and we want to forget it. There's something simplistic about allowing ourselves to be convinced that there is a them, you know, we- we've- we've- we've, in our own political documents, have enshrined the sanctity of the individual. The religious doctrines have been doing that for centuries. And so the idea of making distinctions, you know, I remember I gave a speech at Brandeis, a commencement speech, talking about the Middle East, and I said, these three great religions, all with claim to the same holy ground, have turned it into a shameful graveyard. God does not distinguish between the dead.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: There's a lot of talk about them these days. Are you hoping to pierce that with this telling of America's beginning?",
      "KEN BURNS: I don't have a conscious desire to do this. There's- there's a kind of- that implies a kind of agenda, kind of a political agenda. I know that a good story is a benign Trojan horse. You take it in and it- it- it- at night, it goes into the city, and it doesn't slay anybody. It just reminds them: no them, no them, no them. This is- isn't this wonderful? Isn't this- isn't this important? Isn't this extraordinary? Isn't the complication worth learning about? And that- that's the only thing- that's- if- we have been- we have been really disciplined to say we just want to tell a story. I mean, Mark Twain said history doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes. We consciously understand, as we're working on a film, how many- how much it's rhyming in the present and it changes a little bit, and changes that. But we don't ever try to put neon signs going, look how much this is so much like today. We just want to let that resonate. And you go, oh my goodness, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, they may have wigs and they may have breeches, they're very much like us.",

You know, this is a big- a good story is a big house with lots of different doors, and we tend to go through the front door and think that's it. Somebody may be coming in the side door. Somebody may be coming- climbing up and- and breaking in from the second- however you get in, you're in, and that's all you want, is, you know, stories are invitations like, honey, how was your day, right? It doesn't begin: I backed slowly down the driveway, avoiding the garbage can at the curb, you- you just edit human experience. And that's what we spent the last 10 years doing. We're saying this story of the American founding, our- our creation myth, is as important a story to get right as anything, and we've spent 10 years trying to get it right.",

      "KEN BURNS: Benjamin Rush, who is the great physician of the time, one of the signers of the Declaration, said that- when it was over, that the- the American war is over, but the American Revolution is going on. I think if you accept the idea of pursuit of happiness, if you accept the idea of a more perfect union, you realize, as we do in our own lives, in our own work, in our own relationships, that it's about process, that we're engaged in an ongoing desire to achieve these things. This perfection is what you want to tilt for. It's unattainable, obviously, but if you're not engaged in the active pursuit of perfection, self, relationship, community, country, world, then you're stopped, you're static, and you're not going forward. And I think there's not an American that does not want to go forward.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: We're here in Jefferson's house. The only thing he was perhaps more proud of than Monticello was the University of Virginia. It's on his tombstone. The president of the University of Virginia just resigned under pressure from the president. What would Jefferson think?",
      "KEN BURNS: Well, you know, it's the first university that was founded in the United States without a religious affiliation. It was really important to him that part of this thing that we not make the mistake of the other countries of having a set and recognized religion. And I think that he would be shocked at any kind of interference with the- with the goings on of a laboratory of- of experimentation, a laboratory of education and discovery.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Can we learn about history if the government is telling us what we can and can't do as we try to arrange our- our system for learning?",
      "KEN BURNS: Yeah, you sure can. Stories are kind of subversive in that way. They just tell you stuff, the, sort of, the inconvenient truths of- of stuff that's going on and good stories are- are very much that, I think, and that's what we hope always. I'm not sure that we succeed everywhere, but telling a good story has a kind of way of- of setting aside the mythologies or the certainties, right? There- there's really, you know, the enemy of good anything is certainty. It's always my way or the highway. That just doesn't work. And so stories, good stories, I think, are- are wonderfully- they have a wink to them. And you know, it's just like humor, it hits both the yes and no at the same time. A good story is always going to be collecting the- the complication, the tensions within and between individuals, and when they're represented, then people grow. You're stunted, and you're back to being a subject, you're back to being a superficial peasant, superstitious peasant, if you're- if- if- if you're subscribing to one set of things, you know. It just reminds me of those Soviets editing the photograph, right? Saying, oh, that person doesn't exist anymore. We- we've torn him out. He- he- he doesn't exist. He goes out of our history books. There- it's all there. We- and- and our liberation, you know, Harry Truman is supposed to have said, the only thing that's really new is the history you don't know. I love the idea. New.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump referred to some lenders as \"shylocks and bad people\" during a Thursday evening speech, using a term the Anti-Defamation League called a \"centuries-old antisemitic trope.\"",
      "The remarks came during an event in Iowa, as Mr. Trump celebrated the passage of his One Big Beautiful Bill Act. When discussing the law's changes to the estate tax, he said, \"Think of that. No death tax, no estate tax. No going to the banks and borrowing from in some cases a fine banker, and in some cases shylocks and bad people.\"",
      "The word \"shylock\" is a reference to the name of a Jewish character in William Shakespeare's \"The Merchant of Venice\" who is portrayed as a greedy moneylender. The depiction is widely seen as evocative of antisemitic stereotypes.",
      "When asked about the word's antisemitic connotations, Mr. Trump told reporters after the speech, \"I've never heard it that way.\"",
      "\"The meaning of shylock is somebody that's a moneylender at high rates,\" the president said. \"You view it differently. I've never heard that.\"",
      "The Anti-Defamation League said Friday on X, \"President Trump's use of the term is very troubling and irresponsible,\" writing that the word \"evokes a centuries-old antisemitic trope about Jews and greed that is extremely offensive and dangerous.\"",
      "Rep. Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat who is Jewish, also criticized Mr. Trump's remarks in a post on X, writing: \"This is blatant and vile antisemitism, and Trump knows exactly what he's doing.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's promise to eliminate federal income tax on worker tips will become a reality Friday when he signs the\u00a0massive budget package\u00a0into law.",
      "After narrowly squeaking through the House\u00a0on Thursday, the \"big, beautiful bill\" now heads to the president's desk for his signature. As part of the legislation, workers who rely on tips for a large share of their income, such as waiters, bartenders and hairdressers, will see relief from federal income tax on those tips.",
      "The White House has framed the tax cuts as a win for the working class. But critics such as the Independent Restaurant Coalition have pushed back on that notion, saying the benefits for tipped workers would be temporary and that this apparent tax cut wouldn't help most low-wage workers.",
      "How does \"no tax on tips\" work?",
      "The \"no tax on tips\" provision in the spending bill creates a new deduction for tipped workers, eliminating what they owe in federal income tax. Tipped workers still have to pay state and local income tax and payroll taxes.",
      "The House and Senate versions\u00a0of the tax and spending bill vary on a few key points, including how much a worker could claim in deductions. The Senate proposal limits that deduction to $25,000, while the House version is uncapped.",
      "Under the House measure, meanwhile, only people with annual income of $160,000 or less would qualify for the tipping tax break, while the Senate version would phase out benefits for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000 or couples whose income exceeds $300,000.",
      "Notably, however, under the budget bill those tip tax cuts would extend only through 2028, and so Congress could restrict or even abolish the tax break in future.",
      "Who benefits?",
      "A May\u00a0report\u00a0from the White House's Council of Economic Advisers estimates that eliminating taxes on tips for eligible workers would increase their average take-home pay by $1,675 per year.",
      "According to the White House, a June survey found that 83% of hourly workers support eliminating taxes on tips. \"These results suggest that any measure increasing the amount of immediately available income \u2014 such as untaxed tips \u2014 would provide meaningful, stabilizing support for a large segment of the hourly workforce,\" according to that report.",
      "Data\u00a0from the Yale Budget Lab shows that roughly 4 million people \u2014 2.5% of the American workforce \u2014 worked in tipped jobs as of 2023. But given the way the budget bill is written, not all will necessarily benefit. The nonpartisan policy research center notes in a recent\u00a0analysis that over a third of tipped workers in the U.S. are already exempt from federal income tax because their earnings are too low.",
      "\"A deduction for tipped work is actually a pretty horrible way to help low-wage workers,\" Ernie Tedeschi, the director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You're only helping a narrow slice of them, and it's not helping the lowest of low-wage workers because they don't have any federal tax liability to begin with.\"",
      "Only about 4% of workers who earn less than $25 per hour also get tips, the group has found. As a result, low-wage servers at many restaurants could\u00a0qualify for the tax break, but fast-food employees might not\u00a0despite earning similar incomes.",
      "\"It's going to help some very, very high earners, along with some middle earners,\" Sylvia Allegretto, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lion's share of low-wage workers, it's not going to touch because they're not tipped workers.\"",
      "A better way to helps low-wage workers, labor advocates say, would be to raise the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009.",
      "\"It's not that these workers pay too much in taxes or that taxes are a problem,\" Allegretto said. \"The problem is they just don't earn enough money.\"",

    "story": [
      "A\u00a090-day freeze\u00a0on sweeping U.S. tariffs is set to expire on July 9, sowing economic uncertainty as the Trump administration works to revamp the terms of global trade.",
      "The stakes for millions of U.S. consumers and businesses are high. Economists warn that the barrage of import duties announced on April 2, which President Trump called \"Liberation Day,\" could trigger another bout of inflation, put smaller companies out of businesses and dent financial markets.",
      "As next week's deadline approaches, the Trump administration has touted new trade agreements with countries including China, the U.K. and\u00a0Vietnam, while the status of other pacts remains under wraps. Mr. Trump told reporters on Friday that the the U.S. is likely to start informing some countries on Friday what tariffs their exports will face. Earlier in the week, he said doesn't plan to extend the July 9 deadline, leaving little time to clinch bilateral deals with dozens of other countries.",
      "Under the April 2 tariffs, imports from some nations would only face a 10% universal tariff, while some Asian nations, such as Cambodia, would also be subject to duties of 49%. If the new tariffs take effect next week, country-specific rates would be added to the baseline 10% charge on all U.S. imports.",
      "That 10% duty has been in effect since early April, while the so-called reciprocal rates have largely been temporarily suspended. Additionally, many goods from Canada and Mexico have been exempted from 25% tariffs under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Chinese goods, which were temporarily subject to levies of as high as 145%, are currently subject to 30% across-the-board tariffs.",
      "If the U.S. fails to arrange trade deals with some nations by the deadline, country-specific tariffs would take effect after midnight on July 9, substantially hiking duties on billions of dollar in foreign imports from all corners of the globe.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a question about whether it could announce more trade deals by the July 9 deadline.",
      "Kicking the can?",
      "Given the complexity of trade deals, some experts think the U.S. is likely to extend the tariff freeze pause for some nations.",
      "\"It can take a lot more time [than 90 days] to truly iron these things out,\" Clark Packard, a trade policy expert and research fellow at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Countries that Trump administration officials see as negotiating in good faith could be given a longer runway, while tariffs are likely to rise on July as scheduled for nations viewed as less compliant, he added.",
      "\"I think countries the administration believes are not bending at the knee or kissing the ring are likely going to face tariff snapbacks,\" Packard said.",
      "Although imposing sharply higher tariffs on dozens of countries could scare some investors and fuel concerns about higher prices in the U.S., extending the tariff freeze would prolong uncertainty for millions of U.S. businesses.",
      "\"The threat of tariffs, and this uncertainty, causes capital to sit on the sidelines. You cannot plan out a year from now if you if you can't even figure out what your costs are going to be in a week,\" Packard said. \"All of that causes uncertainty, and that's the enemy of investment and broader economic growth, which are the kinds of things we want in the economy.\"",
      "3 buckets",
      "Patrick Childress, an international trade police attorney at law firm Holland & Knight, expects the countries subject to higher U.S. tariffs to fall into three different broad categories as the clock strikes on July 9.",
      "First, he thinks \"a modest number\" of trade agreements will be finalized before the deadline. Under the new U.S. deal with Vietnam, for example, Mr. Trump said the country's imports would be subject to levies of 20%, plus a 40% tariff on goods that pass through Vietnam from other countries. In return, Vietnam will allow the U.S. to sell products in the country tariff-free, Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump has also announced the framework of what he called a \"breakthrough\"\u00a0deal with the U.K. that includes \"billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports.\" Mr. Trump added that the under the terms of the deal, the U.K. would \"reduce or eliminate\" numerous nontariff barriers. A broad agreement with China has also been reached, according to both nations.",
      "A number of other nations are likely to fall into a second category in which the U.S. keeps a 10% baseline tariff in place as trade talks continue, Childress said.",
      "A third group of U.S. trading partners, having either failed to nail down a trade deal or viewed as uncooperative by American trade officials, will be hit with sharply higher tariffs as of 12:01 a.m. on July 9.",
      "\"We don't know which trading partners will fall into which of the three buckets, or how many trading partners will end up in each of three groups,\" Childress said.",
      "What could happen next",
      "\"If no action is taken by the executive, the higher rates automatically go into effect,\" David Murphy, a customs and trade attorney with law firm GDLSK, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If he makes deals like he's done with the U.K., that pulls them out of the whole mess \u2014 their deal stands. So if he comes up with other deals and announces them before July 9, they are in that bucket as well.\"",
      "Countries that fail to come to terms with the Trump administration face potentially large tariff increases. For example, Mr. Trump has threatened to hit EU members with a 50% flat tariff.",
      "\"If this happens, the EU will likely feel compelled to respond in kind, potentially sparking a full trade war and market instability,\" analysts with investment adviser Gavekal\u00a0said in a report.",
      "Because trade policy experts don't expect all, or even most, deals to be finalized by Mr. Trump's deadline, uncertainty will likely persist, they say.",
      "\"The most likely outcome seems to be some combination of very limited agreements which would allow the U.S. to grant further extensions without losing face,\" analysts with Capital Economics, an investor advisory firm, said in a report. \"Indeed, Trump has stated that a longer pause would be 'no big deal'. But given his unpredictability, we wouldn't rule out the possibility that some countries face Liberation Day tariffs from next week.\"",
      "Some experts also think a number of countries are unlikely to fold to U.S. pressure regardless of Mr. Trump's self-imposed deadline. That includes the European Union's 27-member nations, which account for a quarter of all U.S. exports, giving them significant leverage.",
      "Meanwhile, much of Mr. Trump's trade agenda could end up in tatters after the U.S. Court of International Trade in May ruled that most of his tariffs were illegal. Although a federal appeals count in Washington, D.C., has temporarily blocked, a final ruling is pending.",

      "\"Only the richest person in the world could make a serious effort at creating a new American political party,\" Brett Kappel, a veteran election lawyer, told CBS News.",
      "Navigating 50 different state laws \u2014 and federal rules",
      "\"Political parties are creatures of the states,\" Kappel said.",
      "Each state has different legal rules for recognizing which political parties can appear on the ballot, and those hurdles \"range from high to extraordinarily difficult to overcome,\" he noted. In some cases, a nascent state party may need to get candidates onto the ballot by submitting large numbers of signatures, and then win a certain percentage of the vote across election cycles.",
      "For example, to qualify in California, a new political party needs to either sign up 0.33% of the state's voters \u2014 or about 75,000 people \u2014 as registered members, or submit signatures from 1.1 million voters. After that, in order to remain qualified, parties have to either maintain that 0.33% registration threshold or win at least 2% of the vote in a statewide race.",
      "And to gain recognition at the national level, each state-level political party would need to seek an advisory opinion from the Federal Election Commission.",
      "These efforts would almost certainly face intense pushback from the Democratic and Republican parties, including legal challenges over signatures in each state, requiring Musk \u2014 or any other aspiring third-party founder \u2014 to spend scores of money on litigation.",
      "\"The state laws in all of the states are biased towards the two major political parties, and make it as difficult as possible for the emergence of a third political party,\" Kappel told CBS News.",
      "The process of creating a political party with national ambitions would be time-consuming, too. Kappel says it might be doable \u2014 albeit difficult \u2014 for Musk to get a few favored candidates onto the ballot in certain states, but building an entirely new national party would likely take years, and would not be possible by the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "Musk wrote on X Friday a nascent political party could \"laser-focus on just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts,\" arguing, \"that would be enough to serve as the deciding vote on contentious laws.\"",
      "For evidence of how challenging the process of forming a new national party is, look no further than the struggles that existing third parties have faced. The Green Party and Libertarian Party were each founded decades ago, and still engage in state-by-state pushes for ballot access and party recognition.",
      "\"The hurdles for creating a new party and getting it on the ballot are extremely high. It can be done if you have endless amounts of money, but it's a multi-year project and will cost hundreds of millions of dollars,\" Kappel said.",
      "Musk's campaign cash",
      "The high cost of launching a political party may not be a big stumbling block for Musk, whose net worth exceeds $350 billion according to Forbes and Bloomberg's valuations.",
      "The Tesla and SpaceX leader spent a staggering $277 million to aid Mr. Trump and other Republican candidates in the 2024 election cycle. The bulk of that spending, roughly $239 million, was routed through America PAC, a political action committee founded by Musk that underwrote a sprawling get-out-the-vote effort across the swing states.",
      "Since then, Musk has hinted that he plans to dial back his involvement in politics. His tenure leading the Trump administration's cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency ended in May, a month after telling Tesla shareholders his work with the federal government will \"drop significantly.\" He also said at the Qatar Economic Forum in May that he will \"do a lot less\" political spending moving forward, noting he doesn't \"currently see a reason\" to keep opening his wallet.",
      "If Musk follows through on his proposal to launch a competitor to the two mainstream parties, it would mark an expensive return to the fray \u2014 and the laws around how to finance it are complex.",
      "Before new political parties are formally recognized, they are typically organized as not-for-profit groups, and their financial backers do not face any dollar limits to their donations, Kappel says. But once a party gains national recognition, donors like Musk would be subject to the FEC's caps on political contributions. Currently, individuals can only give $10,000 a year to a state political party, or $44,300 a year to a national party committee, the FEC says.",
      "The rules governing when organizations are subject to those limits are byzantine. Almost two decades ago, the FEC said a group called Unity08 \u2014 which aimed to create a bipartisan presidential ticket \u2014 must register as a political committee if it spends over $1,000 trying to get ballot access. After a lengthy legal battle, an appeals court reversed that decision.",
      "Another way for Musk to keep wielding political influence would be through America PAC. The group is organized as a super PAC, which allows Musk to donate unlimited sums of money, but requires the group to remain officially independent from candidates or political parties.",
      "Even as he mused about launching a third party, Musk implied this week he could remain engaged in Republican politics. The billionaire suggested he will back primary challenges against GOP lawmakers who voted for the Trump-endorsed One Big Beautiful Bill Act. He also vowed to lend support to Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who voted against the bill and is facing a Trump-backed primary contest.",
      "The president, for his part, has said in recent days that Musk appears to be \"upset\" that his signature tax and domestic policy bill would phase out electric vehicle tax credits \u2014 which could\u00a0cost Tesla billions. Some of Musk's criticisms of the bill have focused on its steep cuts to green energy incentives, though he has also argued the bill is too expensive.",
      "\"I think Elon is a wonderful guy, and I know he's going to do well always,\" Mr. Trump told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo in an interview that aired Sunday. \"But he got a little bit upset, and that wasn't appropriate.\"",

      "The order by Jackson County Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang said the abortion restrictions likely violate a state constitutional right to abortion approved by voters last year.",
      "Planned Parenthood said the order clears the way for it to again provide procedural abortions in Missouri.",
      "But Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey said his office \"will expeditiously appeal this ruling.\"",
      "The court order marks the latest twist in a multiyear battle that has seen Missouri swing back and forth between banning and allowing most abortions.",
      "When the U.S. Supreme Court ended a nationwide right to abortion by overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022, it triggered a Missouri law banning abortions \"except in cases of medical emergency.\" But abortion-rights activists gathered initiative petition signatures to reverse that law.",
      "Last November, voters narrowly approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing a right to abortion until fetal viability, generally considered sometime past 21 weeks of pregnancy. That made Missouri the only state where voters have used a ballot measure to overturn a ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy.",
      "The state Supreme Court ruled in May that Zhang had applied the wrong standard when issuing rulings in February and December that blocked Missouri's abortion restrictions.",
      "Upon reconsideration, Zhang again issued preliminary injunctions against the abortion ban. The judge also reimposed a hold on various other laws, including a 72-hour waiting period for abortions, numerous abortion facility licensure requirements and a mandate that physicians performing abortions have admitting privileges at certain types of hospitals located within 30 miles or 15 minutes of where an abortion is provided.",
      "\"Abortion is legal again in Missouri because voters demanded it and we fought for it,\" said Emily Wales, president and CEO of Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains. \"Care starts again on Monday in Kansas City.\"",
      "Planned Parenthood clinics in central Missouri and St. Louis also \"will work as quickly as possible to resume scheduling abortion appointments,\" said Margot Riphagen, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers.",
      "The attorney general's office said it will keep up the legal fight.",
      "\"Missouri will not stand idly by while the abortion industry seeks to strip away basic medical safeguards,\" Bailey's office said in a statement. \"We will continue to uphold the State's compelling interest in protecting women's health, safety, and informed consent.\"",
      "Thursday's order did not address medication abortions, which remain on hold while Planned Parenthood wrangles with the state over abortion regulations.",
      "The court battle is just one part of Missouri's ongoing abortion debate.",
      "In May, the Republican-led Legislature approved a proposed constitutional amendment that would reimpose an abortion ban \u2014 but with exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest. The measure could be on the ballot in 2026 or sooner.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump signed an executive order Thursday calling on the national park system to charge higher entry fees for foreign visitors.",
      "It instructs Interior Secretary Doug Burgum \u2014 who oversees the National Park Service \u2014 to \"develop a strategy\" to hike entrance fees and recreation pass fees for non-U.S. residents at any national park that currently charges for entry.",
      "\"To fund improvements and enhanced experiences across the park system, I've just signed an executive order to raise entrance fees for foreign tourists while keeping prices low for Americans,\" Mr. Trump said in a Thursday evening rally in Iowa. \"The national parks will be about America first.\"",

      "In its 2026 fiscal year budget proposal released in May, the Interior Department estimated that such a surcharge would generate more than $90 million annually.",
      "Not all national parks charge an entrance fee, and for those that do, the fee varies. Generally, visitors can purchase either a standard daily or weekly pass to one specific park, or an annual pass that can be used at one park or in a certain region of the country. The Park Service also offers a more comprehensive \"America the Beautiful\" pass, which costs $80 and can be used at all national parks nationwide.",
      "Some of the National Park Service's most popular sites \u2014 like Yellowstone, Yosemite and the Grand Canyon \u2014 charge entrance fees of $20 per person or $35 per vehicle.",
      "Mr. Trump also ordered the Interior Department to give U.S. residents \"preferential treatment\" over foreign visitors regarding \"recreational access rules, including permitting or lottery rules\" that parks might have in place. The order did not detail what those preferential treatment rules would entail, but some popular national parks have reservation systems for entry and camping during peak seasons.",
      "The order Thursday also revoked a memorandum signed in January 2017, at the tail end of former President Barack Obama's second term, which sought to promote diversity and inclusion at national parks. The move appeared to be part of the ongoing effort by the Trump administration to scale back the federal government's diversity efforts.",
      "The latest moves come as the Trump administration has sought to reduce the size of the National Park Service's staff. It laid off about 1,000 Park Service employees in February as part of its push, led by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, to enact large-scale personnel and budgetary cuts across the federal government.",
      "According to analysis released this week by the National Parks Conservation Association, an independent advocacy group, the Park Service has lost 24% of its permanent staff since President Trump took office in January.",
      "In its 2026 fiscal year budget, the Interior Department also proposed cutting more than $1 billion to the Park Service, which would be the largest such budget cut in the agency's history.",

      "Washington \u2014 The House on Thursday passed the signature piece of legislation of President Trump's second term, approving a massive bill that includes trillions of dollars in tax and spending cuts while ramping up funding for defense and implementing the administration's immigration agenda.",
      "The lower chamber voted 218 to 214 to approve the measure, with two Republicans \u2014 Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania \u2014 joining all Democrats in opposing the bill. The Senate passed the legislation, dubbed the \"big, beautiful bill,\" earlier this week.",
      "President Trump plans to sign the bill at a ceremony at the White House on Friday, coinciding with the July 4 holiday.",
      "The vote came after a marathon overnight session that saw GOP leaders overcome internal opposition to advance the bill, paving the way for final passage. Most Republican members who balked at many of the changes the Senate made to the legislation eventually relented and voted to pass it.",
      "Once it became clear that GOP leaders had the votes they needed, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries tried to delay the inevitable by speaking on the floor for 8 hours and 44 minutes, setting the record for the longest House speech in U.S. history. He called out Republicans for the bill's deep cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs, highlighting the Americans who he said would suffer because of the bill.",
      "Johnson touted the legislation's passage after the vote, outlining the long path to passage since the bill was initially dreamt up more than a year ago, while saying it all came down to \"belief.\"",
      "\"We had a vision for what we wanted to do as a group. We believed in the election cycle last fall that we were going to be given this great blessing of unified government,\" Johnson said. \"And we did not want to waste that opportunity.\"",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add $3.4 trillion to federal deficits over the next 10 years and leave millions without health insurance, due to the cuts to Medicaid and programs under the Affordable Care Act. It would also dramatically increase funding for immigration enforcement, a key priority for Republicans and the president.",
      "GOP opposition melts away",
      "The final vote came after House GOP leadership scrambled Wednesday and into the wee hours Thursday to shore up support for the measure ahead of a key procedural vote to approve the rules for debate on the floor.",
      "Although Johnson spent weeks pleading with his Senate counterparts not to make any major changes to the version of the bill that passed the lower chamber by a single vote in May, the Senate made a number of tweaks that irked House members on a number of fronts \u2014 from its cuts to Medicaid to its impact on the deficit. Johnson acknowledged that the Senate bill's changes \"went a little further than many of us would've preferred,\" though he repeatedly urged that the final product was largely what the House had signed off on in May.",
      "The Senate-passed bill included steeper Medicaid cuts, a higher increase in the debt limit and changes to the House bill's green energy policies and the state and local tax deduction that irked many House members. Other controversial provisions that faced pushback in both chambers, including the sale of public lands in nearly a dozen states, a 10-year moratorium on states regulating artificial intelligence and an excise tax on the renewable energy industry, were stripped from the Senate bill before heading back to the House.",
      "Potential holdouts, including moderates and members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, met with Mr. Trump on Wednesday as the White House pressured House Republicans to vote for the bill.",
      "The vote on the key procedural hurdle began around 9:30 p.m. Wednesday and didn't wrap up until about 3:20 a.m. Thursday. Five House Republicans initially voted no on the rule, which would have been enough to tank the vote. But GOP leaders kept the vote open as they worked to shore up support, allowing lawmakers to change from no to yes.",
      "Johnson told reporters that Mr. Trump was \"directly engaged\" with skeptical members to get them onboard.",
      "\"Members wanted to hear certain assurances from him about what's ahead, what the future will entail, and what we're going to do next, and all of that,\" Johnson said. \"And he was very, very helpful in that process.\"",
      "Mr. Trump ramped up the pressure over Truth Social as a handful of Republican holdouts didn't appear to be budging, declaring: \"FOR REPUBLICANS, THIS SHOULD BE AN EASY YES VOTE. RIDICULOUS!!!\"",
      "\"What are the Republicans waiting for??? What are you trying to prove??? MAGA IS NOT HAPPY, AND IT'S COSTING YOU VOTES!!!\" Mr. Trump wrote shortly after midnight.",
      "The House ultimately voted 219 to 213 to advance the bill in a key victory for Republican leaders, who won the support of about a dozen GOP opponents to the rule. And when the vote finally came to an end, Fitzpatrick was the sole Republican opposed. He would also vote against final passage.",
      "Johnson told reporters that the breakthrough came amid help from the president, along with lengthy listening sessions with the bill's opponents, \"making sure that their concerns were addressed.\"",
      "\"A lot of people had to take the time to thoroughly go through the Senate's changes to our bill and that's fine,\" Johnson said. \"That was necessary to get them to yes.\"",
      "Ultimately, only Massie and Fitzpatrick bucked GOP leaders to vote against the legislation. Massie, a conservative, had drawn the ire of the president due to his stance against the bill for weeks. He said in a statement after Thursday's vote that he voted against it \"because it will significantly increase U.S. budget deficits in the near term, negatively impacting all Americans through sustained inflation and high interest rates.\"",
      "Fitzpatrick said that the Senate's changes to the initial House legislation were too drastic for him to support.",
      "\"[I]t was the Senate's amendments to Medicaid, in addition to several other Senate provisions, that altered the analysis for our PA-1 community,\" the Pennsylvania Republican said in a statement, referring to his district. \"The original House language was written in a way that protected our community; the Senate amendments fell short of our standard. I believe in, and will always fight for, policies that are thoughtful, compassionate, and good for our community. It is this standard that will always guide my legislative decisions.\"",

    "summary": "More than half of Americans say they will fly the flag this July 4.",
    "story": [
      "As July 4 nears, here's something a lot of Americans agree on: Many will fly the flag, they will do so out of patriotism, and seeing the flag connotes the same feeling.",
      "Images of the flag have always abounded in politics, of course, but most Americans don't display it themselves to make a political statement \u2014 though they think plenty of others do.",
      "And while we often see an image of the flag emblazoned on everything from caps to clothing, for most, it's not just a fashion statement.",
      "But relatively more feel they've seen the flag used in these contexts, even if they would not do so themselves.",
      "What does the flag communicate?",
      "Most Americans think, in turn, assume a person they see displaying the flag is patriotic.",
      "Most also see it as someone supporting the military.",
      "To most, seeing someone flying the flag does not communicate a person's ideological stance that they can discern.",
      "But for those who do feel they receive an impression, it's more likely they think someone flying the flag is conservative, more so than liberal, and Democrats and Republicans think that at about the same rate.",
      "Maybe they're onto something \u2014 because Americans' reasons and frequency for displaying the flag do, in fact, differ a bit according to their partisanship.",
      "Republicans are relatively more likely to say they've flown a flag themselves to display patriotism, and at times to make a political statement, each more often than Democrats say they have.",
      "The flag and protest",
      "Over the decades, polling has asked whether it should be legal to destroy or burn the flag as a form of protest. Most Americans think that should be against the law. Most also thought so 35 years ago, too. (There are partisan differences on this, with Republicans especially likely to say so.)",
      "And a large majority of Americans say the U.S. flag doesn't have to be displayed solo to signify patriotism \u2014 three-quarters think one can fly the flag of one's country of family heritage, along with the American flag and still be patriotic.",

      "\"Especially by waiving these two things that gets to get that faster, where the truth can come out,\" Boelter said.",
      "Boelter is accused of killing Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, as well as shooting state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette, who survived. He was charged by the U.S. Attorney's Office with two counts of murder, two counts of stalking and two weapons charges.",
      "Boelter\u00a0may face the death penalty if convicted. He also faces state charges, and could face life without parole if convicted.",

      "Boelter, 57,\u00a0appeared in court last Friday, where his defense was granted a motion to move his detention and preliminary hearing. He told the court he hadn't slept in about two weeks and complained of poor conditions at the Sherburne County Jail in Elk River, Minnesota. The Sherburne County sheriff disputed those claims.",

      "A Tennessee man pardoned by President Trump in January for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol will nevertheless serve a life sentence for plotting to attack FBI agents and seeking to incite a \"civil war,\" according to prosecutors.",
      "Edward Kelley, who was the fourth U.S. Capitol rioter to enter the building on Jan. 6, 2021, faced a separate prosecution for targeting federal agents while he was being investigated for his role in the Capitol attack.",
      "The Justice Department argued Kelley created a \"kill list\" of FBI agents and others who investigated his role in the Jan. 6 siege. Prosecutors said Kelley \"distributed this list \u2014 along with videos containing images of certain FBI employees identified on the list \u2014 to a co-conspirator as part of his 'mission.'\"",
      "A jury convicted Kelley of conspiracy charges in November, and a federal judge in the Eastern District of Tennessee sentenced Kelley to life in prison on Tuesday.",
      "Though Kelley was among the more than 1,500 Capitol riot defendants pardoned on January 20, 2025, the pardon did not extend to Kelley's conspiracy case in Tennessee. Last month, prosecutors argued, \"Edward Kelley is remorseless and has shown neither a capacity nor desire to rehabilitate. On the contrary, Kelley not only believes the actions for which he was convicted were justified but that his duty as a self-styled 'patriot' compelled him to target East Tennessee law enforcement for assassination.\"",
      "Prosecutors also said, \"The proof at trial established that Kelley targeted law enforcement because of their anticipated role in the civil war that Kelley hoped to initiate and because of his animus towards those who participated in his May 2022 arrest and search of his home.\"",
      "They argued Kelley viewed \"the FBI as the enemy and, as such, were valid targets in the civil war because they served as the 'eyes and ears' of the government.\"",
      "The Justice Department also said, \"The defendant identified 36 individual federal, state, and local law enforcement personnel to target for assassination. He created a list of his targets which included names, titles, and cell phone numbers.\"",
      "Kelley is one of several Jan. 6 defendants who face prison time in separate criminal cases, including some who have been arrested again after their pardons were issued.",
      "A Florida defendant was arrested later in January 2025 on a gun charge. A Texas defendant who was freed from prison by the Trump pardon was later arrested, suspected of attempted child solicitation.",
      "Kelley's role on Jan. 6, 2021, was distinct. Security camera photos showed he was the fourth person to unlawfully enter the Capitol building at the forefront of the mob and he was accused of being part of a group that assaulted an officer. He was also among the group that confronted lone officer Eugene Goodman outside the U.S. Senate chamber as Senators evacuated to safety.",
      "The Justice Department press release issued Tuesday to announce Kelley's prison sentence did not make a reference to Jan. 6. Prior announcements in his case, from 2022, specified Kelley's alleged role in the Capitol siege.",

      "The Marine Corps is sending about 200 service members to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Florida, in the Trump administration's latest use of the military to boost its immigration operations.",
      "U.S. Northern Command announced the move Thursday, saying the 200 Marines \u2014 from the Marine Wing Support Squadron 272\u00a0based in North Carolina \u2014 mark the \"first wave\" of support for ICE. Last month, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth green-lit up to 700 military personnel to help ICE in Florida, Texas and Louisiana.",
      "The military said the Marines \"will perform strictly non-law enforcement duties within ICE facilities,\" focusing primarily on \"administrative and logistical tasks.\" They are \"prohibited from direct contact with individuals in ICE custody.\"",
      "Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CBS News that the Marines \"will be trained and ready to assist with immigration processing at locations across the state of Florida, consistent with the whole-of-government approach to deliver on President Trump's mandate from the American people to remove public safety threats from American communities.\"",
      "As President Trump aims to crack down on unauthorized border crossings and boost immigration arrests in the interior of the United States, his administration has repeatedly used the military.",
      "Thousands of service members have been deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border to assist with wall construction and border enforcement, and members of the military can temporarily detain migrants in some narrow zones of land along the border before transferring them to immigration officials. As a surge in ICE detentions stretches the agency's capacity, officials have considered converting military bases such as Fort Bliss in Texas into temporary immigration holding facilities, though those plans have not fully materialized.",
      "The administration also sent 700 Marines and approximately 4,000 California National Guard troops to Los Angeles last month, part of an operation to guard ICE agents and federal property after days of protests against the Trump administration's immigration actions in the city.",
      "In one case, Marines in Los Angeles temporarily detained someone who walked onto federal property last month, but released him without charges, The Associated Press reported. The military told The AP that Marines are authorized to briefly detain people in certain circumstances before transferring detainees to civilian police.",
      "The deployment to Los Angeles was controversial. Gov. Gavin Newsom argued the federal government illegally sidestepped him by deploying Guard forces without his permission, and said the presence of the military might further inflame protests that state and local police could handle themselves. The Trump administration argued the deployment was necessary to deter alleged threats against immigration agents.",
      "The state of California sued over the Guard deployment, but a federal appeals court sided with the Trump administration in an early ruling, saying Mr. Trump likely acted within his legal authority.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 There's no filibuster in the House, but Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries essentially conducted one anyway as the House debated President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" before it passed on Thursday.",
      "Jeffries held the House floor for more than eight hours, taking his \"sweet time\" with a marathon floor speech that delayed passage of Republicans' massive tax and spending cuts legislation and gave his minority party a lengthy spotlight to excoriate what he called an \"immoral\" bill.",
      "As Democratic leader, Jeffries can speak for as long as he wants during debate on legislation \u2014 hence its nickname on Capitol Hill, the \"magic minute,\" that lasts as long as leaders are speaking.",
      "He began the speech at 4:53 a.m. ET and finished at 1:37 p.m. ET, 8 hours, 44 minutes later, breaking the record set by then-Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California in 2021, when he was the GOP leader. McCarthy spoke for 8 hours, 32 minutes when he angrily criticized Democrats' \"Build Back Better\" legislation, breaking a record set by Rep. Nancy Pelosi, when she spoke about immigration for 8 hours, 7 minutes in 2018.",
      "\"I feel an obligation, Mr. Speaker, to stand on this House floor and take my sweet time,\" Jeffries said as he opened.",
      "The speech pushed a final vote on Mr. Trump's tax bill, initially expected in the early morning, into the daylight hours. The New York Democrat used the time to criticize the bill's health care and food aid cuts, tax breaks for the wealthy and rollbacks to renewable energy programs, among other parts of the bill that Democrats decry.",
      "He also killed time by riffing on hip-hop, King George III and his own life story, among other diversions. He called out Republicans who have voiced concerns about the bill, read stories from people concerned about their health care from those GOP lawmakers' districts and praised his own members, some of whom sat behind him and cheered, clapped, laughed and joined hands.",
      "\"This reckless Republican budget is an immoral document, and that is why I stand here on the floor of the House of Representatives with my colleagues in the House Democratic caucus to stand up and push back against it with everything we have,\" Jeffries said.",
      "He ended the speech in the cadence of a Sunday sermon, with most of the Democratic caucus in a tight huddle around him. One colleague called out, \"Bring it home, Hakeem!\"",
      "\"We don't work for President Donald Trump,\" Jeffries said, as a handful of Republicans across the aisle sat silent and occasionally snickered at the leader as he kept talking.",
      "He invoked the late John Lewis, a civil rights activist in the 1960s and longtime Democratic congressman from Georgia. \"Get into good trouble, necessary trouble,\" Jeffries said. \"We're going to press on until victory is won.\"",
      "Jeffries sneaked small bites of food and drank liquids to boost his energy, but did not leave the chamber or his podium. The speech would be over if he did.",
      "Democrats were powerless to stop the huge bill, which Republicans passed by using an obscure budget procedure that bypasses the Senate filibuster. So they were using the powers they did have, mostly to delay. In the Senate, Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York forced Senate clerks to read the bill for almost 16 hours over the weekend.",
      "Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey similarly gained attention in April when he spoke for more than 25 hours on the Senate floor about the first months of Mr. Trump's presidency and broke the record for the longest continuous Senate floor speech in the chamber's history. Booker was assisted by fellow Democrats who gave him a break from speaking by asking him questions on the Senate floor, but Jeffries' \"magic minute\" did not allow for any interaction with other members.",
      "Republicans who were sitting on the floor when Jeffries started trickled out, leaving half the chamber empty. When the speech was over, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, a Republican of Missouri, called it \"a bunch of hogwash.\"",
      "The speech \"will not change the outcome that you will see very shortly,\" Smith said.",
      "After the bill passed, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said that Democrats \"wanted to speak for hours and hours and break records because they wanted to stand in the way of history.\"",

    "summary": "The FDA's Dr. Vinay Prasad said that he disagreed with the agency's career vaccine reviewers about COVID shot approvals.",
    "story": [
      "Top-ranking Food and Drug Administration officials picked by the Trump administration under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. overrode career staff at the agency to limit the approvals of COVID-19 shots from Novavax and Moderna, according to records released by the FDA.",
      "In a memorandum following Novavax's approval in May, which narrowed the shot's label to only seniors ages 65 and older and others at-risk of severe disease, the FDA's Dr. Vinay Prasad said that he disagreed with the agency's career vaccine reviewers.",
      "Prasad was named earlier this year to replace Dr. Peter Marks, the longtime head of the agency's center regulating vaccines and other biologics, who was ousted under Kennedy. Prasad was later elevated to the FDA's chief medical and scientific officer as well, absorbing the roles of other top-ranking FDA officials who were removed or left under the Trump administration.",
      "Novavax had applied for a license for its shot to prevent COVID-19 for anyone over 12 years old, effectively converting it to a traditional approval from the emergency use authorizations the FDA had granted to the vaccine during the pandemic to allow its use at the time.",
      "Prasad wrote that he questioned the data submitted by Novavax, said COVID-19's risk of severe disease had dropped in the U.S. population, and cited safety concerns that he said \"fundamentally alters the benefit-risk calculation in non-high-risk individuals.\"",
      "\"The decrease in the chance of developing severe COVID-19, means that the potential for absolute benefit from vaccination has simultaneously decreased. Even rare vaccination-related harms, both known and unknown, now have a higher chance of outweighing potential benefits in non-high-risk populations,\" Prasad wrote.",
      "A separate memo released by the agency from Captain Edward Wolfgang, chair of the review team for Novavax's shot, said the changes for who should be approved to get the vaccine followed requests by Prasad and the special assistant to the FDA commissioner.",
      "The agency's career scientists had initially concluded on April 1 that Novavax's data submitted in its Biologics License Application, or BLA, and COVID-19's ongoing public health threat warranted broad approval for use in everyone ages 12 and older.",
      "\"The data submitted with this BLA indicate the safety and efficacy of a single dose of Nuvaxovid (2024-2025 Formula) meet the statutory requirements to support its use in individuals 12 years of age and older to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2,\" they concluded.",
      "Documents released last month about the approval of Moderna's new COVID-19 vaccine for only seniors ages 65 and older and others with at least one underlying condition down to age 12 outline a rationale similar to the one Prasad used in his decision about the Novavax shot.",
      "\"The review team has done a commendable job in summarizing and analyzing the submission to date. Nevertheless, I disagree with certain aspects of their conclusions and instead reach the conclusion described below,\" Prasad wrote in his memo for Moderna's approval, dated May 30 and titled \"CENTER DIRECTOR OVERRIDE MEMO.\"",
      "The New York Times previously reported that the FDA had released the documents. Trade publication Pink Sheet previously reported that Prasad and his aides had blocked agency plans to grant a broad license for Novavax's vaccine, delaying its approval.",
      "Under Marks, Prasad's predecessor, it was uncommon but not unheard of for the head of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research to intervene in the decisions to green-light vaccines. But it is virtually unprecedented for the FDA commissioner or his political appointees to step in to directly intervene or question traditional approval decisions, FDA officials have said.",
      "\"The tradition in 99.95% of FDA decisions about individual products is that those decisions are made by career civil servants. The commissioner actually has no role in that, unless there's an internal dissent and an appeal, or in some cases, an external appeal that makes it all the way up to the commissioner level,\" Dr. Robert Califf, then the FDA commissioner under the Biden administration, had said at an event last year.",
      "In past criticism of the agency, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary has often cited a move by Marks to green-light booster shots during the COVID-19 pandemic that led to the ouster of two top career vaccines officials, who questioned the decision. One of those former FDA officials \u2014 Dr. Phil Krause \u2014 is also now criticizing moves by Makary and his aides as threatening to erode the agency's credibility.",
      "Agency leaders under Kennedy have made other unprecedented moves in recent months to wrest control over the nation's vaccines process.",
      "Months before Kennedy fired the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's influential vaccine advisory committee and replaced them with his own picks, the FDA replaced the career official who usually works as liaisons to the CDC panel with Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg.",
      "Hoeg is the special assistant to the FDA commissioner. Along with Makary, Hoeg questioned the agency's approach to approving vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which has largely replaced the agency's career media relations staff who were mostly laid off in April, rejected the characterization of Prasad overruling FDA scientists as \"a distortion of the facts.\"",
      "\"He evaluated the totality of the evidence and made a judgment rooted in gold standard science. That's not political \u2014 it's what principled leadership looks like,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The spokesperson said the FDA \"will continue to follow the science and use evidence-based decision-making,\" echoing frustrations voiced by Prasad and others picked by Kennedy about using long COVID to justify vaccine approvals, backing boosters for healthy young adults and the desire to bring U.S. vaccine policy in line with other countries.",
      "Makary and Prasad also made this argument in May, after they announced a new \"framework\" that would limit all COVID-19 vaccine approvals to only seniors and others at-risk, unless vaccine makers were able to generate new clinical trial data.",
      "\"Dr. Prasad is correcting course with data, with transparency, and with the courage to say what others won't. That's how trust in science is rebuilt,\" the HHS spokesperson said.",
      "The FDA's approvals decide whether vaccinemakers are allowed to sell their shots in the U.S. market at all. Those approvals are usually followed by CDC recommendations on how they should be used, which are influential because they are tied to federal policies that enable access to vaccines, like guaranteeing insurance coverage.",
      "Health care providers are also allowed to give vaccines \"off-label\" outside of the FDA's label and CDC recommendations, once the FDA has approved sales, though that risks running afoul of insurance coverage and liability protections.",

      "Delgado, who has investigated more than 100 shipwrecks globally, gained international attention in 2019 when he discovered the Clotilda, the last known slave ship to arrive in the United States. The discovery was later featured in a \"60 Minutes\" segment with Anderson Cooper.",
      "The archaeologist's fascination with shipwrecks began in childhood while growing up in the San Francisco Bay area, where he learned about ships from the 1849 Gold Rush. He said locating shipwrecks requires extensive preparation.",
      "\"It takes a team. And that team includes oceanographers, people that understand currents. We're also looking at old records and charts. You're also trying to understand the forensics of it,\" he said.",
      "The process involves analyzing factors like ship speed and sailing patterns. Once located, the wrecks often don't match popular expectations.",

      "\"I think the most important thing for people to remember about shipwrecks is that it's okay for them to have different meanings,\" Delgado said. \"Some people like them because they inspire you with the stories of bravery.

      "\"There it was looming out of the darkness,\" he recalled. \"This massive hull rising twice as high as the ceiling here. Still painted but streaked with rust and rusticles that are orange and yellow and red. And then a porthole that's open and another closed.\"",
      "Delgado described one particularly eerie moment: \"One of the spookiest moments \u2014 because 'Titanic' is a ship of the dead \u2014 is when I first looked through the porthole, 2.5 miles down, the lights \u2014 I could see a face looking back at me in the porthole. It was my own reflection.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. government is preparing to breed billions of flies and dump them out of airplanes over Mexico and southern Texas to fight a flesh-eating maggot.",
      "That sounds like the plot of a horror movie, but it is part of the government's plans for protecting the U.S. from a bug that could devastate its beef industry, decimate wildlife and even kill household pets. This weird science has worked well before.",
      "\"It's an exceptionally good technology,\" said Edwin Burgess, an assistant professor at the University of Florida who studies parasites in animals, particularly livestock. \"It's an all-time great in terms of translating science to solve some kind of large problem.\"",
      "The targeted pest is the flesh-eating larva of\u00a0the New World Screwworm fly.\u00a0The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to ramp up the breeding and distribution of adult male flies \u2014 sterilizing them with radiation before releasing them. They mate with females in the wild, and the eggs laid by the female aren't fertilized and don't hatch. There are fewer larvae, and over time, the fly population dies out.",
      "It is more effective and environmentally friendly than spraying the pest into oblivion, and it is how the U.S. and other nations north of Panama eradicated the same pest decades ago. Sterile flies from a factory in Panama kept the flies contained there for years, but the pest appeared in southern Mexico late last year.",
      "The USDA expects a new screwworm fly factory to be up and running in southern Mexico by July 2026. It plans to open a fly distribution center in southern Texas by the end of the year so that it can import and distribute flies from Panama if necessary.",
      "The scientific name for the parasite, Cochliomyia hominivorax, is roughly translated to \"man-eater,\" according to the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.",
      "\"When NWS fly larvae (maggots) burrow into the flesh of a living animal, they cause serious, often deadly damage to the animal,\" the\u00a0USDA\u00a0says. \"NWS can infest livestock, pets, wildlife, occasionally birds and, in rare cases, people.\"",
      "Threats to the beef industry",
      "Most fly larvae feed on dead flesh, making the New World screwworm fly and its Old World counterpart in Asia and Africa outliers \u2014 and for the American beef industry, a serious threat. Females lay their eggs in wounds and, sometimes, exposed mucus.",
      "\"A thousand-pound bovine can be dead from this in two weeks,\" said Michael Bailey, president elect of the American Veterinary Medicine Association.",
      "Veterinarians have effective treatments for infested animals, but an infestation can still be unpleasant \u2014 and cripple an animal with pain.",
      "Don Hineman, a retired western Kansas rancher, recalled infected cattle as a youngster on his family's farm.",
      "\"It smelled nasty,\" he said. \"Like rotting meat.\"",
      "Scientists plan to use the fly's biology against it",
      "The New World screwworm fly is a tropical species, unable to survive Midwestern or Great Plains winters, so it was a seasonal scourge. Still, the U.S. and Mexico bred and released more than 94 billion sterile flies from 1962 through 1975 to eradicate the pest, according to the USDA.",
      "The numbers need to be large enough that females in the wild can't help but hook up with sterile males for mating.",
      "One biological trait gives fly fighters a crucial wing up: Females mate only once in their weekslong adult lives.",
      "Why does the U.S. want to breed more flies?",
      "Alarmed about the fly's migration north, the U.S. temporarily closed its southern border in May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison and it won't be fully open again at least until mid-September.",
      "But female flies can lay their eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal, and that includes humans.",
      "Decades ago, the U.S. had fly factories in Florida and Texas, but they closed as the pest was eradicated.",
      "The Panama fly factory can breed up to 117 million a week, but the USDA wants the capacity to breed at least 400 million a week. It plans to spend $8.5 million on the Texas site and $21 million to convert a facility in southern Mexico for breeding sterile fruit flies into one for screwworm flies.",
      "Raising hundreds of millions of flies",
      "In one sense, raising a large colony of flies is relatively easy, said Cassandra Olds, an assistant professor of entomology at Kansas State University.",
      "But, she added, \"You've got to give the female the cues that she needs to lay her eggs, and then the larvae have to have enough nutrients.\"",
      "Fly factories once fed larvae horse meat and honey and then moved to a mix of dried eggs and either honey or molasses, according to past USDA research. Later, the Panama factory used a mix that included egg powder and red blood cells and plasma from cattle.",
      "In the wild, larvae ready for the equivalent of a butterfly's cocoon stage drop off their hosts and onto the ground, burrow just below the surface and grow to adulthood inside a protective casing making them resemble a dark brown Tic Tac mint. In the Panama factory, workers drop them into trays of sawdust.",
      "Security is an issue. Sonja Swiger, an entomologist with Texas A&M University's Extension Service, said a breeding facility must prevent any fertile adults kept for breeding stock from escaping.",
      "Risks associated with dropping flies from an airplane",
      "Dropping flies from the air can be dangerous. Last month, a plane freeing sterile flies crashed near Mexico's border with Guatemala, killing three people.",
      "In test runs in the 1950s, according to the USDA, scientists put the flies in paper cups and then dropped the cups out of planes using special chutes. Later, they loaded them into boxes with a machine known as a \"Whiz Packer.\"",
      "The method is still much the same: Light planes with crates of flies drop those crates.",
      "Burgess called the development of sterile fly breeding and distribution in the 1950s and 1960s one of the USDA's \"crowning achievements.\"",
      "Some agriculture officials argue now that new factories shouldn't be shuttered after another successful fight.",
      "\"Something we think we have complete control over \u2014 and we have declared a triumph and victory over \u2014 can always rear its ugly head again,\" Burgess said.",

    "summary": "A satellite program that has historically been a key source of weather forecasting data will be discontinued no later than July 31, according to a message posted by NOAA.",
    "story": [
      "A satellite program that has historically been a key source of weather forecasting data will be discontinued by July 31, as the United States enters peak hurricane season, according to the already resource-strapped National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "The federal agency, which includes the National Weather Service, initially said last week that it was going to lose access to the satellite data by June 30. But in an update\u00a0posted online on Monday, NOAA said the deadline to decommission the satellite system was pushed to July 31, at the request of a top official at NASA.",
      "Operated by the U.S. Department of Defense, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program has since the 1960s collected environmental information each day from satellites orbiting Earth, in order to provide real-time details about conditions in the atmosphere and oceans to the military. The data was made available to weather scientists for traditional forecasting purposes, after being processed by a branch of the Navy that focuses on meteorology and oceanography.",
      "Starting Aug. 1, that naval branch will no longer process or upload satellite data to the computing interface where meteorologists previously accessed it, according to NOAA.",
      "In an email that the agency reposted online, the deputy director of its Office of Satellite and Product Operations said the Navy decided to implement that change in efforts \"to mitigate a significant cybersecurity risk\" but would continue to distribute the data through the end of next month. A Navy spokesperson told CBS News in an email that it is \"discontinuing contributions\" to the satellite program \"given the program no longer meets our information technology modernization requirements.\"",
      "NOAA spokesperson Kim Doster called it a \"routine process of data rotation and replacement\" in a statement to CBS News on Monday, adding that remaining data sources remaining \"are fully capable of providing a complete suite of cutting-edge data and models that ensure the gold-standard weather forecasting the American people deserve.\"",
      "\"The DMSP is a single dataset in a robust suite of hurricane forecasting and modeling tools in the NWS portfolio,\" said Doster, citing several other satellites that feed into the National Weather Service's forecasting models, including one launched recently that,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Space Force, \"advances weather monitoring.\"",
      "The data cutoff from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program comes after NOAA lost a substantial chunk of its staff to layoffs and buyouts earlier this year, stemming from President Trump's initiative to reduce government spending in part by shrinking the federal workforce.",
      "Former NOAA administrator Rick Spinrad, who served in that role during the Biden administration, told CBS News in an email that \"there's no logical explanation\" for the cutoff, \"other than some downstream benefit to the private sector\" \u2014 which would align with goals outlined in Project 2025 to move toward privatizing NOAA and the Weather Service. Losing that data puts the agency's current capabilities at risk, Spinrad said, especially during hurricane season.",
      "\"NWS is working feverishly to start using other data from a satellite DoD launched last year,\" he added. \"This is ill-timed, poorly planned, and dangerous.\"",
      "Hurricane season runs through Nov. 30, and NOAA forecasters said in May that they expected this one to be more active than an average year. The season typically reaches its \"peak,\" its most active period, around August and September.",

That's about three miles higher than the internationally recognized boundary between the discernible atmosphere and space.",
      "The capsule then began falling back to Earth and the passengers returned to their seats for the descent to touchdown. The reusable booster, meanwhile, made its own return to the launch site, dropping tail first to a rocket-powered touchdown.",

    "story": [
      "Dozens of people are dead in central Texas in what officials called a \"mass casualty event\" after devastating flash floods slammed Hill Country, with water rescues taking place along the Guadalupe River. While officials couldn't confirm an exact number of those who remain unaccounted for, they said between 23 and 25 people were still missing from Camp Mystic, a children's summer camp.",
      "At least 27 fatalities have been reported so far, Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said in an email Saturday morning. The dead include 18 adults and 9 children. Six of the adults and one child remain unidentified, Leitha said. Officials have conducted more than 160 air rescues, Leitha said. In total, 850 uninjured and 8 injured people have been rescued as of Saturday, he said.",
      "Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said in a news briefing on Friday that there hadn't been \"a drop of rain until the tragedy struck\" earlier in the day, and that the Guadalupe River had risen about 26 feet in 45 minutes. An alert went out around 4 and 5 a.m. local time, he said. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and several other officials also appeared at the news conference.",
      "Speaking to reporters late Friday night aboard Air Force One, President Trump called the floods a \"terrible thing.\"",
      "On Saturday, Mr. Trump said his administration was working with state and local officials and that Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem would be arriving in Texas shortly. DHS oversees the Federal Emergency Management Agency.",
      "\"Melania and I are praying for all the families impacted by this horrible tragedy,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"Our Brave First Responders are on site doing what they do best. GOD BLESS THE FAMILIES, AND GOD BLESS TEXAS!\"",
      "How did the Guadalupe River flood so quickly?",
      "Dalton Rice, city manager for Kerrville, explained how the Guadalupe River flooded so quickly.",
      "\"When you look at the headwaters of the Guadalupe... there's a north and a south fork,\" Rice said Friday night. \"Since 1987, under normal conditions, if you can call it that, you'll hit water in one of those areas, and those two forks will converge into the Guadalupe, which comes through the city of Kerrville.\"",
      "\"This rain event sat on top of that and dumped more rain than what was forecasted on both of those forks,\" Rice continued. \"When we got the report, it was about 7 feet or so on the south fork, and within a matter of minutes it was up to 29 feet, and all of that converged at Guadalupe.\"",
      "The Guadalupe River at Hunt reached its second-highest height on record, higher than the famous 1987 flood,\u00a0the city said, citing the National Weather Service.",
      "The Texas Division of Emergency Management had multiple meetings since Thursday to prepare, but the National Weather Service \"did not predict the amount of rain that we saw,\" officials said, adding that the original estimate was up to 8 inches of rain.",
      "Officials said they were still concerned about the weather, adding that \"if you do not live in area, do not come.\"",
      "Kerr County judge Rob Kelly said the area does \"not have a warning system\" and said that authorities were shocked by the ferocity of the floods.",
      "\"We had no reason to believe that this was gonna be any, anything like what's happened here. None whatsoever,\" Kelly told CBS Evening News.",
      "Texas issued flash flood emergencies in five counties in West Texas on Friday as Hill Country continued to be slammed by severe rain and flooding. Between 5 and 11 inches of rain have fallen in northwestern Bandera County, Central Kerr County, Northeastern Tom Green County, East Central Kerr County and West Central Kendall County,\u00a0according\u00a0to the National Weather Service.",
      "Search and rescue operations are ongoing",
      "There are hundreds of people on the ground from various units helping with search and rescue operations, officials said, which include drones and helicopters.",
      "\"We brought in over 100 troopers this morning,\" Col. Freeman Martin, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, said during Friday night's news briefing. \"And they've worked all day, rescues, high water vehicles, boats, rescue divers, seven rescue helicopters with hoist capabilities.\"",
      "The governor signed a disaster declaration for several counties during the news conference Friday night, saying it \"ensures all the counties will have access to every tool, strategy, personnel that the state of Texas can provide to them, which will be limitless.\"",
      "\"We will stop at nothing to ensure that every asset and person and plane, whatever is needed, is going to be involved in the process of rescuing every last person and ensure everybody involved in this is going to be fully accounted for,\" Abbott said.",
      "Earlier Friday, Abbott asked that Texas residents \"heed guidance from state and local officials and monitor local forecasts to avoid driving into flooded areas.\"",
      "Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u00a0said\u00a0in a statement posted to social media that he had spoken to Mr. Trump, as well as other state officials.",
      "\"President Trump committed ANYTHING Texas needs,\" Cruz said.",
      "Lorena Gullen, who owns a restaurant right next to an RV park that was affected by the floods, said \"raging water\" swept away vehicles, some with people still inside. Residents at the park had been celebrating the Fourth of July.",
      "\"You could also see vehicles coming from up the river with the lights on and hear somebody honking, and they were washiing away but they kept going,\" she told CBS Evening News. \"It was impossible.\"",
      "\"Between 23 to 25\" people still missing from Camp Mystic",
      "\"We don't have an estimate\" on how many people are missing, Sheriff Leitha said Friday night, adding that somewhere \"between 23 and 25\" campers were still believed to be missing from Camp Mystic.",
      "Earlier Friday, Patrick addressed parents of children at Camp Mystic, where there were about 750 children at summer camp when the floods hit. The lieutenant governor, who was acting as governor while Abbott was on vacation, said they are praying for all those missing \"to be found alive.\"",
      "\"If they are alive and safe, we will find them and bring them home to you,\" Patrick said during an afternoon news conference.",
      "The camp said in a statement, read by Patrick, that there has been a \"catastrophic level\" of flooding.",
      "Patrick said Camp Mystic is an all-girls summer camp in the area that has several camps with thousands of children attending for the summer. The camp said they have no power, no water and no Wi-Fi , adding that \"the highway has washed away, so we are struggling to get more help.\"",
      "\"Please pray for everyone in the Hill Country, especially Camp Mystic,\" Cruz said in his social media statement.",
      "The summer camp sits on a strip known as \"flash flood alley,\" Austin Dickson, the CEO of the Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country, told the Associated Press. The foundation is a charitable endowment that is collecting donations to help nonprofits responding to the disaster.",
      "\"When it rains, water doesn't soak into the soil,\" Dickson said. \"It rushes down the hill.\"",
      "13-year-old Elinor Lester told the Associated Press that she and her cabinmates were evacuated by helicopter. Her cabin was on elevated ground, but younger campers bunk in cabins situated along the riverbank, she said. Those were the first to flood. Younger campers came up the hill for shelter.",
      "\"The camp was completely destroyed,\" she told the Associated Press. \"It was really scary. Everyone I know personally is accounted for, but there are people missing that I know of and we don't know where they are.\"",
      "Her mother, Elizabeth Lester, told the Associated Press her son was at Camp La Junta, a nearby summer camp, and also survived after a counselor woke up, saw rising water and helped the boys swim out through a window.\u00a0Camp La Junta and another camp on the river,\u00a0Camp Waldemar, said in Instagram posts that all campers and staff there were safe.",
      "\"My kids are safe, but knowing others are still missing is just eating me alive,\" Elizabeth Lester told the Associated Press.",

    "published": "Fri, 04 Jul 2025 20:17:26 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump pushed to eliminate taxes on Social Security. Does his \"one big, beautiful bill\" deliver?",
    "story": [
      "As Congress was approving President Trump's\u00a0\"big, beautiful bill\" on Thursday, the Social Security Administration touted the legislation by stating that it \"eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most beneficiaries.\"",
      "That claim, which echoes\u00a0previous promises by Mr. Trump to remove taxes on Social Security, may have come as welcome news for the millions of older and disabled people who depend on the program for income. So does the bill deliver? Not entirely.",
      "In a press release, SSA said that the tax and spending package, which the president is set to sign into law on Friday, \"ensures that nearly 90% of Social Security beneficiaries will no longer pay federal income taxes on their benefits.\"",
      "That figure draws on a June\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the White House's Council of Economic Advisers that said 88% of seniors \u2014 or 51.4 million people \u2014 on Social Security will pay no tax on their payments under the measure because their deductions would exceed their taxable benefits.",
      "The bill \"includes the largest tax break in American history for our nation's seniors,\" CEA said, adding that \"the deductions ensure that seniors who earned their Social Security through years of hard work get more money back in their pockets.\"",
      "Yet while it's true that the bill offers fresh tax relief for some people on Social Security, it is misleading to suggest that the measure does away with taxes on Social Security benefits, policy experts told CBS MoneyWatch. Rather, the bill offers relief by creating a new \"bonus\" tax deduction for beneficiaries.",
      "\"While the deduction does provide some relief for seniors, it's far from completely repealing the tax on their benefits,\" Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C., think tank, told The Associated Press this week ahead of Congress approving the bill.",
      "The Social Security Administration did not respond to a request for comment. The White House declined to comment.",
      "How does the \"big, beautiful bill\" impact Social Security?",
      "The bill doesn't eliminate taxes on Social Security, but rather introduces a temporary deduction that beneficiaries can claim to lower their federal income tax. Notably, that deduction applies to all of a senior's income \u2014 not just to Social Security benefits.",
      "Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS MoneyWatch the bill doesn't change the taxation of Social Security benefits. Eliminating taxes on Social Security under the bill was impossible because of a congressional restriction (dubbed the Byrd Rule\u00a0after late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd) that limits what the Senate can include in a reconciliation bill like the Republican budget measure.",
      "What the bill does do is provide a temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older. The tax break is available to people with an adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 or less and $150,000 or less for couples filing jointly. The deduction is set to expire at the end of 2028.",
      "\"Each spouse can take the deduction, for a total of $12,000, if both are 65-plus,\" AARP explains in its analysis of the budget bill. The deduction phases out for people who earn above those amounts.",
      "Social Security recipients under 65 and people above the specified income thresholds are ineligible to claim the new tax deduction. It also won't benefit the many low-income seniors who already pay no federal income tax because they earn too little.",
      "\"Boosting the amount that you get to write off when you already get to write off everything does not help you at all,\" Kogan said.",
      "The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan policy research group, said in a June\u00a0report\u00a0that exempting Social Security benefits from taxation would not change the after-tax income for the bottom 20% of taxpayers, noting that \"those taxpayers are already exempt from taxation on their Social Security benefits.\"",
      "The biggest beneficiaries of the bill will be higher-income seniors, said Martha Shedden, president and co-founder of the National Association of Registered Social Security Analysts, which focuses on Social Security education.",
      "\"The people who benefit by definition have to be richer, and people who benefit the most are the richest people,\" Kogan added.",
      "More pressure on Social Security?",
      "Providing a temporary tax deduction is likely to help some Social Security recipients, but it could also worsen the retirement program's fragile financial state, Kogan said. Social Security is on track to\u00a0deplete its trust fund by 2034 if Congress does not take action.",
      "\"We already have a problem of not enough money going into the trust fund. This bill makes even less money go into the trust fund,\" he said.",
      "The Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania think tank that studies fiscal issues, estimates that eliminating income taxes on Social Security benefits would lower federal revenue by $1.5 trillion over 10 years and increase the federal debt by 7%\u00a0 by 2054.",
      "As the debate continues over how to shore up Social Security while offering tax relief to older Americans, one thing is clear, and perhaps politically unpalatable: cutting benefits. According to a AARP-funded survey from the National Academy of Social Insurance released in January, 85% of Americans think benefits should not be reduced, or that they should be increased, even if it means raising taxes on some or all Americans.",
      "\"Virtually all Americans want their Social Security benefits to be preserved and are willing to do what it takes to ensure the program continues to provide meaningful support for future generations,\" said AARP Chief Public Policy Officer Deb Whitman in a statement after the survey was released.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to deport a group of migrants with criminal records held at a U.S. base in Djibouti; the administration says they'll be sent to South Sudan.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday cleared the way for the Trump administration to deport a group of migrants with criminal records held at a U.S. naval base in Djibouti, clarifying the scope of its earlier order that lifted restrictions on removals to countries that are not deportees' places of origin.",
      "Shortly after the ruling, Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin announced, \"these sickos will be in South Sudan by Independence Day,\" calling it a \"win for the rule of law.\"",
      "In a social media post Thursday evening in response to the ruling, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote, \"Yet another rogue district court judge has been rebuked by the Supreme Court thanks to the tireless work of dedicated DOJ attorneys. @POTUS will continue to exercise his full authority to remove killers and violent criminal illegal aliens from our country.\"",
      "The high court's follow-up ruling came after it paused a federal judge's April injunction that prevented the Trump administration from deporting migrants to so-called third countries without first giving them notice of the destination and a chance to contest their deportation there by raising fears of torture, persecution or death.",
      "Soon after that order by the Supreme Court last month, U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy of Massachusetts said that a decision he issued in May requiring the Trump administration to provide interviews with U.S. asylum officers to the men detained in Djibouti before removing them to South Sudan remained \"in full force and effect.\"",
      "Those men \u2014 who hail from Latin America and Asia, and have been convicted of serious crimes in the U.S. \u2014 have been held at the Djibouti base for weeks after Murphy ordered the Department of Homeland Security to retain custody of them. The Trump administration has described deplorable and dangerous conditions faced by the personnel sent to guard the men in Djibouti, including concerns about malaria, rocket attacks, inadequate security protocols and triple-digit outdoor temperatures.",
      "Murphy issued his order in May after finding that the Trump administration violated his initial injunction when it attempted to swiftly remove the migrants to South Sudan with less than 24 hours' notice and no chance to raise fear-based claims. The world's youngest country, South Sudan remains plagued by violence and political instability, with the State Department warning Americans not to travel there.",
      "According to the Justice Department, the State Department has received \"credible diplomatic assurances\" from South Sudan that the migrants will not be subject to torture.",
      "The Supreme Court on Thursday said Murphy's May order \"cannot now be used to enforce an injunction that our stay rendered unenforceable,\" referring to the April injunction from Murphy that the high court paused last month. Justice Elena Kagan wrote in a concurring statement that, while she opposed the Supreme Court's initial pause, \"I do not see how a district court can compel compliance with an order that this Court has stayed.\"",
      "In a dissent that was joined by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the high court's majority was effectively allowing the Trump administration to pursue \"unlawful ends,\" expressing concern about the safety of the deportees.",
      "\"What the Government wants to do, concretely, is send the eight noncitizens it illegally removed from the United States from Djibouti to South Sudan, where they will be turned over to the local authorities without regard for the likelihood that they will face torture or death,\" Sotomayor wrote.",
      "On Friday, U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss of the District of Columbia briefly paused the deportation of the eight men to South Sudan, issuing an administrative stay in response to a last-ditch emergency motion filed by their attorneys.",
      "However, in a subsequent hearing later Friday, Moss said he would allow his stay to expire at 4:30 p.m. ET. He also said he would transfer the case back to Judge Murphy.",
      "Murphy subsequently denied the migrants' request to block the deportation, writing in his order Friday: \"This Court interprets these Supreme Court orders as binding on this new petition, as Petitioners are now raising substantially similar claims, and therefore Petitioners motion is denied.\"",
      "The deportation flight to South Sudan had been scheduled to depart from Djibouti at 7 p.m. ET, the Justice Department told Moss during the earlier hearing. It was unclear on Friday night if it departed at that time.",
      "The legal fight",
      "The Supreme Court's original order last month was a significant legal victory for President Trump and his mass deportation campaign. As part of that effort, administration officials have sought to convince countries around the globe, including in far-flung parts of Africa, to accept deportees who are not their citizens. Several countries \u2014 including El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama and Kosovo \u2014 have already agreed to host migrants from other nations who have been deported from the U.S.",
      "The high court's decision in June was unsigned and did not contain any reasoning, prompting questions as to whether the Trump administration could move to deport the migrants being held in Djibouti to South Sudan, as it was initially trying to do. The three liberal justices \u2014 Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson \u2014 dissented.",
      "After Murphy clarified that the Department of Homeland Security could not yet remove the men without first providing them additional process, Solicitor General D. John Sauer sought further word from the justices.",
      "Sauer, who represents the government before the court, argued that the justice's decision meant there is no injunction in place barring the deportation of the migrants in Djibouti. Murphy's ruling, he wrote, \"is a lawless act of defiance that, once again, disrupts sensitive diplomatic relations and slams the brakes on the executive's lawful efforts to effectuate third-country removals.\"",
      "\"This court should immediately make clear that the district court's enforcement order has no effect, and put a swift end to the ongoing irreparable harm to the executive branch and its agents, who remain under baseless threat of contempt as they are forced to house dangerous criminal aliens at a military base in the Horn of Africa that now lies on the borders of a regional conflict,\" Sauer said.",
      "Immigration attorneys disagreed and told the Supreme Court in a filing that Murphy's May order \"is the only shield that preserves and protects their statutory, regulatory, and due process rights to seek protection from torture in South Sudan.\"",
      "They said that the judge's order requiring the government to retain custody of the eight deportees and provide them reasonable-fear interviews was simply a remedy that was issued to address the Trump administration's violation of his injunction.",
      "Plus, the immigration attorneys said that when the Justice Department first sought the Supreme Court's intervention to resume third-country deportations, it did not seek relief from that follow-up order regarding the attempted removals to South Sudan.",
      "\"Because the district court's remedial order is not before the court, it remains in effect,\" they argued. \"Any other conclusion would reward the government's defiance of the district court's orders.\"",
      "The back-and-forth over the third country removals before the Supreme Court has played out on its emergency docket, where the Trump administration has requested relief while legal proceedings play out. Decisions on those requests are typically made only with written briefing and no oral argument, and the court's decisions often do not include its reasoning or how its members voted.",
      "The Trump administration has filed more than a dozen emergency appeals with the Supreme Court, many arising from its efforts to curtail illegal immigration into the U.S. The high court has allowed the government to end two programs protecting nearly 1 million migrants from deportation while the challenges move forward.",
      "But it has also said that migrants facing swift deportation under a 1798 law known as the Alien Enemies Act must receive notice and an opportunity to challenge their removals in court.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's promise to eliminate federal income tax on worker tips will become a reality Friday when he signs the\u00a0massive budget package\u00a0into law.",
      "After narrowly squeaking through the House\u00a0on Thursday, the \"big, beautiful bill\" now heads to the president's desk for his signature. As part of the legislation, workers who rely on tips for a large share of their income, such as waiters, bartenders and hairdressers, will see relief from federal income tax on those tips.",
      "The White House has framed the tax cuts as a win for the working class. But critics such as the Independent Restaurant Coalition have pushed back on that notion, saying the benefits for tipped workers would be temporary and that this apparent tax cut wouldn't help most low-wage workers.",
      "How does \"no tax on tips\" work?",
      "The \"no tax on tips\" provision in the spending bill creates a new deduction for tipped workers, eliminating what they owe in federal income tax. Tipped workers still have to pay state and local income tax and payroll taxes.",
      "The House and Senate versions\u00a0of the tax and spending bill vary on a few key points, including how much a worker could claim in deductions. The Senate proposal limits that deduction to $25,000, while the House version is uncapped.",
      "Under the House measure, meanwhile, only people with annual income of $160,000 or less would qualify for the tipping tax break, while the Senate version would phase out benefits for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000 or couples whose income exceeds $300,000.",
      "Notably, however, under the budget bill those tip tax cuts would extend only through 2028, and so Congress could restrict or even abolish the tax break in future.",
      "Who benefits?",
      "A May\u00a0report\u00a0from the White House's Council of Economic Advisers estimates that eliminating taxes on tips for eligible workers would increase their average take-home pay by $1,675 per year.",
      "According to the White House, a June survey found that 83% of hourly workers support eliminating taxes on tips. \"These results suggest that any measure increasing the amount of immediately available income \u2014 such as untaxed tips \u2014 would provide meaningful, stabilizing support for a large segment of the hourly workforce,\" according to that report.",
      "Data\u00a0from the Yale Budget Lab shows that roughly 4 million people \u2014 2.5% of the American workforce \u2014 worked in tipped jobs as of 2023. But given the way the budget bill is written, not all will necessarily benefit. The nonpartisan policy research center notes in a recent\u00a0analysis that over a third of tipped workers in the U.S. are already exempt from federal income tax because their earnings are too low.",
      "\"A deduction for tipped work is actually a pretty horrible way to help low-wage workers,\" Ernie Tedeschi, the director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You're only helping a narrow slice of them, and it's not helping the lowest of low-wage workers because they don't have any federal tax liability to begin with.\"",
      "Only about 4% of workers who earn less than $25 per hour also get tips, the group has found. As a result, low-wage servers at many restaurants could\u00a0qualify for the tax break, but fast-food employees might not\u00a0despite earning similar incomes.",
      "\"It's going to help some very, very high earners, along with some middle earners,\" Sylvia Allegretto, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lion's share of low-wage workers, it's not going to touch because they're not tipped workers.\"",
      "A better way to helps low-wage workers, labor advocates say, would be to raise the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009.",
      "\"It's not that these workers pay too much in taxes or that taxes are a problem,\" Allegretto said. \"The problem is they just don't earn enough money.\"",

      "The jury in Clackamas County, located directly south of Portland, found McLemore, 32, guilty of rape, unlawful sexual penetration and one count of sexual abuse. He was found not guilty on another count of sexual abuse, Portland television station KGW reported.",
      "Sentencing was scheduled for Wednesday.",
      "\"We recognize there are those who fear individuals with celebrity status or a position of prominence can avoid prosecution. Not in Clackamas County. This case demonstrates my office prosecutes criminal acts regardless of the offender's community status,\" District Attorney John Wentworth said in a statement.",
      "The charges stemmed from a party on Oct. 3, 2021, at the Lake Oswego home owned by his Trail Blazers teammate Robert Covington.",
      "Prosecutors claimed during the trial that the sexual encounter was rape, while McLemore's attorney countered it was consensual sex.",
      "The woman said she was incapacitated after a night of heavy drinking and was unable to give consent. Prosecutors submitted photos of the woman hovering over a toilet and then passed out on a couch, The Oregonian/Oregon Live earlier reported.",
      "She said she woke up at one point during the rape and froze in terror.",
      "\"I don't know who this person is,\" she testified. \"This is a random person that is doing something like this to me.\" The Associated Press generally does not identify victims of sexual assault.",
      "At one point, she said she let her body slide to the floor in an effort to stop the assault. The woman testified McLemore pulled her back onto the couch and continued.",
      "Covington earlier testified he saw the woman flirting with McLemore while they sat on a couch.",
      "McLemore testified he was also drinking but claimed the sex was consensual. He also said he and the woman did not have a conversation before, during or after the act, after which he immediately left the home.",
      "One of his attorneys, Kris Winemiller, said McLemore left after receiving an angry message from this then-wife, who tracked him and wanted to know why he wasn't in their own Lake Oswego home.",
      "Clackamas County prosecutor Scott Healy said there was no confusion. \"When you look at all the surrounding circumstances and you assess the evidence in this case, I submit to you that the defendant is guilty,\" he said during closing arguments Tuesday.",
      "Another defense attorney, Lisa Maxfield, argued for McLemore's acquittal.",
      "\"The only reasonable verdict in a case where two people get drunk and have sex and the man is drunker than the woman, the only reasonable verdict in a case like that is not guilty,\" she said.",
      "The woman said she did not hire an attorney to sue McLemore and didn't seek money from him. Instead she pursued the criminal case because \"you can't do that to somebody, let alone somebody that you don't know.\"",
      "McLemore, who played college at Kansas, was the seventh overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft by the Sacramento Kings. He also played for Memphis, Houston and the Los Angeles Lakers before his last NBA season with Portland in 2021-2022.",
      "Since then, he has played in Europe and China. Last August he signed with a team in Turkey.",

The foundation later posted a photo of the fragments of the explosive device and claimed, without providing evidence, that it was detonated by Hamas militants. It said the injuries were not life-threatening, and the two men received medical attention.",

      "Hamas gave a \"positive\" response late Friday to the latest U.S. proposal for a 60-day truce but said further talks were needed on implementation.",
      "Hamas has been seeking guarantees that the initial truce would lead to a total end to the war and withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Hamas has also said they want aid to be delivered exclusively by the U.N. and its partners, and that the GHF be shut down.",
      "President Trump has been pushing for an agreement and is set to host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House next week to discuss a deal. Netanyahu has previously ruled out ending the war until all the hostages are freed and the military and governing capability of Hamas has been permanently destroyed.",

Eight were killed near a GHF aid distribution site in the southern city of Rafah, the hospital said. One Palestinian was also killed near another GHF point in Rafah. It was not clear how far away the Palestinians were from the sites.",
      "GHF denied that the killings happened near their sites. Previously, the organization has said no one has been shot at its sites, which are guarded by private contractors but can only be accessed by passing Israeli military positions hundreds of meters away. CBS News previously reported that a contractor said their colleague had fired into the crowd at one aid site.",
      "The army had no immediate comment, but has said it fires warning shots as a crowd-control measure and it only aims at people when its troops are threatened.",
      "One Palestinian was also killed waiting in crowds for aid trucks in eastern Khan Younis, officials at Nasser Hospital said. The United Nations and other international organizations bring in their own supplies of aid. It was unclear to which organization the aid trucks the Palestinians were waiting for belonged to, but the incident did not appear to be connected to GHF operations.",
      "Crowds of Palestinians often wait for trucks and unload or loot their contents before they reach their destinations. These trucks must pass through areas under Israeli military control. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the incident.",
      "The GHF \u2014 a U.S.- and Israeli-backed initiative meant to bypass the U.N. \u2014 distributes aid from four sites that are surrounded by Israeli troops, three of which are in the far south of Gaza.",
      "The U.N. and other humanitarian groups have rejected the GHF system, saying it allows Israel to use food as a weapon, violates humanitarian principles and it's not effective.",
      "Israel says Hamas has been siphoning off aid delivered by the U.N. \u2014 a claim the U.N. denies. Hamas has urged Palestinians not to cooperate with the GHF.",
      "GHF, which is registered in Delaware, began distributing food in May to Palestinians, who say Israeli troops open fire almost every day toward crowds on roads heading to the distribution points, through Israeli military zones. Several hundred people have been killed and hundreds more wounded, according to the Hamas-run\u00a0Gaza Health Ministry and witnesses.",
      "The war in Gaza was set off after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 250 others hostage. Israel responded with an offensive that has killed over 57,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, displaced nearly all of Gaza's 2 million people and left many on the edge of famine.",

He said Hamas is insisting on guarantees regarding an Israeli withdrawal to positions it held on March 2, during a previous ceasefire, and an end to the war following a 60-day truce, as well as ending the U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) system for distributing aid. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media.",

    "summary": "The feuding Gallagher brothers kicked off a reunion tour in Cardiff, Wales, their first performance since their acrimonious split in 2009.",
    "story": [
      "Oasis ended a 16-year hiatus on Friday with a punchy, powerful trip through one of Britpop's greatest songbooks, kicking off a reunion tour in Cardiff, Wales to a crowd ecstatic for the band's 1990s hits.",
      "And was there brotherly love between the famously feuding Gallagher siblings? Definitely maybe.",
      "Fans traveled to the Welsh capital from around the world for a show that many thought would never happen. Guitarist-songwriter Noel Gallagher and his singer brother Liam, the heart of Oasis, had not performed together since their acrimonious split in 2009.",
      "One fan banner summed it up: \"The great wait is over.\"",
      "After a montage of headlines about the sparring siblings was capped with the words \"the guns have fallen silent,\" Oasis appeared on stage to a deafening roar, opening with the apt \"Hello\" and its refrain of \"it's good to be back.\"",
      "The brothers had a brief hand-in-hand moment but largely kept their distance onstage. Noel, 58, focused on his guitar while a parka-clad Liam, 52, snarled into the microphone with a swagger that has not dimmed in the 31 years since the band released its first album, \"Definitely Maybe.\"",
      "A crowd of more than 60,000 in the Principality Stadium was treated to a well-paced two-hour set that drew heavily on the first album and its 1995 followup, \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory,\" alongside a smattering of later tracks and fan-favorite B-sides.",
      "Song like \"Supersonic,\" \"Roll With It\" and \"Rock 'n' Roll Star\" sounded as thunderous as ever and sparked mass sing-alongs.",
      "\"Put your arms over each other like you love each other,\" a tambourine-clutching Liam exhorted the crowd before launching into \"Cigarettes and Alcohol.\"",
      "There was poignancy on \"Live Forever\" when an image of Liverpool Football Club player Diogo Jota, who was killed in a car crash on Thursday, was projected above the band.",
      "Noel took his turn on lead vocals for several songs, including the touching \"Half the World Away,\" and the show ended with encores featuring some of Oasis' most enduring tracks: \"Don't Look Back in Anger,\" \"Wonderwall\" and \"Champagne Supernova.\" The brothers shared a half-hug as they ended the final song.",
      "Multicolored, sometimes faintly psychedelic projections formed the main technological accoutrement to a show where the focus was squarely on the songs. There was little banter, though Liam paused between songs to check the audience was having a good time.",
      "\"Was it worth the 40,000 pounds you paid for the ticket?\" he quipped at one point, referring to the scramble for seats that saw some fans pay hundreds to see a show.",
      "From the roar of response, it was.",
      "The show in Cardiff kicked off a 19-date Live '25 tour in the U.K. and Ireland. Then come stops in North America, South America, Asia and Australia, ending in Sao Paulo on Nov. 23.",
      "Before the show, the streets around the stadium filled with fans who gathered in groups to sing along to the band's hits and snapped up Oasis-branded bucket hats at 35 pounds ($48) each.",
      "\"It's very, very special \u2014 emotional,\" said 44-year old Rob Maule from Edinburgh, Scotland. \"I'm here with three of my friends, childhood friends, and we used to see Oasis across the country.",
      "\"For us, it's a generational thing. It's a chapter of our lives,\" he said. \"And then the second generation, as people are taking their kids. It's really special.\"",
      "Vicki Moynehan came from Dorchester, in southwest England. She said her life has changed since she bought her ticket almost a year ago.",
      "\"Seven months pregnant \u2014 ain't gonna stop me,\" she said.",
      "Founded in the working-class streets of Manchester, England, in 1991, Oasis was one of the dominant British acts of the 1990s, releasing eight U.K. No. 1 albums.",
      "The band's sound was fueled by sing-along rock choruses and the combustible chemistry between guitarist-songwriter Noel Gallagher \u2014 a Beatles and glam rock-loving musician with a knack for memorable tunes \u2014 and younger brother Liam.",
      "Then and since, the brothers have often traded barbs \u2014 onstage, in the studio and in interviews. Liam once called Noel \"tofu boy,\" while Noel branded his brother \"the angriest man you'll ever meet. He's like a man with a fork in a world of soup.\"",
      "After a backstage bustup at a concert in France in 2009, they long resisted pressure to reunite, even with the promise of a multimillion-dollar payday.",
      "Now they have agreed on a tour that sees hem joined by former Oasis members Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs and Gem Archer on guitar, bassist Andy Bell and drummer Joey Waronker.",
      "The announcement of the U.K. tour in August sparked a ticket-buying frenzy, complete with error messages, hourslong online queues, dashed hopes and anger at prices that surged at the last minute.",
      "The ticketing troubles sparked questions in U.K. Parliament, where Arts Minister Chris Bryant criticized \"practices that see fans of live events blindsided by price hikes.\" Britain's competition regulator has since threatened Ticketmaster \u2014 which sold around 900,000 Oasis tickets \u2014 with legal action.",
      "No plans have been announced for Oasis to record any new music, and the tour is being presented as a one-off.",
      "Music writer John Aizlewood said that it's an opportunity for Oasis to \"tend the legacy\" of the band, and remind people of the power of the Oasis brand.",
      "\"There should be a sense of huge joy and life affirmation about these shows. And I think if they can just play it right, then that can be a massive burnishing of their legacy,\" he said. \"(There is) this enduring love for Oasis \u2014 and love means money.\"",
      "Fans were determined to enjoy the moment.",
      "\"I'm the oldest sibling of four brothers, so I know they'll fall out,\" said Stephen Truscott, from Middlesbrough in northeast England. \"(But) the first night, they're going to have an absolute unbelievable blast. It's going to be the best.\"",

      "While a zoo spokesperson said Scampi and Flounder have never hatched and raised a chick before,\u00a0same-sex penguin couples are not unheard of. In 2018, two male penguins at the Sea Life Sydney Aquarium in Australia hatched a chick, and then in 2020, a pair of female penguins at an aquarium in Spain welcomed a baby chick. In 2022, a male penguin couple at a zoo in New York state became parents.",
      "Penguin parents share feeding and parenting duties. Chester Zoo keepers provide fish, which the parents swallow and blend into a \"protein-rich soup,\" which they regurgitate to feed the chicks, according to the zoo.",
      "Eight of the 10 penguins hatched at Chester Zoo this year have been named in the weeks since they hatched in April.",
      "\"This year we've gone with a celestial theme for naming the chicks and we've had a lot of fun coming up with names inspired by stars, constellations and cosmic wonders,\" Sweetman said.",
      "The zoo is taking suggestions on social media before deciding on the names of two of the chicks, but has named the others: Ursa, Alcyone, Quasar, Orion, Dorado, Cassiopeia, Altair and Xena. Scampi and Flounder's chick will have its name picked on social media. The zoo has not specified if the chick is male or female.",
      "Since their births, the fluffy penguin chicks have nearly quadrupled in size, according to the zoo.",
      "\"They're now days away from a really exciting milestone \u2014 their very first swimming lessons, which is always a thrill to witness as they dive into the pool for the very first time,\" Sweetman said.",
      "Humboldt penguins, native to South America, are vulnerable to climate change and habitat loss, according to the zoo. Population numbers have decreased by around 85% in the last 40 years.",
      "\"The penguin colony at Chester Zoo plays a vital role in the international breeding program for the species, helping to maintain a genetically healthy population in conservation zoos across Europe,\" according to the zoo.",
      "Humboldt penguins are carnivores, eating small fish and crustaceans, according to the zoo. They spend up to 75% of their lives in water. They typically live 12 to 15 years, but can live up to 20 years in human care. Humboldt penguins typically weigh around 7 to 13 pounds, with their weight fluctuating based on food and whether or not they're molting. They grow to be about 2 feet tall.

      "Russian officials have recently been emphasizing the need to engage with the Taliban to help stabilize Afghanistan, and lifted a ban on the Taliban in April.",
      "Russia's ambassador to Afghanistan, Dmitry Zhirnov, said in remarks broadcast by state Channel One television that the decision to officially recognize the Taliban government was made by President Vladimir Putin on advice from Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.",
      "Zhirnov said the decision proves Russia's \"sincere striving for the development of full-fledged relations with Afghanistan.\"",
      "On Friday, the Taliban took down the tricolor flag of the republic from the embassy building in Moscow and replaced it with their white flag, prompting reactions from former republic officials.",
      "\"An authoritarian regime recognizing another\"",
      "\"Russia's recognition of the Taliban marks a turning point. It legitimizes a regime that bans girls from education, enforces public floggings, and shelters UN-sanctioned terrorists,\" Mariam Solaimankhail, a former member of the Afghanistan parliament during the republic government, wrote on social media. \"The move signals that strategic interests will always outweigh human rights and international law.\"",
      "Naseer A. Faiq, the charg\u00e9 d'affaires of the Afghan Permanent Mission to the United Nations, said, \"The recognition of the Taliban by countries that have supported them over the past twenty years is not surprising. But the main question is whether this recognition will have an impact on the political, economic, social, and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan and its people, who are facing poverty, unemployment, and uncertainty, or not?",
      "\"The answer is clear: this political move is apparently in the interests of the Taliban, but its long-term negative effects on the Afghan people will be much greater.\"",
      "Torek Farhadi, a veteran geopolitical analyst, believes Russia is interested in rare earth minerals in Afghanistan. He said Moscow's recognition of the Taliban makes financial investment possible for Russia's defense industry in the region.",
      "\"Afghanistan has rare earth mines and deposits and Moscow has the mappings from the Soviet day,\" Farhadi told CBS News. \"Moscow officially recognizes the Taliban, it opens the door for investments as rare earth becomes key to the auto industry and the defense industry. Moscow is interested in this spot before anybody else returns to Afghanistan for such investments.\"",
      "Mohammad Halim Fidai, a former provincial governor and civil society activist in exile in Germany, told CBS News, \"By endorsing the Taliban regime, Russia has not only violated international norms but also undermined the global consensus against recognizing a government with a deeply troubling human rights record.\"",
      "\"This move risks further marginalizing both Russia and the Taliban on the world stage.\"",
      "\"Moreover, it exposes the flawed assumptions by some in the West that the Taliban had reformed and would respect basic rights. Ultimately, this endorsement reflects a broader trend of authoritarian solidarity \u2014 an authoritarian regime recognizing another.\"",

    "story": [
      "Waves of drone and missile attacks targeted Kyiv overnight into Friday in the largest aerial assault since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began more than three years ago, officials said, amid a renewed Russian push to capture more of its neighbor's land.",
      "The barrage injured at least 23 people and inflicted severe damage across multiple districts of the capital in a seven-hour onslaught. Blasts lit up the night sky and echoed across the city as air raid sirens wailed. The blue lights of emergency vehicles reflected off high-rise buildings, and debris blocked city streets.",
      "\"It was a harsh, sleepless night,\" Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.",
      "Russia has been stepping up its long-range attacks on Ukrainian cities. Less than a week ago, Russia launched what was then the largest aerial assault of the war. That strategy has coincided with a concerted Russian effort to break through parts of the roughly 620-mile front line, where Ukrainian troops are under severe pressure.",
      "Russia launched 550 drones and missiles across Ukraine during the night, the country's air force said. The majority were Shahed drones, but Russia also launched 11 missiles.",
      "The attacks on Kyiv began the same day a phone call took place between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Zelenskyy called the timing of the strikes a deliberate signal that Moscow has no intention of ending the war.",
      "Mr. Trump said he was \"very disappointed\" with the call and he would call Zelenskyy on Friday.",
      "Peace moves not making much progress",
      "U.S.-led international peace efforts have been fruitless so far. Recent direct peace talks have led only to sporadic exchanges of prisoners of war, wounded troops and the bodies of fallen soldiers. No date has been set for further negotiations.",
      "Ukrainian officials and the Russian Defense Ministry said another prisoner swap took place Friday, though neither side said how many soldiers were involved. Zelenskyy said most of the Ukrainians had been in Russian captivity since 2022. The Ukrainian soldiers were classified as \"wounded and seriously ill.\"",

      "\"Russia will not back down from these goals,\" Ushakov told reporters after the call.",
      "War continuing unabated",
      "Russia's army crossed the border on Feb. 24, 2022, in an all-out invasion that Putin sought to justify by falsely saying it was needed to protect Russian-speaking civilians in eastern Ukraine and prevent the country from joining NATO. Zelenskyy has repeatedly called out Russian disinformation efforts.",
      "The U.S. has paused some shipments of military aid to Ukraine, including crucial air defense missiles. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News in a statement that the \"decision was made to put America's interests first following\" a Defense Department \"review of our nation's military support and assistance to other countries across the globe.\"",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News the move was over concerns about U.S. military stockpiles falling too low.",
      "Ukraine's main European backers are considering how they can help pick up the slack. Zelenskyy says plans are afoot to build up Ukraine's domestic arms industry, but scaling up will take time.",
      "The Ukrainian response needs to be speedy, since Russia has been escalating its aerial attacks.",
      "Russia launched 5,438 drones at Ukraine in June, a new monthly record, according to official data collated by The Associated Press. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said earlier this week that Moscow also launched more than 330 missiles, including nearly 80 ballistic missiles, at Ukrainian towns and cities that month.",

      "Ukraine's Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko described \"families running into metro stations, basements, underground parking garages, mass destruction in the heart of our capital.\"",
      "\"What Kyiv endured last night, cannot be called anything but a deliberate act of terror,\" she wrote on X.",

    "story": [
      "The Colombian navy on Wednesday announced its first seizure of an unmanned \"narco sub\" equipped with a Starlink antenna off its Caribbean coast.",
      "The semisubmersible vessel was not carrying drugs, but the Colombian navy and Western security sources based in the region told AFP they believed it was a trial run by a cocaine trafficking cartel.",
      "\"It was being tested and was empty,\" a naval spokeswoman confirmed to AFP.",
      "Manned semisubmersibles built in clandestine jungle shipyards have been used for decades to ferry cocaine north from Colombia, the world's biggest cocaine producer, to Central America or Mexico.",
      "But in recent years, they have been sailing much farther afield, crossing the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.",
      "The latest find, announced by Admiral Juan Ricardo Rozo at a press conference, is the first reported discovery in South American waters of a drone narco sub. In May 2024, Italian police announced the seizure of a small remote-controlled sub likely intended to transport drugs as part of an international drug trafficking network.",
      "The Colombian navy said the drone semisubmersible was owned by the Gulf Clan, Colombia's largest drug trafficking group and had the capacity to transport 1.5 tons of cocaine.",
      "The Gulf Clan is one of several cartels recently\u00a0designated\u00a0as foreign terrorist groups by the United States.The group's \"primary source of income is from cocaine trafficking, which it uses to fund its paramilitary activities,\" according to the\u00a0U.S. State Department.",
      "A video released by the navy showed a small grey vessel with a satellite antenna on the bow.",
      "This is not the first time a Starlink antenna has been used at sea by suspected drug traffickers.",
      "In November, Indian police seized a giant consignment of meth worth $4.25 billion in a vessel steered remotely by Starlink near the remote Andaman and Nicobar islands.",
      "It was the first known discovery of a narco sub operated by Starlink.",
      "Floating \"coffins\"",
      "Cocaine production, seizures and use all hit record highs in 2023, the U.N. drug agency said last month.",
      "In Colombia, production has reached record levels, fueled by surging global demand.",
      "Rozo said the use of autonomous subs reflected the traffickers \"migration toward more sophisticated unmanned systems\" which are hard to detect at sea, \"difficult to track by radar and even allow criminal networks to operate with partial autonomy.\"",
      "Juana Cabezas, a researcher at Colombia's Institute for Development and Peace Studies, told AFP that powerful Mexican drug cartels, who operate in Colombia, \"hired technology experts and engineers to develop an unmanned submarine\" as far back as 2017.",
      "She pointed out that drone vessels made it harder for the authorities to pinpoint the drug lords behind the shipments.",
      "\"Removing the crew eliminates the risk of captured operators cooperating with authorities,\" agreed Henry Shuldiner, an investigator for the U.S.-based InSight Crime think tank, who co-authored a report on the rise of narco subs.",
      "Shuldiner also highlighted the challenge of assembling crews to sail makeshift subs described as floating \"coffins.\" The journey can be deadly: In 2023, a\u00a0\"narco sub\" with two dead bodies\u00a0and nearly three tons of cocaine aboard was seized off the coast of Colombia.",
      "A near record number of the low-profile vessels were intercepted in the Atlantic and Pacific in 2024, according to the report.",
      "In November last year, five tons of Colombian cocaine were found on a semisubmersible en route to faraway Australia.",
      "Colombian law punishes the use, construction, marketing, possession and transportation of semisubmersibles with penalties of up to 14 years in prison.",
      "Though commonly spotted off the coast of Colombia, narco subs have been intercepted across the globe in recent months.",
      "Just last week, the Mexican navy seized 3.5 tons of cocaine hidden in a semisubmersible vessel off the Pacific coast, while releasing video of the \"narco sub\" being intercepted.",
      "In March, Portuguese police said forces had confiscated nearly\u00a06.5 tons\u00a0of cocaine from a semisubmersible vessel off the remote Azores archipelago that was bound for the Iberian peninsula.

      "\"Generally speaking, most people want to look like a better version of themselves,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Certainly, there are some people who do want to look like a certain celebrity or an influencer they have seen on social media, so we may see a temporary uptick in requests for a breast augmentation to look like a certain celebrity who has admitted to having theirs done.\"",
      "\"However, it is not very realistic to look like someone else,\" Hadeed added. \"Every woman starts off with a different breast size, volume, shape and anatomy.\u00a0A good breast augmentation should result in a natural look that compliments the chest and body, and since there are so many options for breast implants, it is important to find the right implant for each patient depending on what her aesthetic goals are.\"",

      "\"Confession can be a PR triumph or a social media bloodbath \u2013 there\u2019s no middle ground,\" Schiffer said. \"Some fans applaud the honesty, others see it as normalizing vanity. For each fan who praises transparency, there\u2019s one who calls it a desperate plea for attention.\"",
      "He continued, \"Owning up to surgery humanizes a celebrity \u2013 or expose them as just another insecure narcissist. It\u2019s negative if the work looks botched \u2013 transparency can\u2019t rescue bad art direction on your epidermis.\"",
      "LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS",
      "\"You can also think of it as pre-emptive crisis insurance: disclose the nip-tuck details before TMZ finds the OR log, and the headline reads \u2018empowered,\u2019 not \u2018exposed,'\" Schiffer added. \"In the TikTok courtroom, hiding a facelift is securities fraud against your own face.\"",

      "Eldridge told Fox News Digital that the uptick in celebrities' transparency about their plastic surgeries was a \"good move.\"",
      "\"Getting \u2018work done\u2019 is inevitable in Hollywood; until recently, \u2018giving credit\u2019 was not,\" he said. \"As social media continues to be a tool to close the gap between celebrities and their fans \u2013 by providing the illusion of proximity, authenticity and relatability \u2013 then this is the logical \u2018update\u2019 for those apps: candor.\"",

      "As for whether the trend would continue, Schiffer told Fox News Digital that he believed \"the transparency arms race has just begun.\"",
      "\"Expect even more grotesque detail and surgical oversharing,\" he said. \"Confession is contagious; each celebrity who comes clean drags a dozen more into the lights.\"",
      "Schiffer continued, \"Transparency is now a competitive sport \u2013 who can be more brutally honest, more raw? This isn\u2019t a trend \u2013 it\u2019s a permanent mutation in celebrity culture. The next frontier is not just admitting surgery, but live-streaming it.\"",

      "Chinese President Xi Jinping will not attend this week\u2019s BRICS Summit in Brazil, marking the first time the Chinese leader has missed the gathering of major emerging economies. The abrupt decision has triggered widespread speculation about internal political dynamics within China and the fraying cohesion of BRICS itself.",
      "China\u2019s official explanation \u2014 a \"scheduling conflict\" and the fact that Xi already met with Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva earlier this year, according to the South China Morning Post \u2014 has been met with skepticism. Premier Li Qiang will attend the summit in Xi\u2019s place, continuing a recent trend of Xi scaling back his appearances on the global stage.",
      "\"That doesn\u2019t make sense,\" said Gordon Chang, an expert on U.S.-China relations. \"There are many other countries at the BRICS summit, not just Brazil. To me, it\u2019s extremely significant that Xi Jinping is not going. It suggests turbulence at home \u2014 there are signs he\u2019s lost control of the military and that civilian rivals are reasserting power. This is a symptom of that.\"",

      "\"China is actively harming all those countries for the most part, maybe with some exceptions, through its malign trade policies and dumping and overcapacity.\"",
      "Some analysts point to rising China-India friction as a contributing factor in Xi\u2019s decision to skip the summit.",
      "\"China has been at war with India for decades, essentially,\" Burack said. \"These are fundamentally opposing interests. It\u2019s difficult to see China changing its behavior in the near term, and that will keep tensions high.\"",

      "Formed by Brazil, Russia, India and China and later joined by South Africa, BRICS was envisioned as a non-Western counterweight to G7 dominance. It has expanded to include Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, the UAE and, most recently, Indonesia, strengthening its economic footprint.",
      "Economist Christian Briggs highlighted BRICS\u2019s massive scale: \"BRICS now comprises 12 full members and up to 23 when counting partners. Collectively, they account for over 60% of the world\u2019s GDP and around 75% of the global population. They control vast natural resources and a growing share of global trade flows.\"",
      "Yet despite its scale, the bloc remains ideologically and strategically fragmented. \"It\u2019s a group of countries that hate each other,\" Burack said bluntly. \"China is harming many of them through unfair trade practices. There\u2019s not a lot of incentive for real unity.\"",
      "The alliance\u2019s aspirations to challenge the U.S. dollar through alternative payment systems and a potential BRICS currency have gained media traction \u2014 but experts caution against overestimating this threat.",
      "\"There\u2019s been a lot of fearmongering about a BRICS currency,\" said Burack. \"But the interests of these countries are completely divergent. There\u2019s more smoke than fire when it comes to a currency challenge to the dollar.\"",
      "Chang echoed this skepticism: \"The only country that can challenge the dollar is the United States. Weakness in the dollar is due to what we are doing domestically, not what the BRICS are doing.\"",
      "Still, Briggs offered a counterpoint, arguing that BRICS members are already reshaping global currency flows.",

      "While its cohesion remains questionable, BRICS poses a long-term challenge to U.S. influence \u2014 particularly in regions where Washington has retreated diplomatically and economically.",
      "\"China filled the void left by the U.S. in places like Africa,\" said Briggs. \"Now it controls about 38% of the world\u2019s minerals. Meanwhile, Russia\u2019s economy has doubled despite sanctions, because they preemptively reduced reliance on the dollar.\"",
      "Yet Chang sees India as a brake on any aggressive anti-Western tilt. \"BRICS has an \u2018I\u2019 in it\u2014and that\u2019s India. Modi doesn\u2019t want to be part of an anti-Western bloc. As long as India\u2019s in BRICS, the rest of the world is safe.\"",

      "\"He doesn\u2019t have to be there,\" Briggs contended. \"Xi\u2019s power allows him to delegate. China is trading with nearly 80% of the world now. He\u2019s moving the agenda forward even in absentia.\"",
      "What\u2019s clear is that BRICS continues to evolve \u2014 its internal contradictions as visible as its geopolitical ambitions. Whether Xi's absence marks a retreat or a recalibration remains one of the key questions hovering over the summit in Brazil."

      "White House official Lindsey Halligan blasted content currently on display at the National Museum of American History\u2019s Entertainment Nation exhibit in an exclusive email to Fox News Digital.The exhibit, which explores American pop culture, has drawn internal and external criticism for what some see as a politically loaded interpretation of cultural milestones.",
      "\"American taxpayers should not be funding institutions that undermine our country or promote one-sided, divisive political narratives,\" Halligan said. \"The Smithsonian Institution should present history in a way that is accurate, balanced, and consistent with the values that make the United States of America exceptional.\"DONALD TRUMP FIRES NATIONAL PORTRAIT GALLERY DIRECTOR FOR BEING 'STRONG SUPPORTER' OF DEI",

      "The White House statement comes on the heels of several striking examples from the exhibit.",
      "One placard, featured alongside a 1923 circus poster, reads: \"Under the big top, circuses expressed the colonial impulse to claim dominion over the world.\" Another, describing early American entertainment, declares: \"One of the earliest defining traits of entertainment in the United States was extraordinary violence.\"",
      "The exhibit reframes iconic American characters through a critical, politically-charged lens. On The Lone Ranger, the display states: \"The White title character\u2019s relationship with Tonto resembled how the U.S. government imagined itself the world\u2019s Lone Ranger.\"",
      "Mickey Mouse, a beloved American cultural icon, is not spared either. A display for the 1928 cartoon Steamboat Willie states, \"Mickey challenged authority, but not everyone was in on the joke.\"",
      "It continues: \"Mickey Mouse debuted as the deckhand \u2018Steamboat Willie\u2019 in 1928, amidst a rising anxiety felt by many that modern living and city life were eroding family and community ties and loosening moral codes\u2026 But the new character\u2019s outsized facial features, white gloves, and trickster temperament were vestiges of longstanding traditions of blackface minstrelsy.\"",
      "In reference to the Indiana Jones film series, another panel reads: \"His character embodied a confident righteousness that, in many ways, captured the essence of the 1980s\" above another subhead referencing President Ronald Reagan's famous speech, asking, \"Are you better off?\"KENT STATE STUDENT'S VIOLENT ANTI-TRUMP ART DISPLAY SPURS OUTRAGE",

      "\"The examples [Fox News Digital] highlighted from the National Museum of American History are part of the problem the Trump Administration aims to fix,\" Halligan said. \"Framing American culture as inherently violent, imperialist, or racist does not reflect the greatness of our nation or the millions of Americans who have contributed to its progress.\"",

      "She added, \"We will provide updates on this audit as our progress unfolds.\"",
      "The Smithsonian Institution responded to Fox News Digital with the following brief written statement: \"The museum is committed to continuous and rigorous scholarship and research and unbiased presentation of facts and history. As such, and as previously announced, we are assessing content in Smithsonian museums and will make any necessary changes to ensure our content meets our standards.\"",
      "The Institution did not answer specific questions regarding who authored the Entertainment Nation exhibit, whether outside academic consultants or activist organizations were involved, or who made the decision to present all exhibit text bilingually in English and Spanish.",

      "The race to develop 6th-generation aircraft is no longer a future vision \u2013 it\u2019s now a defining force behind U.S. defense strategy.",
      "With cutting-edge platforms like the B-21 Raider, the F-47 and the Navy\u2019s F/A-XX on the horizon, the Pentagon is reshaping how the U.S. projects airpower for the next 50 years.",
      "These aircraft promise unprecedented advances in speed, stealth and autonomy \u2013 but they\u2019re also colliding with budget pressures, industrial capacity limits, and an increasingly uncertain global threat environment.",
      "Northrop Grumman\u2019s B-21 Raider is poised to become the backbone of U.S. long-range strike capability. With its next-gen stealth design, reduced maintenance burden and affordability compared to its B-2 predecessor, the B-21 is seen as critical to deterring strategic threats like China and Iran.",
      "The urgency became clear last week when seven B-2 bombers flew an 18-hour mission to Iran, dropping bunker-busting bombs on nuclear targets. While effective, the B-2\u2019s high cost and aging systems underscore the need for its replacement. At $692 million per aircraft \u2014 compared to $2 billion for a B-2 \u2014 the B-21 offers strategic reach at a more sustainable price.",
      "The high-tech stealth bomber can carry nuclear and conventional weapons and is designed to be optionally manned, meaning it could fly without a crew on board.",

      "\"What we need to consider is doubling the production capacity as rapidly as possible to bring up that inventory,\" Gen. David Deptula, Dean of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Power Studies, told Fox News Digital.",

      "Once stalled, the Air Force\u2019s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program roared back to life this spring under a new name and a new contract. Now designated the F-47, the program \u2013 awarded to Boeing \u2013 is designed to be the most advanced manned fighter in U.S. history. Its capabilities will include stealth, extended range, speeds exceeding Mach 2 and integration with a new class of AI-enabled drones called Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA).",
      "The F-47 will serve as the \"quarterback\" for a team of 1,000 CCAs, controlling them in battle and coordinating sensor and targeting data in real time.",
      "\"It's critically important that President Trump proceeded with the manned platform for the Air Force,\" said former Rep. Mike Garcia, R-Calif. \"This academic debate about unmanned-only platforms is aspirational \u2013 but the networks just aren\u2019t there yet.\"",
      "The aircraft has an ambitious timeline for initial operational capacity \u2013 within the 2025-2029 range, according to a graphic posted by Air Force chief of staff David Allvin on X.",
      "The Pentagon is going all-in on the F-47 in the 2026 budget: requesting $3.5 billion while decreasing its request for F-35s from 74 to 47. Garcia, a former Navy pilot, emphasized that human pilots are still essential for managing the complexity of 21st-century warfare.",
      "However, others within the Pentagon argue that manned fighters may become obsolete before the F-47 is even fully fielded.",

      "Deptula decried \"arbitrary\" budgets that were set by Congress rather than defense officials' determination of what they need for readiness and argued the more-expensive F-47 might be able to do far more work than less elite aircraft.",
      "\"Individually, F-47 might be costlier than a previous fighter aircraft, but if it can achieve 15, 20, 30, 40 times what it would take to accomplish the particular outcome using non-stealthy or other less expensive aircraft, which one provides the most value? So that's where the decision calculus needs to go.\"",
      "President Donald Trump revealed a rendering of the F-47 during a White House ceremony in March. (REUTERS/Carlos Barria)",

      "\"Designing a naval variant of an Air Force aircraft on the same timeline? It\u2019s impossible to do it correctly.\"",
      "Instead, the Navy is expected to borrow technology \u2013 like engines and sensors \u2013 from NGAD while building a unique carrier-capable fighter suited for saltwater, catapults and fight deck operations.",
      "However, Garcia warned that the Navy has a deeper, under-reported problem: a shortfall in carrier-based strike fighters.",

      "\"A gold-plated 6th-gen aircraft in low quantities isn\u2019t the answer. Slightly less capability in higher numbers is what the Navy needs.\"",
      "However, Deptula said there\u2019s a question of whether aircraft carriers will even continue to be viable in the future.",
      "\"The question that a lot of people in the Department of Defense are asking now is what's the viability of an aircraft carrier in a future world proliferated by hypersonic, very precise missiles with 1,500-mile-plus ranges.\"",

    "summary": "The return of blue book exams emerges as universities fight widespread AI academic dishonesty and educators debate whether to ban AI tools or teach responsible usage.",
    "story": [
      "A growing number of fire departments across the country are turning to artificial intelligence to help detect and respond to wildfires more quickly.",
      "The rise of artificial intelligence in education is forcing schools and universities to rethink everything from homework policies to how final exams are administered. With tools like ChatGPT now widespread, students can generate essays, solve complex math problems or draft lab reports in seconds, raising urgent questions about what authentic learning looks like in 2025.",
      "To fight back, some schools are turning to an unlikely solution: pen and paper. The old-school \"blue book,\" a lined booklet used for handwritten test answers, is staging a comeback, according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal. And while it might seem like a relic of a pre-digital era, educators say it's one of the most effective tools they have to ensure students are actually doing their own work.",

      "Exam blue book\u00a0 \u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How common is AI cheating in schools today?",
      "While it's difficult to measure precisely, recent surveys suggest up to 89% of students have used AI tools like ChatGPT to help with coursework. Some admit to using it only for brainstorming or grammar fixes, but others rely on it to write entire papers or take-home tests. As reported, the spike in academic dishonesty has left faculty scrambling to preserve academic standards.",
      "Universities have reported a sharp rise in disciplinary cases tied to AI, but many incidents likely go undetected. Detection software like Turnitin's AI writing checker is being used more widely, but even those tools admit their systems aren't foolproof.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Why AI cheating in schools is so hard to detect",
      "One reason this trend is so hard to police is that generative AI has become surprisingly good at mimicking human writing. Tools can tailor tone and style and even match a student's previous work, making plagiarism nearly impossible to identify without sophisticated forensics or human intuition.",
      "In blind tests, teachers have often been unable to distinguish between human and AI-written responses. Making matters worse, some schools that initially tried detection software have started abandoning it due to accuracy concerns and privacy issues.",
      "A student using ChatGPT on his laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why schools are bringing back blue books to stop AI cheating",
      "In response, a growing number of professors are bringing exams back into the classroom, with pen and paper. Schools like Texas A&M, University of Florida and UC Berkeley have all reported surging demand for blue books over the last two years. The logic is simple: If students have to write their essays by hand during class time, there's no opportunity to copy from ChatGPT or another AI assistant. It's not just nostalgia; it's a strategic shift. In-person, handwritten exams are harder to game, and some instructors say the quality of student thinking actually improves without digital shortcuts.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Are handwritten exams enough to stop AI cheating in schools?",
      "Still, not everyone is convinced this is the answer. Critics argue that relying on in-class, timed writing may shortchange students on deeper research skills and analytical thinking, especially for complex topics that benefit from time, revision and outside sources. Plus, blue books do little to prevent AI misuse on homework, group projects or take-home essays.",
      "Should schools ban AI tools or teach responsible use?",
      "Some educators are pushing for a more balanced response: Instead of banning AI tools, teach students how to use them responsibly. That means integrating AI literacy into the curriculum, so students learn where the line is between inspiration and plagiarism and understand when it's appropriate to use tools like ChatGPT or Grammarly.",
      "\"AI is part of the professional world students will enter,\" said one university dean quoted in The Wall Street Journal.\u00a0\"Our job is to teach them how to think critically, even with new tools in hand.\"",
      "A teacher teaching a lesson and a student using her smartphone\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What\u2019s next in the fight against AI cheating in schools?",
      "As AI tools evolve, so will the strategies schools use to ensure honest learning. Some are shifting toward oral exams, where students must explain their reasoning out loud. Others are assigning more process-based work, such as annotated drafts, recorded brainstorming sessions or group projects that make cheating harder. There's no silver bullet, but one thing is clear: the AI genie isn't going back in the bottle, and the education system must adapt quickly or risk losing credibility.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "AI cheating in education has forced schools to take a hard look at how they assess student learning. The return of the blue book is a sign of just how serious the problem has become and how far educators are willing to go to protect academic integrity. But the real solution will probably involve a mix of old and new, using analog tools like blue books, embracing digital detection methods and teaching students why honest work matters. As AI continues to evolve, education will have to evolve with it. The goal isn't just to stop cheating, it's to make sure students leave school with the skills, knowledge and values they need to succeed in the real world.",

      "You don't need spy-grade tech to hack a phone. The truth is, most phones get compromised not by brute force, but by everyday tricks that prey on users' habits and software gaps.",
      "Phishing is one of the most common methods. This usually involves receiving a fake text, email or even a phone call designed to trick you into clicking a malicious link or sharing sensitive information. It could look like a message from your bank, a delivery service or even a friend.",
      "SIM-swapping is another major threat. In this scam, someone convinces your phone provider to move your number to a SIM card. Once they gain control, they can read your texts, take calls and access accounts that rely on your number.",
      "Malicious apps are also a big risk, especially on devices where users sideload apps or install them from unofficial sources. Some apps appear harmless but are designed to spy on your activity, steal data or give remote access to an attacker.",

      "If your phone continues to act strangely after you\u2019ve tried other fixes, a factory reset on your iPhone or Android might be necessary. This process erases all data and settings, essentially giving you a fresh start. Before doing this, back up your important files, photos and contacts because a factory reset will delete everything on your device. Once reset, reinstall only trusted apps to reduce the risk of reinfection.",
      "Note: While a factory reset removes most malware, extremely advanced spyware may persist. If you suspect this level of compromise, consult a cybersecurity expert or consider replacing the device.",

      "At the core of the Capsule Interface are sophisticated muscle displacement sensors. Unlike conventional teleoperation systems that rely on motion sensors or exoskeletons, H2L's sensors detect even the smallest changes in muscle tension. This allows the device to capture both the intent and the effort behind every movement.",

      "The future of body sharing: Expanding sensory feedback",
      "Looking ahead, H2L plans to make the Capsule Interface even more realistic by adding a new feature called proprioceptive feedback. In simple terms, this means the device would not only let you control a robot, but also allow you to feel what the robot is doing, like sensing resistance when lifting something heavy or feeling the texture of an object through the robot.",

      "There has been little change in U.S. energy consumption over the past decade. Increased efforts to make energy use more efficient have kept levels low. But over the next five years, demand for electricity to power data centers is expected to more than double. Some estimates show the facilities are expected to require as much energy in 2030 as the entire country of Japan does today.",
      "\"Every investor is lining up to invest in the next AI breakthrough. But when it comes to energy, there is a challenge in terms of permitting, the reality of construction timelines for new power plants and new grid capabilities,\" said senior advisor with the Wadhwani A.I. center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"All of this could slow down A.I. just as the research and development is preparing for takeoff.\"",
      "The demand from tech firms comes amid skepticism from consumers. According to a Fox News Poll on how voters felt about A.I. in society, 43% saw it as a good thing, while 47% thought it was a bad thing.",
      "\"I think it's natural that people will always have, call it a mixture of hopes and anxieties about what a new technology, including any new technology and especially AI may bring,\" Microsoft President Brad Smith said. \"The truth is we all rely on AI already, even if we don't think about it.\"",

      "Over the next five years, demand for electricity to power data centers is expected to more than double. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "While positive views have increased faster than negative views, according to polling from 2023, subgroups surveyed expressed opinions all over the board. Most rural voters, White voters, women and those over the age of 45 viewed A.I. as a bad thing. Urban voters, non-White voters, men and those younger than 45 viewed the technology as good. Among major political parties, registered Republicans were most optimistic about A.I. but no party\u2019s approval was above 50%.",
      "Despite the somewhat negative sentiment of most voters, tech companies are powering on.",
      "\"A.I. relies on a lot of what we call compute. A lot of chips that do a lot of calculations and a lot of data that is accessed and is stored. So all of that requires more electricity. And it's why we have to pursue new partnerships as we are with the kinds of companies that generate electricity,\" Smith said.",
      "At least two nuclear plants are scheduled to restart thanks to big tech partnerships.",
      "\"I think this will all become an increasing part of the nation's electricity future,\" Smith said. \"It only makes sense for a power company to invest, to bring something like Three Mile Island back online if it has a guarantee that somebody's gonna purchase it.

      "Three Mile Island is located near Pennsylvania\u2019s capital, Harrisburg. The site is most widely known for its Unit 2 reactor\u2019s partial meltdown in 1979. It was one of the most serious nuclear accidents in U.S. history. The reactor was immediately taken offline in the aftermath.",
      "\"Very small traces of radioactivity have been released from the plant,\" said Metropolitan Edison Vice President John \"Jack\" Herbein at the time.",
      "While there were no detectable health effects, the incident changed how nuclear plants operate. Three Mile Island Unite 1 closed in 2019 for economic reasons. Constellation and Microsoft plan to restart the reactor as early as 2027 at what is now called Crane Energy Center. It will add more than 800 megawatts of energy. That\u2019s enough to power more than 800,000 homes. Nuclear power has the highest energy efficiency rate, yet energy producers say the U.S. should remain diversified.",

      "\"I think it's going to be an important part of the mix,\" Constellation President and CEO Joseph Dominguez said. \"We don't need 24/7 power for the full amount of electricity in the U.S. We still have seasonal needs, we still have day and night differences.\"",
      "Microsoft is working to add the amount of power back to the grid that the company\u2019s data centers will use from the regional transmission system.",
      "\"Our philosophy as a company is that we will invest to bring onto the electric grid as much or more power than we will consume,\" Smith said. \"We will do that in a way that ensures that none of the neighbors are going to see rise in their electricity rates.\"",
      "Constellation is also partnering with Meta to relicense its Clinton Clean Energy Center in central Illinois for another 20 years.",

Amazon will build two data center complexes in Pennsylvania and use nearly two gigawatts of electricity from Talen Energy\u2019s nuclear plant. Google is partnering with Elementl Power on three nuclear projects, each expected to produce 600 megawatts.",
      "\"This is all nuclear. It's a hot industry. It's a brilliant industry,\" President Donald Trump said as he signed several executive orders in May. Those are intended to quadruple domestic nuclear power production within the next 25 years.",
      "\"To win the AI race, we're going to need a lot of energy,\" White House A.I. and Crypto Czar David Sacks said. \"The new AI data centers are very power hungry. They consume a lot of electricity. And the U.S. electric grid really hasn't grown very much over the past decade.\"",

      "The documents confirm that CBP\u2019s initial contract with ARC began in June 2024. It has already been extended and may continue through 2029. Although the initial amounts seem modest, around $11,000 with a recent $6,800 update, the implications are far-reaching.",

      "What DHS is collecting from your flight bookings and why it\u2019s concerning",
      "ARC\u2019s Travel Intelligence Program goes far beyond basic passenger manifests. It includes over a billion records spanning both past and future travel, updated daily. The system can be queried by name, credit card or even travel agency. Importantly, it does not include data from tickets purchased directly through airline websites, focusing instead on bookings made via travel agencies, such as Expedia.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The DHS has justified its use of TIP data in a public Privacy Impact Assessment, noting the program helps in active investigations. CBP echoed this, stating that data is only used when a case is already open. Still, this sets a dangerous precedent. It normalizes mass surveillance through third-party data purchases, undermining safeguards designed to limit unnecessary intrusion.",
      "This isn\u2019t an isolated incident. Last month, Immigration and Customs Enforcement also acknowledged purchasing ARC data. Other federal agencies listed in procurement records include the Secret Service, SEC, DEA, TSA and even the Air Force.",

      "6 ways you can protect your privacy from data brokers",
      "If you want to take back control of your personal information, here are six smart steps you can take right now to reduce your exposure to data brokers.",
      "1. Book flights directly on airline websites:\u00a0Whenever you can, avoid using third-party travel sites like Expedia, Orbitz or travel agencies. These platforms are the main sources of the data collected by the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC) through its Travel Intelligence Program. When you book directly on an airline\u2019s official website or mobile app, your data is far less likely to be shared with ARC or sold to government agencies. While it might be tempting to look for deals on aggregator sites, once you find a fare you like, try to book it directly through the airline.",
      "2. Use virtual or disposable credit cards:\u00a0The ARC system allows queries by credit card number, which means your travel activity can be tracked even if your name is not directly searched. To protect yourself, consider using a virtual credit card or a disposable card number for flight bookings. These are often available through banking apps or fintech services like Revolut, Privacy.com or certain American Express accounts. Virtual cards are tied to your main account but generate a temporary number that can only be used once or at a specific merchant. This makes it much harder for brokers to link future bookings to you.",
      "3. Share the bare minimum when booking:\u00a0Be cautious about the personal information you enter during the booking process. Unless it is legally required, avoid adding unnecessary details like your frequent flyer number, passport data for domestic flights or secondary phone numbers. You can also create a separate email address specifically for travel bookings to reduce the risk of cross-linking data with your other online accounts. When it comes to loyalty programs, consider opting out or using a separate identity if you are concerned about data being shared across companies.",
      "4. Remove your data from the internet:\u00a0The most effective way to take control of your data and avoid data brokers from selling it is to opt for data removal services. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services and get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web by visiting\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Delete",
      "5. Use a privacy-focused browser and email service: Prevent tracking at the source by using privacy-first tools. Switch to browsers like Brave, Firefox or DuckDuckGo, which block ads and data collectors by default. Set up a separate, secure alias email address for booking travel using services. This limits how easily brokers can link your travel data to your online identity. See my review of the best secure and private email services by\u00a0visiting\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Mail",
      "6. Use an identity theft protection service:\u00a0If your travel or payment data is ever leaked or abused, freezing your credit can help prevent identity theft. Identity theft companies can assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. They can also monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.",
      "One of the best parts of my No. 1 pick is that is it has identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft by visiting\u00a0Cyberguy.com/IdentityTheft",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The ARC incident is yet another example of federal agencies bypassing traditional legal channels by buying sensitive data from private firms. Travelers are not just passengers, they are data points in a growing ecosystem where information is currency. The fact that this trade happened without informed consent and behind legal smokescreens should worry anyone who values privacy.",

      "In an interview with CyberGuy, Amazon\u2019s VP of Worldwide Buyer Risk Prevention explained:",
      "\"We\u2019ve made it harder for bad actors to impersonate Amazon communications through implementing industry-leading tools, including the adoption of a secure email capability to make it easier for customers to identify authentic emails from Amazon and avoid phishing attempts. Customers using Gmail, Yahoo!, and other common email providers can be confident that when they receive an @amazon.com email with the smile logo in their inbox, that email is really from us.\"",
      "The smile icon now appears next to verified @amazon.com emails in inboxes like Gmail, Yahoo, and Apple Mail. It is a quick visual cue that the email has passed Amazon\u2019s security checks and can be trusted.",

      "This system helps reduce guesswork, but it is not foolproof. If you ever doubt the legitimacy of a message, go directly to your Amazon Message Center. Any real communication from Amazon will be listed there.",
      "How to protect yourself from fake emails",
      "Even with Amazon rolling out new safeguards like verified sender logos and the Message Center, scammers are still targeting customers with sophisticated phishing emails. Here are the top ways to protect yourself:",
      "1. Know the signs of a scam: Fake Amazon emails often try to scare you or tempt you into clicking by using familiar tricks. You might see a message claiming your account has been locked, offering a gift card or refund, confirming an order you never placed, or asking you to verify payment details or login credentials. These tactics are meant to create urgency or curiosity. It\u2019s important to remember that Amazon will never ask for your password, banking information, or gift card codes by email.",
      "2. Double-check every message: If something feels off, don\u2019t click anything. Instead, visit Amazon.com or open the app to check your order history and account messages. If the email doesn\u2019t appear in your Amazon Message Center, it\u2019s not real. Also hover over the sender\u2019s name to see the full email address. Genuine messages come from @amazon.com and may show the Amazon smile logo if your inbox supports it.",
      "Genuine email sent from @amazon.com\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3. Avoid clicking on unknown links and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Phishing emails often contain links that appear to lead to Amazon but actually take you to fake websites designed to steal your information. Instead of clicking, it\u2019s safer to type amazon.com directly into your browser to verify any claims. For added protection, consider using antivirus software that can detect scam links, block dangerous sites, and alert you to phishing emails or ransomware threats. This extra layer of security helps keep your personal information and digital assets safe.

      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "4. Reduce your exposure to scammers:\u00a0Phishing emails often originate from personal information found on public databases, people-search sites, and data broker platforms. To limit how often you're targeted, consider using a data removal service. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services by visiting here\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Delete.",
      "5. Report suspicious emails: If you receive a phishing message pretending to be from Amazon, report it right away. This helps Amazon investigate the scam and improve their ability to block similar messages in the future. You can forward the suspicious email to stop-spoofing@amazon.com, or submit it through Amazon\u2019s official reporting form.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Scam emails that pretend to be from Amazon are getting more realistic, but there are still clear ways to protect yourself. Use the Message Center to confirm any message tied to your account. Always double-check the sender's address, look for the smile logo in your inbox when supported, and never click on links unless you're certain they're safe. A few quick habits can go a long way in keeping your personal information secure.",

    "published": "Tue, 01 Jul 2025 15:00:06 -0400",
    "summary": "The Berkeley Humanoid Light (BHL) is a lightweight, open source humanoid robot that anyone can build using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components.",
    "story": [
      "A few hundred robots moved a building that covers about 43,400 square feet.",
      "Building an open-source humanoid robot has traditionally been out of reach for most people due to high costs and complex proprietary systems. While robotics has made major strides in automation, healthcare, and research, accessible robot design still poses a challenge-especially for students, hobbyists, and small research teams. Most humanoid robots are expensive, hard to modify, and difficult to repair.",
      "That's why a new project from UC Berkeley is getting a lot of attention. The Berkeley Humanoid Light (BHL) is a lightweight, open-source humanoid robot that anyone can build using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components. It's a major step toward making robotics more affordable, customizable, and accessible to all.",

      "The Berkeley Humanoid Light (BHL) is a lightweight, open source humanoid robot that anyone can build using 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf components.\u00a0 (Berkeley)",
      "Why accessible robot design is essential for innovation",
      "Building a robot from scratch usually means needing fancy equipment like CNC machines or custom electronics. Most people don't have access to those tools, which makes learning and experimentation hard. That's exactly what the Berkeley team wanted to change.",
      "The goal behind the BHL project was to create an accessible robot design that doesn't require a massive budget or a fully equipped lab. The entire robot can be made with parts ordered online and printed at home. It costs less than $5,000 to build, which is far cheaper than most commercial humanoid robots.",
      "Inside Berkeley\u2019s open-source humanoid robot",
      "The robot stands about 39 inches tall and weighs just over 35 pounds. It's powered by modular actuators that use 3D-printed cycloidal gearboxes. These gearboxes distribute pressure across larger gear teeth, which helps the joints last longer and perform more like those found in high-end commercial robots.",
      "Because the design is modular, you don't have to build the whole robot all at once. You can start by printing and testing a single actuator, then gradually move on to assembling full limbs and eventually the entire humanoid. That's a big plus for anyone just getting started with robotics or working with limited resources.",
      "It's a major step toward making robotics more affordable, customizable, and accessible to all. (Berkeley)",
      "Open source robotics with a strong community focus",
      "Everything about the BHL robot is open source. That includes the hardware design, control software, and even a custom teleoperation system that uses SteamVR. It's built to be easy to control, simple to repair, and endlessly customizable.",
      "There's also a growing community around the project. Builders are sharing tips, upgrades, and full robot builds on Discord and GitHub. That kind of collaboration is a big part of what makes accessible robot design so powerful-it brings more people into the conversation and helps everyone learn faster.",
      "The goal behind the BHL project was to create an accessible robot design that doesn't require a massive budget or a fully equipped lab. (Berkeley)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "The Berkeley Humanoid Light proves that accessible robot design doesn't have to mean cutting corners. With smart engineering, affordable parts, and a commitment to openness, the team behind BHL is making it easier than ever for anyone to dive into humanoid robotics. Whether you're a student, a maker, or just curious about how robots work, this is one project that shows what's possible when technology is made for everyone.",

      "What sets Meta AI apart from other chatbots is the \"Discover\" tab, a public feed that displays shared conversations. It was meant to encourage community and creativity, letting users showcase interesting prompts and responses. Unfortunately, many didn\u2019t realize their conversations could be made public with just one tap, and the interface often fails to make the public/private distinction clear.",
      "The feature positions Meta AI as a kind of AI-powered social network, blending search, conversation, and status updates. But what sounds innovative on paper has opened the door to major privacy slip-ups.",
      "Why Meta AI\u2019s Discover tab is a privacy risk",
      "Privacy experts are sounding the alarm over Meta's Discover tab, calling it a serious breach of user trust. The feed surfaces chats containing legal dilemmas, therapy discussions, and deeply personal confessions, often linked to real accounts. In some cases, names and profile photos are visible. Although Meta says only shared chats appear, the interface makes it easy to hit \"share\" without realizing it means public exposure. Many assume the button saves the conversation privately. Worse, logging in with a public Instagram account can make shared AI activity publicly accessible by default, increasing the risk of identification.",
      "Some posts reveal sensitive health or legal issues, financial troubles, or relationship conflicts. Others include contact details or even audio clips. A few contain pleas like \"keep this private,\" written by users who didn't realize their messages would be broadcast. These aren't isolated incidents, and as more people use AI for personal support, the stakes will only get higher.",

      "Are AI chat platforms really private?",
      "This issue isn\u2019t unique to Meta. Most AI chat tools, including ChatGPT, Claude, and Google Gemini, store your conversations by default and may use them to improve performance, train future models, or develop new features. What many users don\u2019t realize is that their inputs can be reviewed by human moderators, flagged for analysis, or saved in training logs.",
      "Even if a platform says your chats are \"private,\" that usually just means they aren\u2019t visible to the public. It doesn\u2019t mean your data is encrypted, anonymous, or protected from internal access. In many cases, companies retain the right to use your conversations for product development unless you specifically opt out, and finding that opt-out isn't always straightforward.",
      "If you\u2019re signed in with a personal account that includes your real name, email address, or social media links, your activity may be easier to connect to your identity than you think. Combine that with questions about health, finances, or relationships, and you\u2019ve essentially created a detailed digital profile without meaning to.",
      "Some platforms now offer temporary chat modes or incognito settings, but these features are usually off by default. Unless you manually enable them, your data is likely being stored and possibly reviewed.",
      "The takeaway: AI chat platforms are not private by default. You need to actively manage your settings, be mindful of what you share, and stay informed about how your data is being handled behind the scenes.",

      "How to protect your privacy when using AI chatbots",
      "AI tools can be incredibly helpful, but without the right precautions, they can also open you up to privacy risks. Whether you're using Meta AI, ChatGPT, or any other chatbot, here are some smart, proactive ways to protect yourself:",
      "1) Use aliases and avoid personal identifiers: Don\u2019t use your full name, birthday, address, or any details that could identify you. Even first names combined with other context can be risky.",
      "2) Never share sensitive information: Avoid discussing medical diagnoses, legal matters, bank account info, or anything you wouldn\u2019t want on the front page of a search engine.",
      "3) Clear your chat history regularly: If you\u2019ve already shared sensitive info, go back and delete it. Many AI apps let you clear chat history through Settings or your account dashboard.",
      "4) Adjust privacy settings often: App updates can sometimes reset your preferences or introduce new default options. Even small changes to the interface can affect what\u2019s shared and how. It\u2019s a good idea to check your settings every few weeks to make sure your data is still protected.",
      "5) Use an identity theft protection service: Scammers actively look for exposed data, especially after a privacy slip. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Visit\u00a0Cyberguy.com/IdentityTheft\u00a0for tips and recommendations.",
      "6) Use a VPN for extra privacy: A reliable VPN hides your IP address and location, making it harder for apps, websites, or bad actors to track your online activity. It also adds protection on public Wi-Fi, shielding your device from hackers who might try to snoop on your connection. For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices\u00a0at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/VPN.",
      "7) Don\u2019t link AI apps to your real social accounts: If possible, create a separate email address or dummy account for experimenting with AI tools. Keep your main profiles disconnected.\u00a0 To create a quick email alias you can use to keep your main accounts protected visit\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Mail.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Meta\u2019s decision to turn chatbot prompts into social content has blurred the line between private and public in a way that catches many users off guard. Even if you think your chats are safe, a missed setting or default option can expose more than you intended. Before typing anything sensitive into Meta AI or any chatbot, pause. Check your privacy settings, review your chat history, and think carefully about what you're sharing. A few quick steps now can save you from bigger privacy headaches later.",

      "A new threat targets both Android and iPhone users. (Apple)",
      "What is SparkKitty mobile malware",
      "Researchers at cybersecurity firm Kaspersky recently identified SparkKitty. This malware appears to succeed SparkCat, a campaign first reported earlier this year that used optical character recognition (OCR) to extract sensitive data from images, including crypto recovery phrases.",
      "SparkKitty goes even further than SparkCat. According to Kaspersky, SparkKitty uploads images from infected phones without discrimination. This tactic exposes not just wallet data but also any personal or sensitive photos stored on the device. While the main target seems to be crypto seed phrases, criminals could use other images for extortion or malicious purposes.",
      "Kaspersky researchers report that SparkKitty has operated since at least February 2024. Attackers distributed it through both official and unofficial channels, including Google Play and the Apple App Store.",
      "SparkKitty uploads images from infected phones without discrimination. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kaspersky found SparkKitty embedded in several apps, including one called \u5e01coin on iOS and another called SOEX on Android. Both apps are no longer available in their respective stores. SOEX, a messaging app with cryptocurrency-related features, reached more than 10,000 downloads from the Google Play Store before its removal.",
      "On iOS, attackers deliver the malware through fake software frameworks or enterprise provisioning profiles, often disguised as legitimate components. Once installed, SparkKitty uses a method native to Apple\u2019s Objective-C programming language to run as soon as the app launches. It checks the app\u2019s internal configuration files to decide whether to execute, then quietly starts monitoring the user\u2019s photo library.",
      "On Android, SparkKitty hides in apps written in Java or Kotlin and sometimes uses malicious Xposed or LSPosed modules. It activates when the app launches or after a specific screen opens. The malware then decrypts a configuration file from a remote server and begins uploading images, device metadata, and identifiers.",
      "On iOS, attackers deliver the malware through fake software frameworks or enterprise provisioning profiles. (Apple)",
      "Unlike traditional spyware, SparkKitty focuses on photos, especially those containing cryptocurrency recovery phrases, wallet screenshots, IDs, or sensitive documents. Instead of just monitoring activity, SparkKitty uploads images in bulk. This approach makes it easy for criminals to sift through and extract valuable personal data.",
      "1) Stick to trusted developers:\u00a0Avoid downloading obscure apps, especially if they have few reviews or downloads. Always check the developer's name and history before installing anything.",
      "2) Review app permissions:\u00a0Be cautious of apps that request access to your photos, messages, or files without a clear reason. If something feels off, deny the permission or uninstall the app.",
      "3) Keep your device updated:\u00a0Install system and security updates as soon as they are available. These updates often patch vulnerabilities that malware can exploit.",
      "4) Use mobile security software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious software is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Both Apple and Google removed the identified apps after being alerted, but questions remain about how SparkKitty bypassed their app review processes in the first place. As app stores grow, both in volume and complexity, the tools used to screen them will need to evolve at the same pace. Otherwise, incidents like this one will continue to slip through the cracks.",

      "Thanks to a team at the University of California, Davis, there's a new brain-computer interface (BCI) system that's opening up real-time, natural conversation for people who can't speak. \"Cyberguy\" Kurt Knutsson explains.",
      "When someone loses the ability to speak because of a neurological condition like ALS, the impact goes far beyond words. It touches every part of daily life, from sharing a joke with family to simply asking for help. Now, thanks to a team at the University of California, Davis, there's a new brain-computer interface (BCI) system that's opening up real-time, natural conversation for people who can't speak. This technology isn't just about converting thoughts into text. Instead, it translates the brain signals that would normally control the muscles used for speech, allowing users to \"talk\" and even \"sing\" through a computer, almost instantly.",

      "There's a new brain-computer interface (BCI) system that's opening up real-time, natural conversation for people who can't speak. (UC Davis)",
      "Real-time speech through brain signals",
      "The heart of this system is four microelectrode arrays, surgically implanted in the part of the brain responsible for producing speech. These tiny devices pick up the neural activity that happens when someone tries to speak. The signals are then fed into an AI-powered decoding model, which converts them into audible speech in just ten milliseconds. That's so fast, it feels as natural as a regular conversation.",
      "What's especially remarkable is that the system can recreate the user's own voice, thanks to a voice cloning algorithm trained on recordings made before the onset of ALS. This means the person's digital voice sounds like them, not a generic computer voice. The system even recognizes when the user is trying to sing and can change the pitch to match simple melodies. It can also pick up on vocal nuances, like asking a question, emphasizing a word, or making interjections such as \"aah,\" \"ooh,\" or \"hmm.\" All of this adds up to a much more expressive and human-sounding conversation than previous technologies could offer.",
      "It translates the brain signals that would normally control the muscles used for speech, allowing users to \"talk\" and even \"sing\" through a computer, almost instantly. (UC Davis)",
      "How the technology works",
      "The process starts with the participant attempting to speak sentences shown on a screen. As they try to form each word, the electrodes capture the firing patterns of hundreds of neurons. The AI learns to map these patterns to specific sounds, reconstructing speech in real-time. This approach allows for subtle control over speech rhythm and tone, giving the user the ability to interrupt, emphasize, or ask questions just as anyone else would.",
      "One of the most striking outcomes from the UC Davis study was that listeners could understand nearly 60 percent of the synthesized words, compared to just four percent without the BCI. The system also handled new, made-up words that weren't part of its training data, showing its flexibility and adaptability.",
      "The AI learns to map these patterns to specific sounds, reconstructing speech in real-time.\u00a0 (UC Davis)",
      "The impact on daily life",
      "Being able to communicate in real-time, with one's own voice and personality, is a game-changer for people living with paralysis. The UC Davis team points out that this technology allows users to be more included in conversations. They can interrupt, respond quickly, and express themselves with nuance. This is a big shift from earlier systems that only translated brain signals into text, which often led to slow, stilted exchanges that felt more like texting than talking.",
      "As David Brandman, the neurosurgeon involved in the study, put it, our voice is a core part of our identity. Losing it is devastating, but this kind of technology offers real hope for restoring that essential part of who we are.",
      "The UC Davis team points out that this technology allows users to be more included in conversations. (UC Davis)",
      "Looking ahead: Next steps and challenges",
      "While these early results are promising, the researchers are quick to point out that the technology is still in its early stages. So far, it's only been tested with one participant, so more studies are needed to see how well it works for others, including people with different causes of speech loss, like stroke. The BrainGate2 clinical trial at UC Davis Health is continuing to enroll participants to further refine and test the system.",
      "The technology is still in its early stages. (UC Davis)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Restoring natural, expressive speech to people who have lost their voices is one of the most meaningful advances in brain-computer interface technology. This new system from UC Davis shows that it's possible to bring real-time, personal conversation back into the lives of those affected by paralysis. While there's still work to be done, the progress so far is giving people a chance to reconnect with their loved ones and the world around them in a way that truly feels like their own.",

Since the store operates around the clock without breaks, it maximizes both convenience for shoppers and revenue for operators. Eliminating on-site staff dramatically reduces overhead, allowing for competitive pricing and improved profitability.",
      "Security is a major focus for VenHub. The store uses bulletproof glass to protect inventory and customers. If one robot requires maintenance, the other can take over, ensuring reliable service with minimal downtime. VenHub's design is also environmentally conscious, featuring compact, energy-efficient layouts and optional solar power compatibility to reduce its carbon footprint. Each store can be customized to fit local demand, whether that means stocking snacks, electronics, or other essentials.",

      "The human factor: Are robots replacing jobs or creating new ones?",
      "A common concern with automation is the impact on jobs. VenHub's robots do replace some traditional retail roles, but the company emphasizes that new opportunities are emerging. Skilled workers are needed to maintain, restock, and support the automated systems, shifting the workforce toward higher-paying, tech-focused positions. This trend reflects a broader shift in the economy, where automation often transforms jobs rather than eliminating them.",

      "VenHub smart store pricing and ownership: What you need to know",
      "If you're considering bringing a VenHub Smart Store to your city, here's a quick breakdown of the costs and what's included. The price for a VenHub Smart Store ranges from $250,000 to $275,000, depending on your chosen configuration. To secure your spot in the production queue, you'll need a $2,500 pre-order deposit, which is fully refundable up until production begins. Financing is available through select financial institutions, with some buyers qualifying for up to 100% financing. However, all arrangements are handled directly between you and the lender; VenHub does not influence approval decisions.",
      "Once you own a VenHub Smart Store, it's yours outright; there are no leases or franchise agreements. You have complete control over pricing, inventory, and restocking, and you can manage replenishment yourself or use VenHub's preferred fulfillment partners. A monthly software-as-a-service fee of $2,500 covers software updates, AI analytics, remote monitoring, and cloud-based management tools. If you require additional support, an optional maintenance package is available for $1,300 per month, which includes servicing and preventive care.",
      "VenHub does not secure locations for you, but they do offer guidance on choosing high-traffic spots, such as shopping centers, universities, business districts, or commuter hubs, to help maximize your store's performance. With high demand and expanding production capacity, VenHub is working to deliver stores to new owners as quickly as possible across the country.",

Watching robots like Barb and Peter grab your order in just seconds is pretty impressive, but what's even more remarkable is that this technology is already making shopping quicker, safer, and a whole lot easier. As these smart stores start popping up in more places across the country, they might totally change not just how we shop. It's interesting to consider that this kind of smart, connected retail experience could soon become something we all use every day, without even thinking twice about it.",

      "Moving a building of this size is tough enough, but the challenge is multiplied by Zhangyuan's dense web of narrow alleys and closely packed historic buildings. Traditional relocation methods simply would not fit. The area's historic significance also means that any mistake could damage irreplaceable architecture, including the 1928 \"great hall\" that once housed a patriotic night school.",

      "Instead of using cranes or bulldozers, engineers put 432 small walking robots to work. These robots gently lift the building and slowly move it forward, inch by inch, covering about 33 feet each day. To achieve this incredible level of precision, the project relies on several advanced technologies. Special low-clearance drilling robots, which can be operated remotely, navigate tight corridors and doorways to create new foundations beneath the historic structure.",

Engineers also use building information modeling and point cloud scanning to create highly detailed 3D blueprints. These digital models help the team plan exact movement routes, avoid potential collisions and design curved paths for removing soil.",

      "Social media challenges prompt users to create more \"content that elicits a reaction,\" Bark Technologies CMO Titania Jordan said. (Friendswood Police Department\u00a0)",
      "\"Reports of doors being kicked in on homes began to come in during the middle of the night. Officers have collected evidence from neighborhoods indicating that a social media trend called the \u2018Door Kicking Challenge\u2019 is behind these acts,\" the Byesville Police Department said in a Facebook post. \"The suspects are not entering the homes; instead, they are merely kicking the front doors and then fleeing the scene.\"",
      "Byesville police added that authorities are collecting physical evidence from the scenes of these crimes, including video footage.",
      "\"The criminal charges aren\u2019t even the worst thing that could happen to you. You could lose your life.\"",
      "Byesville PD Chief Daulton Dolan told Fox News Digital that the door-kick challenges take \"ding dong ditch\" to a new level, especially in stand-your-ground states like Ohio.",
      "\"If you feel that your life or a life of your family members are threatened, you can take deadly force against somebody right there on the spot. \u2026 So, for instance, if someone kicks open [a] door in the middle of the night, and the homeowner believes that they're coming in can physically harm them, they're going to shoot at them if they have a gun nearby,\" Dolan said. \"And in Southeast Ohio \u2026 we've seen that before.\"",
      "The door-kick challenge can lead to charges ranging from trespassing to property damage. (Niketa Rae)",
      "Additionally, in Ohio, if a person's leg enters another person's home by kicking a door in, that can result in a burglary charge, on top of possibly trespassing charges, Dolan explained.",
      "Homeowners might also face a lengthy process in the criminal justice system if they choose to defend themselves with a gun if someone kicks their door open, Dolan said.",
      "\"Our job would be: if the homeowner did fire a weapon if somebody had kicked open their door, we would conduct an investigation into that. Of course, we would seize the weapon that was used in it as evidence. We would take any kind of interviews and reports, medical exams, pictures, measurements, everything \u2026 and then we would turn it over to the Guernsey County Prosecutor's Office \u2026 [who] can rule it out as a justified homicide or they can move it up further and go to a grand jury.\"",
      "The Fleetwood Police Department in Pennsylvania on June 8 warned that a \"TikTok \u2018door knock\u2019 or \u2018door kick\u2019 challenge encourages kids and teens to record themselves doing just that; knocking on and/or kicking random doors, usually late at night.\"",

      "\"This trend has been reported across the country, including right here in Texas,\" the Fort Worth PD said. \"It is imperative that individuals partaking in this trend understand that even if no burglary or theft occur, this behavior is illegal and considered vandalism and can lead to criminal charges. More critically, it can be mistaken as an attempted break-in, potentially prompting dangerous or defensive responses from homeowners.\"",

      "Ari Lightman, professor of digital media and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy, told Fox News Digital that social media trends resemble what used to be games of truth-or-dare \"on steroids.\"",
      "\"Especially in states that have stand-your-ground laws, very, very worrisome.\"",
      "\"You're reaching tens of thousands of people. You're not daring somebody face-to-face,\" Lightman said. \"Why are they doing that? Is it just to get likes, and those likes might turn into followers, and those followers might turn into advertisers, and those advertisers might turn into profits for some people? Is it even real, or is it AI generated?\"",
      "Defenders of the UrbanEx trend say it exposes historically significant structures that have been left to rot; many social media users have been calling on local city leaders to revive abandoned schools, houses, churches and event spaces.",

      "\"Maybe your kid's playing Roblox and you don't think it's safe. Google dangers of Roblox. Show your child how other children have been harmed by adults they have been lured by on that platform so they realize you're not just being overprotective,\" she said.",
      "\"All you can do is have candid calm conversations with them, and not just talking to them or talking at them, but asking them what they've seen. What did they think? What do they think the dangers are of hanging around an old building and recording it? Maybe they say they don't know, and that can encourage a conversation right there.\"",

      "The investigation into Suzanne Morphew's disappearance appeared to be at a standstill following the dismissal of Barry Morphew's murder charge in 2022. That changed when investigators found a rare chemical compound inside her body, which prosecutors say ties Barry Morphew directly to her death.",
      "Barry Morphew was arrested near Phoenix, Arizona on June 20 following a grand jury indictment for allegedly killing his wife, 49-year-old Suzanne Morphew, a mother of two, who vanished on Mother's Day in 2020.

      "This new wave of paranoia and fear, he explained, mirrors tactics seen in North Korea \u2014 where citizens vanish without explanation and information is tightly controlled. During the recent conflict, Iran\u2019s leadership imposed a total internet blackout to isolate the population, blocking Israeli evacuation alerts, and pushed propaganda that framed Israel as targeting civilians indiscriminately.",

      "Earlier this week, President Donald Trump signed an executive order lifting most U.S. sanctions on Syria, in a move experts say reflects growing recognition inside the administration that Syria, long a battleground for Iranian influence and Islamist terror, may now offer the U.S. a rare opportunity to reclaim regional leverage, counter enemies, and support allies like Israel and Jordan.",
      "At a White House press briefing Monday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, \"This is another promise made and promise kept by this president,\" she said, referring to Trump\u2019s recent meeting with Syria\u2019s new transitional leader Ahmed al-Sharaa during a trip to Saudi Arabia. \"He\u2019s committed to supporting a Syria that is stable, unified, and at peace with itself and its neighbors.\"",
      "\"The sanctions did their job,\" David Schenker, former assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs and now a senior fellow at the Washington Institute, told Fox News Digital. \"They were crippling by and large.

A Syria that no longer hosts Iranian proxies, cooperates on counterterrorism, and integrates with Arab neighbors serves U.S. interests on every front.\"",
      "According to Schenker, Syria has taken steps the U.S. has long demanded: allowing inspections by the IAEA and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, sharing intelligence on ISIS, and cooperating with American liaison officers on counterterrorism. \"These groups have declared al-Sharaa an infidel. They themselves are being attacked by ISIS,\" he noted.",

      "Ali described the current moment as part of a broader Trump strategy: \"Now with Assad gone, it\u2019s another blow to the Islamic Republic of Iran. This creates an opportunity to coalesce the Sunni Arab states \u2013 either around the Abraham Accords or a growing anti-Iran coalition.\"",
      "The U.S. military still maintains a small but critical footprint in Syria \u2013 approximately 1,000 troops across three to four bases in the northeast \u2013 providing vital intelligence and rapid strike capability. \"That footprint has been one of our most important counterterrorism outposts,\" Ali said. \"We\u2019ve seen multiple targeted operations this year alone.\"",

      "He said, however, that deeper U.S.-Syrian cooperation could bring new complications. \"There\u2019s always a risk that as ties deepen, either the U.S. could reduce its presence \u2013 or al-Sharaa might ask us to scale back,\" Ali said. \"That could impact our ability to monitor jihadist activity or manage the tens of thousands of ISIS detainees still in camps guarded by SDF forces.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the diplomatic implications of Trump\u2019s move are drawing global attention. Syria\u2019s new leadership has publicly distanced itself from Iran, reportedly blocked Hezbollah weapon shipments, and dismantled multiple Iranian military posts across the country.",
      "\"The president is genuinely focused on expanding the Abraham Accords,\" said Schenker. \"He sees Syria as the next possible candidate.\"",
      "White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Fox News Digital. \"President Trump is working towards lasting peace in the Middle East, which includes supporting a Syria that is stable, unified, and at peace with itself and its neighbors. The President is empowering Syria\u2019s success by lifting sanctions on export controls while maintaining sanctions on terrorists and all other potential threats to the United States. The President made a promise to give Syria a chance to rebuild and thrive by lifting sanctions, and this President keeps his promises.\"",
      "A masked Islamic State terrorist holds the ISIS flag in 2015. (Pictures from History/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)",
      "Still, normalization with Israel remains politically fraught. Syria remains officially at war with the Jewish state, and while Sharaa has hinted at accepting the pre-1974 ceasefire lines, jihadist factions and Islamist groups within Syria remain staunchly opposed. \"There have already been reported assassination attempts on Sharaa,\" Schenker said. \"It\u2019s going to get harder if he moves from non-belligerency to full normalization.\"",
      "Charles Lister, director of the Syria program at the Middle East Institute, told Fox News Digital, \"Syria has always been an open wound in the center of the region \u2013 an engine of instability\u2026 But if it stabilizes now, it unlocks a path for broader regional integration. It connects Israel and Jordan to a more secure arc and reduces the need for heavy U.S. military involvement.\"",

      "Ahead of his 90th birthday on Sunday, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism laid out his succession plans in a recorded statement that was televised at a religious gathering of Buddhist monks in the town of Dharamshala, India. Originally named Tenzin Gyatso, he became what is traditionally known as the 14th reincarnation of the Dalai Lama in 1940. He fled Tibet when Chinese troops crushed an uprising in the Tibetan capital Lhasa in 1959.",

      "Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama can choose the body into which he is reincarnated, as has happened on 14 occasions since the creation of the institution in 1587. He has reiterated in the past that his successor would be born outside China. After fleeing Tibet, the current Dalai Lama helped establish a democratic Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamshala, while also traveling the world to advocate autonomy for the Tibetan people.",

      "Once a fringe militia born of revolution, Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has grown into the regime\u2019s most feared and powerful force. But according to Dr. Afshon Ostovar, a leading expert on Iran and author of \"Vanguard of the Imam: Religion, Politics, and Iran's Revolutionary Guards,\" said the recent U.S. and Israeli strikes in Iran may have permanently altered its trajectory.",

(AHMAD AL-RUBAYE/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "\"What the IRGC tried to achieve over the last 25 years is basically toast,\" Ostovar told Fox News Digital, \"Their campaign to build a military deterrent at home through missiles and nuclear enrichment, and to expand regionally through proxies, has essentially collapsed.\"",
      "Founded in the wake of the 1979 revolution, the IRGC was created to safeguard and spread the Islamic Republic\u2019s values \u2014 often through violence. Ostovar describes how its legitimacy evolved over time, initially drawn from the overthrow of the Shah, then the Iran-Iraq War, and later through the manufactured narrative of an eternal struggle with the U.S. and Israel.",
      "Behnam Ben Taleblu, Senior Director of FDD's Iran Program Behnam Ben Taleblu, told Fox News Digital the IRGC\u2019s origin reflects a deep mistrust of Iran\u2019s traditional military, which had remained loyal to the Shah.",
      "\"The IRGC were created through efforts to collect pro-regime armed gangs called Komitehs. They enforced revolutionary edicts and developed a parallel and ideological military force due to clerical skepticism in the national army,\" he explained.",

      "\"The IRGC are tasked with preserving and defending the revolution in Iran,\" Taleblu said. \"That\u2019s one reason why the 1979 Islamic Revolution has not been tamed, nor has the regime\u2019s extremism lost any luster. If anything, terrorism and hostage-taking have continued.\"",
      "\"They created a boogeyman in the U.S. and Israel,\" Ostovar added. \"But today, that ideology no longer resonates with most Iranians. The majority want better relations with the West and are tired of the regime\u2019s isolationist stance.\"",
      "Today, the IRGC is deeply intertwined with the clerical elite. \"The IRGC and the clerical elite are partners in power, treating Iran as a springboard to export their revolution,\" Taleblu noted.",
      "EXILED IRANIAN PRINCE TELLS TRUMP HE CAN BE 'ONE OF HISTORY'S GREAT PEACEMAKERS' AMID TALK OF REGIME CHANGE",
      "Over the past year, Iran has suffered a series of strategic defeats: Hezbollah has been degraded in Lebanon, Hamas crippled in Gaza, Syria effectively lost, and Iranian military infrastructure \u2014 including nuclear and missile sites \u2014 destroyed in many cases by U.S. and Israeli strikes. Ostovar says these losses have decimated the IRGC\u2019s regional footprint and forced the regime to reevaluate its strategy.",
      "\"They can try to rebuild everything \u2014 but that would take too long and be too difficult,\" he said. \"More likely, we\u2019ll see them repress harder at home and lean on China and Russia to rebuild conventional military capabilities like air defense and advanced jets.\"",
      "Members of the Iranian revolutionary guard march during a parade. The IRGC is designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department. A large part of its work is to covertly operate outside of Iran. (Reuters)",
      "Internally, the IRGC\u2019s economic empire is also under growing strain. Sanctions, cyberattacks, and battlefield losses have made operations far more difficult. Ostovar said that foreign banks avoid any connection with Iran out of fear they may inadvertently deal with IRGC-linked entities, forcing the group to operate through front companies abroad. \"They\u2019ve lost a lot, and now they\u2019ll have to redirect their limited resources to rebuild. That\u2019s going to stretch them even thinner.\"",
      "ISRAEL'S 'RESOUNDING' MILITARY CAMPAIGN AGAINST IRAN COULD BE HISTORIC TURNING POINT, EXPERTS SAY",
      "Despite these pressures, both Ostovar and Taleblu agree that the IRGC is unlikely to turn against the regime. \"Much like the regime elite, the IRGC is at a crossroads,\" Taleblu said. \"They have lost much of their strategic brain trust, but are likely to remain loyal for a combination of ideological and material reasons \u2014 so long as the status quo doesn\u2019t change.\"",
      "Looking ahead, Iran may shift focus inward, relying more on domestic repression than on external terror. \"They can\u2019t get weapons into Gaza. They\u2019ve lost access to Lebanon. They may still attempt terrorism, but they\u2019ve failed repeatedly \u2014 especially against Israeli targets,\" Ostovar said. \"In contrast, repressing their own people is something they can do easily.\"",
      "He warns that Iran could become \"more insular, more autocratic \u2014 more like North Korea than what it is today.\" While regime collapse is always a possibility, Ostovar believes autocracies are often resilient. \"Look at Venezuela or Cuba \u2014 they\u2019ve run their countries into the ground but still hold on to power.\"",
      "In this photo released by the Iranian Red Crescent Society rescuers work at the scene of an explosion after an Israeli strike in Tehran, Iran, Friday, June 13, 2025. (Iranian Red Crescent Society via AP)",
      "Ostovar thinks change \u2014 and not for the better \u2014 could come via generational shift. \"The IRGC\u2019s younger cadre is less religious but no less hardline,\" he said. \"They may not care about hijabs, but they\u2019ve spent the last two decades fighting the U.S. and Israel in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. That\u2019s the war they know.\"",
      "Some reformist elements within the regime envision a different path \u2014 one focused on normalization and growth. \"They want to preserve the regime not by fighting the world, but by opening up to it,\" Ostovar said. \"They look more to Vietnam or China as models.\"",

      "Taleblu warned that despite recent setbacks, the IRGC\u2019s grip remains strong. \"Right now, the Guards have power without accountability, wielding political, economic, and military influence in Iranian policy.

      "\u201cAny student not fully vaccinated without exemption will be excluded from school,\u201d Newton Public Schools Superintendent Anna Nolin wrote in a memo last month. The directive followed a chickenpox outbreak among students, as well as rising threats of measles, Nolin said.",
      "But unvaccinated students without medical reasons to forgo the shots can still get a pass to attend class in Massachusetts: a religious exemption.",
      "According to state immunization data, vaccination rates among kindergartners in Massachusetts have been falling \u2014 from 95.9% in 2020 to 94.3% this past school year \u2014 as the proportion of students with religious exemptions has risen: 0.93% in 2020 to 1.33% currently.",

      "Massachusetts isn\u2019t alone. Vaccination rates have been falling across the United States for years.",
      "Clamping down on vaccination exemptions raises rates",
      "In the past decade, California, Connecticut, Maine and New York have removed such exemptions in an effort to drive up vaccination rates.",
      "It seems to be working. Maine, for example, had one of the country\u2019s highest vaccination opt-out rates in 2017, at 5.3%. Two years later, in 2019, it passed a law that eliminated religious and philosophical exemptions to vaccinations.",
      "Since then, Maine\u2019s kindergarten MMR vaccination rate has climbed from less than 94% to nearly 98%.",

      "The actions come at a critical time in America\u2019s vaccination history. The country is on track to have the largest measles outbreak in decades, with 1,267 cases already logged this year.",
      "While the majority of parents support vaccination, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has repeatedly undermined the shots\u2019 safety and effectiveness.",
      "Childhood immunization rates fell during the pandemic for several reasons. Children were less likely to get their annual well-checks during lockdown. And misinformation about Covid shots stoked fears about vaccines in general.",
      "The percentage of students with religious exemptions in Hawaii doubled during that time, from 2% before the pandemic to 4% last year, according to the state Health Department.",
      "Hawaii legislators proposed a bill to end exemptions based on religion, but it stalled after a massive public backlash.",
      "Meanwhile, Kennedy has doubled down on vaccine distrust. In June, he abruptly fired every member of the federal government\u2019s group of nonpartisan, independent experts charged with advising the administration on vaccines, appointing instead several known anti-vaccine activists.",
      "Religious concerns about vaccination?",
      "Most states and Washington, D.C., allow parents to opt out of vaccination requirements based on religious or philosophical views.",
      "Mississippi lawmakers added a religious vaccination exemption in 2023.",
      "In Texas, where an ongoing outbreak of measles in southwest Texas has killed two children, legislation in front of state lawmakers would make it easier for parents to be notified about and obtain vaccination exemptions.",
      "There is no indication, however, that any of the world\u2019s major religions oppose vaccination.",
      "Catholic popes, for example, have a long history of supporting immunizations. In a 2021 video message, Pope Francis urged people to get the Covid shot, calling it \u201can act of love.\u201d",
      "\u201cGetting vaccinated is a simple yet profound way to care for one another, especially the most vulnerable,\u201d he said.",
      "Jewish law supports vaccination. Islamic law does, too. The Dalai Lama, Tibetan Buddhism\u2019s highest spiritual leader, has personally given polio vaccinations to children.",
      "One possible sticking point in some religions is a concern that vaccines contain fetal cells.",
      "The concern is unfounded, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. \u201cSome vaccines involve growing viruses in human cell cultures originally developed from two aborted fetuses in the 1960s. These cell lines are still going, so no new aborted fetuses are ever needed,\u201d the group writes on its website. \u201cPurification processes filter the vaccine during production, and no fetal tissue remains.\u201d",
      "Still, the number of kids whose caregivers are opting them out of routine childhood vaccines has reached an all-time high, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Experts said the findings reflect Americans\u2019 growing unease about medicine in general.",
      "Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, a pediatrician at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado and a spokesman for the pediatrics academy, said the group\u2019s official policy \u201cis that there should be no nonmedical exemptions for vaccines,\u201d including religion. (Some children have weakened immune systems because of cancer treatments or organ transplantation and can\u2019t be vaccinated.)",
      "Otherwise, \u201cthere\u2019s no legitimate reason not to be vaccinated,\u201d he said. \u201cThe benefits of vaccines clearly outweigh the risks.\u201d"

      "Two weeks into Tesla\u2019s robotaxi prototype rollout on the streets of Austin, Texas, a string of viral videos showing apparent mishaps and the severely limited access to the service have caused a cloud of confusion and concern around the vehicles and their safety.",
      "Tesla launched its Austin service on June 22. People who\u2019ve gotten an invitation, a group that appears to be composed largely of influencers adjacent to and acolytes of CEO Elon Musk, use an app to call for a ride, similar to ride-hailing apps Uber and Lyft. Each ride costs $4.20, a cannabis-associated number that Musk frequently uses.",
      "The service is somewhat of a prototype. Although no human is in the driver\u2019s seat, each car has a company employee in the front passenger seat who can stop the car with a button if there are safety concerns. Tesla says its experimental software is driving the vehicles.",
      "Experts in the field of autonomous driving say it\u2019s too early to judge the success or failure of the venture. Federal regulators and some local and state politicians say they\u2019re concerned about several incidents \u2014 documented on camera and shared on social media \u2014 where the cars appeared to break traffic laws or put people in danger. Some people who\u2019ve used competing robotaxi services, such as Google spinoff Waymo, yawned at what they considered old technology. Even the stock market shrugged off the launch, with no lasting imprint on Tesla\u2019s share price.",
      "Tesla did not respond to requests for comment on how the service is going. Several key metrics, such as how many miles it has driven and how often Tesla employees need to intervene with the driving software, remain mysteries. Because the service operates only in Texas, where there are currently minimal rules surrounding autonomous vehicles, the company is not required to report such information to regulators at any level of government.",
      "In the first days of the rollout, videos of Tesla robotaxis appearing to violate traffic laws or behave oddly proliferated online. In one, a Tesla dropping off a passenger did so in the middle of an intersection. In another, a Tesla drives on the wrong side of a double yellow line. In at least two videos, its robotaxis are traveling faster than the posted speed limit. And in several examples, the Tesla cars brake suddenly and passengers say they were confused as to why.",
      "In all, NBC News found 13 instances in videos online where a Tesla appeared to break the rules or otherwise make a mistake. In each case, NBC News contacted the people who made the videos but did not hear back.",
      "Some elected officials in Austin said they\u2019re worried about the incidents.",
      "\u201cThere are just a lot of errors,\u201d said Vanessa Fuentes, a member of the Austin City Council and the mayor pro tempore, meaning she runs council meetings when the mayor is absent, in a phone interview. \u201cThey have proven that the technology they have is unsafe for Austinites.\u201d",
      "And while other autonomous vehicle companies such as Waymo or former General Motors unit Cruise have been documented on camera making embarrassing or illegal maneuvers, Fuentes said that she doesn\u2019t believe Tesla has coordinated enough with the city government \u2014 which Tesla is not legally required to do, but she said would build trust.",
      "\u201cTesla has had no regard for public input or working with our city, and unfortunately, I\u2019m not OK having this done at the expense of Austinites\u2019 safety,\u201d she said. She said she embraces autonomous vehicles in the city as a general matter but would like to see Tesla\u2019s service halted for now.",
      "Zo Qadri, an Austin City Council member whose district overlaps with the Tesla robotaxi service area, said he is hearing from people in his district who are worried.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been seeing chaos unfold. We have a lot of constituents who are very angry,\u201d he said.",
      "He said the situation reminded him of problems associated with Cruise robotaxis in Austin in 2023, when residents complained that Cruise cars were making unsafe turns and being a nuisance. Cruise shuttered last year. Qadri said he has not heard similar complaints from constituents about Waymo, which also operates there.",
      "It\u2019s not clear whether Tesla could face local consequences for such incidents, such as traffic tickets, for breaking any laws. Fuentes said the process in Austin for ticketing a robotaxi is more complicated than simply writing a ticket for a driver: A police officer must draft a complaint affidavit, send it to a lieutenant, and then have the affidavit witnessed and sent to a municipal court.",
      "The Austin Police Department said in a statement:",
      "\u201cAs with any company operating autonomous technology on public roadways, when a potential legal or safety concern is brought to our attention, we promptly share it with the company. These concerns are then addressed through our regular meetings, where we follow up on the issue and review the steps taken to resolve it. Our priority is to maintain public safety while supporting innovation in transportation,\u201d the department said.",
      "Federal regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also took notice of the safety incidents, saying in a statement June 23 that the agency \u201cis aware of the referenced incidents and is in contact with the manufacturer to gather additional information.\u201d",
      "Texas state Rep. Vikki Goodwin, a Democrat whose district includes part of Austin, said she wants Tesla to proceed cautiously.",
      "\u201cI think that it\u2019s in their interest to make sure safety is top of mind and that nothing goes wrong. Otherwise, that could really derail their plans for launching it fully,\u201d she said.",
      "Goodwin was one of seven Texas lawmakers who sent a letter to Tesla on June 18 asking for the company to delay the launch of its robotaxis until Sept. 1 \u2014 the day a new law regarding autonomous vehicles is set to go into effect. Tesla did not delay its launch, but Goodwin said the company did respond to their letter, saying it would update its policies to ensure that it would be compliant with the new law.",
      "Goodwin said part of her desire for caution comes from owning a Tesla herself and experiencing unexpected maneuvers while using the company\u2019s driver-assistance software.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had personal experience with using cruise control and having the car brake for me, which can be very disturbing,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had that experience on a number of occasions, and it just leads me to believe that it really is important to have a person in the vehicle.\u201d",
      "Tesla is aiming to compete with Waymo, which says it has about 1,500 robotaxis on the road in several cities including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Phoenix. Musk said Tesla\u2019s service would start small with 10-20 vehicles and try to grow over the next several months, although how quickly it could expand is not clear.",
      "Tesla\u2019s stock price soared the day after its service launched on a Sunday, jumping more than 9% on the following Monday. But the stock, which is often volatile, retreated over the following days as it became clear how many hurdles Tesla faces in trying to scale up the service.",
      "The public knows about the safety incidents involving Tesla robotaxis mainly because Tesla sent many of the initial invitations to use the service to online influencers, including people with YouTube channels or similar video platforms.",
      "The invitations were so scarce that at least one Tesla influencer, a person named Omar who goes by the pseudonym Whole Mars Catalog, offered to share rides for $10. \u201cTake a Tesla Robotaxi ride round trip with Omar. Includes two rides, there and back,\u201d the person\u2019s sponsorship page said. The $10 would be more than the combined cost of two $4.20 rides. The account did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Eliana Sheriff was among the early riders. A video creator with a YouTube channel focused on Musk\u2019s rocket company SpaceX, she said she came away a fan of the robotaxi service.",
      "\u201cI was totally trusting of the technology,\u201d she said in a YouTube video on her channel, \u201cEllie in Space.\u201d",
      "She did have one complaint. After she reached her destination in the robotaxi, a storm appeared overhead and she wanted to stay in the car to shelter. A Tesla customer service agent called into the car\u2019s audio system to say that she couldn\u2019t. She exited and called a second ride to take her back to where she started. (Some posts online said erroneously that Tesla kicked her out midride, but she said in an interview that she did reach her destination.)",
      "Sheriff said that despite some concerns in the automotive and tech industries over whether Tesla\u2019s technology is good enough to deploy robotaxis, she has faith in Musk to pursue the best approach.",
      "\u201cElon must have a reason for why he believes in that,\u201d she said.",
      "She\u2019s not alone. Since the robotaxi launch, the legions of Musk and Tesla fans have proclaimed their enthusiasm for the service across the internet: on X, the social media app that Musk owns, and on other apps such as Reddit and TikTok. And they\u2019ve employed a wide variety of superlatives to describe the robotaxis: \u201cflawless,\u201d \u201cseamless\u201d and \u201chistory-making.\u201d",
      "But because the service is invite-only, with only a handful of cars on the road, almost no consumers who aren\u2019t Tesla fans have gotten to use the service firsthand.",
      "Musk and his fans have described the service as futuristic and groundbreaking, but the rollout has succeeded mainly in preaching to Tesla\u2019s already-converted choir of supporters.",
      "Brad Templeton, a consultant in the autonomous vehicle industry who worked for Google\u2019s self-driving car project from 2010 to 2013 before it became Waymo, said Tesla\u2019s most enthusiastic fans are \u201call fairly convinced that it\u2019s just on the cusp of being ready, and they get really annoyed when other people don\u2019t see it.\u201d",
      "Like other experts, Templeton said the only measure for robotaxis that counts is whether they\u2019re safe over the very long term, measured in the tens of millions of miles driven.",
      "\u201cWhat matters is not individual demonstrations. It\u2019s statistics,\u201d he said.",
      "Many of the Tesla and Waymo fans clash head-to-head on Reddit, where the message board r/SelfDrivingCars has been heating up with competition between the two sides. Waymo boosters regularly argue on the site that the company is years ahead of Tesla in experience: Waymo had paying customers in its first market, Phoenix, while still using safety drivers in December 2018 \u2014 six and a half years ago. Waymo began \u201crider only\u201d rides in 2019.",
      "Lately, some Tesla fans have been pushing back by highlighting videos of what they considered to be Waymo vehicles driving poorly, including stopping in standing water.",
      "One Reddit user, in a popular recent post, vented that the r/SelfDrivingCars message board was being \u201cflooded with Tesla apologist propaganda and disinformation. \u2026 The astroturf army is out in full display these past couple weeks.\u201d",
      "The top comment on the post asked for a truce.",
      "\u201cI want to see progress by both companies,\u201d the Reddit user Juice805 wrote. \u201cWaymo is doing great and is quite far ahead in their rollout and Tesla just made a huge first step in theirs.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just want cars to drive themselves,\u201d they wrote. They did not respond to a request for comment."

    "published": "Sat, 05 Jul 2025 10:30:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Accessing reading material in prisons is hard, but 'Freedom Reads' founder and former inmate Reginald Betts went beyond books, creating libraries made by former prisoners.",
    "story": [
      "Maria Montalvo speaks with emotion, her eyes shining as she recounts her reading experiences. She says she especially enjoys books by Isabel Allende, Octavia Butler, Toni Morrison, Erika L. S\u00e1nchez and John Grisham because, in her words, \u201creading makes you wiser and you learn how people live in other countries. It takes your mind to other places you can\u2019t travel to.\u201d",
      "Montalvo isn\u2019t an ordinary reader. During her incarceration at Edna Mahan Correctional Facility, a prison in New Jersey, she has participated in the activities of Freedom Reads, a nonprofit organization that has been promoting reading in U.S. prisons since 2020.",
      "\u201cFreedom Reads has brought books on different topics, and it\u2019s very important to read because it makes you wiser,\u201d Montalvo, 60, said in an interview with Noticias Telemundo. \u201cBooks change the prison climate; they change the way people think about themselves. This opens your mind and makes you want to change.\u201d",
      "Montalvo proudly recalled the arrival of the books at her prison in May.",
      "\"They brought two bookcases that are very symbolic and very important, because they relate to literature, justice and writers like Martin Luther King,\u201d she said.",
      "The origin of Freedom Reads is closely linked to the life of Reginald Dwayne Betts, who pleaded guilty to car theft at age 16 and was sentenced to nine years in the Virginia prison system.",
      "\"In prison, I discovered books. I became a poet and also a very good communicator. I was able to make friendships and connections that have lasted decades. Books gave me an understanding of the world,\u201d Betts said in an interview with Noticias Telemundo.",
      "Years later, Betts earned his law degree from Yale University, began publishing books of poetry and won prestigious Guggenheim and MacArthur fellowships, and in 2020, he was one of the founders of Freedom Reads, where he has worked to increase access to books for the U.S. prison population.",
      "Finding reading material in prisons is difficult, Betts said. Most facilities have only one library, which is open a few hours a day and requires a permit to access it.",
      "\u201cI asked myself, \u2018What would a library be?\u2019 And I decided it would be a collection of 500 books, and I called it the Library of Freedom, because I believe in the idea that freedom begins with a book.\"",
      "Betts worked with architects at Mass Design, a nonprofit firm focused on architecture's role in supporting communities and fostering societal healing, and they decided the bookcases' structure should be curved. Many of them are built by former inmates, he said.",
      "The libraries themselves are objects of design, each consisting of two to six freestanding bookshelves, handcrafted from maple, walnut or cherry wood. Betts has fitted the libraries into empty cells for easy access and designed each shelf to be 44 inches tall so as not to obstruct guards\u2019 vision. The curves of each reading structure contrast with the harsh, angular architecture of the prison system.",
      "\"We want to show that it\u2019s possible to be kind in places as violent and dangerous as some prisons, and we\u2019re projecting our idea with libraries we make with our own hands,\u201d he said.",
      "Betts read several books in prison that changed his life. One was \"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\" by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, which he said \u201ctaught [him] to understand Latin America and its people.\u201d",
      "According to figures from the Federal Bureau of Prisons, there are 46,334 Hispanic prisoners in the United States. Therefore, from the beginning of the project, bilingualism has been present, and Spanish-language titles are abundant.",
      "\u201cWe have a list of more than 100 books in Spanish, and it continues to grow every year,\u201d said David P\u00e9rez, Freedom Reads\u2019 library coordinator.",
      "According to the organization, Spanish-language books in the library\u2019s permanent collection include \"The House of Spirits,\" by Isabel Allende; \"I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter,\" by S\u00e1nchez; \"In the Time of the Butterflies,\" by Julia \u00c1lvarez; and \"The Shadow of the Wind,\" by Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n, in addition to classics such as the novels of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and English-language works by Ernest Gaines, William Faulkner and George Orwell.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so pleased that my novel has reached so many unexpected places. I\u2019m proud that incarcerated people find some relief in Julia\u2019s story,\" S\u00e1nchez said in an email about her book. \"She\u2019s a complicated protagonist who wants to escape her circumstances, like many women around the world.\"",
      "'A lot of work ahead of us'",
      "Maria Montalvo was convicted in 1996 of the deaths of her two children in a car fire, which she claimed at the trial was an accident; she's serving a life sentence. During her trial, prosecutors acknowledged that she was \u201cemotionally disturbed\u201d during the incident, which contributed to her not being sentenced to death.",
      "Years later, Montalvo says she has dedicated her time in prison to studying the problems of mass incarceration, reading literary works and engaging with other inmates in reading circles that discuss books in Spanish and English.",
      "\u201cThere are many books in Spanish and English. So you can sit with many of the women who don\u2019t speak English and read a book, but at the same time, another group is reading the same book in English, and you can have a conversation afterward,\u201d she said.",
      "Noticias Telemundo asked the Federal Bureau of Prisons for figures on its prisons' literacy and reading initiatives, but it didn't receive a response about the data. However, spokesperson Scott Taylor said in an email that the bureau closely monitors reading promotion programs like Freedom Reads, which \u201cincludes regular coordination meetings, staff training on safety expectations, and ongoing oversight to address any concerns.\"",
      "In addition, Taylor said, the bureau\u2019s education branch has implemented a strategy focused on literacy and improving language skills for inmates who don't speak English. \u201cBilingual instructions and materials are provided in Spanish and English, supported by digital tools that offer accessible resources for those learning English,\u201d he wrote.",
      "In 2023, research published by the Mackinac Public Policy Center, a nonprofit organization espousing free-market principles, found that prison-based reading, job training and education programs reduce the likelihood of recidivism by 14.8%. It also found a 6.9% increase in the likelihood of employment.",
      "\"I love having conversations with people inside prisons,\u201d P\u00e9rez said. \u201cThey read a lot, and it moves you when you see them crying because they\u2019ve read a poem or a novel \u2014 it\u2019s unique.\u201d",
      "'Having a voice'",
      "Freedom Reads has installed 498 libraries in 50 adult and youth prisons across the United States. It has placed an estimated 280,000 books in the hands of inmates.",
      "\u201cDespite that success, we\u2019ve probably reached less than 1%, maybe 0.5%, of the prisons in this country,\" Betts said. \"We\u2019re not in any federal prisons yet. We\u2019re only in 13 states, and we\u2019re missing more than 30. So we have a lot of work ahead of us.\u201d",
      "Betts' aim is to have libraries in 20,000 prisons.",
      "Since 2023, Freedom Reads has administered the Inside Literary Prize, a literary award judged by incarcerated people. The inaugural award went to Imani Perry\u2019s book \"South to America: A Journey Below the Mason-Dixon to Understand the Soul of a Nation,\" selected by more than 200 judges from 12 prisons across six states.",
      "By 2025, the competition had expanded to include more than 300 judges from 13 prisons in five states, and this year\u2019s edition also included Puerto Rico. Montalvo was part of this year\u2019s jury, and its decision will be announced Thursday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a feeling of inclusion. It makes you realize that what we think about books and what we read matters,\u201d Montalvo said excitedly. \u201cIt\u2019s having a voice.\u201d",
      "An earlier version of this story was first published in Noticias Telemundo."

      "Hopes for an end to the bloody fighting in Gaza appeared to brighten Friday when Hamas announced that it had given a thumbs-up to the latest ceasefire proposal, but added that further talks were needed.",
      "\u201cHamas has completed its internal consultations with Palestinian factions and forces regarding the mediators\u2019 latest proposal to halt the aggression against our people in Gaza,\u201d the Palestinian militant group said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThe movement has submitted a positive response to the mediators,\u201d the statement added. \u201cThe movement is fully prepared to immediately enter into a round of negotiations on the mechanism for implementing this framework.\u201d",
      "The development came just days after President Donald Trump said Israel has \u201cagreed to the necessary conditions\u201d to finalize a 60-day ceasefire deal in the Israel-Hamas war.",
      "But in his first remarks since Trump\u2019s announcement on Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not confirm Trump\u2019s claim and once again called for the elimination of Hamas.",
      "\u201cThere will be no Hamas,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cThere will be no Hamastan. We are not going back to that. It is over. We will release all our hostages.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu is scheduled to visit to the White House on Monday, where he is expected to discuss the situation in Gaza with Trump.",

      "In a statement Wednesday, Hamas said it would be \u201cconducting national consultations\u201d with the final aim of ending the fighting, ensuring the withdrawal of Israeli forces and delivering \u201curgent relief\u201d to the people of Gaza.",
      "The war in Gaza erupted on Oct. 7, 2023, after Hamas launched a bloody surprise attack on Israel that left more than 1,200 people dead. Hamas also took 251 people hostage. And of the remaining hostages in captivity, 28 are presumed to be dead.",
      "Meanwhile, Israel\u2019s attacks in Gaza have killed more than 56,000 people and created a humanitarian crisis in the densely populated Palestinian territory, where most of the 2 million residents have been forced from their homes."

      "In 2018, McMahon returned to Australia to star in a comedy-drama film, \u201cSwinging Safari,\u201d alongside Australian star Kylie Minogue. Minogue was McMahon\u2019s former sister-in-law from McMahon\u2019s first marriage to Minogue\u2019s younger sister, Dannii Minogue, in the 1990s.",

      "\u201cThe attack \u2014 which preliminary information indicates was carried out by two assailants who threw two grenades at the Americans \u2014 occurred at the conclusion of an otherwise successful distribution in which thousands of Gazans safely received food,\u201d the GHF said.",
      "In addition to aid workers, the GHF employs private U.S. military contractors tasked with providing security at their sites.It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack.",

      "Six years after her son was killed by a Seattle police officer involved in multiple deadly encounters, a federal judge cleared the way for Rose Johnson\u2019s excessive force lawsuit to move forward.",
      "U.S. District Judge Thomas Zilly set a tentative trial date of Sept. 15 after an appeals court this year rejected the officer\u2019s claim of qualified immunity, the much-debated legal doctrine that can shield police officers from civil rights claims.",
      "The ruling on March 3 by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is a sign of the incremental change unfolding in courts and statehouses across the country as legislative efforts to reform qualified immunity in Congress have stalled.",
      "To Johnson, who filed the Seattle lawsuit after police fatally shot her son seconds after they kicked down his door on May 8, 2019, the panel\u2019s decision was an important victory on a long and arduous road of trying to heal.",
      "\u201cTrying to move on and heal from the trauma of losing Ryan hasn\u2019t been easier because six years have passed by,\u201d she said of her son, Ryan Smith, 31. \u201cHe was \u2014 and is \u2014my heart and soul.\u201d",
      "Johnson\u2019s lawsuit, filed in 2022 after an NBC News investigation detailed her son\u2019s case, alleges that the \u201cwillful and reckless\u201d conduct of Officer Christopher Myers violated Smith\u2019s constitutional rights and caused his death.",
      "The suit names a second officer as a defendant and accuses the Seattle Police Department of demonstrating \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d by not getting Myers \u2014 who fired his gun in four separate encounters from 2010 to 2019, three of which were fatal \u2014 \u201cprofessional, mental, or other help to assure he stops shooting people.\u201d",
      "Myers has not been disciplined or charged with any crimes in connection with those shootings, though an appeals panel ruled in 2014 that there was little evidence to corroborate his account of the allegedly suspicious behavior that prompted one of them. Myers did not respond to a request for comment. He previously defended his use of lethal force, telling NBC News in 2021 that he never expects an encounter to escalate into a shooting.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, some people don\u2019t yield and sometimes force the situation,\u201d he said.",
      "Lawyers representing the officers and the police department did not respond to a request for comment. The attorneys previously sought to dismiss the lawsuit, claiming in a 2023 filing that city officials could not be held liable because they had not violated Smith\u2019s constitutional rights. Smith posed an imminent and deadly threat when he was fatally shot, they wrote, and the officers were entitled to qualified immunity.",
      "The qualified immunity legal defense, first adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1967, allows law enforcement officers to argue that claims of constitutional violations should be dismissed because the violations were not \u201cclearly established\u201d at the time they occurred.",
      "\u201cThere was no (and is no) case that would put every reasonable officer on notice that shooting Mr. Smith would violate clearly established law,\u201d the lawyers wrote.",
      "Smith was fatally shot after his girlfriend dialed 911 and described a terrifying situation: Smith had a knife, and he was threatening to assault her and take his own life, according to a dispatcher\u2019s log of the call included in the filing. She was barricaded in the bathroom, according to the call log, and Smith was scratching at the door. \u201cThere is blood all over the bathroom,\u201d a dispatcher told responding officers.",
      "City officials later acknowledged that that final grim detail was based on inaccurate information that the 911 call taker misinterpreted. The girlfriend actually told the operator that she did not need a medic but feared Smith had hurt himself and needed help, according to Johnson\u2019s lawsuit.",
      "But when Myers responded to the 911 call, he believed Smith\u2019s girlfriend might be bleeding out, he told investigators. In the 2023 filing, the officers\u2019 attorneys wrote that \u201cany objectively reasonable officer would have believed this was a domestic violence emergency.\u201d",
      "Body camera video of what followed showed officers ordering Smith to open the door. Seconds later, after he did not comply, they kicked it down. In the video, Smith can be seen walking slowly toward the threshold with what appears to be a knife in his hand as the officers order him to put his hands up, to get on the ground and to drop the knife.",
      "Within six seconds, Myers fired eight shots, according to the lawsuit. The second officer, Ryan Beecroft, fired twice. Smith was hit seven times, the lawsuit says.",
      "According to the filing, the officers opened fire only after Smith refused to comply with their orders and advanced toward them with his knife in an \u201cattack position.\u201d",
      "Smith\u2019s mother has said her son struggled for years with depression, anxiety and alcoholism, and she believes he was having a mental health crisis the night he was fatally shot. In her family\u2019s lawsuit, Johnson\u2019s attorneys wrote that police did not follow de-escalation and crisis intervention techniques even though Beecroft had been to Smith\u2019s apartment weeks before and was aware of his mental health issues.",
      "In the March ruling, 9th Circuit Judge William Fletcher disputed the officers\u2019 claims, writing that a reasonable juror could conclude that Smith did not pose an immediate threat and was not actively resisting arrest. He may not have comprehended the officers\u2019 commands, \u201cwhich were shouted at the same time and inconsistent,\u201d Fletcher wrote.",
      "\u201cThe officers gave no warnings and the use of a Taser might have been available,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGiven this circuit\u2019s case law, a reasonable officer should have been on notice that it was unreasonable to use deadly force solely because Smith was holding a knife in his right hand and raised that hand across his chest.\u201d",
      "The next hearing in the case is scheduled for July 18. The officers' attorneys have sought to delay the September trial, which is scheduled to last five to 10 days."

      "Both new Luckin stores are based in Manhattan, and at the midtown location on Wednesday, Sam Liu took a sip of her jasmine cold brew.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never tried anything like it,\u201d she said.",
      "I thought I just order at the counter, but I realized everyone was standing around looking at their phone.",
      "Luckin Customer Sam Liu, New York City",
      "Liu said she\u2019d hoped for more seating \u2014 the small shop has only three tables \u2014 and was initially confused by Luckin\u2019s in-app ordering system, which means customers can\u2019t order directly from a barista.",
      "\u201cI thought I just order at the counter, but I realized everyone was standing around looking at their phone,\u201d Liu said.",
      "Luckin is China\u2019s largest coffee chain, with more than twice as many locations as Starbucks there. Its two New York City stores are its first foray outside Asia, where it has over 24,000 locations across the region. By comparison, there are over 17,000 Starbucks in the United States.",
      "Its CEO, Guo Jinyi, called the U.S. \u201ca strategically important market\u201d for the company\u2019s expansion in a press release heralding the two new locations Wednesday. \u201cWe are excited to introduce a diverse and unique coffee experience to American consumers.\u201d",
      "The company, which didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, has touted its ambitions to expand globally but hasn\u2019t publicly detailed its next moves in the U.S. or other markets.",
      "The chain has gained success overseas through creative drinks like alcohol-infused coffees and fruit lattes, along with its smartphone-centric ordering model. The app-based approach makes it easier to track inventory, send personalized appeals to consumers and serve drinks quickly, said John Zolidis, an analyst who tracks Luckin and Starbucks at the brokerage firm he founded, Quo Vadis Capital.",
      "\u201cLuckin was able to develop an incredible muscle with regard to product innovation, and they have been very creative in China,\u201d he said.",
      "Zolidis said how Luckin fares on Starbucks\u2019 home turf will depend on its ability to differentiate its menu from other major U.S. coffee chains and smaller, independent cafes. Its American lineup already includes distinctive drinks like blood orange cold brew and coconut lattes.",
      "\u201cThese orange drinks, or one of their most successful, a coconut cloud latte \u2014 that\u2019s how you get trial [customers] from the U.S.,\u201d Zolidis said.",
      "Luckin faced financial troubles during the pandemic. It was delisted from Nasdaq in 2020 after its stock plunged following an internal investigation that found an executive had falsified revenue reports. The company filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. the following year but emerged from proceedings in 2022 and its sales have soared since, reaching $4.7 billion worldwide in fiscal year 2024, a 38.4% increase from 2023.",
      "Luckin was able to develop an incredible muscle with regard to product innovation, and they have been very creative in China.",
      "John Zolidis, Founder, Quo Vadis Capital",
      "Starbucks, by contrast, is struggling in both the U.S. and China. Its same-store sales in the U.S. declined 2% and its sales in China 8% in fiscal year 2024, and it reported in April that its quarterly profit was half of what it pulled in for the same period last year. The Seattle-based chain is reportedly looking to partially sell its business in China while revamping its U.S. strategy to focus on customer experience and human connection, in contrast with Luckin\u2019s model.",
      "\u201cWe veered away from, I think, owning the idea of the \u2018third place,\u2019 the coffeehouse experience, making sure that the customer was front and center,\u201d Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol told NBC News in June.",
      "A Starbucks spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "Zolidis said that whereas Starbucks aims in both the U.S. and China to appeal to customers looking for higher-end coffee served in an inviting setting, Luckin has successfully positioned itself as the \u201ceveryman\u2019s coffee\u201d in China, with low prices and small, grab-and-go storefronts.",
      "After taking the train in from Hoboken, New Jersey, to check out the new one in midtown, Samantha Coy said the trip was worth it. She had enjoyed Luckin in China previously and was eager to order one of its fruit drinks.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m surprised Starbucks hasn\u2019t tried to bring that over to the U.S.,\u201d Coy said. \u201cI hope they stay open.\u201d",
      "Zolidis said he thinks Luckin is well-positioned to gain a foothold in America.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve been able to operate and grow incredibly quickly in the Chinese market, much faster than I would have thought possible, and they\u2019ve been able to sustain it and develop a strong financial model so they can fund their expansion in the U.S.,\u201d Zolidis said. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t be coming here to try it if they didn\u2019t think they had a shot of owning part of the market.\u201d"

    "summary": "Two weeks into Tesla\u2019s robotaxi rollout on the streets of Austin, Texas, viral videos showing apparent mishaps have caused a cloud of confusion and concern.",
    "story": [
      "Two weeks into Tesla\u2019s robotaxi prototype rollout on the streets of Austin, Texas, a string of viral videos showing apparent mishaps and the severely limited access to the service have caused a cloud of confusion and concern around the vehicles and their safety.",
      "Tesla launched its Austin service on June 22. People who\u2019ve gotten an invitation, a group that appears to be composed largely of influencers adjacent to and acolytes of CEO Elon Musk, use an app to call for a ride, similar to ride-hailing apps Uber and Lyft. Each ride costs $4.20, a cannabis-associated number that Musk frequently uses.",
      "The service is somewhat of a prototype. Although no human is in the driver\u2019s seat, each car has a company employee in the front passenger seat who can stop the car with a button if there are safety concerns. Tesla says its experimental software is driving the vehicles.",
      "Experts in the field of autonomous driving say it\u2019s too early to judge the success or failure of the venture. Federal regulators and some local and state politicians say they\u2019re concerned about several incidents \u2014 documented on camera and shared on social media \u2014 where the cars appeared to break traffic laws or put people in danger. Some people who\u2019ve used competing robotaxi services, such as Google spinoff Waymo, yawned at what they considered old technology. Even the stock market shrugged off the launch, with no lasting imprint on Tesla\u2019s share price.",
      "Tesla did not respond to requests for comment on how the service is going. Several key metrics, such as how many miles it has driven and how often Tesla employees need to intervene with the driving software, remain mysteries. Because the service operates only in Texas, where there are currently minimal rules surrounding autonomous vehicles, the company is not required to report such information to regulators at any level of government.",
      "In the first days of the rollout, videos of Tesla robotaxis appearing to violate traffic laws or behave oddly proliferated online. In one, a Tesla dropping off a passenger did so in the middle of an intersection. In another, a Tesla drives on the wrong side of a double yellow line. In at least two videos, its robotaxis are traveling faster than the posted speed limit. And in several examples, the Tesla cars brake suddenly and passengers say they were confused as to why.",
      "In all, NBC News found 13 instances in videos online where a Tesla appeared to break the rules or otherwise make a mistake. In each case, NBC News contacted the people who made the videos but did not hear back.",
      "Some elected officials in Austin said they\u2019re worried about the incidents.",
      "\u201cThere are just a lot of errors,\u201d said Vanessa Fuentes, a member of the Austin City Council and the mayor pro tempore, meaning she runs council meetings when the mayor is absent, in a phone interview. \u201cThey have proven that the technology they have is unsafe for Austinites.\u201d",
      "And while other autonomous vehicle companies such as Waymo or former General Motors unit Cruise have been documented on camera making embarrassing or illegal maneuvers, Fuentes said that she doesn\u2019t believe Tesla has coordinated enough with the city government \u2014 which Tesla is not legally required to do, but she said would build trust.",
      "\u201cTesla has had no regard for public input or working with our city, and unfortunately, I\u2019m not OK having this done at the expense of Austinites\u2019 safety,\u201d she said. She said she embraces autonomous vehicles in the city as a general matter but would like to see Tesla\u2019s service halted for now.",
      "Zo Qadri, an Austin City Council member whose district overlaps with the Tesla robotaxi service area, said he is hearing from people in his district who are worried.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been seeing chaos unfold. We have a lot of constituents who are very angry,\u201d he said.",
      "He said the situation reminded him of problems associated with Cruise robotaxis in Austin in 2023, when residents complained that Cruise cars were making unsafe turns and being a nuisance. Cruise shuttered last year. Qadri said he has not heard similar complaints from constituents about Waymo, which also operates there.",
      "It\u2019s not clear whether Tesla could face local consequences for such incidents, such as traffic tickets, for breaking any laws. Fuentes said the process in Austin for ticketing a robotaxi is more complicated than simply writing a ticket for a driver: A police officer must draft a complaint affidavit, send it to a lieutenant, and then have the affidavit witnessed and sent to a municipal court.",
      "The Austin Police Department said in a statement:",
      "\u201cAs with any company operating autonomous technology on public roadways, when a potential legal or safety concern is brought to our attention, we promptly share it with the company. These concerns are then addressed through our regular meetings, where we follow up on the issue and review the steps taken to resolve it. Our priority is to maintain public safety while supporting innovation in transportation,\u201d the department said.",
      "Federal regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also took notice of the safety incidents, saying in a statement June 23 that the agency \u201cis aware of the referenced incidents and is in contact with the manufacturer to gather additional information.\u201d",
      "Texas state Rep. Vikki Goodwin, a Democrat whose district includes part of Austin, said she wants Tesla to proceed cautiously.",
      "\u201cI think that it\u2019s in their interest to make sure safety is top of mind and that nothing goes wrong. Otherwise, that could really derail their plans for launching it fully,\u201d she said.",
      "Goodwin was one of seven Texas lawmakers who sent a letter to Tesla on June 18 asking for the company to delay the launch of its robotaxis until Sept. 1 \u2014 the day a new law regarding autonomous vehicles is set to go into effect. Tesla did not delay its launch, but Goodwin said the company did respond to their letter, saying it would update its policies to ensure that it would be compliant with the new law.",
      "Goodwin said part of her desire for caution comes from owning a Tesla herself and experiencing unexpected maneuvers while using the company\u2019s driver-assistance software.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had personal experience with using cruise control and having the car brake for me, which can be very disturbing,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had that experience on a number of occasions, and it just leads me to believe that it really is important to have a person in the vehicle.\u201d",
      "Tesla is aiming to compete with Waymo, which says it has about 1,500 robotaxis on the road in several cities including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Phoenix. Musk said Tesla\u2019s service would start small with 10-20 vehicles and try to grow over the next several months, although how quickly it could expand is not clear.",
      "Tesla\u2019s stock price soared the day after its service launched on a Sunday, jumping more than 9% on the following Monday. But the stock, which is often volatile, retreated over the following days as it became clear how many hurdles Tesla faces in trying to scale up the service.",
      "The public knows about the safety incidents involving Tesla robotaxis mainly because Tesla sent many of the initial invitations to use the service to online influencers, including people with YouTube channels or similar video platforms.",
      "The invitations were so scarce that at least one Tesla influencer, a person named Omar who goes by the pseudonym Whole Mars Catalog, offered to share rides for $10. \u201cTake a Tesla Robotaxi ride round trip with Omar. Includes two rides, there and back,\u201d the person\u2019s sponsorship page said. The $10 would be more than the combined cost of two $4.20 rides. The account did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Eliana Sheriff was among the early riders. A video creator with a YouTube channel focused on Musk\u2019s rocket company SpaceX, she said she came away a fan of the robotaxi service.",
      "\u201cI was totally trusting of the technology,\u201d she said in a YouTube video on her channel, \u201cEllie in Space.\u201d",
      "She did have one complaint. After she reached her destination in the robotaxi, a storm appeared overhead and she wanted to stay in the car to shelter. A Tesla customer service agent called into the car\u2019s audio system to say that she couldn\u2019t. She exited and called a second ride to take her back to where she started. (Some posts online said erroneously that Tesla kicked her out midride, but she said in an interview that she did reach her destination.)",
      "Sheriff said that despite some concerns in the automotive and tech industries over whether Tesla\u2019s technology is good enough to deploy robotaxis, she has faith in Musk to pursue the best approach.",
      "\u201cElon must have a reason for why he believes in that,\u201d she said.",
      "She\u2019s not alone. Since the robotaxi launch, the legions of Musk and Tesla fans have proclaimed their enthusiasm for the service across the internet: on X, the social media app that Musk owns, and on other apps such as Reddit and TikTok. And they\u2019ve employed a wide variety of superlatives to describe the robotaxis: \u201cflawless,\u201d \u201cseamless\u201d and \u201chistory-making.\u201d",
      "But because the service is invite-only, with only a handful of cars on the road, almost no consumers who aren\u2019t Tesla fans have gotten to use the service firsthand.",
      "Musk and his fans have described the service as futuristic and groundbreaking, but the rollout has succeeded mainly in preaching to Tesla\u2019s already-converted choir of supporters.",
      "Brad Templeton, a consultant in the autonomous vehicle industry who worked for Google\u2019s self-driving car project from 2010 to 2013 before it became Waymo, said Tesla\u2019s most enthusiastic fans are \u201call fairly convinced that it\u2019s just on the cusp of being ready, and they get really annoyed when other people don\u2019t see it.\u201d",
      "Like other experts, Templeton said the only measure for robotaxis that counts is whether they\u2019re safe over the very long term, measured in the tens of millions of miles driven.",
      "\u201cWhat matters is not individual demonstrations. It\u2019s statistics,\u201d he said.",
      "Many of the Tesla and Waymo fans clash head-to-head on Reddit, where the message board r/SelfDrivingCars has been heating up with competition between the two sides. Waymo boosters regularly argue on the site that the company is years ahead of Tesla in experience: Waymo had paying customers in its first market, Phoenix, while still using safety drivers in December 2018 \u2014 six and a half years ago. Waymo began \u201crider only\u201d rides in 2019.",
      "Lately, some Tesla fans have been pushing back by highlighting videos of what they considered to be Waymo vehicles driving poorly, including stopping in standing water.",
      "One Reddit user, in a popular recent post, vented that the r/SelfDrivingCars message board was being \u201cflooded with Tesla apologist propaganda and disinformation. \u2026 The astroturf army is out in full display these past couple weeks.\u201d",
      "The top comment on the post asked for a truce.",
      "\u201cI want to see progress by both companies,\u201d the Reddit user Juice805 wrote. \u201cWaymo is doing great and is quite far ahead in their rollout and Tesla just made a huge first step in theirs.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just want cars to drive themselves,\u201d they wrote. They did not respond to a request for comment."

    "published": "Sat, 05 Jul 2025 10:30:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Accessing reading material in prisons is hard, but 'Freedom Reads' founder and former inmate Reginald Betts went beyond books, creating libraries made by former prisoners.",
    "story": [
      "Maria Montalvo speaks with emotion, her eyes shining as she recounts her reading experiences. She says she especially enjoys books by Isabel Allende, Octavia Butler, Toni Morrison, Erika L. S\u00e1nchez and John Grisham because, in her words, \u201creading makes you wiser and you learn how people live in other countries. It takes your mind to other places you can\u2019t travel to.\u201d",
      "Montalvo isn\u2019t an ordinary reader. During her incarceration at Edna Mahan Correctional Facility, a prison in New Jersey, she has participated in the activities of Freedom Reads, a nonprofit organization that has been promoting reading in U.S. prisons since 2020.",
      "\u201cFreedom Reads has brought books on different topics, and it\u2019s very important to read because it makes you wiser,\u201d Montalvo, 60, said in an interview with Noticias Telemundo. \u201cBooks change the prison climate; they change the way people think about themselves. This opens your mind and makes you want to change.\u201d",
      "Montalvo proudly recalled the arrival of the books at her prison in May.",
      "\"They brought two bookcases that are very symbolic and very important, because they relate to literature, justice and writers like Martin Luther King,\u201d she said.",
      "The origin of Freedom Reads is closely linked to the life of Reginald Dwayne Betts, who pleaded guilty to car theft at age 16 and was sentenced to nine years in the Virginia prison system.",
      "\"In prison, I discovered books. I became a poet and also a very good communicator. I was able to make friendships and connections that have lasted decades. Books gave me an understanding of the world,\u201d Betts said in an interview with Noticias Telemundo.",
      "Years later, Betts earned his law degree from Yale University, began publishing books of poetry and won prestigious Guggenheim and MacArthur fellowships, and in 2020, he was one of the founders of Freedom Reads, where he has worked to increase access to books for the U.S. prison population.",
      "Finding reading material in prisons is difficult, Betts said. Most facilities have only one library, which is open a few hours a day and requires a permit to access it.",
      "\u201cI asked myself, \u2018What would a library be?\u2019 And I decided it would be a collection of 500 books, and I called it the Library of Freedom, because I believe in the idea that freedom begins with a book.\"",
      "Betts worked with architects at Mass Design, a nonprofit firm focused on architecture's role in supporting communities and fostering societal healing, and they decided the bookcases' structure should be curved. Many of them are built by former inmates, he said.",
      "The libraries themselves are objects of design, each consisting of two to six freestanding bookshelves, handcrafted from maple, walnut or cherry wood. Betts has fitted the libraries into empty cells for easy access and designed each shelf to be 44 inches tall so as not to obstruct guards\u2019 vision. The curves of each reading structure contrast with the harsh, angular architecture of the prison system.",
      "\"We want to show that it\u2019s possible to be kind in places as violent and dangerous as some prisons, and we\u2019re projecting our idea with libraries we make with our own hands,\u201d he said.",
      "Betts read several books in prison that changed his life. One was \"One Hundred Years of Solitude,\" by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, which he said \u201ctaught [him] to understand Latin America and its people.\u201d",
      "According to figures from the Federal Bureau of Prisons, there are 46,334 Hispanic prisoners in the United States. Therefore, from the beginning of the project, bilingualism has been present, and Spanish-language titles are abundant.",
      "\u201cWe have a list of more than 100 books in Spanish, and it continues to grow every year,\u201d said David P\u00e9rez, Freedom Reads\u2019 library coordinator.",
      "According to the organization, Spanish-language books in the library\u2019s permanent collection include \"The House of Spirits,\" by Isabel Allende; \"I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter,\" by S\u00e1nchez; \"In the Time of the Butterflies,\" by Julia \u00c1lvarez; and \"The Shadow of the Wind,\" by Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n, in addition to classics such as the novels of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and English-language works by Ernest Gaines, William Faulkner and George Orwell.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so pleased that my novel has reached so many unexpected places. I\u2019m proud that incarcerated people find some relief in Julia\u2019s story,\" S\u00e1nchez said in an email about her book. \"She\u2019s a complicated protagonist who wants to escape her circumstances, like many women around the world.\"",
      "'A lot of work ahead of us'",
      "Maria Montalvo was convicted in 1996 of the deaths of her two children in a car fire, which she claimed at the trial was an accident; she's serving a life sentence. During her trial, prosecutors acknowledged that she was \u201cemotionally disturbed\u201d during the incident, which contributed to her not being sentenced to death.",
      "Years later, Montalvo says she has dedicated her time in prison to studying the problems of mass incarceration, reading literary works and engaging with other inmates in reading circles that discuss books in Spanish and English.",
      "\u201cThere are many books in Spanish and English. So you can sit with many of the women who don\u2019t speak English and read a book, but at the same time, another group is reading the same book in English, and you can have a conversation afterward,\u201d she said.",
      "Noticias Telemundo asked the Federal Bureau of Prisons for figures on its prisons' literacy and reading initiatives, but it didn't receive a response about the data. However, spokesperson Scott Taylor said in an email that the bureau closely monitors reading promotion programs like Freedom Reads, which \u201cincludes regular coordination meetings, staff training on safety expectations, and ongoing oversight to address any concerns.\"",
      "In addition, Taylor said, the bureau\u2019s education branch has implemented a strategy focused on literacy and improving language skills for inmates who don't speak English. \u201cBilingual instructions and materials are provided in Spanish and English, supported by digital tools that offer accessible resources for those learning English,\u201d he wrote.",
      "In 2023, research published by the Mackinac Public Policy Center, a nonprofit organization espousing free-market principles, found that prison-based reading, job training and education programs reduce the likelihood of recidivism by 14.8%. It also found a 6.9% increase in the likelihood of employment.",
      "\"I love having conversations with people inside prisons,\u201d P\u00e9rez said. \u201cThey read a lot, and it moves you when you see them crying because they\u2019ve read a poem or a novel \u2014 it\u2019s unique.\u201d",
      "'Having a voice'",
      "Freedom Reads has installed 498 libraries in 50 adult and youth prisons across the United States. It has placed an estimated 280,000 books in the hands of inmates.",
      "\u201cDespite that success, we\u2019ve probably reached less than 1%, maybe 0.5%, of the prisons in this country,\" Betts said. \"We\u2019re not in any federal prisons yet. We\u2019re only in 13 states, and we\u2019re missing more than 30. So we have a lot of work ahead of us.\u201d",
      "Betts' aim is to have libraries in 20,000 prisons.",
      "Since 2023, Freedom Reads has administered the Inside Literary Prize, a literary award judged by incarcerated people. The inaugural award went to Imani Perry\u2019s book \"South to America: A Journey Below the Mason-Dixon to Understand the Soul of a Nation,\" selected by more than 200 judges from 12 prisons across six states.",
      "By 2025, the competition had expanded to include more than 300 judges from 13 prisons in five states, and this year\u2019s edition also included Puerto Rico. Montalvo was part of this year\u2019s jury, and its decision will be announced Thursday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a feeling of inclusion. It makes you realize that what we think about books and what we read matters,\u201d Montalvo said excitedly. \u201cIt\u2019s having a voice.\u201d",
      "An earlier version of this story was first published in Noticias Telemundo."

      "Unlike other kids in Massachusetts, students living in one Boston suburb won\u2019t be able to go back to school next month unless they\u2019ve had their chickenpox and measles shots, as well as other routine childhood vaccinations.",
      "\u201cAny student not fully vaccinated without exemption will be excluded from school,\u201d Newton Public Schools Superintendent Anna Nolin wrote in a memo last month. The directive followed a chickenpox outbreak among students, as well as rising threats of measles, Nolin said.",
      "But unvaccinated students without medical reasons to forgo the shots can still get a pass to attend class in Massachusetts: a religious exemption.",
      "According to state immunization data, vaccination rates among kindergartners in Massachusetts have been falling \u2014 from 95.9% in 2020 to 94.3% this past school year \u2014 as the proportion of students with religious exemptions has risen: 0.93% in 2020 to 1.33% currently.",
      "Schools in Massachusetts loosened vaccination requirement rules during the pandemic, allowing unvaccinated students to attend class without exemptions. In some areas of the state, the proportion of students who are allowed to skip shots because of exemptions is as high as 12.8%, according to the state\u2019s data.",
      "There\u2019s \u201ca lot of concern about what\u2019s happening with kids and keeping them safe from vaccine-preventable diseases,\u201d said Northe Saunders, executive director of the SAFE Communities Coalition, an organization that supports pro-vaccination policies. \u201cPeople are fed up.\u201d",
      "A bill working its way through the Massachusetts statehouse proposes removing nonmedical exemptions \u2014 including religious and philosophical beliefs \u2014 for vaccination requirements to attend public schools.",
      "\u201cMisuse of the current religious exemption loophole in Massachusetts policy has led to kindergarten classes across our state with terrifyingly low rates of vaccination,\u201d Logan Beyer, a Harvard Medical School student, said at a hearing about the legislation last month.",
      "Beyer, who studies child health and child health equity, testified that she had a conversation with a woman who confided that she would use the religious exemption loophole to delay vaccinating her child. \u201c\u2018We don\u2019t really go to church, but you don\u2019t have to prove anything,\u2019\u201d the woman said, according to Beyer.",
      "Massachusetts isn\u2019t alone. Vaccination rates have been falling across the United States for years.",
      "Clamping down on vaccination exemptions raises rates",
      "In the past decade, California, Connecticut, Maine and New York have removed such exemptions in an effort to drive up vaccination rates.",
      "It seems to be working. Maine, for example, had one of the country\u2019s highest vaccination opt-out rates in 2017, at 5.3%. Two years later, in 2019, it passed a law that eliminated religious and philosophical exemptions to vaccinations.",
      "Since then, Maine\u2019s kindergarten MMR vaccination rate has climbed from less than 94% to nearly 98%.",
      "When California passed a law in 2016 removing personal belief and religious exemptions after a measles outbreak that began at Disneyland, MMR coverage increased by 3% in 2019. It has remained high, at 96.2%, according to the California Department of Public Health.",
      "The actions come at a critical time in America\u2019s vaccination history. The country is on track to have the largest measles outbreak in decades, with 1,267 cases already logged this year.",
      "While the majority of parents support vaccination, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has repeatedly undermined the shots\u2019 safety and effectiveness.",
      "Childhood immunization rates fell during the pandemic for several reasons. Children were less likely to get their annual well-checks during lockdown. And misinformation about Covid shots stoked fears about vaccines in general.",
      "The percentage of students with religious exemptions in Hawaii doubled during that time, from 2% before the pandemic to 4% last year, according to the state Health Department.",
      "Hawaii legislators proposed a bill to end exemptions based on religion, but it stalled after a massive public backlash.",
      "Meanwhile, Kennedy has doubled down on vaccine distrust. In June, he abruptly fired every member of the federal government\u2019s group of nonpartisan, independent experts charged with advising the administration on vaccines, appointing instead several known anti-vaccine activists.",
      "Religious concerns about vaccination?",
      "Most states and Washington, D.C., allow parents to opt out of vaccination requirements based on religious or philosophical views.",
      "Mississippi lawmakers added a religious vaccination exemption in 2023.",
      "In Texas, where an ongoing outbreak of measles in southwest Texas has killed two children, legislation in front of state lawmakers would make it easier for parents to be notified about and obtain vaccination exemptions.",
      "There is no indication, however, that any of the world\u2019s major religions oppose vaccination.",
      "Catholic popes, for example, have a long history of supporting immunizations. In a 2021 video message, Pope Francis urged people to get the Covid shot, calling it \u201can act of love.\u201d",
      "\u201cGetting vaccinated is a simple yet profound way to care for one another, especially the most vulnerable,\u201d he said.",
      "Jewish law supports vaccination. Islamic law does, too. The Dalai Lama, Tibetan Buddhism\u2019s highest spiritual leader, has personally given polio vaccinations to children.",
      "One possible sticking point in some religions is a concern that vaccines contain fetal cells.",
      "The concern is unfounded, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. \u201cSome vaccines involve growing viruses in human cell cultures originally developed from two aborted fetuses in the 1960s. These cell lines are still going, so no new aborted fetuses are ever needed,\u201d the group writes on its website. \u201cPurification processes filter the vaccine during production, and no fetal tissue remains.\u201d",
      "Still, the number of kids whose caregivers are opting them out of routine childhood vaccines has reached an all-time high, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Experts said the findings reflect Americans\u2019 growing unease about medicine in general.",
      "Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, a pediatrician at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado and a spokesman for the pediatrics academy, said the group\u2019s official policy \u201cis that there should be no nonmedical exemptions for vaccines,\u201d including religion. (Some children have weakened immune systems because of cancer treatments or organ transplantation and can\u2019t be vaccinated.)",
      "Otherwise, \u201cthere\u2019s no legitimate reason not to be vaccinated,\u201d he said. \u201cThe benefits of vaccines clearly outweigh the risks.\u201d"

      "Trump told reporters Tuesday that his daughter-in-law Lara Trump \u201cwould always be my first choice\u201d to run for Senate in North Carolina, her home state. Some Tar Heel State Republicans said potential candidates would likely defer to Lara Trump if she decides to run.",
      "\u201cThe Trump lane is the path to victory. If your name\u2019s Trump, you got a pretty good advantage,\u201d said Republican strategist Jonathan Felts.",
      "A former Republican National Committee co-chair, Lara Trump told Fox News Radio on Monday that she is considering a run, noting that she passed on running for Senate in North Carolina in 2022 and in Florida earlier this year.",
      "\u201cIt is something that, if it works out and the timing works and it works for my family, it is absolutely something that I would consider doing,\u201d she said.",
      "Doug Heye, a former RNC spokesman and North Carolina native, said Lara Trump \u201chas the right of first refusal.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf she wants the nomination, she\u2019s in the driver\u2019s seat,\u201d Heye said. \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t, this process could be wide open.\u201d",
      "Other potential candidates include current RNC Chairman Michael Whatley, the former chairman of the North Carolina GOP.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that he is open to it, but he is going to take direction from the president and the White House,\u201d said one Senate GOP strategist, granted anonymity to speak candidly about private deliberations.",
      "First-term Rep. Pat Harrigan, R-N.C., is also considered a potential candidate, though he posted on X that he would back Lara Trump if she runs. Rep. Greg Murphy, R-N.C., told reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday that he is also considering a Senate run, but he has been focused on passing the president\u2019s sweeping domestic policy bill.",
      "Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., was considered a potential candidate, but he announced on Tuesday that he remains focused on leading the National Republican Congressional Committee.",
      "On the Democratic side, former Democratic Rep. Wiley Nickel is in the race, but many members of the party are waiting to see if former Gov. Roy Cooper decides to jump in.",
      "\u201cGov. Cooper continues to strongly consider a run for the Senate and he\u2019ll decide in the coming weeks,\u201d said Jackson, a Cooper adviser. Jackson said Tillis\u2019 exit has not affected Cooper\u2019s deliberations, noting Cooper\u2019s decision \u201chas always been based on a personal decision of what is the best way to serve the state and the people. And that calculation has not changed.\u201d",
      "Other key matchups take shape",
      "The Democratic field is also still in flux in Maine. Collins\u2019 spokespeople did not return a request for comment on her plans, but she told CNN in May, \u201cIt\u2019s certainly my inclination to run and I\u2019m preparing to do so,\u201d adding that she has \u201cnot made a formal announcement because it\u2019s too early for that.\u201d",
      "Jordan Wood, a Maine native who served as former California Rep. Katie Porter\u2019s chief of staff, is in the race on the Democratic side. Maine state House Speaker Ryan Fecteau and former state Sen. Cathy Breen told the Portland Press Herald in May that they were considering runs. And Dan Kleban, co-founder of Maine Beer Company, told the Bangor Daily News that he is also weighing a run for Senate.",
      "But Democrats are largely waiting on Gov. Janet Mills to make a decision on a Senate run. Mills, who cannot run for re-election due to term limits, has not closed the door on challenging Collins. But she told the Maine Trust for Local News in April, \u201cI\u2019m not planning to run for anything. Things change week to week, month to month, but at this moment I\u2019m not planning to run for another office.\u201d",
      "Democratic Senatorial Campaign Chairwoman Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., told NBC News last month that she was confident her party would have formidable candidates in both Maine and North Carolina. She also did not rule out taking sides in primaries to boost the strongest candidate.",
      "Republicans, meanwhile, are looking to expand their 53-47 majority by targeting Democratic-held seats in Georgia, Michigan and New Hampshire.",
      "Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff is the only Democrat running for re-election in a state Trump won last year, since Michigan Sen. Gary Peters is retiring. And Republicans are bracing for a primary fight in the Peach State after Gov. Brian Kemp passed on running.",
      "Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., and state Insurance Commissioner John King are already in the race, and the field is expected to grow. Rep. Mike Collins, R-Ga., told NBC News on Wednesday that he is seriously considering a run and would make a decision \u201cin the near future.\u201d",
      "Derek Dooley, a former football coach at the University of Tennessee with personal ties to Kemp, is seriously considering running and has met with key Georgia donors and Republican officials in Washington, D.C., according to a Georgia GOP strategist familiar with Dooley\u2019s deliberations.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Trump and Kemp will work to back the same candidate in the primary. Trump and Kemp met in mid-May, a source familiar with the meeting confirmed to NBC News. The meeting was first reported by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which noted that Trump and Kemp did discuss the Senate race.",
      "GOP leaders have already taken sides in the primary in Michigan, with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Tim Scott, R-S.C., backing former GOP Rep. Mike Rogers, who lost a close Senate race last year. But Rogers could still face a primary, with Rep. Bill Huizenga considering a run.",
      "Democrats will also have a contentious primary in the open-seat race, with Rep. Haley Stevens, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, former state House Speaker Joe Tate and former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed all running for the nomination.",
      "But Democrats have coalesced around a candidate in New Hampshire, with Rep. Chris Pappas running to replace retiring Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. Brown, a former ambassador and former Massachusetts senator, may not be the only Republican candidate to jump into the race. State Sen. Dan Innis has also said he is considering a run."

She explained that she bit off part of her tooth while eating dinner the night before and she wanted to see if could smooth the chipped enamel and make it look \u201cmore nonchalant.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m scared for this,\u201d she said as she started to use the nail file. But afterwards, she was satisfied with her appearance and smiled at the camera.",
      "Then, the podcaster began to apply her makeup while launching into a story about the adjustments she has made to her teeth over the years.",
      "\u201cWell, I guess, veneer reveal. It was after I graduated college, I think, like in August, I did it. I never wanted to post about it because I immediately feel like I regretted it, and I never want to influence people to do something that I don\u2019t think they should do,\u201d she shared.",
      "Earle added, \u201cAlthough, I like the results. I think that it was great.\u201d",
      "She explained that as a child she had \u201creally good straight teeth\u201d except for two of her front teeth. She recalled falling off her bike during her childhood and hitting the front of her mouth.",
      "Although two of her teeth were dislodged and \u201cdangling from the nerves,\u201d her dentist advised her to hold them in place until they eventually straightened.",
      "Her teeth returned to their original position, but she decided to try Invisalign \u2014 custom clear aligners \u2014 during her final year of high school. Again, she was pleased with the results, but they didn\u2019t last because didn\u2019t wear her retainers, causing her teeth to shift. So, prior to graduation she underwent a cosmetic procedure called composite bonding. The reversible cosmetic procedure involves applying \u201ctooth-colored resin material to the affected teeth to change their shape, size or color,\u201d according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "When the material cracked due to her biting her teeth, she finally opted to get veneers.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m an anxious person. So sometimes, if I have, like, a bad dream, I\u2019ll bite my teeth and they would crack off. It happened a lot, honestly, probably like twice a year they cracked off. Senior year of college (I) started getting a following on here, made some money,\u201d she explained. \u201cBecause I had friends that had veneers on just these two (front) teeth, I was like, \u2018Oh, you know what? That seems like a good idea.\u2019\u201d",
      "She spoke to a dentist who claimed it wouldn\u2019t be possible to only fix two of her teeth. According to her, the dentist said it would not be worth it to get the cosmetic procedure because all her teeth would not look the same.",
      "\u201cSo I went in for two teeth, and I basically left with 10,\u201d she continued as she became emotional. \u201cIt was one of those things that I did it and\u2026I regretted it right away. I think it was really scary for me I was like, \u2018What did I just do?\u2019\u201d",
      "Earle emphasized how much she wishes she had waited before changing her appearance.",
      "\u201cI will say I don\u2019t regret a lot. It is something I really regret doing. At the end of the day, whatever, it was my decision. But I feel like it was kind of one of those decisions that was made pretty fast and I just didn\u2019t think it all the way through, or, I think, talk to enough people.\u201d",
      "Despite some moments of insecurity since then, she has grown to like her smile.",
      "\u201cI actually like the character in my teeth. It\u2019s great,\u201d she said.",
      "Toward the end of the video, she apologized to any fans who might be upset that she didn\u2019t share this information sooner.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking about doing anything to your teeth, this is your sign to not do it and to embrace your natural teeth,\u201d she concluded. \u201cDon\u2019t follow my lead on this one.\u201d"

      "CBS has announced a few twists that \u201cBig Brother\u201d fans can expect to see when the show returns for Season 27, including one that even surprised host Julie Chen Moonves.",
      "On July 2, ahead of the long-running summer competition show\u2019s premiere on Thursday, July 10, CBS shared first-look images of the newly designed \u201cBig Brother\u201d house and revealed the theme for the season: \u201cA Summer of Mystery.\u201d",
      "In a press release, the network teased that the houseguests will soon move into \u201cHotel Myst\u00e8re, a place where secrets lurk behind every door and nothing is as it seems.\u201d",
      "What does that mean? Well, CBS explained that the season premiere will include \u201cunexpected twists and turns including a masked visitor, a secret accomplice and the shocking arrival of a \u2018Mystery Houseguest\u2019 whose identity will remain under wraps \u2026 at least for now.\u201d",
      "The 90-minute premiere kicks off at 8 p.m. ET/PT and will be followed by another extended episode on Sunday, July 13, at the same time.",
      "So, who is this \u201cMystery Houseguest\u201d who will impact the game? Chen Moonves recently spoke about the new season and how the twists will reflect the show\u2019s \u201cexpect the unexpected\u201d motto that fans love.",
      "In an Entertainment Weekly interview published July 3, the host said the mystery houseguest will be a \u201cpolarizing\u201d figure who viewers will surely have an opinion about.",
      "\u201cWhat I can say is the mystery houseguest, when I was told who this person is, I had to expect the unexpected! I never expected that person,\u201d Chen Moonves shared. \u201cAnd I was very excited because, in my opinion, getting that person is epic. And that person is also very polarizing. So there\u2019s going to be a strong reaction in both directions for this mystery houseguest.\u201d",
      "As for the secret accomplice, Moonves revealed that the person will be required to complete certain tasks.",
      "She said, \u201cThe accomplice this person\u2019s going to have \u2014 they\u2019re going to have responsibilities, and they may or may not be able to pull it off, and that will affect the game.\u201d",
      "The host described the masked visitor as a more \u201cdisruptive\u201d version of the AI Bot A.I.N.S.L.E.Y. who took over last season.",
      "\u201cAinsley could do only so much, but this masked visitor is going to wreak havoc in ways that we\u2019ve never seen before. And I would say on a deeper level. Much deeper. It\u2019s more three dimensional,\u201d she teased.",
      "Speaking of Season 26, Moonves suggested that the AI Arena, which allowed three nominees to compete for another chance at safety on eviction night, could return this year.",
      "\u201cYeah, I was a huge fan of it, as was everyone internally. I don\u2019t know if you know this, but last summer it worked so well, so we extended it. Because it wasn\u2019t supposed to go on for as long as it did,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reason I liked it so much is because at the beginning of each season, there tends to be this herd mentality where there\u2019s no surprise on eviction night because the whole house goes one way.\u201d",
      "Moonves added, \u201cSo things that work well tend to make an appearance again. I mean, look at the Power of Veto. That became a staple after Season 3. So I would say it\u2019s like shaking the Magic 8 Ball \u2014 signs are pointing to yes.\u201d",
      "She also said the mystery theme will affect the houseguests and viewers at home. For instance, the host explained that some items in the house might appear ordinary but will play a role in how the game unfolds this season.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be a detective this year to play this game,\u201d she advised the Season 27 houseguests.",
      "Following the format of previous seasons, \u201cBig Brother\u201d is expected to reveal its Season 27 cast a few days before the premiere."

      "\u201cWe have such a rainbow of kids,\" Terry told E! News in a June 29 interview. He said he tells his wife, \"\u2018We were chosen for it. That\u2019s what we\u2019re supposed to do with our platform.\u201d",
      "The pair are raising 21-year-old Nick and his twin sister Max (who came out as bisexual during the pandemic),  18-year-old Kat (who said she was a lesbian in the family group chat) and 14-year-old Ace (who Heather shared was transgender two years ago).",
      "\u201cIf we can change hearts and minds by showing how our version of a normal, supportive family can be, we\u2019re in,\u201d Terry said. \u201cWe try to be role models for these conversations, and that\u2019s the platform that Heather and I have been chosen to have and to put out there.

With all of them, it was just a normal, ongoing conversation. There was never a big moment.\"",

      "\u201cYou may have your biases and your preconceived notions, but it ain\u2019t about you, it\u2019s about them, and they live in a completely different world than you grew up in,\u201d Terry told E!

      "Oasis' tour starts with a pair of shows in Cardiff, Wales, on Friday, July 4, and Saturday, July 5.",
      "When Are Oasis\u2019 North America Tour Dates?",

A search on the popular resale sites SeatGeek and StubHub shows that a ticket will cost you over $100 at minimum, depending on the city and date.",
      "What Will the Oasis Tour Songs List Be?",
      "There isn't an answer to that question yet, but if you believe the internet speculation, the band will lean heavily into its first two albums, 1994's \u201cDefinitely Maybe\u201d and 1995's \u201c(What\u2019s the Story) Morning Glory?\u201d That would make sense, given that Oasis\u2019 biggest hits came from those albums.",
      "Ticket holders are surely hoping the Gallaghers will incorporate some mix of \u201cLive Forever,\u201d \u201cSupersonic\u201d and \u201cCigarettes & Alcohol\u201d (from \u201cDefinitely Maybe\u201d), plus \u201cWonderwall,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Look Back in Anger\u201d and \u201cChampagne Supernova\u201d (from \u201cMorning Glory\u201d), into their set list.",
      "Oasis also has a strong catalog of B-sides, so favorites like \u201cAcquiesce,\u201d \u201cThe Masterplan\u201d and others would please longtime fans as well."

      "In the hit Netflix show out of South Korea, financially desperate people battle each other for a prize pot of 4.56 billion won, or just over $33 million.",
      "After winning the first game in Season 1, Gi-hun returns, this time with the intention to take down the craven competition. He makes it to the end again. In the final moments, he chooses between sparing himself and taking the life of an infant born during the games, or leaving the infant as the sole winner.",
      "The words he says are a clue into his journey in the show.",
      "How do Gi-hun's last words tie back to Episode 1?",

      "Gi-hun is depicted as a financially struggling divorced dad who loves his daughter dearly. To celebrate his daughter\u2019s birthday, he wanted to treat her to dinner and a nice present but didn\u2019t have the money. He turns to horse betting to win money for his daughter.",
      "The horse betting motif carries all throughout the show. Similar to horse races, the \"Squid Game\" players participate for the enjoyment of the bettors and VIPs. Despite mental torture and never-ending trauma, the bettors do not care; they simply want to be entertained.",
      "This motif is mentioned by Front Man \u2014 a former winner-turned \"Squid Game\" exec \u2014 in the first season, moments before Gi-hun is dropped off on the street with the prize money on a debit card.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same here, but we bet on humans. You\u2019re our horses,\u201d Front Man continues.",
      "Though it may not be what they wanted, fans say that Gi-hun\u2019s fate is a full circle moment.",

      "\u201cHorses act on instinct. They\u2019re forced into wars, into races, into someone else\u2019s game. They run because they don\u2019t have a choice. And maybe that\u2019s what the Squid Game was, people running out of desperation,\u201d another X user said.",
      "What do his last words mean?",
      "Show director Hwang Dong-hyuk spoke to Variety about Gi-hun\u2019s last words and why he never finishes the sentence.",
      "\u201cMore and more I\u2019ve come to realize that it\u2019s so difficult to define what humans are. We are very complex beings,\u201d Hwang said.",

      "\u201cTrainwreck: Poop Cruise\u201d tells the tale of an infamous cruise ship disaster over ten years later.",
      "The 55-minute film, released June 24, includes firsthand accounts of several passengers who spent almost five days on the Carnival Triumph after it was left floating at sea without functional plumbing or electricity in 2014.",
      "While it seems like this incident is something that could only be imagined, it was a reality for over 3,000 unlucky passengers and over 1,000 crew members.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "What happened on the Carnival Triumph?",
      "In February 2014, 4,200 passengers and crew members were stuck at sea aboard the Carnival Triumph.",
      "The cruise was meant to follow a four-day roundtrip route from Galveston, Texas to Cozumel, Mexico.",
      "However, on the fourth day of the cruise, a power outage left the boat floating in the middle of the ocean, waiting to be tugged to land, NBC News reported at the time.",
      "While the ship was first going to be taken to Mexico, strong winds carried the boat so far north in the Gulf it had to be taken to Mobile, Alabama, instead.",
      "The conditions on board were harrowing, as reported by passengers interviewed at the time. With no electricity on the ship, passengers took to sleeping on the ship\u2019s deck to escape their hot rooms and used sheets to create makeshift tents on deck.",
      "Conditions on board were already difficult without electricity. Add to the mix that ship's plumbing also halted.",
      "\u201cThe worst part is the bathrooms,\u201d passenger Donna Gutzman told NBC News. \u201cThere\u2019s no water. You can\u2019t really flush so everyone\u2019s going in little plastic baggies and putting it outside their rooms.\u201d",
      "The ship eventually returned to land on Feb. 14.",
      "Why did the power go out?",
      "The cruise ship lost power after an engine room fire. After the ship's return, the Coast Guard concluded that a fuel oil return line leak sprayed onto a hot surface in the room, starting a flame, NBC News reported.",
      "The U.S. Coast Guard Marine Casualty Investigation Team said the ship\u2019s crew \u201cdid a very good job\u201d in responding to the fire.",
      "The damage was caused to a small area of the engine room, but because the oil burned at such a large temperature, the room had to be closed off. Crew members were not able to set out the blaze immediately.",
      "This fire created a domino effect that cut out the ship\u2019s power and halted its toilets.",
      "NBC News later reported that Carnival knew about the risk of leaks from engine fuel hoses, according to court documents surfaced in a lawsuit later filed against the corporation on behalf of dozens of the ship\u2019s passengers.",
      "Carnival said, in a response, that the ship\u2019s engines passed inspection before departure.",
      "What did people say about their experiences?",
      "Passengers on the Carnival Triumph spoke about how what was meant to be a vacation turned into a nightmare.",
      "Wondering what a ship holding thousands of people without working plumbing smells like? One person compared the conditions of the sewage-soaked ship to a zoo, NBC News reported.",
      "Clark Jones, one of the ship's passengers, told NBC News at the time that he saw people hoarding food and protecting their turf on ship. Jones said recounted the conditions as \u201cprimitive.\u201d",
      "Another passenger on the ship, Julie Billings, told NBC News that the experience \u201cwas like post-natural disaster, but stuck on a boat with 3,200 other people, and those poor workers trying to clean up after everyone and deal with everyone freaking out.\u201d",
      "As the ship made its way to dock in Mobile, NBC News reported people chanting to be let off and using bed sheets to make giant sigs spelling out \u201cSOS!\u201d or \u201cSweet Home Alabama!\u201d",
      "NBC News also reported that passengers were grateful for the crew\u2019s response to the unprecedented experience. Janie Baker told MSNBC at the time that the crew was \u201cfantastic,\u201d despite the tempers of those on board \u201cflying\u201d by the final night.",
      "Though not all were satisfied. \u201cIt was mistake after mistake after mistake, incompetence to a point I\u2019ve never seen,\u201d passenger Mark Mazan said on TODAY.",
      "What did Carnival say about the incident?",
      "As passengers made it back on dry land, NBC News reported that former Carnival Cruise Lines CEO Gerry Cahill apologized for the ordeal.",
      "\u201cWe pride ourselves on providing our guests with a great vacation experience, and clearly we failed in this particular case,\u201d Cahill said at the time.",
      "Carnival provided passengers with food, phones, blankets and refreshments upon their arrival in Mobile.",
      "Buses arrived to take passengers to their flights home or to hotels.",
      "The first passenger to file suit did so hours after returning to land, seeking unspecified damages against Carnival Corp. saying \u201cshe was \u201cinjured as a result of the unseaworthy, unsafe, unsanitary, and generally despicable conditions,\u201d NBC News reported. Other passengers joined the lawsuit, which was settled out of court in 2016.",
      "Carnival suspended the Triumph through mid-April and gave $500 to each passenger. They also reimbursed each passenger\u2019s trip, their purchases onboard and gave them a free future cruise.",
      "While the ship failed its first inspection after $115 million in repairs, the Carnival Triumph is back at sea, renamed the Carnival Sunrise."

      "\"Basically, in the beginning, I just thought, 'OK, 50 years of \"SNL\" means I'll find the 50 best music performances. Easy-peasy,'\" Questlove recalls.",
      "\"Then, by the time I got to 1988, I already had 39 slots filled and thought there was no way I was going to get to 2025 without breaking someone's heart or ruining my reputation,\" he says.",
      "So, the musician and producer shifted gears and started over.",
      "\"I just started from the beginning and decided that maybe I should watch all the episodes,\" he says. Once he did, everything changed.",
      "\"I decided that this is not going to be a clip show. This is going to be a real narrative documentary,\" says Questlove, who notably picked up an Oscar in 2022 for \"Summer of Soul ( ... Or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised),\" a documentary on the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival.",
      "The result of his two-year odyssey is \"Ladies & Gentlemen \u2026 50 Years of 'SNL' Music,\" a two-hour feature now streaming on Peacock chronicling the hundreds of acts that have performed on \"SNL's\" legendary stage and the indelible mark they've left on TV history. (Peacock is owned by TODAY.com's parent company, NBCUniversal.)",
      "\"I love 'SNL' more than the air I breathe. So never once did it feel like work,\" says Questlove. \"Even now, I'm still at tapings as if I'm still doing research, knowing good and well, like, it's over.\"",
      "Along with chronicling memorable musical guests and moments, Questlove also included a variety of cameos and sketches in the documentary, citing their importance in the show's overall cultural impact.",
      "\"It'd be Billy Murray singing 'Star Wars' or Eddie Murphy doing 'Hot Tub,' even the Debbie Downer, womp, womp, womp, womp,\" he says, adding Debbie Downer sound effects for good measure.",
      "\"Most of the memorable things that we love 'SNL' for usually has a musical component that we attach it to.\"",
      "According to Questlove, he\u2019d watch episodes, then take notes on anything music-related that occurred during the 90-minute show, starting with \"SNL's\" debut on Oct. 11, 1975. That fateful first episode featured performances by not one, but two guests: Billy Preston and Janis Ian.",
      "Among the viewers watching that night was Questlove.",
      "\"I was 5 years old,\" he says. It was a seminal moment that would launch a lifelong passion for the show he'd one day go on to document for the history books.",
      "\"I\u2019m just really glad that I got chosen to be able to capture lightning in a bottle or just be in the zeitgeist of learning and teaching at the same time. That\u2019s the important thing for me.\"",
      "Watching Elton John With Madonna: 'She Was Just as Gobsmacked As I Was'",
      "Even though it's been on the air for five decades, Questlove says \"SNL\" is as relevant and \"strong\" as it was 50 years ago.",
      "\"There was a period where it was almost, like, customary, almost obligatory, to trash 'SNL.' Like, the whole 'Saturday Night Dead' or, 'It's not funny like it used to be,'\" he explains, saying it took him a while to realize it's not an \"SNL\" thing as much as it is a generational thing.",
      "\"You grasp on it, like, either in late middle school or the beginning of high school, and then it becomes your thing in college. Then you sort of step off the train once you go to adulthood. But another generation comes and embraces it,\" he says.",
      "\"Once I realized that it's just the passing down of the torch of a generation, then I realized that 'SNL' still has the power to speak to people.\"",
      "Indeed, he says the show spoke to him as he sat in the audience and watched Elton John perform live this past season.",
      "\"That moment was so powerful \u2014 looking to my left, in full civilian mode, was Madonna, literally four seats over. And she was just as gobsmacked as I was. And I was like, 'Wait a minute, no bodyguards, no fans. You're just sitting here like a regular person who wants this,'\" he says of John's April 5 performance.",
      "\"That's how powerful it was. We sat (and) it almost drove us to tears. That's how I realize there's still magic there.\"",
      "On Lady Gaga Hosting: 'It Was a Historical Moment'",
      "John was far from the only highlight this past season. Lizzo, Bad Bunny, Benson Boone, Stevie Nicks, Coldplay and Billie Eilish, among others, also took the stage during \"SNL's\" 50th season.",
      "But according to Questlove, one musician took their performance to the next level: Lady Gaga.",
      "Though the legendary singer has performed on the \"SNL\" stage a total of five times since 2009, it's her most recent turn as host and musical guest that the drummer says was a true game changer.",
      "\"She kind of wanted to redo, like, make a memorable moment happen that she didn't get to make happen the last time she hosted the show. And she did it,\" he says of Lady Gaga's March 8 appearance on \"SNL.\"",
      "\"That's the first time where I saw someone in every sketch and doing these intricate performances,\" Questlove continues.",
      "\"That's the magic of 'SNL,'\" he concludes. \"I'm glad I was there. It was a historical moment that we'll talk about decades from now.\""

      "\"Jurassic World's\" breakout star tucks into a backpack and chomps on licorice with her tiny teeth. Her name is Dolores, and she\u2019s quickly become the soft spot of \u201cJurassic World Rebirth.\u201d",
      "When the film made its theatrical debut on July 2, audiences encountered a dinosaur not yet seen before in the franchise: an Aquilops, brought to life not only by special effects but also by an animatronic figure.",
      "In the six previous entries of the \u201cJurassic\u201d franchise, moviegoers learned to brace for colossal carnivores, bone-rattling reptile rumbles and bloody-slicked jungle terrain. But Dolores' big eyes and playful energy likens her more to a pet than a predator.",
      "In a June 26 behind-the-scenes featurette, actor Rupert Friend, who portrays Martin Krebs, described Dolores as \u201cadorable,\u201d adding, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s everyone\u2019s favorite character in the film. She's probably mine.\"",
      "Similar affection for the dinosaur was extended when she appeared on TODAY June 25 alongside co-star Scarlett Johansson, who goaded co-anchor Craig Melvin into giving her a kiss.",
      "\"She's a diva,\" Johansson gushed, adding. \"Give Dolores a kiss!\"",
      "She might be an animatronic, but she certainly appeared real enough to Craig, who hesitated several times before finally plopping a kiss on her head.",
      "\"She is sweet, not as sweet as you,\" Craig told Johansson.",
      "What Kind of Dinosaur Is Dolores?",
      "Dolores is an Aquilops who made her feature debut in \u201cJurassic World Rebirth.\u201d She strikes a connection with the film\u2019s character Isabella (played by Audrina Miranda), whom the dinosaur comforts when Isabella is frightened.",
      "\u201cThe reason why our relationship is so good in the movie is because I was scared and she just happened to crawl along and help me,\u201d explains Miranda in the behind-the-scenes footage.",
      "Isabella eventually learns that Dolores isn\u2019t like the dangerous teeth-gnashing dinosaurs on the island. Instead, Dolores enjoys licorice and is up for being carried around in Isabella\u2019s backpack.",
      "David Iacono, who portrays Xavier in the film, describes her in the featurette as a \u201cfun-loving puppy.\u201d",
      "How Big Was Aquilops?",
      "When Aquilops, who inspired Dolores, existed more than 100 million years ago, it was believed to be nearly two feet long according to the Sam Noble Museum at the University of Oklahoma. Or, roughly the size of a small cat!",
      "How Was Dolores Brought to Life in \u2018Jurassic World Rebirth\u2019?",
      "Instead of being created solely through CGI, special effects artists brought Dolores to life in an animatronic form, according to NBC Insider. The Dolores puppet was operated via radio controllers, capable of making the dinosaur blink and move her head, body, jaw and tail.",
      "As a result, Dolores didn't just feel real on screen. According to the film\u2019s director, Gareth Edwards, Dolores' cuteness factor meant it was hard to tear the cast and crew away from her.",
      "\"The days we had the Aquilops on set were very long days because people wouldn't go home,\" Edwards explains. \"They would stop and they'd want to pet her.\""

      "While Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has been known to make touchdowns on the field, he\u2019s been trying his luck at scoring off the field in the world of acting.",
      "Appearing on a July 1 episode of \"Bussin' With The Boys,\" a podcast hosted by former NFL players Will Compton and Taylor Lewan, Kelce opened up about breaking into the acting world and some of its challenges.",
      "Reminiscing on his \"Saturday Night Live\" hosting gig in March 2023, Kelce said that while he felt \"so much more comfortable\" doing comedy, he still felt nervous and was concerned that he wouldn't be taken seriously.",
      "Kelce remembered thinking, \u201c\u2018I want to take advantage of this, like, I want to have fun doing it but I don\u2019t want to look like a loser doing this. I want to make them respect my approach and how I\u2019m taking it serious.\u201d",
      "Calling the rehearsals leading up to the show \u201ca crazy ride\u201d and \u201cjust a fun rollercoaster,\u201d he explained that he was at Rockefeller Center preparing all week until 2 or 3 a.m. every day.",
      "When asked about the \u201cSNL\u201d writers\u2019 rooms, Kelce called them \u201cfun because you\u2019re just getting pitched ideas.\u201d But when it came time for the table read, the football star called the experience the \u201chardest f---ing part\u201d about being on the show.",
      "\"The table reading \u2014 for a guy that can\u2019t really read that well \u2014 it was kind of a f--- situation,\" he said. \"I felt like I was just trying to get through the reading instead of actually acting it out and giving it a voice and giving it a character, things like that.\"",
      "\u201cI was just focused on, \u2018Don\u2019t f------ skip this line,\u2019\u201d he added.",
      "Lewan admitted similar troubles, telling Kelce, \u201cBrother, when it comes to reading difficulties, I will be on that side of the aisle with you my entire life.\u201d",
      "When Kelce added that he considers himself \u201cmore of an audio guy,\u201d Lewan joked, \u201cThat\u2019s why they make audio books now, for guys like us.\u201d",
      "\u201c\u2018You reading?\u2019 I\u2019m listening. I\u2019m listening quite a bit, actually,\u201d Lewan said as Kelce laughed.",
      "Earlier in the interview, Kelce touched on his \"fun cameo\" in Adam Sandler's upcoming sequel, \"Happy Gilmore 2,\" which is set to hit theaters July 25.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s where I see myself kind of focusing, like those fun cameos,\u201d he said, later adding, \u201clike in \u2018Happy Gilmore,\u2019 I\u2019m a waiter. Like a fun a-- f------ role in a movie with a guy, Adam Sandler, who I\u2019ve loved my entire life.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019d kill to do movies like that for the rest of my life,\u201d Kelce said of the new film.",
      "Despite his recent list of acting credits, including \u201cHappy Gilmore 2,\u201d Kelce admitted that acting is a field he\u2019s not \u201ccomfortable in yet, especially enough to do serious stuff,\u201d telling the podcast hosts that he doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel like I\u2019ve grasped the acting world yet.\u201d",
      "In 2024, Kelce took on his first \"serious\" acting role as Eddie Lachlan in Ryan Murphy's show \u201cGrotesquerie.\u201d While he credited the \"really good cast\" for showing him the ropes, he said he felt out of his comfort zone \"preparation wise.\"",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so prepared for an NFL game,\u201d Kelce explained. \u201cIn my career field, I get an entire week to figure out a scheme, how I\u2019m going to attack somebody, how I\u2019m going to handle certain specific situations. And when you go into acting, it\u2019s just, I didn\u2019t feel as prepared.\u201d",
      "The Super Bowl champion says he wishes acting had a similar approach to his on-field plays, saying, \u201cEvery single director I\u2019ve met on scenes, I\u2019m just like, \u2018Coach me up. I\u2019m here to be coached. If I suck, tell me I suck. Tell me how I can be better. I\u2019ll take all the criticism, I don\u2019t give a f---.\u2019\u201d"

      "BEERSHEBA, Israel \u2014 American contractors guarding aid distribution sites in Gaza are using live ammunition and stun grenades as hungry Palestinians scramble for food, according to accounts and videos obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Two U.S. contractors, speaking to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were revealing their employers\u2019 internal operations, said they were coming forward because they were disturbed by what they considered dangerous and irresponsible practices. They said the security staff hired were often unqualified, unvetted, heavily armed and seemed to have an open license to do whatever they wished.",
      "They said their colleagues regularly lobbed stun grenades and pepper spray in the direction of the Palestinians. One contractor said bullets were fired in all directions \u2014 in the air, into the ground and at times toward the Palestinians, recalling at least one instance where he thought someone had been hit.",
      "\u201cThere are innocent people being hurt. Badly. Needlessly,\u201d the contractor said.",
      "He said American staff on the sites monitor those coming to seek food and document anyone considered \u201csuspicious.\u201d He said they share such information with the Israeli military.",
      "Videos provided by one of the contractors and taken at the sites show hundreds of Palestinians crowded between metal gates, jostling for aid amid the sound of bullets, stun grenades and the sting of pepper spray.",
      "Other videos include conversation between English-speaking men discussing how to disperse crowds and encouraging each other after bursts of gunfire. NBC News has not obtained or reviewed the videos.",
      "The testimonies from the contractors \u2014 combined with the videos, internal reports and text messages obtained by the AP \u2014 offer a rare glimpse inside the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the newly created, secretive American organization backed by Israel to feed the Gaza Strip\u2019s population. Last month, the U.S. government pledged $30 million for the group to continue operations \u2014 the first known U.S. donation to the group, whose other funding sources remain opaque.",
      "In a statement issued in response to the AP\u2019s report, GHF said they had launched an investigation, which included reviewing the videos, and concluded that the claims in the story are \u201ccategorically false,\u201d and questioned the credibility of the reporting. The organization added that they are pursuing legal action against the news outlet.",
      "Journalists have been unable to access the GHF sites, located in Israeli military-controlled zones. The AP and NBC News cannot independently verify the contractors\u2019 stories.",
      "On Wednesday, officials in Switzerland initiated proceedings to dissolve the Geneva branch of the GHF, citing legal shortcomings in its establishment, Reuters reported.",
      "The group is registered in the U.S. state of Delaware and had registered an affiliate in Geneva on Feb. 12. The Federal Supervisory Authority for Foundations (ESA), a Swiss regulatory body, told Reuters the GHF had not fulfilled certain legal requirements including having the correct number of board members, a postal address or a Swiss bank account.",
      "\u201cGHF confirmed to the ESA that it had never carried out activities in Switzerland ... and that it intends to dissolve the Geneva-registered (branch),\u201d the ESA said in a statement obtained by Reuters.",
      "A spokesperson for Safe Reach Solutions, the logistics company subcontracted by GHF, told the AP that there have been no serious injuries at any of their sites to date. In scattered incidents, security professionals fired live rounds into the ground and away from civilians to get their attention. That happened in the early days at the \u201cthe height of desperation where crowd control measures were necessary for the safety and security of civilians,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "Gaza\u2019s more than 2 million Palestinians are living through a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. Since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, setting off the 21-month war, Israel has bombarded and laid siege to the strip, leaving many teetering on the edge of famine, according to food security experts.",
      "For 2 1/2 months before GHF\u2019s opening in May, Israel blocked all food, water and medicine from entering Gaza, claiming Hamas was stealing the aid being transported under a preexisting system coordinated by the United Nations. It now wants GHF to replace that U.N. system. The U.N. says its Gaza aid operations do not involve armed guards.",
      "Over 57,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed since the war erupted, according to the territory\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and militants.",
      "GHF is an American organization, registered in Delaware and established in February to distribute humanitarian aid during the ongoing Gaza humanitarian crisis. Since the GHF sites began operating more than a month ago, Palestinians say Israeli troops open fire almost every day toward crowds on roads heading to the distribution points, through Israeli military zones. Several hundred people have been killed and hundreds more wounded, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry and witnesses.",
      "In response, Israel\u2019s military says it fires only warning shots and is investigating reports of civilian harm. It denies deliberately shooting at any innocent civilians and says it\u2019s examining how to reduce \u201cfriction with the population\u201d in the areas surrounding the distribution centers.",
      "AP\u2019s reporting for this article focuses on what is happening at the sites themselves. Palestinians arriving at the sites say they are caught between Israeli and American fire, said the contractor who shared videos with the AP.",
      "\u201cWe have come here to get food for our families. We have nothing,\u201d he recounted Palestinians telling him. \u201cWhy does the [Israeli] army shoot at us? Why do you shoot at us?\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the GHF said there are people with a \u201cvested interest\u201d in seeing it fail and are willing to do or say almost anything to make that happen. The spokesperson said the team is composed of seasoned humanitarian, logistics and security professionals with deep experience on the ground. The group says it has distributed the equivalent of more than 50 million meals in Gaza in its food boxes of staples.",
      "GHF says that it has consistently shown compassionate engagement with the people of Gaza.",
      "Throughout the war, aid distribution has been marred by chaos. Gangs have looted trucks of aid traveling to distribution centers and mobs of desperate people have also offloaded trucks before they\u2019ve reached their destination. Earlier this month, at least 51 Palestinians were killed and more than 200 wounded while waiting for the U.N. and commercial trucks to enter the territory, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry and a local hospital. Israel\u2019s military acknowledged several casualties as soldiers opened fire on the approaching crowd and said authorities would investigate.",
      "AP spoke to the two contractors for UG Solutions, an American outfit subcontracted to hire security personnel for the distribution sites. They said bullets, stun grenades and pepper spray were used at nearly every distribution, even if there was no threat.",
      "Videos of aid being dispensed at the sites seen by the AP appear to back up the frenetic scenes the contractors described. The footage was taken within the first two weeks of its distributions \u2014 about halfway into the operations.",
      "In one video, what appear to be heavily armed American security contractors at one of the sites in Gaza discuss how to disperse Palestinians nearby. One is heard saying he has arranged for a \u201cshow of force\u201d by Israeli tanks.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want this to be too aggressive,\u201d he adds, \u201cbecause this is calming down.\u201d",
      "At that moment, bursts of gunfire erupt close by, at least 15 shots. \u201cWhoo! Whoo!\u201d one contractor yelps.",
      "\u201cI think you hit one,\u201d one says.",
      "Then comes a shout: \u201cHell, yeah, boy!\u201d",
      "The camera\u2019s view is obscured by a large dirt mound.",
      "The contractor who took the video told AP that he saw other contractors shooting in the direction of Palestinians who had just collected their food and were departing. The men shot both from a tower above the site and from atop the mound, he said. The shooting began because contractors wanted to disperse the crowd, he said, but it was unclear why they continued shooting as people were walking away.",
      "The camera does not show who was shooting or what was being shot at. But the contractor who filmed it said he watched another contractor fire at the Palestinians and then saw a man about 60 yards (meters) away \u2014 in the same direction where the bullets were fired \u2014 drop to the ground.",
      "This happened at the same time the men were heard talking \u2014 effectively egging each other on, he said. In other videos furnished by the contractor, men in grey uniforms \u2014 colleagues, he said \u2014 can be seen trying to clear Palestinians who are squeezed into a narrow, fenced-in passage leading to one of the centers. The men fire pepper spray and throw stun grenades that detonate amid the crowd. The sound of gunfire can be heard. The contractor who took the video said the security personnel usually fire at the ground near the crowds or from nearby towers over their heads.",
      "During a single distribution in June, contractors used 37 stun grenades, 27 rubber-and-smoke \u201cscat shell\u201d projectiles and 60 cans of pepper spray, according to internal text communications shared with the AP.",
      "That count does not include live ammunition, the contractor who provided the videos said.",
      "One photo shared by that contractor shows a woman lying in a donkey cart after he said she was hit in the head with part of a stun grenade.",
      "An internal report by Safe Reach Solutions, the logistics company subcontracted by GHF to run the sites, found that aid seekers were injured during 31% of the distributions that took place in a two-week period in June. The report did not specify the number of injuries or the cause. SRS told the AP the report refers to non-serious injuries.",
      "More videos show frenzied scenes of Palestinians running to collect leftover food boxes at one site. Hundreds of young men crowd near low metal barriers, transferring food from boxes to bags while contractors on the other side of the barriers tell them to stay back.",
      "Some Palestinians wince and cough from pepper spray. \u201cYou tasting that pepper spray? Yuck,\u201d one man close to the camera can be heard saying in English.",
      "SRS acknowledged that it\u2019s dealing with large, hungry populations, but said the environment is secure, controlled, and ensures people can get the aid they need safely."

      "The Chinese government responded to the comments swiftly, with a spokesperson for the Foreign Affairs Ministry saying the Dalai Lama must be reincarnated \u201cin accordance with Chinese laws and regulations.\u201d",
      "The succession must take place in mainland China and get approval from the central government, spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing in Beijing.",
      "The Dalai Lama made the announcement days ahead of his 90th birthday on Sunday, after a conference of representatives of the four major traditions of Titbetan Buddhism in the Indian city of Dharamsala, the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile.",
      "It\u2019s unusual for a living Dalai Lama to talk about his successor, the search for whom begins only upon his death because it involves reincarnation. But as the 14th Dalai Lama grows older, there is growing worry that the Chinese government could take advantage of a gap in leadership.",
      "\u201cI think His Holiness feels the need to reassure people by basically letting them know that he is thinking about the succession,\u201d Thupten Jinpa, his English translator of four decades, said in a phone interview from India last week.",
      "Identified as a baby in 1937, the 14th Dalai Lama was formally recognized two years later. In addition to his role as spiritual leader, he was temporal leader of Tibet starting in 1950, when he was 15 and China began annexing the region.",
      "In 1959, when he was 23, the Dalai Lama and thousands of other Tibetans fled to India after a failed uprising against Communist rule, eventually settling in Dharamsala.",
      "Since the 1970s, the goal of the movement has shifted from Tibetan independence to achieving genuine autonomy within China. In recent years, the Dalai Lama has also stepped down from his political role, which is now a democratically elected position.",
      "In March, he said in a new book that his successor would be born in the \u201cfree world\u201d outside China so that the traditional mission of the Dalai Lama could continue. According to the Central Tibetan Administration, there are about 130,000 Tibetan exiles around the world, mostly in India and Nepal.",
      "The Dalai Lama had said in 2011 that the institution of the Dalai Lama did not necessarily have to continue at all and that he would leave it up to the Tibetan Buddhist community.",
      "Since then, he has received appeals from a variety of constituencies, and the \u201cunanimous\u201d response, Jinpa said, has been that there should be a 15th Dalai Lama.",
      "\u201cFor the Tibetan people, his name has come to symbolize the nation,\u201d said Jinpa, who has assisted the Dalai Lama with a number of books, including the recent \u201cVoice for the Voiceless.\u201d",
      "There is also concern that if they do not select a new Dalai Lama, China could name one who goes unchallenged.",
      "\u201cSadly, the PRC government probably will want to play a role, just as it inserted itself in the process of the recognition of the Panchen Lama,\u201d Jinpa said, referring to the second-highest spiritual leader in Tibetan Buddhism.",
      "In 1995, the Dalai Lama recognized a 6-year-old boy in Tibet as the 11th Panchen Lama, six years after the previous one died. The boy was forcibly \u201cdisappeared\u201d by the Chinese government three days later, rights groups say, and has not been seen in public since.",
      "China then chose its own Panchen Lama, imposing him on the 6 million people in Tibet.",
      "The Tibetan government-in-exile does not recognize the Beijing-appointed Panchen Lama, who rarely appears in public but pledged loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party in a closed-door meeting last month with President Xi Jinping, state media reported.",
      "If Beijing also tries to name a Dalai Lama, \u201cTibetans would not be surprised,\u201d Jinpa said. \u201cThey would be disappointed and annoyed, but I don\u2019t think they would be surprised.\u201d",
      "The Chinese government says that Tibet has prospered under its rule and that it has improved infrastructure and social conditions and promoted economic development. It says that the Dalai Lama is \u201ca political exile engaged in separatist activities under the guise of religion\u201d and that the reincarnation of Tibetan lamas should be controlled by Beijing.",
      "China\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry said the Dalai Lama must be reincarnated \u201cin accordance with Chinese laws and regulations\u201d that Beijing claims aim to protect the tradition and religious freedom.",
      "The succession must take place in mainland China and get approval by the central government, Mao, the ministry spokesperson, said Wednesday."

      "LIUYANG, China \u2014 There are few sights more dazzling than fireworks on the Fourth of July. Yet all the sparkle and sound on the most American day of the year relies almost solely on China, which is mired in a trade war with the United States that could disrupt fireworks displays across the country from big cities to backyard barbecues.",
      "The U.S. imported more than 120,000 tons of fireworks in 2023, with over 97% of them \u2014 including those displayed at Independence Day celebrations \u2014 coming from China, according to the World Bank. American fireworks wholesalers and distributors are warning that President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese imports could limit supply and send prices soaring unless the duties are brought down.",
      "Though most Chinese-made fireworks were shipped in time for this year\u2019s Fourth of July celebrations, uncertainty hangs over future holidays as well as the \u201cgrand celebration\u201d Trump has promised for the 250th anniversary of American independence next year.",
      "U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, which had reached as high as 145%, are currently at 30% after the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day trade truce that ends in mid-August. The tariff rate for fireworks was previously 5%.",
      "The uncertainty is felt strongly here in Liuyang, a production hub in the southern Chinese province of Hunan that on its own makes nearly 60% of the world\u2019s fireworks. The city of about 1.5 million people is proudly known as the birthplace of fireworks, with a history in the business dating to China\u2019s Tang Dynasty more than 1,000 years ago.",
      "Wendy Tang, owner of Pyroshine Fireworks in Liuyang, said factories went through a \u201creally hard time\u201d when U.S.-China trade tensions escalated in March and April, a peak shipping season for July Fourth fireworks. At times, the U.S. and China were increasing their tariff rates multiple times a day.",
      "\u201cIn the morning, it\u2019s 100%. But in the afternoon, it\u2019s like 200%,\u201d Tang said, making it \u201cvery hard\u201d for her American customers to decide whether to proceed with their orders.",
      "Her U.S. clients eventually chose to go ahead, Tang said, and her company cleared almost all of its stock.",
      "\u201cMy customers said: \u2018OK. No matter what, we need fireworks for the consumers during the Independence Day,\u2019\u201d said Tang, who said she is now trying to confirm as many orders as possible for next year\u2019s July Fourth.",
      "While most U.S. warehouses were already stocked with fireworks for this year, shows in some places may be scaled back or cost more.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking at $20,000 or more increased cost just to get the container out of port,\u201d Matthew Lavigne, the owner of Green Mountain Fireworks in Alburgh, Vermont, told NBC affiliate WPTZ.",
      "In a letter to Trump sent in April, the American Pyrotechnics Association and the National Fireworks Association said the tariffs could \u201ccripple\u201d the $2 billion fireworks industry in the U.S.",
      "\u201cTariffs will not incentivize U.S. production \u2014 they will only increase costs,\u201d the letter said.",
      "Though fireworks received a tariff exemption during Trump\u2019s first term, there is no word on whether there will be any such reprieve this time around.",
      "In a statement, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said: \u201cReal prosperity and patriotism isn\u2019t celebrating the independence of our country with cheap foreign-made firecrackers and trinkets \u2014 it\u2019s having a country with booming Main Streets, a thriving working class, and robust manufacturing.\u201d",
      "The fireworks industry says it would be impossible for the U.S. to replicate Chinese manufacturing, citing its lack of key raw materials, its high labor costs and the extensive land it requires.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no country on the planet that can have this infrastructure and can do mass production that they can do here,\u201d Nicol\u00e1s Souza Linares, international business manager at the Indiana-based North Central Industries, the largest supplier of fireworks in the U.S. Midwest, said in an interview in Liuyang.",
      "At Tang\u2019s factory, there are dozens of workshops scattered across the slopes, serving different purposes in the production process.",
      "Some steps are automated, such as cutting paper and rolling it into shells or stacking tubes to form casings, but others, such as loading powder into the tubes, have to be done by hand because the work is so delicate and risky.",
      "An explosion at a Hunan fireworks factory this month killed nine people and injured 26 others, according to Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency.",
      "To prevent such accidents, work areas are separated by walls and kept at a distance from each other, with high-risk stages monitored by surveillance cameras overseen by local authorities. The government has strict rules limiting the amount of explosive powder each person can handle and the number of workers allowed in each area at any given time.",
      "Workers wear color-coded uniforms from yellow to orange \u2014 orange being the most dangerous \u2014 to indicate the level of danger linked with their tasks. Those working with the most dangerous materials are required to stop by around noon, before the hottest time of day.",
      "The American fireworks industry, which is made up mostly of small businesses, relies heavily on factories such as Tang\u2019s to supply events big and small.",
      "But Pyroshine Fireworks has received \u201cvery few orders\u201d recently as U.S. distributors \u201cwait and see what\u2019s going to happen with the tariffs,\u201d said Melissa Cai, the company\u2019s U.S. sales manager.",

      "\"She went to bed rather early, 7 o\u2019clock,\" he said. \"She got up two times, checked on him. He was watching TV or whatever. And then when she got up at 7:00 am, he was gone.\"",
      "The day prior to Tarrence's disappearance, DeFazio said, the pair went on a boat ride.",
      "Tarrence\u2019s wife told the private investigator that her husband had been acting \u201ca little bit different than he normally is,\u201d DeFazio told NBC News, but said it could have been due to dehydration.",
      "Local authorities did not respond to NBC News' request for comment. A State Department spokesperson said the agency is \"aware of a U.S. citizen missing in Turks and Caicos.\"",
      "\"When a U.S. citizen is missing, we work closely with local authorities as they carry out their search efforts, and we make every effort to keep lines of communication open with families as appropriate,\" the spokesperson said. \"The Department of State has no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens abroad. We stand ready to provide consular assistance to U.S. citizens in need and their families.\"",
      "The private investigator added that Tarrence's wife said his speech was unusual the night before he disappeared. He noted that Tarrence left the condo with his phone and that he has not made any credit card transactions since his disappearance.",
      "DeFazio added that the local police department was trying to gain access to Tarrence's phone records, while his sister-in-law and mother looked for him on the island.",
      "DeFazio said Tarrence's wife went back to the United States but was expected to return to the island soon."
