      "The world's most popular TikTok personality has left the U.S. after being detained by immigration agents in Las Vegas",
      "LAS VEGAS -- LAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 Khaby Lame, the world\u2019s most popular TikTok personality with millions of followers, has left the U.S. after being detained by immigration agents in Las Vegas for allegedly overstaying his visa.",
      "The Senegalese-Italian influencer, whose legal name is Seringe Khabane Lame, was detained Friday at Harry Reid International Airport but was allowed to leave the country without a deportation order, a spokesperson for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed in a statement.",
      "Lame arrived in the U.S. on April 30 and \u201coverstayed the terms of his visa,\u201d the ICE spokesperson said. The Associated Press sent a message seeking comment Tuesday to the email address listed on Lame\u2019s Instagram account. He has not publicly commented on his detainment.",
      "His detainment and voluntary departure from the U.S. comes amid President Donald Trump\u2019s escalating crackdown on immigration, including raids in Los Angeles that sparked days of protests against ICE, as the president tests the bounds of his executive authority.",
      "A voluntary departure \u2014 which was granted to Lame \u2014 allows those facing removal from the U.S. to avoid a deportation order on their immigration record, which could prevent them from being allowed back into the U.S. for up to a decade.",
      "The 25-year-old rose to international fame during the pandemic without ever saying a word in his videos, which would show him reacting to absurdly complicated \u201clife hacks.\" He has over 162 million followers on TikTok alone.",
      "The Senegal-born influencer moved to Italy when he was an infant with his working class parents and has Italian citizenship.",
      "His internet fame quickly evolved. He signed a multi-year partnership with designer brand Hugo Boss in 2022. In January, he was appointed as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador.",
      "Last month, he attended the Met Gala in New York City, days after arriving in the U.S.",

      "Oscar-nominated \u201cPast Lives\u201d filmmaker Celine Song's new film \u201cMaterialists\u201d was inspired by the brief time she worked as a matchmaker in New York",
      "Before Celine Song was an Oscar-nominated filmmaker, she was a playwright in New York who needed day jobs to pay rent. That\u2019s how she found herself as a professional matchmaker.",
      "What may have begun as a purely transactional gig, a way for her to keep making her art in an expensive city, taught her more about people\u2019s wants and needs and the true contents of their hearts than she could have ever imagined.",
      "\u201cI always wanted to write something about it because there seemed to be a story in it that is massive and very epic in proportion,\u201d Song said. \u201cIt affects every human being on Earth.\"",
      "And while waiting for her breakout film \u201cPast Lives\u201d to debut, she did. That film is \u201cMaterialists,\u201d a modern-day New York love story starring Dakota Johnson, Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans that\u2019s heading to theaters this weekend. Johnson is the matchmaker presented with two different types of men for herself \u2014 one a poor struggling actor and ex-boyfriend, the other a wealthy \u201cunicorn\u201d \u2014 and the internet has already been drawing battle lines. But, like \u201cPast Lives\u201d wasn\u2019t really about a love triangle, \u201cMaterialists\u201d is about something more than the question of which guy is the \u201ccorrect\u201d choice.",
      "Song and Johnson spoke with The Associated Press about the film, falling in love and the modern marketplace of dating. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "SONG: We met up thinking that we were just going to get to know each other and be friends and I walked away from that conversation \u2014 this is just from my perspective \u2014 but I think I was still sitting there when I texted my producers and the studio being like, \u201cI think I\u2019ve found my Lucy.\u201d That\u2019s how casting works for me, it\u2019s always about falling in love. It\u2019s very connected to what we talk about in the film. Like, there\u2019s no mathematical anything. It just the feeling that you get talking to someone and you\u2019re like, oh I just know.",
      "JOHNSON: I knew you had this movie that you were about to start making. I was basically told it was too late. I was like, but I really want to meet her because she\u2019s so smart, and I\u2019ve seen interviews and obviously had seen \u201cPast Lives.\u201d I just wanted talk and get to know her as an artist and a person and so I went into this being like there\u2019s no chance that I\u2019ll be in this movie, but maybe she\u2019ll make another one. We just had such a good time talking, I didn\u2019t even know that I was someone she was thinking about. A few weeks later we spoke. It was very romantic.",
      "JOHNSON: She\u2019s sort of at the top of her game in her work and is very disconnected from her heart and focused on being a perfectionist and getting people to get married. On the surface, you see her as a very transactional person and not really invested in people\u2019s souls, but she actually is and really does want the best for them. She\u2019s also on her own journey of trying to figure out what it is she wants for herself in this life, and, essentially, do you fight for the thing that you think you want, or do you fight for that thing that you know you need? Is that right, Celine?",
      "SONG: That\u2019s so good.",
      "SONG: It was never going to be a conversation about which flavor of a person. It\u2019s actually so much more about this marketplace of dating that all of us live in if you\u2019re single, and also the marketplace that Dakota\u2019s character is navigating. She knows the math better than anyone else in the film. She\u2019s an excellent matchmaker.",
      "Pedro plays somebody who is probably, in straight dating, someone of the highest possible value. Chris\u2019 character, in the spectrum in the marketplace of values of dating, is someone who is of the lowest value possible. I find them to be such adorable characters, very worthy of an adoration.",
      "Lucy knows exactly where they fall in the in the stock market of men. It\u2019s actually about the way that the math around that is going to blow up.",
      "JOHNSON: Celine speaks so eloquently about the marketplace of dating and I glitch at those words because I\u2019m like, you can\u2019t explain love that way. But that\u2019s actually how people are. Marriage used to be a business deal. It was like, my father wants your cows and my mother needs your wheat and whatever. It was a trade-off. But now there\u2019s all these books about how we expect our partner to fulfill every single aspect of our needs. And the world being dominated by social media, people don\u2019t meet in real life anymore. They don\u2019t behave normally in public.",
      "People are in a very strange place in evolution, and I think the difference between these two characters and these two men, sure they are different ends of the spectrum in terms of like technical value, materialistic value. But also each of them have the opposite in terms of psycho-spiritual value and emotional value and what they can offer the other person in terms of soul evolution and growth.",
      "Perhaps because she works in this world of trying to understand people and what they want, she\u2019s forced to go more inward and really interrogate herself and say, what do I really want and what is actually important in this life? Is it how much money I have or is it how truly loved I am?",
      "SONG: To me, it\u2019s about this contradiction, right? It\u2019s this thing of how we talk about what we want in our partner, when we\u2019re asked to use language to describe it, and how we literally, spiritually fall in love. The gap between those two things is terrifyingly big. To me, that\u2019s where the mystery of the film is.",

    "story": [
      "Harm reductions initiatives are becoming more commonplace at major music festivals, both through partnerships with festival organizers as well as volunteer efforts done without explicit permission",
      "NEW YORK -- The sounds of muffled percussion and audience cheers reverberate throughout the grounds. Brand activations, makeshift bars and restaurant pop-ups control traffic as a sea of bodies move from set to set. Sandwiched between is a row of nonprofits across familiar causes: hunger, housing and voter registration.",
      "It's a common music festival scene, until closer inspection. There is a new table, This Must Be the Place. The Ohio-based nonprofit offers attendees free opioid overdose reversal treatment and training on how to use it, an education acquired in under two minutes. Just a few years ago, their inclusion might've been unthinkable amid murky regulations and a lack of public awareness surrounding harm reduction.",
      "Advocates say drugs are commonly consumed at music festivals, making them ideal locations for harm reduction activities. While more music festivals are allowing such activities, activists are pushing for expanded efforts as some festivals remain cautious.",
      "Founded by William Perry and Ingela Travers-Hayward in 2022, This Must Be The Place has since given away an estimated $4.5 million in naloxone, the opioid overdose reversal medication, at festivals and smaller community events.",
      "In the very beginning, without a \u201cproof of concept,\u201d as Perry describes it, they had trouble partnering with festivals. Eventually, a few festivals in the Midwest agreed to let them table, which \u201cgot us in the door with Bonnaroo in 2022,\u201d says Perry, referring to the major U.S. festival operated by C3 Presents, one of the largest concert promoters on the planet. Now they have a presence at 35 major U.S. festivals \u2014 including Lollapalooza, Governors Ball and Besame Mucho \u2014 where they collaborate directly with C3 and their security personnel.",
      "The organization's growth overlaps with advancing federal regulations. According to Daliah Heller, vice president of overdose prevention initiatives at the global public health nonprofit Vital Strategies, naloxone distribution used to be determined by state regulations until 2023, when the Food and Drug Administration approved the first over-the-counter nasal spray.",
      "\u201cWe no longer need the prescription laws to be amended to allow for the distribution of naloxone,\u201d she says. \u201cNow it's like buying aspirin \u2014 it's over the counter.\u201d",
      "Last year, This Must Be the Place gave away 46,146 units of Narcan \u2014 a brand name for naloxone \u2014 through their national festival outreach.",
      "Emmett Beliveau, chief operating officer of C3 Presents, says working with This Must Be the Place was C3\u2019s first time implementing public-facing harm reduction strategies, in addition to the promoter's existing medical programs.",
      "Bringing the organization into C3\u2019s festivals was \u201cnot in response to anything that has happened at one of our festivals,\u201d he says, but rather because of the \u201cnumber of fatalities happening in our communities.\u201d",
      "Some activists believe attendees are most responsive to receiving harm reduction education from peers instead of authority figures. And so, for the last three years, a nonprofit dedicated to combating accidental drug overdoses among young adults, Team Awareness Combating Overdose, has distributed fentanyl test strips and Narcan at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.",
      "Former TACO CEO Kameran Mody says that music festivals are ideal locations for distribution and education because \u201cmusic and the use of drugs are synonymous with each other.\u201d",
      "TACO distributes through what Mody describes as \u201cguerrilla-style marketing.\u201d They enlist volunteers, train them on how to use naloxone, and ship Narcan and test strips to them to bring into the festival.",
      "They do not involve the festival organizers. Representatives for Coachella did not respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment.",
      "In 2023, a TACO volunteer administered Narcan to an unresponsive Coachella attendee exhibiting signs of an overdose. The organization says the attendee regained consciousness.",
      "\u201cThat was one of our biggest successes,\u201d Mody says.",
      "In 2019, at Bonnaroo, a 27-year-old man was found dead at his campsite \u2014 right after harm reduction activists had picketed the Tennessee festival because it didn't allow drug testing. The toxicology report found ecstasy and fentanyl in his system.",
      "At the time, under state law, test strips were criminalized and classified as drug paraphernalia. That\u2019s changed: In 2022, Tennessee decriminalized fentanyl test strips. By the end of 2023, 44 other states and D.C. had done the same.",
      "But in some states, drug paraphernalia laws are written in a way that isn't completely transparent \u2014 there are test strips that are not fentanyl-specific, Heller points out \u2014 and criminalization and social stigmas endure.",
      "Some have found workarounds. \u201cEven in the states where the legalities were a bit unclear, instead of just coming in and hoping things worked out, we would reach out to the health department, and say \u2018We run this project, how do feel about it?\u2019\u201d says Perry. \u201cWe would end up with letters from the highest-ranking health official, either in the county or in the state, saying \u2018We approve of this.\u2019 That circumvented any roadblocks.\u201d",
      "Some festivals, though, might be hesitant to use test strips because \u201cit\u2019s tough for them to admit that drugs are being used,\u201d Mody says. Some festivals have even banned naloxone.",
      "While This Must Be The Place distributes fentanyl test strips at some Ohio events, C3 doesn't distribute test strips at its events and does not plan to. Beliveau doesn't believe fentanyl test strips are effective and expressed concern they could encourage drug use. Test strips, which can detect fentanyl in pills, powders or injectables, are recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a low-cost means of helping prevent drug overdoses.",
      "At a three-day electronic music festival in Mexico City earlier this year, a booth provided free, anonymous drug testing. The initiative, known as \u201cCheca tu Sustancia\u201d (Check Your Substance), was spearheaded by the Instituto RIA, a Mexico-based drug policy research and advocacy organization.",
      "When unexpected substances are detected, users received detailed information on what they are, their risks, potential interactions with other substances and dosage adjustments, empowering them to make informed choices.",
      "Perry says they are aware of smaller festivals in the United States conducting drug checking, but \u201cthey do it in a very underground and whisper network way\u201d to avoid criminalization.",
      "What Perry says his organization would like to see at music festivals in the future would be harm reduction areas \u2014 sections where attendees who have taken drugs can be monitored, not to \u201cget them into trouble\u201d but to ensure safety.",
      "Heller says there are a number of groups working to destigmatize drugs, promote decriminalization, and promote drug checking.",
      "\u201cWe already have drug checking happening in cities,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes perfect sense to expand the settings where you would offer that to include music festivals. It's the same rationale. ... The issue is this idea of liability. You\u2019d have to create a law, essentially, that would protect the festival from liability.\u201d",

      "\u201cI\u2019ve had four phone conversations with Ms. Winfrey,\u201d Lamb said in a statement, remembering how she called to praise his debut novel, \u201cShe's Come Undone\u201d upon its release, in 1992. Five years later, she phoned with the news that \u201cShe's Come Undone\u201d was her latest book club pick. In 1998, Winfrey picked Lamb's \u201cI Know This Much Is True,\u201d his second novel.",
      "\u201cI was as shocked as ever last month when I answered the phone and heard Ms. Winfrey\u2019s voice again, twenty-seven years after the last time we had talked,\u201d he said. \u201cShe told me my latest novel, \u2018The River Is Waiting,\u2019 would be the 115th title in her beloved Book Club.

      "NEW YORK -- Jurors in Harvey Weinsteinn'ssex crimes retrial appeared to be focusing on one of his three accusers as deliberations stretched into a fourth day Tuesday, with no further sign of interpersonal tensions that flared earlier.",
      "The jury had requested to start off Tuesday with electronic copies of emails and other evidence pertaining to Jessica Mann \u2014 the accuser with arguably the most complex history with Weinstein. Jurors deliberated through the morning without sending any further requests.",
      "During days of testimony, Mann said the Oscar-winning movie producer raped her in 2013 amid a consensual relationship that continued for years afterward. Weinstein\u2019s lawyers emphasized that she kept seeing him, accepting invitations and sending warm messages to him. Mann said she \u201ccompartmentalized\u201d the pain he caused her.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty to all the charges in the case. In addition to the rape charge, he's accused of sexually assaulting two other women, Mimi Haley and Kaja Sokola.",
      "Weinstein didn't testify during the current trial, but maintained through his attorneys that he had completely consensual encounters with his accusers, who wanted his help building show business careers.",
      "Weinstein was one of the movie industry's most powerful figures until a series of sexual misconduct allegations against him became public in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement and eventually leading to criminal charges.",
      "The jury is made up of seven women and five men. Their closed-door discussions began Thursday and apparently have been fractious at times.",
      "One juror asked Friday to be excused because he felt one member of the group was being treated unfairly. Then on Monday, the foreperson complained to the judge, prosecutors and defense lawyers that some jurors were \u201cpushing\" others to change their minds, talking about Weinstein's past and going beyond the charges.",
      "The foreperson didn't specify what was said. Trial evidence has included some testimony about allegations outside the scope of the current charges, such as mentions of the groundswell of claims against the ex-studio boss in 2017.",
      "Yet another juror soon asked to speak to the court, where she opined that things were \u201cgoing well.\u201d By the end of Monday, the jury as a whole said in a note that it was \u201cmaking good progress.\u201d",
      "There was progress Tuesday on at least one front: Jurors ultimately were given coffee, as requested, Judge Curtis Farber said. He hadn't initially thought the state court system could provide it.",
      "Weinstein originally was convicted in New York in 2020 of raping Mann and forcing oral sex on Haley. Sokola's allegation was added last year, after New York state's highest court overturned the 2020 conviction and sent the case back for retrial.",
      "Meanwhile, Weinstein is appealing a 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not identify people without their permission if they say they have been sexually assaulted. Sokola, Mann and Haley have agreed to be named.",

      "A Connecticut judge has settled a bitter feud over the estate of the late legendary blues guitarist Johnny Winter",
      "A Connecticut judge has settled a bitter feud over the estate of the late legendary blues guitarist Johnny Winter, ordering his managers to pay $226,000 in damages for improper payments they received after his 2014 death and rejecting their claim to the rights to his music.",
      "Relatives of Winter's late wife, Susan, sued Winter's manager, Paul Nelson, and his wife, Marion, in 2020, claiming the Nelsons swindled more than $1 million from Winter's music business. The Nelsons denied the allegations and countersued. They accused the relatives of improperly having Paul Nelson ousted as the beneficiary of Winter's estate, and they claimed ownership of his music rights.",
      "After a seven-day trial before a judge in January 2024, Judge Trial Referee Charles Lee ruled Friday that the Nelsons received improper payments and made improper withdrawals from Winter's accounts, but rejected claims they committed fraud, mismanagement and breach of contract.",
      "\u201cThe court finds that the conduct for which it has awarded the damages set forth above was negligent or at least arguably legitimate,\u201d Lee wrote in a 54-page decision that also rejected the claims in the Nelsons' countersuit.",
      "The judge said the Nelsons' most serious impropriety was withdrawing $112,000 from Winter's business account and depositing it into one of their own accounts in 2019, without listing Susan Winter as a signatory on their account. Susan Winter owned all of her husband's assets \u2014 valued at about $3 million at the time of his death. The judge said punitive damages may be imposed on the Nelsons because of that transfer.",
      "Paul Nelson, who managed Johnny Winter's business from 2005 to 2019 and played guitar in his band, died in March 2024 from a heart attack during a music tour. Marion Nelson, who did bookkeeping for the Winters and the music business, did not immediately return an email message Monday. The Nelsons' lawyers did not immediately return phone and email messages. It wasn't clear if they planned to appeal.",
      "Susan Winter died from lung cancer in October 2019. Months before her death, she removed Paul Nelson as her successor trustee to her family trust, which included all of her late husband's assets. She named her sister and brother, Bonnie and Christopher Warford, from Charlotte, North Carolina, as her new successor trustees, and they sued the Nelsons.",
      "The Warfords' lawyers did not immediately return phone and email messages Monday. Phone numbers for the Warfords listed in public records were no longer in service.",
      "The Nelsons claimed the Warfords took advantage of Susan Winter and had her sign legal documents while she was medicated near the end of her life. They also alleged the Warfords soured their relationship with Susan Winter with false embezzlement claims. The Warfords denied those allegations.",
      "The judge ruled that the Warfords were entitled to damages because of improper payments the Nelsons received, including $68,000 in royalty payments from a 2016 auction of Winter's assets, $69,000 in cash withdrawals, $18,000 in expense reimbursements and $15,000 in other royalty payments.",
      "The Warfords also were awarded $56,000 that remains in one of the Nelsons' accounts, the same account used in the $112,000 transfer criticized by the judge. In 2020, the Nelsons transferred about $151,000 out of that account to the Warfords\u2019 lawyers.",
      "Lee also rejected claims by the Warfords that Paul Nelson should not have received $300,000 in auction proceeds from the sale of three of Johnny Winter's guitars, because Winter promised those guitars to Paul Nelson.",
      "John Dawson Winter III was born and raised in Beaumont, Texas. He burst onto the world blues scene in the 1960s, dazzling crowds with his fast licks while his trademark long, white hair flew about from under his cowboy hat. He and his brother Edgar \u2014 both born with albinism \u2014 were both renowned musicians. Johnny Winter, who played at Woodstock in 1969, was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1988.",
      "Rolling Stone magazine listed him as the No. 63 best guitar player of all time in 2015. He released more than two dozen albums and was nominated for several Grammy Awards, winning his first one posthumously in 2015 for Best Blues Album for \u201cStep Back.\u201d Nelson produced the album and also took home a Grammy for it.",
      "Johnny Winter, who spent two decades living in Easton, Connecticut, before his death, battled heroin addiction for years and credited Nelson, whom he met in 1999, with helping him get off the opioid methadone and revive his career, according to the 2014 documentary, \u201cJohnny Winter: Down & Dirty.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- Frederick Forsyth, the British author of \u201cThe Day of the Jackal\" and other bestselling thrillers, has died after a brief illness, his literary agent said Monday. He was 86.",
      "Jonathan Lloyd, his agent, said Forsyth died at home early Monday surrounded by his family.",
      "\u201cWe mourn the passing of one of the world\u2019s greatest thriller writers,\" Lloyd said.",
      "Forsyth served as a Royal Air Force pilot before becoming a foreign correspondent and a novelist. In 2015, he told the BBC that he had also worked for the British intelligence agency MI6 for many years, starting from when he covered a civil war in Nigeria in the 1960s.",
      "\u201cThe Day of the Jackal,\u201d published in 1971, propelled him into global fame. The political thriller about a professional assassin was made into a film in 1973 and more recently a television series starring Eddie Redmayne and Lashana Lynch.",

    "story": [
      "Trailblazing ballerina Misty Copeland has decided to move on to what she calls \u201cthe next stage\u201d in her career",
      "NEW YORK -- Ten years ago this month, Misty Copeland sat in front of a hastily arranged news conference at American Ballet Theatre, fighting back tears of pride over her new role: principal dancer.",
      "\u201cThis is it,\u201d she said, with emotion. \u201cThis has been my dream since I was 13.\u201d",
      "The occasion was highly unusual \u2014 normally, when a dancer is promoted, a brief press release is issued. But this was Copeland, a crossover star with fame far beyond the insular world of ballet. And now she was becoming the first Black female principal in the company\u2019s 75-year history \u2014 just days after her New York debut as the lead in \u201cSwan Lake\u201d brought a refreshingly diverse, packed audience to the Metropolitan Opera House.",
      "Now, a decade and many accomplishments later, Copeland is retiring from the company she joined as a teenager.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been 25 years at ABT, and I think it\u2019s time,\u201d Copeland, 42, told the Associated Press last week ahead of Monday\u2019s official announcement of her move. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to move to the next stage.\u201d",
      "The company is planning a splashy farewell on Oct. 22, featuring performances by Copeland \u2014 for the first time in five years \u2014 and other dancers. There will be speeches and film clips. And Copeland, who's been heavily involved in the planning, will get a chance to venture one more time onto that balcony in Verona; she\u2019ll dance again in the beautiful \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d pas de deux. Honorary chairs for the evening will be Caroline Kennedy and Oprah Winfrey.",
      "A lot has happened in a quarter-century. Copeland, whose success brought new energy to an art form that has always been overwhelmingly white, has authored a number of books, including a memoir and and several works for young people. The second installment of \u201cBunheads\u201d arrives in September, and more are already planned in a series she calls \u201ca reflection of my journey, showing the range of cultures and types of people that can be a part of the ballet world.\u201d",
      "Copeland has also made a short film with her production company. And her philanthropic organization, The Misty Copeland Foundation, works on increasing diversity in the dance world and giving more kids who grew up economically disadvantaged, like she did, the chance to dance.",
      "\u201cIt was so important for children growing up and seeing somebody like Misty and saying, \u2018Oh my gosh, she looks like I do,\u2019\u201d says Susan Jaffe, ABT\u2019s artistic director, who is overseeing the farewell performance. \u201cThrough her books, through her lectures, even her endorsements, she has really been a trailblazer.\"",
      "Still, progress moves slowly. When Copeland exits ABT, there will no longer be a Black female principal dancer at the company \u2014 nor at many ballet companies around the globe. Copeland discussed that continued challenge in the dance world, among other topics, in the AP interview last week. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "COPELAND: You know, I\u2019ve become the person that I am today, and have all the opportunities I have today, because of ballet, (and) because of American Ballet Theatre. I feel like this is me saying thank you to the company. So it\u2019s a farewell. (But) it won\u2019t be the end of me dancing. \u2026 Never say never.",
      "COPELAND: I\u2019ve noticed that the conversation is not something we shy away from anymore in terms of the lack of equity, the lack of diversity in this (dance) world. That\u2019s one of the biggest shifts I\u2019ve seen \u2026 a lot of young people that just can imagine being part of it in some way. They can imagine stepping into Lincoln Center and being at the Metropolitan Opera House.",
      "COPELAND: It's definitely concerning, and I think I\u2019ve just gotten to a place in my career where there\u2019s only so much I can do on a stage. There\u2019s only so much that visual representation like that can do. I feel like it\u2019s the perfect timing for me to be stepping into a new role, and hopefully still shaping and shifting the ballet world and culture.",
      "COPELAND: I think about my partnership with (former ABT principal) Roberto Bolle and him giving me so many opportunities to travel the world with him \u2026 (Former ABT principal) Marcelo Gomes, he\u2019s been such a such a big part of my journey, and of course Herman Cornejo. We\u2019ve had a beautiful partnership throughout my career and I\u2019m excited to dance with him again (at the October farewell,)",
      "COPELAND: It\u2019s made me even more patient. I just have a lighter and brighter outlook on life because it\u2019s just such an incredible thing to experience and witness... I think ballet has prepared me for being a mother in so many ways. I think it\u2019s ... prepared me for life and being resilient and patient and sensitive and empathetic and strong, and all of these things.",
      "COPELAND: He doesn\u2019t understand at all! (laughs) He\u2019s seen very little of me dancing. \u2026 But he\u2019s very drawn to it. He is a mover. He\u2019s very athletic. He is so drawn to music. He started violin on Monday. We live in the museums. He really is drawn to art. I think he\u2019s definitely on the artist\u2019s track.",
      "COPELAND: It\u2019s been pretty evenly split between all of then. I think it just depends on what\u2019s at the forefront and what needs my focus. ... But it\u2019s exciting to be able to utilize dance in so many different mediums, and to me, that\u2019s how you get true diversity \u2014 by giving people different entry points into learning about dance and feeling like they can be a part of it, which has been my goal. How do I bring dance to as many people as possible in a way that really works for them?",
      "COPELAND: It\u2019s a difficult time. And I think all we can really do is keep our heads down and keep doing the work. \u2026 we\u2019re fortunate in that way that we\u2019ve built great relationships and can continue to do the work right now through my foundation. There\u2019s no way to stop the people that feel passionate about this work. We will continue doing it. It is so necessary for the well-being of our societies and communities. I think there are times to speak out and yell from the rooftops. And for me, I feel like this is a time to keep my head down and really stay focused and do the work.",

      "NEW YORK -- Even the ushers at Radio City Music Hall seemed thrilled to be in the room where it happened.",
      "A few of them could be seen grooving, like everyone else at Sunday\u2019s Tony Awards, to the \u201cHamilton\u201d reunion performance \u2014 a medley of some of that blockbuster musical\u2019s biggest songs, performed by the original cast. The occasion was the 10th Broadway anniversary of Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s juggernaut that spawned multiple touring companies, a West End production and a live-capture film \u2014 and is still going strong.",
      "But while the theater was buzzing to songs like \u201cMy Shot,\u201d \u201cThe Schuyler Sisters,\u201d \u201cHistory Has Its Eyes on You\u201d and \u201cThe Room Where It Happens,\u201d some people were unfortunately NOT in the room where, er, it was happening. They were the ones who\u2019d taken a trip to the bar or a stroll around the lobby, and were then held from entering until the next commercial break \u2014 missing perhaps the night\u2019s most anticipated highlight.",
      "They also missed the entire audience singing along with Jonathan Groff, aka King George, \u201cDa-da-da, dat-da, dat, da-da-da, da-ya-da, Da-da, dat, dat, da-ya-da.\u201d Note for next year: Exit at your own peril!",
      "Some other notable moments from Tony night:",
      "Most award winners thank Mom, their agents, their co-stars and their spouses.",
      "Cole Escola, one of the major stars of this Tony night, promised Mom a call, but also decided to thank \u201cTeebo from Grindr\u201d \u2014 the dating app \u2014 when accepting the award for lead actor in a play.",
      "Escola is star and writer of the riotous \u201cOh, Mary!\u201d \u2014 a reimagining of the life of Mary Todd Lincoln (and her beleaguered husband, Abe) that addresses the question: What if the Lincoln assassination wasn\u2019t such a bad thing for Mary? (Mary wants to be a cabaret star, you see.) The show is seeing audiences collapse in laughter for 80 minutes every night on Broadway.",
      "Escola, a downtown cabaret star, beat out high-wattage competitors like George Clooney and Daniel Dae Kim for the acting award. They mentioned their co-nominees in their speech, saying they had enjoyed sharing \u201cwarm salads\u201d at pre-awards lunches.",
      "Escola is the first nonbinary actor to win a Tony in the category.",
      "When \u201cMaybe Happy Ending\u201d writers Hue Park and Will Aronson accepted the award for best book of a musical, the first handed out, Park felt it necessary to point out that they weren\u2019t an actual couple. \u201cI am very much single,\u201d he clarified, for anyone wondering.",
      "Then later, when the duo won for best score, Park deemed a reminder necessary: \u201cBy the way, I\u2019m still single.\u201d",
      "And then at the end of the night, \u201cMaybe Happy Ending,\u201d the charming and quirky romance between decommissioned robots in a futuristic Korea, won the big prize: best musical. Park did not get the mic. But producer Jeffrey Richards did, and he reminded the crowd: \u201cHue is still single.\u201d",
      "Cynthia Erivo, the \u201cWicked\u201d star and powerhouse vocalist hosting the evening, said it first: \u201cAs they apparently say in a very fertile piece of intellectual property,\" she said with a wink, \u201cthere\u2019s no place like home. And Broadway has always been mine.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a familiar theme on Tony night: the theater community as a welcoming haven for those who may feel different or unseen. It was echoed by Harvey Fierstein, winner of a lifetime achievement award, describing how he joined the theater after being welcomed by a company in Brooklyn. And it was expressed very emotionally by Nicole Scherzinger, winning best actress in a musical for \u201cSunset Blvd.\u201d",
      "\u201cGrowing up, I always felt like I didn\u2019t belong,\u201d said Scherzinger, former lead singer of the pop group Pussycat Dolls who plays Norma Desmond in the minimalist version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber show. \u201cBut you all have made me feel like I belong, and I have come home at last.\u201d Those last words echo the lyrics of one of Desmond\u2019s big numbers, \u201cAs If We Never Said Goodbye.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo if there\u2019s anyone out there who feels like they don\u2019t belong, or your time hasn\u2019t come, don\u2019t give up,\u201d Scherzinger continued. \u201cJust keep on giving and giving because the world needs your love and your light now more than ever.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s always lots of chatter going on during an awards show. But the way the crowd quieted down during Audra McDonald\u2019s powerful, agonized performance of \u201cRose\u2019s Turn\u201d from \u201cGypsy\u201d was striking. In the song's quiet moments, you heard utter silence in the vast room.",
      "McDonald, the Tonys' most awarded actor, is clearly revered by the theater community, who cheered her with standing ovations. But the award she was up for went to Scherzinger.",
      "It\u2019s been two years since HBO\u2019s \u201cSuccession\u201d ended, but its stars keep turning up at awards shows \u2014 and often winning. Jeremy Strong won a Tony last year and was nominated for an Oscar this year. Kieran Culkin won an Oscar this year and is appearing on Broadway this season, though he wasn\u2019t nominated. And now it was the turn of Sarah Snook \u2014 Emmy and Golden Globe winner \u2014 to win a Tony.",
      "Snook, who played mercurial sibling Shiv Roy in the series, took the Tony for best actress in a play for \u201cThe Picture of Dorian Gray,\u201d in which she plays all 26 roles.",
      "Tony winner and musical theater regular Gavin Creel, who died last year of cancer, was a friend to many in the theater community, and was remembered more than once on Tony evening.",
      "During the early pre-show, actor Celia Keenan-Bolger was honored with the Isabelle Stevenson award, for her advocacy work in the arts. She spoke movingly of her deep friendship with Creel and their advocacy work together.",
      "Later, singer and actor Sara Bareilles performed a soulful duet of \u201cTomorrow\u201d from \u201cAnnie,\u201d harmonizing with Erivo, during the memorial segment. That segment ended with a photo of Creel, also a dear friend to Bareilles, who teared up.",
      "Both Bareilles and Keenan-Bolger are involved with the Gavin Creel Fellowship, an initiative that plans to provide $25,000 grants to five emerging theater actors each year.",
      "The final award had been announced by presenter Miranda \u2014 best musical to \u201cMaybe Happy Ending\u201d \u2014 and the audience started to disperse. But Erivo had another idea.",
      "Riffing on the concept of leaving, she launched into the famous \u201cDreamgirls\u201d ballad \u201cAnd I Am Telling You I\u2019m Not Going\u201d \u2014 with rewritten lyrics.",
      "It was a yet another powerhouse performance from someone who has one of the best voices on the planet. The audience stopped dispersing \u2014 and started cheering.",

      "Doechii made her presence felt early during the five-hour ceremony, using her acceptance speech for best female hip-hop artist to draw attention to the immigration raids and protest crackdowns taking place just miles from the venue. Her message added urgency and depth to a ceremony meant to honor both Black excellence and social impact.",
      "After being named best female hip-hop artist \u2014 her first-ever BET Award \u2014 Doechii acknowledged her fellow nominees, then shifted the spotlight to the issues unfolding outside the venue.",
      "\u201cThere are ruthless attacks that are creating fear and chaos in our communities in the name of law and order,\u201d said Doechii, who won a Grammy for best rap album, only the third woman to win in that category.",
      "\u201cTrump is using military forces to stop a protest,\u201d she said. \u201cI want you all to consider what kind of government it appears to be when every time we exercise our democratic right to protest, the military is deployed against us. What type of government is that?\u201d",

      "Foxx, Mariah Carey, Snoop Dogg and Kirk Franklin received the Ultimate Icon Award. They were selected due to their impact on entertainment as well as their community impact and advocacy.",
      "Foxx was the first to receive his award. He was visibly moved during a heartfelt moment at the awards, being brought to tears while accepting his trophy after surviving a life-threatening health scare in recent years.",

But I know my second chance \u2014 I won\u2019t turn it down,\u201d Foxx said, as his two daughters and sister wiped away tears from the audience. \u201cI have so much love to give. Just give me one more crack at this. Whatever reason you put this on me, I promise I\u2019ll do right. \u2026 You can\u2019t go through something like that and not testify.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt took me a while, but I finally realized that life is far too short to live for anyone else's approval, which is something I always did,\u201d said Carey, a five-time Grammy winner. \u201cI decided to own who I am.\u201d",

Being an icon isn't about fame. It's about legacy. It's about what you build, what you leave behind and who you lift up along the way.\u201d",
      "Franklin expressed gratitude for the honor, admitting he\u2019s far from the perfect Christian, husband, father or artist. He joked, \u201cI can\u2019t even sing.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhich makes this award so amazing, because what I do really don\u2019t make sense,\" he said. \"If you\u2019re listening to this, that\u2019s when you know it\u2019s God.\u201d",

      "Hart set the tone for a night full of humor and on a night honoring the awards show's 25th anniversary.",
      "The comedian also joked about the pronunciation of GloRilla and Snoop\u2019s real names, drawing laughs from the crowd before turning sincere.",
      "Hart paid tribute to Foxx and teased gospel star Franklin.",
      "\u201cWhen you get your award tonight, don\u2019t come up here front twerking,\u201d Hart said, as the crowd erupted in laughter.",
      "The jab was a nod to Franklin\u2019s viral moment when he playfully twerked on gospel legend Jacky Clark Chisholm during a live performance.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t come up here poppin\u2019,\u201d Hart added, as cameras caught Franklin bowing his head and chuckling. \u201cDon\u2019t try to blame it on the Lord. The Lord didn\u2019t ask for that. Put it away, Kirk.\u201d",

      "Most big collections have only a fraction of their items on display, with the rest locked away in storage",
      "LONDON -- A museum is like an iceberg. Most of it is out of sight.",
      "Most big collections have only a fraction of their items on display, with the rest locked away in storage. But not at the new V&A East Storehouse, where London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum has opened up its storerooms for visitors to view \u2014 and in many cases touch \u2014 the items within.",
      "The 16,000-square-meter (170,000-square-foot) building, bigger than 30 basketball courts, holds more than 250,000 objects, 350,000 books and 1,000 archives. Wandering its huge, three-story collections hall feels like a trip to IKEA, but with treasures at every turn.",
      "The V&A is Britain\u2019s national museum of design, performance and applied arts, and the storehouse holds aisle after aisle of open shelves lined with everything from ancient Egyptian shoes to Roman pottery, ancient Indian sculptures, Japanese armor, Modernist furniture, a Piaggio scooter and a brightly painted garbage can from the Glastonbury Festival.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s 5,000 years of creativity,\u201d said Kate Parsons, the museum\u2019s director of collection care and access. It took more than a year, and 379 truckloads, to move the objects from the museum\u2019s former storage facility in west London to the new site.",
      "In the museum\u2019s biggest innovation, anyone can book a one-on-one appointment with any object, from a Vivienne Westwood mohair sweater to a tiny Japanese netsuke figurine. Most of the items can even be handled, with exceptions for hazardous materials, such as Victorian wallpaper that contains arsenic.",
      "The Order an Object service offers \u201ca behind-the-scenes, very personal, close interaction\u201d with the collection, Parsons said as she showed off one of the most requested items so far: a 1954 pink silk taffeta Balenciaga evening gown. Nearby in one of the study rooms were a Bob Mackie-designed military tunic worn by Elton John on his 1981 world tour and two silk kimonos laid out ready for a visit.",
      "Parsons said there has been \u201ca phenomenal response\u201d from the public since the building opened at the end of May. Visitors have ranged from people seeking inspiration for their weddings to art students and \u201csomeone last week who was using equipment to measure the thread count of an 1850 dress.\u201d She says strangers who have come to view different objects often strike up conversations.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just wonderful,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cYou never quite know. \u2026 We have this entirely new concept and of course we hope and we believe and we do audience research and we think that people are going to come. But until they actually did, and came through the doors, we didn\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "The V&A\u2019s flagship museum in London\u2019s affluent South Kensington district, founded in the 1850s, is one of Britain\u2019s biggest tourist attractions. The Storehouse is across town in the Olympic Park, a post-industrial swath of east London that hosted the 2012 summer games.",
      "As part of post-Olympic regeneration, the area is now home to a new cultural quarter that includes arts and fashion colleges, a dance theater and another V&A branch, due to open next year. The Storehouse has hired dozens of young people recruited from the surrounding area, which includes some of London\u2019s most deprived districts.",
      "Designed by Diller, Scofidio and Renfro, the firm behind New York\u2019s High Line park, the building has space to show off objects too big to have been displayed very often before, including a 17th-century Mughal colonnade from India, a 1930s modernist office designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and a Pablo Picasso-designed stage curtain for a 1924 ballet, some 10 meters (more than 30 feet) high.",
      "Also on a monumental scale are large chunks of vanished buildings, including a gilded 15th-century ceiling from the Torrijos Palace in Spain and a slab of the concrete fa\u00e7ade of Robin Hood Gardens, a demolished London housing estate.",
      "Not a hushed temple of art, this is a working facility. Conversation is encouraged and forklifts beep in the background. Workers are finishing the David Bowie Center, a home for the late London-born musician\u2019s archive of costumes, musical instruments, letters, lyrics and photos that is due to open at the Storehouse in September.",
      "One aim of the Storehouse is to expose the museum\u2019s inner workings, through displays delving into all aspects of the conservators\u2019 job \u2013 from the eternal battle against insects to the numbering system for museum contents \u2014 and a viewing gallery to watch staff at work.",
      "The increased openness comes as museums in the U.K. are under increasing scrutiny over the origins of their collections. They face pressure to return objects acquired in sometimes contested circumstances during the days of the British Empire",
      "Senior curator Georgia Haseldine said the V&A is adopting a policy of transparency, \u201cso that we can talk very openly about where things have come from, how they ended up in the V&A\u2019s collection, and also make sure that researchers, as well as local people and people visiting from all around the world, have free and equitable access to these objects.",
      "\u201cOn average, museums have one to five percent of their collections on show,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here is saying, \u2018No, this whole collection belongs to all of us. This is a national collection and you should have access to it.\u2019 That is our fundamental principle.\u201d",

      "The panel of seven women and five men on Thursday began weighing two counts of criminal sex act and one count of rape against the former movie mogul. Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty.",
      "On Friday, one juror asked to be removed from the case, saying he felt other jurors were treating one member of the panel in an \u201cunfair and unjust\u201d way. The judge told him he had to keep deliberating and also denied a defense request for a mistrial over the issue.",
      "Weinstein was originally found guilty in New York in 2020 of rape and sexual assault against two women in a verdict considered a landmark in the #MeToo movement.",
      "But the conviction was subsequently overturned, leading to his retrial \u2014 with an additional accuser added last year \u2014 before a new jury and a different judge.",
      "Weinstein was also convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 of another rape.",

      "Filmmaker Dean DeBlois returns to the world of \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d for a new live-action adaptation, in theaters Friday",
      "Ever wanted to soar through the skies on the back of a friendly dragon? The new \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d may be the ticket, from a decidedly safer, though possibly still vertigo-inducing, distance.",
      "This live-action adaption of the underdog adventure story sends the audience cascading through the clouds with the teenage Viking boy Hiccup and his dragon friend Toothless. It\u2019s the kind of immersive sensation and giddy wish fulfillment that might just have you forgetting momentarily to breathe and, maybe more importantly, that you\u2019re still in a movie theater. Credit to veteran cinematographer Bill Pope, no stranger to fantasy worlds, whether it\u2019s \u201cThe Matrix\u201d or \u201cScott Pilgrim vs. The World.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d doesn\u2019t stray far from the original, from shots to story beats. Gerard Butler once again plays Berk\u2019s Chief Stoick the Vast. The new Hiccup, actor Mason Thames, even sounds a bit like Jay Baruchel. But unlike so many live-action remakes of animated films, it also doesn\u2019t feel superfluous, or, worse, like a poor imitation of its predecessor that trades the magic of animation for photorealism.",
      "Perhaps that\u2019s because filmmaker Dean DeBlois, who made the three animated films, stayed in the director\u2019s chair. Who better to kill their darlings than the one who brought them to the screen in the first place? And, crucially, to know where live-action might actually enhance the fabric of the world created by author Cressida Cowell.",
      "It helps that dragon technology has come a long way since, say, \u201cDragonHeart.\u201d These fire-breathing CG creatures feel disarmingly real. And though it might look like \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d or \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d the tone stays light enough for younger filmgoers. There are a few intense sequences, but none that takes it any further than the animated film did 15 years ago.",
      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d does start a little slow, however, which is odd because it also begins with a fiery battle between the Vikings and the dragons on the Isle of Berk. There\u2019s a lot of exposition and introduction that needs to happen before you can just give yourself over to the story. In this more multicultural version, the warriors on Berk have been recruited from tribes around the globe to try to defeat the dragons.",
      "Hiccup is a Viking nepo baby. As the chief's son, he sits in a place of privilege, but he\u2019s also a general outcast in this world of ruthless warriors \u2014 skinny and weak, he just longs to be part of the action, not sharpening the weapons. Killing dragons is currency in this society, and his crush Astrid (Nico Parker) happens to be one of the most promising up-and-comers. His sole champion is Gobber (a delightful Nick Frost), the blacksmith and dragon slayer teacher, who convinces the chief to give the clever Hiccup a shot.",
      "The film finds its internal engine when Hiccup finds Toothless, the wide-eyed \u201cNight Fury\u201d dragon whom he can\u2019t bring himself to kill. Instead, he decides to study this discovery, who he finds is not as nearly fearsome as everyone assumes. \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d teaches empathy and ingenuity without a sermon.",
      "Thames, a teenager himself, is the perfect embodiment of adolescent awkwardness and boldness. You can have all the cute dragons you want, but the audience would be lost if the human conduit to the relationship isn\u2019t up to the task. Butler seems to be having a good time, resplendent in fur and chest-thumping ideas about ancient duties. And Parker gives Astrid a relatable depth \u2014 the best in the bunch who is outshone in an unequal fight.",
      "Kids deserve movies that are made on the biggest possible canvas. \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d is one that's worth the trip to the theater. It might just spark some young imaginations, whether it\u2019s to go back and read the books or dream up their own worlds. And, chances are, no one is going to be yelling \u201cchicken jockey.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon,\u201d a Universal Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csequences of intense action and peril.\u201d Running time: 125 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.",

      "\u201cLilo & Stich\u201d has topped the domestic box office charts for a third weekend",
      "In the box office showdown between a deadly assassin and a chaotic CG alien, \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d still had the edge. The Disney juggernaut celebrated a third weekend at the top of the charts, while the John Wick spinoff \u201cBallerina\u201d did not jet\u00e9 as high as expected.",
      "According to studio estimates Sunday, \u201cFrom the World of John Wick: Ballerina\u201d earned $25 million from 3,409 theaters in the U.S. and Canada. Several weeks ago it was tracking to open in the $35 to $40 million range, but that was adjusted down several times. Ultimately, it still came in lower than forecasts. The movie, directed by Len Wiseman, makes a sideline character out of Keanu Reeves\u2019 John Wick and focuses on Ana de Armas. It takes place during the events of \u201cJohn Wick 3.\u201d",
      "The box office performance is a bit perplexing result considering that \u201cBallerina\u201d got good critic reviews and audience exit polls. Conventional wisdom would say that word of mouth might have given it a boost over the weekend. But, recently, opening weekend isn\u2019t the end all that it used to be. \u201cBallerina\u201d could be in the game for the long haul.",
      "The Lionsgate release, a Thunder Road Films and 87Eleven Entertainment production, had a hefty production price tag reported to be in the $90 million range. But much of that cost has already been offset by foreign pre-sales. Internationally, it earned $26 million from 82 countries, bringing its global opening to $51 million.",
      "As the first spinoff, it\u2019s the second lowest opening of the five-film franchise \u2013 above only the first film which opened just over $14 million in 2014, which does not account for inflation. The franchise overall has grossed more than $1 billion worldwide.",
      "First place once again went to \u201cLilo & Stitch,\u201d which added another $32.5 million in North America, bringing its domestic total to $335.8 and global tally to $772.6 million. In just 17 days, it's already made more domestically than the live-action \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d did in its entire run ($298 million).",
      "\u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 The Final Reckoning\u201d slid to third place with $15 million, bringing its worldwide total to $450.4 million. \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d earned $8.7 million to take fourth place. And \u201cFinal Destination: Bloodlines\" rounded out the top five with $6.5 million.",
      "The new Wes Anderson movie \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d expanded beyond New York and Los Angeles to 1,678 theaters nationwide. The Focus Features release starring Benicio del Toro made an estimated $6.3 million and landed in sixth place.",

      "Broadway has had a stuffed season with seemingly something for everyone and now it's time to recognize the best with the Tony Awards, hosted by Cynthia Erivo, set for Sunday night on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Broadway buzz is usually reserved for musicals but this year the plays \u2014 powered by A-list talent \u2014 have driven the conversation. There's Clooney in \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck,\u201d Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal in \u201cOthello,\u201d Sarah Snook in a one-woman version of \u201cThe Picture of Dorian Gray\u201d and her \u201cSuccession\u201d co-star Kieran Culkin and Bob Odenkirk in \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross.\u201d (Clooney, Snook and Odenkirk are nominated for Tonys.)",

All three are nominated for best play, along with \u201cJohn Proctor is the Villain\u201d and \u201cThe Hills of California.\u201d",
      "On the musical side, three options seem to be in the mix for the top prize: \u201cMaybe Happy Ending,\u201d a rom-com about a pair of androids; \u201cDead Outlaw,\u201d about an alcoholic drifter whose embalmed body becomes a prized possession for half a century; and \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d the musical satire about longtime frenemies who drink a magic potion for eternal youth and beauty. \u201cMaybe Happy Ending,\u201d \u201cDeath Becomes Her\u201d and another musical nominee, \u201cBuena Vista Social Club,\u201d lead nominations with 10 apiece.",
      "The 2024-2025 season took in $1.9 billion, making it the highest-grossing season ever and signaling that Broadway has finally emerged from the COVID-19 blues, having overtaken the previous high of $1.8 billion during the 2018-2019 season.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going through this strange period, which I would think someday we can draw the line from COVID to this, as you can draw the line from the early 1980s with AIDS to the explosion of big musicals again,\u201d says Harvey Fierstein, who will get a special Tony for lifetime achievement.",
      "Audra McDonald, the most recognized performer in the theater awards\u2019 history, could possibly extend her Tony lead. Already the record holder for most acting wins with six Tonys, McDonald could add to that thanks to her leading turn in an acclaimed revival of \u201cGypsy.\u201d She has to get past Nicole Scherzinger, who has been wowing audiences in \u201cSunset Blvd.\u201d",
      "And Kara Young \u2014 the first Black female actor to be nominated for a Tony Award in four consecutive years \u2014 could become the first Black person to win two Tonys consecutively, should she win for her role in the play \u201cPurpose.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Edmund White, a pioneer of contemporary gay literature, died this week at age 85",
      "NEW YORK -- Andrew Sean Greer, a Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist, remembers the first time he read Edmund White. It was the summer of 1989, he was beginning his second year at Brown University and he had just come out.",
      "Having learned that White would be teaching at Brown, he found a copy of White's celebrated coming-of-age novel, \u201cA Boy's Own Story.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019d never read anything like it \u2014 nobody had \u2014 and what strikes me looking back is the lack of shame or self-hatred or misery that imbued so many other gay male works of fiction of that time,\u201d says Greer, whose \u201cLess\u201d won the Pulitzer for fiction in 2018. \"I, of course, did not know then I was reading a truly important literary work. All I knew is I wanted to read more.",
      "\u201cReading was all we had in those days \u2014 the private, unshared experience that could help you explore your private life,\" he said. \"Ed invented so many of us.\"",
      "White, a pioneer of contemporary gay literature, died this week at age 85. He left behind such widely read works as \u201cA Boy\u2019s Own Story\u201d and \u201cThe Beautiful Room Is Empty\u201d and a gift to countless younger writers: Validation of their lives, the discovery of themselves through the stories of others.",
      "Greer and other authors speak of White's work as more than just an influence, but as a rite of passage: \"How a queer man might begin to question all of the deeply held, deeply religious, deeply American assumptions about desire, love, and sex \u2014 who is entitled to have it, how it must be had, what it looks like,\u201d says Robert Jones Jr., whose novel above love between two enslaved men, \u201c The Prophets,\u201d was a National Book Award finalist in 2021.",
      "Jones remembers being a teenager in the 1980s when he read \u201dA Boy's Own Story.\" He found the book at a store in a gay neighborhood in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, \u201cthe safest place for a person to be openly queer in New York City,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt was a scary time for me because all the news stories about queer men revolved around AIDS and dying, and how the disease was the Christian god\u2019s vengeance against the 'sin of homosexuality,'\u201d Jones added.",
      "\u201cIt was the first time that I had come across any literature that confirmed that queer men have a childhood; that my own desires were not, in fact, some aberration, but were natural; and that any suffering and loneliness I was experiencing wasn\u2019t divine retribution, but was the intention of a human-made bigotry that could be, if I had the courage and the community, confronted and perhaps defeated,\" he said.",
      "Starting in the 1970s, White published more than 25 books, including novels, memoirs, plays, biographies and \u201cThe Joy of Gay Sex,\u201d a response to the 1970s bestseller \u201cThe Joy of Sex.\" He held the rare stature for a living author of having a prize named for him, the Edmund White Award for Debut Fiction, as presented by the Publishing Triangle.",
      "\u201cWhite was very supportive of young writers, encouraging them to explore and expand new and individual visions,\u201d said Carol Rosenfeld, chair of the Triangle. The award was \u201cone way of honoring that support.\u201d",
      "Winners such the prize was founded, in 2006, have included \u201cThe Prophets,\u201d Myriam Gurba 's \u201cDahlia Season\u201d and Joe Okonkwo's \u201cJazz Moon.\u201d Earlier this year, the award was given to Jiaming Tang's \u201c Cinema Love,\u201d a story of gay men in rural China.",
      "Tang remembered reading \u201cA Boy's Own Story\u201d in his early 20s, and said that both the book and White were \u201cessential touchpoints in my gay coming-of-age.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe writes with intimate specificity and humor, and no other writer has captured the electric excitement and crushing loneliness that gay men experience as they come of age,\u201d Tang said. \"He\u2019s a towering figure. There\u2019d be no gay literature in America without Edmund White.\u201d",

      "HBO\u2019s new bio series \u201cChespirito: Not Really on Purpose\u201d or \u201cSin Querer Queriendo\u201d has been received with delight by many fans in the U.S. and Latin America who grew up watching Roberto G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os",
      "HBO\u2019s new biographical series \u201cChespirito: Not Really on Purpose\u201d (\u201cSin Querer Queriendo\u201d) has been received with delight by the many fans in the U.S. and Latin America who grew up watching the late Mexican comedian Roberto G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os.",
      "The eight-episode miniseries, which debuted Thursday, dramatizes the professional and personal journey of G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os, who transformed comedy in Latin America and whose characters defined a generation for millions of children. Known as \u201cChespirito,\" he took his inspiration from Laurel and Hardy as well as another transcendent Mexican comedian who eventually made it to Hollywood, Cantinflas. Chespirito died in 2014 at age 85.",
      "Pablo Cruz, who plays Chespirito in the series, told The Associated Press in an interview translated from Spanish that the show is a tribute that tells \u201ca story that we know will connect with a very broad audience and give them an opportunity to further appreciate what they already admire and love.\u201d",
      "Chespirito's two most famous characters were \u201cEl Chavo del Ocho\u201d (\"The Boy from Number Eight\u201d) and \u201cEl Chapulin Colorado\u201d (\u201cThe Crimson Grasshopper\u201d). \u201cEl Chavo del Ocho\" was an 8-year-old boy orphan living alone in a Mexican neighborhood with his barrel, freckles, striped shirt and grayed cap. \u201cEl Chapulin Colorado\u201d was a naive superhero dressed in a red bodysuit and hood with antennae that helped him detect danger miles away (despite the name, his yellow shorts and boots gave him more the look of a red bumblebee).",
      "Through his characters, Chespirito favored a clean comedy style far removed from the sexual innuendo and obscenity-laced jokes popular today. His morning shows were a staple for preschoolers, much like \u201cCaptain Kangaroo\u201d was in the United States.",
      "The HBO series \u201cis a tribute to Chespirito\u2019s importance as one of the key figures in Mexican television and highlights the enormous impact his television programs had throughout Latin America,\u201d Fernando C\u00e1rdenas, digital manager for the Hispanic Organization of Latin Actors, said in a statement to the AP.",
      "The miniseries is a powerful act of cultural preservation, one that documents the impact Latinos have had on the global entertainment industry, said Sehila Mota Casper, director of Latinos in Heritage Conservation.",
      "\u201cFor so many of us, his characters weren\u2019t just entertainment,\u201d Mota Casper said. \u201cThey shaped how we understand humor, how we face challenges and how we see ourselves as Latinxs. This series honors that impact. By telling his story in this way, we help make sure the cultural histories that shaped us are seen, respected and carried forwards to future generations.\u201d",
      "\u201cEl Chavo\u201d proved so popular that reruns are still shown in multiple countries in Latin America and on Spanish-language television in the United States. Many Latin Americans, living under dictatorships during the height of the show, found his underdog triumphs heroic in the face of authority. In a 2005 interview with the Mexican newspaper La Jornada, G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os said he always wrote with working-class people in mind.",
      "\u201cDuring the 1970s, the program was produced to reflect the reality of working-class families in Mexico and enjoyed enormous impact in other Spanish-speaking countries because the situations portrayed in the stories were similar to those of all audiences, regardless of geographical boundaries,\u201d C\u00e1rdenas said.",
      "Alberto Lammers, who grew up watching \u201cEl Chavo\u201d in Peru during the 1970s and \u201880s, was excited for the series and the childhood nostalgia it evokes. He was also excited to learn more about what was happening behind the scenes in G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os\u2019 life.",
      "\u201cIt really struck a chord with my childhood,\u201d Lammers, who now lives in California, said after finishing the first episode. \u201cIt gives heart and context to his complexity and the characters he built. It\u2019s also a very interesting look at how he became a TV personality. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing where it goes! It\u2019s a real-life telenovela!\u201d",
      "Fans also took to social media to praise the episode and their awe at the uncanny similarities between the actors and the people they are playing.",
      "For Lammers, after migrating to the U.S., \u201cEl Chavo del Ocho\u201d served as a connection to his roots even if the show wasn't based in Peru.",
      "\u201cGoing to that show to me was actually very comforting,\u201d Lammers said. \u201cIt built a sense of community across most of Latin America.\u201d",

      "The juror insisted, calling the treatment \u201cunfair and unjust\u201d even as he described the tension as \u201cplayground stuff\u201d with jurors shunning another juror and talking behind their back.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyer Arthur Aidala argued that the jury should be told to stop deliberating while the court found out more about the concerns.",

      "The blockbuster horror film \u201cSinners\u201d features the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians in a short, but impactful scene",
      "CHOCTAW, Miss. -- It\u2019s a small part in a big movie, but for the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, their scene in \"Sinners\" is a huge deal.",
      "The horror movie blockbuster, starring Michael B. Jordan as a gangster turned vampire slayer, paints a brief but impactful portrait of the tribe using Choctaw actors and cultural experts. For some, it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve seen the Choctaw way of life accurately portrayed on the big screen.",
      "In the scene, a posse of Choctaw, riding on horseback and in an old truck, arrives at a small farmhouse to warn the couple that lives there of coming danger. When the couple refuses their help, a Choctaw man wishes them luck in his native language before riding off.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve not seen another movie that has our language, like, spoken correctly,\u201d said Cynthia Massey, a cultural consultant for \u201cSinners.\u201d",
      "Massey runs the tribe\u2019s Chahta Immi Cultural Center alongside Sherrill Nickey and department director Jay Wesley. All three were hired as cultural consultants to ensure a genuine depiction of the tribe in the film. Together, they sifted through archives, researching how their ancestors would have dressed, spoken and acted in the 1930s, when \u201cSinners\u201d takes place.",
      "\u201cI was honored and humbled by the fact that they wanted a true representation,\u201d said Wesley, who also acted in the movie.",
      "Wesley connected the filmmakers to Choctaw actors and artifacts like the beaded sashes the Choctaw characters wear in the movie. Those sashes are now part of a \u201cSinners\u201d display at the cultural center.",
      "The movie's introduction also features a short snippet of a Choctaw war chant, performed by Wesley\u2019s daughter, Jaeden Wesley, who is a student at the University of California, Los Angeles. While recording, Jaeden Wesley said the filmmakers told her they wanted the Choctaw people to hear their music in the movie.",
      "\u201cWe were catering to our own people, even in that short little second,\u201d Jaeden Wesley said.",
      "Shining a spotlight on often overlooked cultures and topics, like the Choctaw people, is part of the mission at Proximity Media, which produced \u201cSinners.\u201d The company was founded by \u201cSinners\u201d director Ryan Coogler, his wife and film producer, Zinzi Coogler, and producer Sev Ohanian.",
      "\u201cIt was never a question for us that if we were going to portray the Mississippi Choctaw, we got to have the right people who can tell us, who can tell Ryan, what we\u2019re not knowing, what we\u2019re not thinking,\u201d Ohanian said. \u201cIt was all because we\u2019re trying to serve Ryan\u2019s story of like putting truth on screen.\"",
      "Ohanian and his co-founders didn\u2019t stop with Choctaw consultants; they enlisted a small army of experts who advised on the confluence of cultures mingling in the Mississippi Delta, where the film is set. The resulting cinematic world was so well received, community organizers penned an open letter, inviting Coogler and his fellow filmmakers to visit the Delta. Last week, the Cooglers, Ohanian and others took up the offer, attending a \u201cSinners\u201d screening in Clarksdale, Mississippi. Clarksdale is where the film's events unfold.",
      "\u201cI hope this encourages other filmmakers to find opportunities to be authentic in their storytelling and to look at this rich tapestry of culture that\u2019s right here in America,\u201d Ohanian said, noting the film industry has historically misrepresented nonwhite groups.",
      "For Wesley and his fellow consultants, the hope is the film will cultivate curiosity in audiences, encourage them to learn more about Choctaw culture and visit the Chahta Immi Cultural Center.",
      "\u201cIt's important to be connected to this culture because this was here before the public was here,\u201d Massey said. \u201cProbably three-quarters of Mississippi was Choctaw land, and now we only have 350,000 acres.\u201d",
      "They say Choctaw participation in the film has cultivated a sense of pride among tribe members. Nickey hopes it will encourage a sort of cultural renaissance at a time when she says fewer and fewer Choctaw speak their native language.",
      "\u201cI know for a fact that there are a lot of kids out there that don't even know how to speak our language. They only speak English,\u201d Nickey said. \u201cI hope they know it's okay to speak our language.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Years before Ana de Armas was using an ice skate to slice a neck in \u201cFrom the World of John Wick: Ballerina,\u201d she co-starred with Keanu Reeves in a much different film.",
      "The erotic thriller \u201cKnock Knock,\u201d released in 2015, was de Armas\u2019 first Hollywood film. De Armas, born and raised in Cuba, had just come to Los Angeles after acting in Spain. English was new to her, so she had to learn her lines phonetically.",
      "\u201cIt was tough and I felt miserable at times and very lonely,\u201d she says in an interview. \u201cBut I wanted to prove myself. I remember being in meetings with producers and they would be like, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll see you in a year when you learn English.\u2019 Before I left the office, I would say, \u2018I\u2019ll see you in two months.\u2019\u201d",
      "Since \u201cKnock Knock,\u201d her rise to stardom has been one of the last decade's most meteoric.

      "And now, 10 years after those scenes with Reeves, de Armas is for the first time headlining a big summer action movie. In \u201cBallerina,\u201d in theaters Friday, de Armas\u2019 progressive development as an unlikely action star reaches a butt-kicking crescendo, inheriting the mantle of one of the most esteemed, high-body-count franchises.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big moment in my career, and I know that. I can see that,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes me look back in many ways, just being with Keanu in another film in such a different place in my career. It definitely gives me perspective of the journey and everything since we met. Things have come far since then.\u201d",
      "While de Armas, 37, isn\u2019t new to movie stardom, or the tabloid coverage that comes with it, many of her career highlights have been streaming releases. \u201cThe Gray Man\u201d and \u201cBlonde\u201d were Netflix. \u201cGhosted\u201d was Apple TV+. But \u201cBallerina\u201d will rely on de Armas (and abiding \u201cJohn Wick\u201d fandom) to put moviegoers in seats.",
      "Heading in, analysts expected an opening weekend of around $35-40 million, which would be a solid result for a spinoff that required extensive reshoots. Reviews, particularly for de Armas playing a ballerina-assassin, have been good.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure,\u201d says director Len Wiseman. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot to carry all on her shoulders. But she\u2019ll be the first person to tell you: \u2018Put it on. Let me carry the weight. I\u2019m totally game.\u2019\u201d",
      "De Armas, whose talents include the ability to be present and personable on even the most frenzied red carpets, has done the globe-trotting work to make \u201cBallerina\u201d a big deal: appearing at CinemaCon, gamely eating hot wings and cheerfully deflecting questions about her next film, \u201cDeeper,\u201d with Tom Cruise.",
      "Yet for someone so comfortable in the spotlight, one of the more interesting facts about de Armas is that she lives part time in that bastion of young A-listers: Vermont.",
      "\u201cYeah, it surprised many people,\u201d she says, chuckling. \u201cAs soon as I went up there, I knew that was going to be a place that would bring me happiness and sanity and peace. But I know for a Cuban who doesn\u2019t like cold very much, it\u2019s very strange.\u201d",
      "Winding up in northern New England is just as unexpected as landing an action movie like \u201cBallerina.\u201d She grew up with the conviction, from age 12, that she would be an actor. But she studied theater.",
      "\u201cI never thought I was going to do action,\u201d de Armas says. \u201cWhat was relatable for me was watching Cuban actors on TV and in movies. That was my reality. That\u2019s all I knew, so the actors I looked up to were those.\u201d",
      "De Armas also had bad asthma, which makes some of the things she does in \u201cBallerina\u201d \u2014 a movie with a flamethrower duel \u2014 all the more remarkable to her.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI couldn\u2019t run. I sometimes couldn\u2019t play with my friends. I had to just be home and be still so I wouldn\u2019t get an asthma attack. So I never thought of myself as someone athletic or able to run just a block. So this has been a surprise.\u201d",
      "At 14, she auditioned and got into Havana\u2019s National Theatre of Cuba. Four years later, with Spanish citizenship through her grandparents, she moved to Madrid to pursue acting. When she arrive in LA in 2014, she had to start all over again.",
      "Now as one of the top Latina stars in Hollywood, she's watched as immigrant paths like hers have grow increasingly arduous if not impossible. The day after she spoke to The Associated Press, the Trump administration announced a travel ban on 12 countries and heavy restrictions on citizens of other countries, including Cuba.",
      "\u201cI got here at a time when things were definitely easier in that sense,\u201d says de Armas, who announced her then-imminent U.S. citizenship while hosting \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in 2023. \u201cSo I just feel very lucky for that. But it\u2019s difficult. Everything that\u2019s going on is very difficult and very sad and really challenging for many people. I definitely wish things were different.\u201d",
      "Chad Stahelski, director of the four \u201cJohn Wick\u201d films and producer of \u201cBallerina,\u201d was about to start production on \u201cJohn Wick: Chapter 4\u201d when producer Basil Iwanyk and Nathan Kahane, president of Lionsgate, called to set up a Zoom about casting de Armas. He quickly watched every scene she had been in.",
      "\u201cHow many people would have played the Bond girl kind of goofy like that?\u201d he says. \u201cI know that I can harden people up. I know I can make them the assassin, but getting the charm and the love and the humor out of someone is trickier. But she had it.\u201d",
      "In \u201cKnives Out,\u201d Stahelski saw someone who could go from scared and uncertain to a look of \u201cI'm going to stab you in the eye.\u201d",
      "\u201cI like that in my action heroes,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see the stoic, superhero vibe where everything\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d",
      "But it wasn\u2019t just her acting or her charisma that convinced Stahelski. It was her life story.",
      "\u201c'John Wick' is all hard work \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean just in the training. You\u2019ve got to love it and put yourself out there,\u201d says Stahelski. \u201cWhen you get her story about how she came from the age of 12, got into acting, what she sacrificed, what she did, that\u2019s what got my attention. \u2018Oh, she\u2019s a perseverer. She doesn\u2019t just enjoy the view, she enjoys the climb.\u2019\u201d",
      "When that quote is read back to her, de Armas laughs, and agrees.",
      "\u201cBeing Cuban, and my upbringing and my family and everything I\u2019ve done, I\u2019ve never had a plan B,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve never had that thing of, \u2018Well, if it doesn\u2019t work, my family can help.\u2019 Or, \u2018I can do this other career.\u2019 This was it. And I also knew, besides being the thing I loved the most, this was my survival. This is how I live. This is how I feed myself and my family. So it\u2019s also a sense of, I don\u2019t know, responsibility.\u201d",
      "That makes her reflect back to when she was just trying to make it in Hollywood, sounding out words, trying not to disappoint directors whose instructions she could barely understand, trying not to be intimidated by the action star across from her who had just finished shooting the first \u201cJohn Wick.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was so committed to do it,\u201d she says. \u201cI was so invested in the trying of it, just giving it a shot. When I give something a shot, I try my best, whatever that is. Then I can actually say: I gave it a shot.\u201d",

      "Atlantic City police say surveillance video initially led them to a 57-year-old Pleasantville man.

      "A top aide to Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Calley Means has built a following within the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement by railing against the failings of the U.S. health system, often pinning the blame on one issue: corruption.",
      "Means, a top aide to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was hired as a White House adviser in March. He has used that perch to attack the nation\u2019s leading physician groups, federal agencies and government scientists, claiming they only protect their own interests in the nation\u2019s $4.9 trillion-a-year industry.",
      "In recent interviews, speeches and podcasts he has called the American Medical Association \u201ca pharma lobbying group,\u201d labeled the Food and Drug Administration \u201ca sock puppet of industry,\" and said federal health scientists have \u201coverseen a record of utter failure.\u201d",
      "Means, however, has his own financial stake in the sprawling health system. He\u2019s the co-founder of an online platform, Truemed, that offers dietary supplements, herbal remedies and other wellness products. Some of the vendors featured on Truemed\u2019s website are supporters of Kennedy\u2019s MAHA movement, which downplays the benefits of prescription drugs, vaccines and other rigorously tested medical products.",
      "Kennedy has pledged to run the Department of Health and Human Services with \u201cradical transparency,\u201d but Means has never had to publicly disclose his own financial details or where exactly they intersect with the policies he's advancing.",
      "\u201cIt reeks of hypocrisy,\u201d said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran, a health researcher at Yale University. \u201cIn effect, he is representing another industry that is touting nonregulated products and using his platform within the government to financially benefit himself.\u201d",
      "In a written statement, Means said his government work has not dealt with matters affecting Truemed and has focused on issues like reforming nutrition programs and pressuring companies to phase out food dyes.",
      "\u201cPursuing these large-scale MAHA goals to make America healthy has been the sole focus in my government work,\u201d Means said.",
      "Truemed helps users take tax-free money out of their health savings accounts, or HSAs, to spend on things that wouldn\u2019t normally qualify as medical expenses, such as exercise equipment, meal delivery services and homeopathic remedies \u2014 mixtures of plants and minerals based on a centuries-old theory of medicine that's not supported by modern science.",
      "The business model caught the attention of the IRS last year, which issued an alert: \u201cBeware of companies misrepresenting nutrition, wellness and general health expenses as medical care.\u201d",
      "Truemed co-founder and CEO, Justin Mares, said in a statement the company is \u201cin full alignment\u201d with IRS guidelines.",
      "\u201cTruemed enables patients to work with providers to use medical funds for root cause interventions like exercise and vitamin D to reverse disease under current law,\u201d Mares said.",
      "The full extent of Means\u2019 potential conflicts \u2014 including his personal investments\u2014 are unclear because of his status as a special government employee.",
      "Unlike presidential appointees and other senior officials, special government employees are temporary staffers who do not have to leave companies or sell investments that could be impacted by their work. Also, their financial disclosure forms are shielded from public release.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big problem,\u201d says Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush now at the University of Minnesota. Painter and other experts have raised alarms over a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails.",
      "Still, part-time government employees are subject to the same law that bars all federal staffers from working on issues that could directly benefit their finances. When such cases arise, they must recuse themselves or risk criminal penalties.",
      "Means regularly opines on matters before HHS, including rethinking the use of drugs for depression, weight loss, diabetes and other conditions. Recently he's been promoting a new government report that calls for scaling back prescription medications in favor of exercise, dietary changes and other alternatives.",
      "\u201cIf we rely less on our medical system, less on drugs, it necessitates the spiritual, cultural conversation about what we\u2019re doing to our children\u2019s bodies,\u201d Means said in a recent podcast appearance.",
      "Experts note that government ethics rules are intended to both prevent financial conflict violations, but also the appearance of such conflicts that might undermine public trust in government.",
      "\u201cIf I were running the ethics office over at HHS, I sure as heck wouldn\u2019t want anybody going around giving interviews and speeches about government matters that could have an effect on their own financial interests,\u201d Painter said.",
      "Means\u2019 rapid rise reflects the seeming contradictions within the MAHA movement itself, which urges followers to distrust both big corporations and the government agencies which regulate them.",
      "Means rails against big pharma and food conglomerates, two industries that he says he spent years working for as a consultant in Washington.",
      "Means has no medical training. A graduate of Harvard Business School, he previously ran a bridal gown startup with his wife. On Wednesday, he's scheduled to be the keynote speaker at FDA's annual science forum, according to a copy of the program shared with The Associated Press.",
      "He traces his passion for health care reform to the death of his mother from pancreatic cancer in 2021. Shortly thereafter, Means and his sister, Dr. Casey Means, took psychedelics together and had \u201ca mind-blowing, life-changing experience,\u201d which led them to co-author a wellness book, launch separate health startups and begin appearing on podcasts.",
      "Casey Means was recently nominated to be surgeon general and has faced scrutiny over her qualifications, including an unfinished medical residency.",
      "Asked about her nomination, President Donald Trump said: \u201cBobby thought she was fantastic,\u201d adding that he did not know her.",
      "Meanwhile, her brother has stepped up his rhetoric for the MAHA agenda, recently declaring that Kennedy has \u201ca spiritual mandate to reform our broken system.\"",
      "While promoting the administration\u2019s accomplishments, Means does not shy away from plugging his own brand or those of his business partners.",
      "When asked to offer health advice to listeners of a sports podcast, Outkick The Show, in April, Means said: \u201cRead our book, \u2018Good Energy.\u2019\u201d",
      "He also recommended blood tests sold by Function Health, which provides subscription-based testing for $500 annually. The company was cofounded by Dr. Mark Hyman, a friend of Kennedy and an investor in Truemed, which also offers Hyman's supplements through its platform. Casey Means is also an investor in Hyman's company.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re sick, most likely you have some kind of nutrient deficiency, some kind of biomarker that you can actually then target with your diet and your supplements,\u201d Calley Means said.",
      "Like dietary supplements, the marketing claims on laboratory tests sold by Hyman are not approved by the FDA. The agency has warned for years about the accuracy of such tests and tried to start regulating them under President Joe Biden.",
      "Experts say MAHA entrepreneurs like Hyman are following a playbook common to the wellness industry: Identify a health concern, market a test to diagnose it and then sell supplements or other remedies to treat it.",
      "\u201cIt ends up favoring these products and services that rest on flimsy grounds, at the expense of products that have actually survived a rigorous FDA approval process,\u201d said Dr. Peter Lurie, a former FDA official who is now president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "Many of the items sold via Truemed, including sweat tents, cold plunge tanks and light therapy lamps, wouldn\u2019t typically qualify as medical expenses under rules for HSAs, tax-free accounts created by Congress to manage medical costs.",
      "The IRS generally states that HSA purchases must help diagnose, cure, treat, mitigate or prevent disease.",
      "Truemed allows users to request a \u201cletter of medical necessity\u201d from a doctor, stating that the product in question could have medical value for them. Like other telehealth services, there\u2019s usually no real-time communication with the patient. The physician reviews a \u201csimple survey solution,\u201d filled out by the Truemed user, according to the company\u2019s website.",
      "Industry representatives say customers should be careful.",
      "\u201cYou need to be prepared to defend your spending habits under audit,\u201d said Kevin McKechnie, head of the American Bankers Association\u2019s HSA council. \u201cCompanies are popping up suggesting they can help you manage that process and maybe they can \u2014 so the debate continues.\u201d",
      "Americans have an estimated $147 billion in HSA accounts, a potential windfall for companies like Truemed that collects fees for transactions made using their platforms.",
      "Means sees an even bigger opportunity \u2014 routing federal funds out of government programs and into more HSAs.",
      "\u201cThe point of our company is to steer medical dollars into flexible spending,\u201d Means told fitness celebrity Jillian Michaels, on her podcast last year. \u201cI want to get that $4.5 trillion of Medicare, Medicaid, everything into a flexible account.\u201d",
      "Means\u2019 pitch for expanding HSAs echoes two decades of Republican talking points on the accounts, which were created in 2003 to encourage Americans in high-deductible plans to be judicious with their health dollars.",
      "But HSAs have not brought down spending, economists say. They are disproportionately used by the wealthiest Americans, who have more income to fund them and a bigger incentive to lower their tax rate.",
      "Americans who earn more than $1 million annually are the group most likely to make regular HSA contributions, according to an analysis by the nonprofit Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. More than half Americans with HSAs have balances less than $500.",
      "Trump\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d would further expand HSA purchases, making gym memberships and other fitness expenses eligible for tax-free spending. That provision alone is expected to cost the government $10 billion in revenue.",
      "\u201cThese are really just tax breaks in the guise of health policy that overwhelmingly benefit people with high incomes,\u201d said Gideon Lukens, a former White House budget official during the Obama and Trump administrations, now with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "Expanding HSA eligibility was listed as a goal for a coalition of MAHA entrepreneurs and Truemed partners, founded by Means, which lobbied Congress last year, according to the group's website.",
      "Means said in a statement that the group focused only on broad topics like \u201chealth care incentives and patient choice \u2014 but did not lobby for specific bills.\u201d",
      "In total, the HSA expansions in Trump's bill are projected to cost the federal government $180 billion over the next 10 years. As HSAs expand to include more disparate products and services, Lukens says the U.S. government will have fewer dollars to expand medical coverage through programs like Medicaid.",
      "\u201cWe have a limited amount of federal resources and the question is whether we want to spend that on health and wellness products that may or may not be helpful for wealthy people,\u201d Lukens said.",

A spokesperson for New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said she would review the legislation.",

      "In a capital where insiders often insist on anonymity to say such things publicly, 92 NIH researchers, program directors, branch chiefs and scientific review officers put their signatures on the letter \u2014 and their careers on the line. An additional 250 of their colleagues across the agency endorsed the declaration without using their names.",
      "The four-page letter, addressed to Bhattacharya, also was sent to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and members of Congress who oversee the NIH. White House spokesman Kush Desai defended the administration's approach to federal research and said President Donald Trump is focused on restoring a \u201cGold Standard\u201d of science, not \u201cideological activism.\u201d",
      "The signers went public in the face of a \u201cculture of fear and suppression\u201d they say Trump's administration has spread through the federal civil service. \u201cWe are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes political momentum over human safety and faithful stewardship of public resources,\u201d the declaration says.",
      "Bhattacharya responded to the declaration by saying it \u201chas some fundamental misconceptions about the policy directions the NIH has taken in recent months.\"",
      "\u201cNevertheless, respectful dissent in science is productive,\u201d he said in a statement. \"We all want the NIH to succeed.\u201d",
      "Named for the agency's headquarters location in Maryland, the Bethesda Declaration details upheaval in the world\u2019s premier public health research institution over the course of mere months.",
      "It addresses the termination of 2,100 research grants valued at more than $12 billion and some of the human costs that have resulted, such as cutting off medication regimens to participants in clinical trials or leaving them with unmonitored device implants.",
      "In one case, an NIH-supported study of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis in Haiti had to be stopped, ceasing antibiotic treatment mid-course for patients.",
      "In a number of cases, trials that were mostly completed were rendered useless without the money to finish and analyze the work, the letter says. \u201cEnding a $5 million research study when it is 80% complete does not save $1 million,\u201d it says, \u201cit wastes $4 million.\u201d",
      "Jenna Norton, who oversees health disparity research at the agency's National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, recently appeared at a forum by Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., to talk about what's happening at the NIH.",
      "At the event, she masked to conceal her identity. Now the mask is off. She was a lead organizer of the declaration.",
      "\u201cI want people to know how bad things are at NIH,\" Norton told The Associated Press.",
      "The signers said they modeled their indictment after Bhattacharya\u2019s Great Barrington Declaration in 2020, when he was a professor at Stanford University Medical School.",
      "His declaration drew together likeminded infectious disease epidemiologists and public health scientists who dissented from what they saw as excessive COVID-19 lockdown policies and felt ostracized by the larger public health community that pushed those policies, including the NIH.",
      "\u201cHe is proud of his statement, and we are proud of ours,\" said Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the NIH's National Cancer Institute who signed the Bethesda Declaration.",
      "As chief of the Health Systems and Interventions Research Branch, Kobrin provides scientific oversight of researchers across the country who've been funded by the cancer institute or want to be. Cuts in personnel and money have shifted her work from improving cancer care research to what she sees as minimizing its destruction. \"So much of it is gone \u2014 my work,\u201d she said.",
      "The 21-year NIH veteran said she signed because she didn't want to be \"a collaborator\u201d in the political manipulation of biomedical science.",
      "Ian Morgan, a postdoctoral fellow with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, also signed the declaration. \u201cWe have a saying in basic science,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go and become a physician if you want to treat thousands of patients. You go and become a researcher if you want to save billions of patients.",
      "\u201cWe are doing the research that is going to go and create the cures of the future,\u201d he added. But that won\u2019t happen, he said, if Trump's Republican administration prevails with its searing grant cuts.",
      "The NIH employees interviewed by the AP emphasized they were speaking for themselves and not for their institutes nor the NIH.",
      "Employees from all 27 NIH institutes and centers gave their support to the declaration. Most who signed are intimately involved with evaluating and overseeing extramural research grants.",
      "The letter asserts \u201cNIH trials are being halted without regard to participant safety\u201d and the agency is shirking commitments to trial participants who \u201cbraved personal risk to give the incredible gift of biological samples, understanding that their generosity would fuel scientific discovery and improve health.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has gone at public health research on several fronts, both directly, as part of its broad effort to root out diversity, equity and inclusion values throughout the bureaucracy, and as part of its drive to starve some universities of federal money.",
      "At the White House, Desai said Americans \u201chave lost confidence in our increasingly politicized healthcare and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago.\u201d",
      "This has forced \u201cindiscriminate grant terminations, payment freezes for ongoing research, and blanket holds on awards regardless of the quality, progress, or impact of the science,\u201d the declaration says.",
      "Some NIH employees have previously come forward in televised protests to air grievances, and many walked out of Bhattacharya's town hall with staff. The declaration is the first cohesive effort to register agency-wide dismay with the NIH's direction.",
      "The dissenters remind Bhattacharya in their letter of his oft-stated ethic that academic freedom must be a lynchpin in science.",
      "With that in place, he said in a statement in April, \u201cNIH scientists can be certain they are afforded the ability to engage in open, academic discourse as part of their official duties and in their personal capacities without risk of official interference, professional disadvantage or workplace retaliation.\"",
      "Now it will be seen whether that's enough to protect those NIH employees challenging the Trump administration and him.",
      "\u201cThere's a book I read to my kids, and it talks about how you can't be brave if you're not scared,\u201d said Norton, who has three young children. \"I am so scared about doing this, but I am trying to be brave for my kids because it's only going to get harder to speak up.",
      "\u201cMaybe I'm putting my kids at risk by doing this,\" she added. \"And I'm doing it anyway because I couldn't live with myself otherwise.\u201d",
      "e and noy on",
      "\u201cIn recent years, Americans have lost confidence in our increasingly politicized healthcare and research apparatus that has been obsessed with DEI and COVID, which the majority of Americans moved on from years ago,\u201d spokesman Kush Desai said. \u201cThe Trump administration is focused on restoring the Gold Standard of Science \u2014 not ideological activism \u2014 as the guiding principle of HHS, the NIH, and the CDC to finally address our chronic disease epidemic.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency is taking aim at dozens of rules aimed at protecting the environment, including one that requires big polluters to report greenhouse gas emissions",
      "LEOPOLD, Ind. -- On the ceiling of Abbie Brockman\u2019s middle school English classroom in Perry County, the fluorescent lights are covered with images of a bright blue sky, a few clouds floating by.",
      "Outside, the real sky isn\u2019t always blue. Sometimes it\u2019s hazy, with pollution drifting from coal-fired power plants in this part of southwest Indiana. Knowing exactly how much, and what it may be doing to the people who live there, is why Brockman got involved with a local environmental organization that\u2019s installing air and water quality monitors in her community.",
      "\u201cIndustry and government is very, very, very powerful. It\u2019s more powerful than me. I\u2019m just an English teacher,\u201d Brockman said. But she wants to feel she can make a difference.",
      "In a way, Brockman\u2019s monitoring echoes the reporting that the Environmental Protection Agency began requiring from large polluters more than a decade ago. Emissions from four coal-fired plants in southwest Indiana have dropped 60% since 2010, when the rule took effect.",
      "That rule is now on the chopping block, one of many that President Donald Trump\u2019s EPA argues is costly and burdensome for industry.",
      "But experts say dropping the requirement risks a big increase in emissions if companies are no longer publicly accountable for what they put in the air. And they say losing the data \u2014 at the same time the EPA is cutting air quality monitoring elsewhere \u2014 would make it tougher to fight climate change.",
      "At stake is the Greenhouse Gas Reporting program, a 2009 rule from President Barack Obama's administration that affects large carbon polluters like refineries, power plants, wells and landfills. In the years since, they've collectively reported a 20% drop in emissions, mostly driven by the closure of coal plants.",
      "And what happens at these big emitters makes a difference. Their declining emissions account for more than three-quarters of the overall, if modest, decline in all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions since 2010.",
      "The registry includes places not usually thought of as big polluters but that have notable greenhouse gas emissions, such as college campuses, breweries and cereal factories. Even Walt Disney World in Florida, where pollution dropped 62% since 2010, has to report along with nearly 10,600 other places.",
      "\"We can\u2019t solve climate change without knowing how much pollution major facilities are emitting and how that\u2019s changing over time,\" said Jeremy Symons, a former EPA senior climate adviser now at Environmental Protection Network, an organization of ex-EPA officials that monitors environmental policies. The group provided calculations as a part of The Associated Press' analysis of impacts from proposed rule rollbacks.",
      "Symons said some companies would welcome the end of the registry because it would make it easier to pollute.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much the registry itself has contributed to declining emissions. More targeted regulations on smokestack emissions, as well as coal being crowded out by cheaper and less polluting natural gas, are bigger factors.",
      "But the registry \u201cdoes put pressure on companies to ... document what they\u2019ve done or at least to provide a baseline for what they\u2019ve done,\u201d said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who heads Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tally national carbon emissions yearly.",
      "Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator under Obama, said the registry makes clear how power plants are doing against each other, and that's an inducement to lower emissions.",
      "\"It is money for those companies. It's costs. It's reputation. It's been, I think, a wonderful success story and I hope it continues.\u201d",
      "The potential end of the reporting requirement comes as experts say much of the country's air goes unmonitored. Nelson Arley Roque, a Penn State professor who co-authored a study in April on these \u201cmonitoring deserts,\u201d said about 40% of U.S. lands are unmonitored. That often includes poor and rural neighborhoods.",
      "\"The air matters to all of us, but apparently 50 million people can\u2019t know or will never know'' how bad the air is, Roque said.",
      "The EPA is also trying to claw back money that had been earmarked for air monitoring, part of the termination of grants that it has labeled as targeting diversity, equity and inclusion. That includes $500,000 that would have funded 40 air monitors in a low-income and minority community in the Charlotte, North Carolina, area.",
      "CleaneAIRE NC, a nonprofit that works to improve air quality across the state that was awarded the grant, is suing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not diversity, equity and inclusion. It\u2019s human rights,\u201d said Daisha Wall, the group's community science program manager. \u201cWe all deserve a right to clean air.\u201d",
      "Research strongly links poor air quality to diseases like asthma and heart disease, with a slightly less established link to cancer. Near polluting industries, experts say what\u2019s often lacking is either enough data in specific locations or the will to investigate the health toll.",
      "Indiana says it \u201cmaintains a robust statewide monitoring and assessment program for air, land and water,\u201d but Brockman and others in this part of the state aren't satisfied. She and other members of local advocacy groups Southwestern Indiana Citizens for Quality of Life and Valley Watch install and maintain their own air and water quality monitors. It\u2019s a full-time job to keep the network of monitors up and running, fighting spotty Wi-Fi and connectivity issues.",
      "Fighting industry is a sensitive subject, Brockman added. Many families depend on jobs at coal-fired power plants, and poverty is real. She keeps snacks in her desk for the kids who haven\u2019t eaten breakfast.",
      "\u201cBut you also don\u2019t want to hear of another student that has a rare cancer,\u201d she said.",

      "Close underworld ties have long existed between organized crime groups in Mexico and Colombia. For many years, Colombian drug traffickers produced cocaine and heroin and moved it themselves by boat or plane to the United States. Later, as U.S. authorities cracked down on trafficking in the Caribbean, Mexican cartels' power grew as they moved Colombian drugs over land and via small plane to the U.S. border and smuggled them across.",

The bill is opposed by Lula's Workers' Party, but according to several press reports Lula will support of the bulk of the changes and will only negotiate minor adjustments.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect combo to wipe out environmental protections and Indigenous land demarcations in the country, accelerate the tipping point of the world\u2019s largest tropical forest and set off a carbon bomb against the global climate,\u201d Climate Observatory, a network of 133 environmental, civil society and academic groups, said in a statement.",

      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Tuesday won a reprieve in a civil suit accusing him of sexual misconduct, after a court approved his bid to temporarily suspend the trial due to start next week.",
      "The suit was filed in 2021 by his former research assistant, Muhammed Yusoff Rawther. Yusoff, 32, alleged that Anwar sexually harassed him in 2018 \u2014 before Anwar became premier, in November 2022. Anwar, 77, denies any wrongdoing and accuses Yusoff of fabricating the charge to ruin his political career.",
      "The case gained attention after Anwar sought immunity from prosecution, sparking criticism from the opposition and others. The High Court dismissed his application last week, saying everyone is equal before the law. Anwar has turned to the nation\u2019s top court, which will hear his case on July 21.",
      "The Court of Appeal on Tuesday approved Anwar\u2019s bid for a temporary stay to the trial that was due to start June 16, pending next month's hearing in the Federal Court.",
      "Anwar wants the Federal Court to rule on several legal questions including whether a sitting prime minister has immunity from lawsuits stemming from alleged private events before his appointment.

      "Just a week into his term in office, South Korea's liberal President Lee Jae-myung has moved against his ousted conservative predecessor",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Just a week into his term in office, South Korea's new liberal President Lee Jae-myung moved against his ousted conservative predecessor, approving legislation to launch sweeping special investigations into Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s ill-fated imposition of martial law in December as well as criminal allegations surrounding his wife and administration.",
      "The monthslong probes, which will involve hundreds of investigators under special prosecutors appointed by Lee, could dominate his early agenda and inflame tensions with conservatives, as Yoon already faces an explosive rebellion trial carrying a possible death sentence.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the bills approved at Tuesday\u2019s Cabinet meeting, which Lee is expected to sign into law soon.",
      "The three bills, overwhelmingly passed last week by the liberal-led legislature, call for independent investigations into Yoon\u2019s hourslong martial law debacle; corruption and financial crime allegations against his wife; and the 2023 drowning death of a marine during a flood rescue operation, an incident Lee\u2019s Democratic Party says Yoon\u2019s government tried to cover up.",
      "Earlier versions of the bills were rejected nine different times both by Yoon and by the caretaker government that took over following his impeachment on Dec. 14.",
      "Lee, who won last week\u2019s snap election triggered by Yoon\u2019s formal removal from office in April, ran on a platform of unity, promising not to target conservatives out of spite and vowing to ease political polarization. However, Lee called for deeper investigations into Yoon\u2019s martial law enactment and allegations involving his wife, citing public demands for accountability.",
      "For each of the three investigations, Lee will appoint a special prosecutor from two candidates nominated by his Democratic Party and a smaller liberal ally. The main conservative People Power Party, whose members largely boycotted last week\u2019s National Assembly votes, denounced the laws for excluding them from the nomination process. Liberal lawmakers justified the move, citing the conservatives\u2019 alleged ties to matters that will be investigated.",
      "More than 570 investigators, including some 120 public prosecutors, can be assigned to assist with the inquiries. The special prosecutors are expected to be nominated and appointed in coming weeks, potentially allowing the investigations to begin as early as July.",
      "Kang Yu-jung, Lee\u2019s spokesperson, said the Cabinet\u2019s approval of the bills reflects public demands to \u201cseek accountability for the rebellion attempt and restore constitutional order.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt also carries the meaning of recovering the National Assembly\u2019s legislative authority, which had been repeatedly blocked by presidential vetoes,\u201d she said.",
      "Public prosecutors in Seoul already indicted Yoon in January on charges of masterminding a rebellion and enacting martial law as an illegal bid to seize the legislature and election offices and arrest political opponents. Liberals insisted independent investigations into Yoon are still essential, saying probes by prosecutors, police and an anti-corruption agency were inadequate and hampered by Yoon\u2019s refusal to cooperate.",
      "Yoon's case will now likely be transferred to the special prosecutor, who will be authorized to expand the existing investigation, including whether he and senior military leaders deliberately sought to provoke North Korea in order to create a crisis that could justify declaring martial law at home.",
      "Yoon\u2019s martial law decree on Dec. 3, which lasted only hours after a quorum of lawmakers pushed past a blockade of hundreds of heavily armed soldiers to revoke it, came amid heightened inter-Korean tensions, marked by monthslong North Korean flights of trash-laden balloons and South Korean loudspeaker broadcasts at the border.",
      "The special prosecutor could also expand the investigation to include PPP lawmakers over suspicions that party leaders tried to obstruct the vote to lift Yoon\u2019s martial law, by directing lawmakers to attend an emergency party meeting, instead of the main chamber session. This is almost certain to provoke a fierce reaction from conservatives, already in disarray after Yoon\u2019s self-inflicted political downfall.",
      "Yoon\u2019s wife, Kim Keon Hee, faces multiple corruption allegations, including claims that she received luxury items from a Unification Church official seeking business favors, as well as possible involvement in a stock price manipulation scheme. Kim is also suspected of interfering with PPP candidate nominations ahead of legislative elections in April last year, but has yet to be summoned by law enforcement authorities. While in office, Yoon repeatedly dismissed calls to investigate his wife, denouncing them as baseless political attacks.",
      "PPP leaders accuse Lee\u2019s government of using its legislative majority to target conservatives \u2013 and also shield the presidency from Lee\u2019s own legal troubles. Lee faced five separate trials on corruption and other charges, but in three cases where hearings had begun, the courts postponed proceedings until after the election.",
      "While South Korea\u2019s constitution prevents a sitting president from being prosecuted for most crimes aside from rebellion and treason, it does not clearly state whether that protection extends to criminal charges filed before taking office, leaving room for judicial interpretation.",
      "The Democrats, who hold 170 of the 300 National Assembly seats, are pushing to revise the criminal procedure law to suspend all ongoing criminal trials involving a sitting president until the end of their terms \u2013 a move PPP leader Kim Yong-tae called a \u201cdistorted\u201d attempt to \u201cbulletproof\u201d Lee\u2019s presidency.",
      "\u201cBecoming president does not erase (Lee\u2019s) crimes. Suspending trials do not make the crimes disappear,\u201d Kim said Tuesday, calling for the Democrats to scrap the bill. \u201cThis would be a declaration that power would stand above the law.\u201d",
      "Two different courts this week handling Lee\u2019s cases \u2014 on allegations of violating election laws and granting illicit favors to private investors during dubious development projects while he was mayor of Seongnam \u2014 decided to suspend the trials indefinitely, citing their interpretations of the constitution.",

      "The Iranian judiciary\u2019s Mizan news agency announced the executions Tuesday, saying that the death sentences had been upheld by the country\u2019s top court.",
      "It described the militants as being detained after they were in a clash in the country's western region with Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, in which three troops and several Islamic State group fighters were killed. Authorities said they had seized a cache of combat weapons, including a machine gun and 50 grenades, after surrounding the militants' hideout in the country\u2019s west.",
      "Iran carries out executions by hanging.",
      "The extremist group, which once held vast territory across Iraq and Syria in a self-described caliphate it declared in 2014, ultimately was beaten back by U.S.-led forces.",
      "It has since been in disarray, though it has mounted major assaults. In Iran's neighbor Afghanistan, for instance, IS is believed to have grown in strength since the fall of the Western-backed government there to the Taliban in 2021.",
      "The group previously claimed a June 2017 attack in Tehran on parliament and a mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini that killed at least 18 people and wounded more than 50. It has claimed other attacks in Iran, including two suicide bombings in 2024 targeting a commemoration for an Iranian general slain in a 2020 U.S. drone strike. That assault killed at least 94 people.",
      "The clash with Revolutionary Guardsmen in 2018 marked a point of heightened tensions between Iran and the militant group. Iran launched ballistic missiles at parts of eastern Syria, vowing revenge after militants disguised themselves as soldiers and opened fire at a military parade in the Islamic Republic\u2019s southwest. That attack killed at least 25 people and was claimed by both the Islamic State group and local separatists.",
      "But Tehran's hand in Syria was weakened with the fall last year of President Bashar Assad, a key ally. Analysts say IS could take advantage of the security vacuum to stage a comeback while Syria\u2019s new leaders are still consolidating their control over the country and forming a national army.",

      "Japan\u2019s bid, led by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, was short-listed in November for the Royal Australian Navy's SEA 3000 frigate project and is competing against Germany\u2019s MEKO A-200 offered by Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems.",
      "The Australian Government will select a preferred design later this year, with construction for 11 new vessels slated to begin the following year.",
      "\u201cWe will go through the process of assessing those bids, both very impressive. We intend to make a decision in relation to that this year,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Richard Marles said during his visit to Indonesia last week. \u201cWe intend to make a decision as quickly as we can, which means, before the end of this year.\u201d",
      "As part of its military buildup, Japan is pushing to strengthen its largely domestic defense industry by participating in joint development, including a next-generation fighter jet with Britain and Italy, and promoting foreign sales like the Mogami-class ships.",
      "In a sign of its commitment and heavy investment Japan has pledged to prioritize the RAN\u2019s order over its own naval procurement.",
      "The project not only serves to further deepen cooperation between Japan and Australia but also to enhance Japan\u2019s warship capabilities, Defense Minister Gen Nakatani has said.",
      "The Japanese Mogami-class design boasts advanced combat systems, anti-submarine and anti-air warfare capabilities, and mine countermeasure operations \u2014 all operated by a lean crew of around 90, helping to address ongoing recruitment challenges in the Australian Navy.",
      "The vessel\u2019s commanding officer, Masayoshi Tamura, said the ship's smaller crew was an aim of the Mogami-class ship.",
      "\u201cThe Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force thought we need stealth, and less people, and a little bit smaller ship,\u201d Tamura told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.",
      "The JS Yahagi's visit to Darwin comes amid intensifying strategic cooperation between Canberra and Tokyo, both of which have emphasized the importance of maritime safety and security of sea lanes.",
      "The frigate\u2019s arrival is also seen as a gesture of Japan\u2019s growing role in regional security and its desire to align more closely with key partners like Australia.",
      "In September 2024, Australia and Japan agreed to increase joint military training exercises to address shared concerns of China's incursions into Japanese airspace and territorial waters.",

      "Filipino forces and villagers have been struggling to live in Beijing's shadow in the disputed South China while fighting isolation on remote islands",
      "WEST YORK ISLAND, South China Sea -- Overwhelmed after setting foot for the first time on a far-flung but picturesque island in the disputed South China Sea, a Filipino army official knelt to kiss the shore. She held a small Philippine flag that fluttered in the breeze.",
      "\u201cThis is just so beautiful,\u201d Philippines military spokesperson Col. Francel Margareth Padilla said of West York Island, one of nine islands, reefs and atolls occupied by Filipino forces in the long-contested waters. \u201cThis solidifies our resolve to fight for this place whatever happens.\u201d",
      "The 18.6-hectare (46-acre) droplet-shaped island, called Likas by Filipinos, could easily become an eco-tourism draw in tropical Asia with its powdery white-sand beaches, turquoise waters and giant sea turtle sanctuaries. Padilla expressed hope it could someday be opened to Filipino travelers and tourists from across the world.",
      "But that longstanding aspiration by Philippine officials has been stymied by a tangle of territorial conflicts involving a militarily superior China.",
      "Beijing claims virtually the entire South China Sea, a vital global trade route with rich undersea deposits of gas and oil. It has increasingly flexed its military might, including its navy \u2014 the largest in the world \u2014 to strengthen its grip on a strategic waterway it says it has owned since ancient times.",
      "The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan contest China\u2019s expansive claims with their own, and the territorial stand-offs have increasingly flared into cat-and-mouse confrontations at sea in recent years.",
      "The long-simmering disputes are also a delicate fault line in the regional rivalry between Beijing and Washington.",
      "Both former President Joe Biden and his successor, Donald Trump, have condemned China\u2019s growing aggression in the contested waters, including its coast guard\u2019s use of powerful water cannons, blinding military-grade lasers and dangerous sea maneuvers against the coast guard and navy of the Philippines, Washington\u2019s oldest treaty ally in Asia.",
      "Under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who took office in mid-2022, the Philippines has intensified a campaign to expose China\u2019s increasingly assertive actions by capturing them in video and photographs. The images have then been made public in the hope that international pressure would prompt Beijing to back down to avoid damage to its reputation.",
      "The Philippine military invited a small group of journalists, including two from The Associated Press, in a dayslong naval patrol of the South China Sea territories claimed by Manila and on visits to navy and marine forces deployed to guard them.",
      "During the patrol, which ended over the weekend, the BRP Andres Bonifacio navy ship carrying the journalists warned a number of Chinese coast guard ships and suspected Chinese militia vessels by two-way radio to move away from Philippines-claimed waters. The Chinese ships responded by asserting their sovereignty in the offshore region without undertaking any provocative actions.",
      "On West York Island, two Filipino marines in camouflage uniforms stood guard with M4 assault rifles under a Philippine flag. One used binoculars to scan the surrounding waters for Chinese or Vietnamese ships passing by from a distance.",
      "One of the farthest islands in the disputed waters from the nearest Philippine province of Palawan, West York is a difficult and risky post, where Filipino forces see nothing beyond the small island but sea. Military personnel can occasionally call their loved ones during their two-month deployment, but the internet connection is spotty, especially during the typhoon season that starts in June, according to military personnel on the island.",
      "They grow eggplants, okra and chili peppers and raise goats and chickens to augment food provisions delivered by navy ships from Palawan. There is a makeshift basketball court to help while away off-duty time and ease the feeling of isolation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s being away from your family,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cAt the end of the day, you go home to an empty room.\u201d",
      "Marine Col. Joel Bonavente, who was among the visiting military officials, told AP that military personnel posted in the remote outpost get additional pay to compensate for the \"hazard and loneliness.\u201d",
      "On Thitu, the largest Philippines-claimed island, which lies west of West York, civilians have thrived for decades in a small fishing village alongside the military forces.",
      "An AP journalist who visited Thitu several years ago saw an island with only a few low-slung wooden and concrete buildings and a gravel airstrip that was being eroded by the constant pounding of waves. There were a few shanties mainlanders had moved to from Palawan in exchange for a monthly government provision of groceries, rice and cash in a bid to grow a civilian community.",
      "Dramatic infrastructure improvements have occurred through the years on the 37.2-hectare (92-acre) island, which now has a concrete runway, a huge aircraft hangar, a wharf, a storm shelter and concrete roads running through the fishing village, military encampments and a three-story coast guard surveillance center.",
      "A high school building is nearly finished near a seawater desalination facility.",
      "\u201cI want to stay on this island because my blood pressure remains stable without the wide selection of fatty food you find in the city like hamburgers,\u201d said Nenita Bania, a 59-year-old villager who has lived with her husband on Thitu for 12 years.",
      "\u201cLonely? Not really. It\u2019s not the case if you\u2019re with family,\u201d she told the AP aboard an air force C-130 aircraft, as she and other villagers hitched a ride back to Thitu from Palawan province.",
      "Living in China\u2019s shadow in the disputed waters, however, has been challenging, said Larry Hugo, 47, who leads a group of at least 114 fishermen.",
      "More than a decade ago, China transformed seven disputed South China Sea reefs into island bases, where Chinese coast guard and navy ships can now refuel and obtain supplies for longer periods far from the Chinese mainland.",
      "One of China\u2019s artificial islands, Subi, has a military-grade runway and lies just 26 kilometers (16 miles) from Thitu.",
      "\u201cThere were no Chinese ships before but now it\u2019s a big problem because they are all around our island,\u201d Hugo said. \u201cThey\u2019re guarding the reefs where we used to fish, and they block us so we can't venture far.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have small boats and we may be run over and that\u2019ll be a big problem because we\u2019re far from civilization.\u201d",

      "Even as it pursues its invasion of Ukraine, Russia is also expanding its military footprint in Africa",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- Even as it pounds Ukraine, Russia is expanding its military footprint in Africa, delivering sophisticated weaponry to sub-Saharan conflict zones where a Kremlin-controlled armed force is on the rise. Skirting sanctions imposed by Western nations, Moscow is using cargo ships to send tanks, armored vehicles, artillery and other high-value equipment to West Africa, The Associated Press has found.",
      "Relying on satellite imagery and radio signals, AP tracked a convoy of Russian-flagged cargo ships as they made a nearly one-month journey from the Baltic Sea. The ships carried howitzers, radio jamming equipment and other military hardware, according to military officials in Europe who closely monitored them. The deliveries could strengthen Russia\u2019s fledgling Africa Corps as Moscow competes with the United States, Europe and China for greater influence across the continent.",
      "The two-year-old Africa Corps, which has links to a covert branch of Russia\u2019s army, is ascendant at a time when U.S. and European troops have been withdrawing from the region, forced out by sub-Saharan nations turning to Russia for security.",
      "Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger have been battling fighters linked with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group for more than a decade.",
      "At first, mercenary groups with an arms-length relationship to the Kremlin entered the fray in Africa. But increasingly, Russia is deploying its military might, and intelligence services, more directly.",
      "\u201dWe intend to expand our cooperation with African countries in all spheres, with an emphasis on economic cooperation and investments,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. \u201cThis cooperation includes sensitive areas linked to defense and security.\u201d",
      "Russia's 8,800-ton Baltic Leader and 5,800-ton Patria are among hundreds of ships that Western nations have sanctioned to choke off resources for Russia's war in Ukraine. The ships docked and unloaded in Conakry, Guinea, in late May, AP satellite images showed.",
      "Other ships made deliveries to the same port in January. They delivered tanks, armored vehicles and other hardware that was then trucked overland to neighboring Mali, according to European military officials and a Malian blogger's video of the long convoy.",
      "The military officials spoke to AP about Russian operations on condition of anonymity. The AP verified the blogger's video, geolocating it to the RN5 highway leading into Bamako, the Malian capital.",
      "After the latest delivery in Conakry, trucks carrying Russian-made armored vehicles, howitzers and other equipment were again spotted on the overland route to Mali.",
      "Malian broadcaster ORTM confirmed that the West African nation's army took delivery of new military equipment. AP analysis of its video and images filmed by the Malian blogger in the same spot as the January delivery identified a broad array of Russian-made hardware, including 152 mm artillery guns and other smaller canons.",
      "AP also identified a wheeled, BTR-80 armored troop carrier with radio-jamming equipment, as well as Spartak armored vehicles and other armored carriers, some mounted with guns. The shipment also included at least two semi-inflatable small boats, one with a Russian flag painted on its hull, as well as tanker trucks, some marked \u201cinflammable\u201d in Russian on their sides.",
      "The military officials who spoke to AP said they believe Russia has earmarked the most potent equipment \u2014 notably the artillery and jamming equipment \u2014 for its Africa Corps, not Malian armed forces. Africa Corps appears to have been given air power, too, with satellites spotting at least one Su-24 fighter-bomber at a Bamako air base in recent months.",
      "For years, French forces supported counterinsurgency operations in Mali and neighboring Burkina Faso and Niger. But France pulled out its troops after coups in Mali in 2020 and 2021, in Burkina Faso in 2022 and Niger in 2023. Russian mercenaries stepped into the vacuum.",
      "Wagner Group, the most notable, deployed to Sudan in 2017 and expanded to other African countries, often in exchange for mining concessions.",
      "It earned a reputation for brutality, accused by Western countries and U.N. experts of human rights abuses, including in Central African Republic, Libya and Mali.",
      "Of 33 African countries in which Russian military contractors were active, the majority were Wagner-controlled, according to U.S. government-sponsored research by RAND.",
      "But after Wagner forces mutinied in Russia in 2023 and their leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, was killed two months later in a suspicious plane crash, Moscow tightened its grip. Russian military operations in Africa were restructured, with the Kremlin taking greater control through Africa Corps.",
      "It is overseen by the commander of Unit 29155, one of the most notorious branches of Russia\u2019s shadowy GRU military intelligence service, according to the European Union. Unit 29155 has been accused of covertly attacking Western interests for years, including through sabotage and assassination attempts.",
      "The EU in December targeted Unit 29155 Maj. Gen. Andrey Averyanov with sanctions, alleging that he is in charge of Africa Corps operations.",
      "\u201cIn many African countries, Russian forces provide security to military juntas that have overthrown legitimate democratic governments, gravely worsening the stability, security and democracy of the countries,\u201d the EU sanctions ruling said. These operations are financed by exploiting the continent's natural resources, the ruling added.",
      "The Russian Ministry of Defense didn\u2019t immediately respond to questions about Averyanov\u2019s role in Africa Corps.",
      "Researchers and military officials say the flow of weapons from Russia appears to be speeding Africa Corps\u2019 ascendancy over Wagner, helping it win over mercenaries that have remained loyal to the group. Africa Corps is also is recruiting in Russia, offering payments of up to 2.1 million rubles ($26,500), and even plots of land, for signing a contract with the Ministry of Defense, plus more on deployment.",
      "Within days of the latest equipment delivery, Wagner announced its withdrawal from Mali, declaring \u201cmission accomplished\" in a Telegram post.",
      "Africa Corps said in a separate post that it would remain.",
      "The changeover from Wagner to Africa Corps in Mali could be a forerunner for other similar transitions elsewhere on the continent, said Julia Stanyard, a researcher of Russian mercenary activity in Africa.",
      "\u201cBringing in this sort of brand-new sophisticated weaponry, and new armored vehicles and that sort of thing, is quite a bit of a shift,\u201d said Stanyard, of the Switzerland-based Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime.",
      "Armed groups in Mali have inflicted heavy losses on Malian troops and Russian mercenaries. The al-Qaida linked group JNIM killed dozens of soldiers in an attack this month on a military base. Insurgents also killed dozens of Wagner mercenaries in northern Mali last July.",
      "Some of the latest hardware could have been shipped over specifically in response to such attacks, military officials said. They said the jamming equipment, for example, could help defend against booby traps detonated using phone signals.",
      "The latest convoy attracted attention because a Russian Navy warship, the Boykiy, escorted the ships after they set off in April from Russia\u2019s Kaliningrad region on the Baltic.",
      "Last October, in what's considered a hostile act, the Boykiy's radar systems locked onto a French Navy maritime surveillance plane on patrol against suspected Russian efforts to sabotage underwater cables, according to military officials.",
      "The convoy included a third sanctioned Russian cargo ship, the Siyanie Severa. It continued onward as Baltic Leader and Patria unloaded in Conakry, docking in Bata, Equatorial Guinea.",
      "Satellite imagery from May 29 shows trucks lined up on the dock as the ship unloaded. The AP could not verify whether the cargo included weapons or the ultimate destination for the shipment, though Wagner has maintained a strong presence in the nearby Central African Republic.",

      "A wave of new ratifications during the U.N. Ocean Conference in France has brought the High Seas Treaty closer to the 60-country threshold needed for it to enter into force",
      "NICE, France -- Eighteen countries ratified the High Seas Treaty on Monday, bringing the total to 49 \u2014 just 11 short of the 60 needed for the ocean agreement to enter into force. The surge in support, occurring during the U.N. Ocean Conference in Nice, France, adds momentum to what could become a historic shift in how the world governs the open ocean.",
      "\u201cThe entry into force is within our sight, and I call on all remaining nations to join swiftly,\u201d U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres told reporters Tuesday. \u201cWe do not have a moment to lose.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what the treaty is, why it matters and what happens next.",
      "Formally known as the Agreement on Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction, the High Seas Treaty is the first legally binding agreement focused on protecting marine biodiversity in international waters. These waters, which are beyond the jurisdiction of any single country, make up nearly two-thirds of the ocean and almost half the surface of the planet.",
      "Until now, there has been no comprehensive legal framework to create marine protected areas or enforce conservation on the high seas.",
      "Despite their remoteness, the high seas are under growing pressure from overfishing, climate change and the threat of deep-sea mining. Environmental advocates warn that without proper protections, marine ecosystems in international waters face irreversible harm.",
      "\u201cUntil now, it has been the wild west on the high seas,\" said Megan Randles, global political lead for oceans at Greenpeace. \"Now we have a chance to properly put protections in place.\u201d",
      "The treaty is also essential to achieving the global \u201c30x30\u201d target \u2014 an international pledge to protect 30% of the planet\u2019s land and sea by 2030.",
      "The treaty creates a legal process for countries to establish marine protected areas in the high seas, including rules for destructive activities like deep-sea mining and geo-engineering. It also establishes a framework for technology-sharing, funding mechanisms and scientific collaboration among countries.",
      "Crucially, decisions under the treaty will be made multilaterally through conferences of parties (COPs) rather than by individual countries acting alone.",
      "Once 60 countries ratify the treaty, a 120-day countdown begins before it officially enters into force. That would unlock the ability to begin designating protected areas in the high seas and put oversight mechanisms into motion.",
      "As of Monday evening, 49 countries and the EU had ratified, meaning 11 more are needed to trigger that countdown.",
      "Guterres called the pace of progress \u201ca record,\u201d noting that the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea took 12 years to reach entry into force, while the BBNJ treaty appears poised to do so in just over two.",
      "\u201cI see a momentum and an enthusiasm that was difficult to find in the past,\u201d he said.",
      "The first Conference of the Parties (COP1) must take place within one year of the treaty\u2019s entry into force. That meeting will lay the groundwork for implementation, including decisions on governance, financing and the creation of key bodies to evaluate marine protection proposals.",
      "Environmental groups are pushing to surpass the required 60 ratifications, and to do so quickly \u2013 the more countries that ratify, the stronger and more representative the treaty\u2019s implementation will be. There\u2019s also a deadline: only countries that ratify by COP1 will be eligible to vote on critical decisions that determine how the treaty will operate.",
      "\u201cTo reach 60 ratifications would be an absolutely enormous achievement, but for the treaty to be as effective as possible, we need countries from all over the world to engage in its implementation,\u201d said Rebecca Hubbard, director of the High Seas Alliance. \u201cSo the next step will be to go from 60 to global.\u201d",
      "The surge in support on Monday has raised hopes that 2025 could mark a turning point for high seas protection.",

      "President Donald Trump likes to say he\u2019s bringing in trillions of dollars in investments from foreign countries",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump likes to say he's bringing in trillions of dollars in investments from foreign countries, but a provision in his tax cuts bill could cause international companies to avoid expanding into the United States.",
      "The House-passed version of the legislation would allow the federal government to impose taxes on foreign-parented companies and investors from countries judged as charging \u201cunfair foreign taxes\u201d on U.S. companies.",
      "Known as Section 899, the measure could cause companies to avoid investing in the the U.S. out of concern they could face steep taxes. The fate of the measure rests with the Senate \u2014 setting off a debate about its prospects and impact.",
      "A new analysis by the Global Business Alliance, a trade group representing international companies such as Toyota and Nestl\u00e9, estimates that the provision would cost the U.S. 360,000 jobs and $55 billion annually over 10 years in lost gross domestic product. The analysis estimates that the tax could cut a third off the economic growth anticipated from the overall tax cuts by Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation.",
      "\"While proponents say this punitive tax hike is intended as a retaliatory measure against foreign governments, this report confirms that the real victims are American workers in states like North Carolina, South Carolina, Indiana, Tennessee and Texas,\" said Jonathan Samford, president and CEO of the Global Business Alliance.",
      "Republican Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, has defended the provision as protecting U.S. interests by giving the president a tool that can be used against countries with tax codes that, in the federal government's opinion, put American companies at a disadvantage.",
      "\u201cIf these countries withdraw these taxes and decide to behave, we will have achieved our goal,\" Smith said in a statement last week. \"It\u2019s just common sense. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to move quickly to pass this bill and protect Americans from economic bad actors around the world.\u201d",
      "The tax gets at a fundamental tension within Trump's policy agenda: a contradiction in the broad strokes of Trump simultaneously trying to tax imports and foreign profits at higher rates while also seeking investments from companies headquartered abroad.",
      "In late May, Trump defended his approach by saying that his tariffs were causing more countries to invest in the U.S. to avoid imports getting taxed. While some countries and companies have made announcements, there is not evidence of the investments pushing up spending on new factories as measured in the government's monthly report on construction spending.",
      "The Republican president said his tendency to impose steep tariffs, then retreat to lower rates, had succeeded.",
      "\u201cWe have $14 trillion now invested, committed to investing,\u201d Trump said then. \u201cYou know we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. I went to Saudi Arabia, the king told me, he said, you got the hottest -- we have the hottest country in the world right now.\u201d",
      "The Global Business Alliance was among the groups that signed a letter on Monday warning of the consequences of Section 899 to Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo of Idaho, both Republicans.",

      "The European Union wants to lower a cap on the price of Russian oil to deprive the Kremlin of profits to fund its war in Ukraine",
      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union wants to lower a cap on the price of Russian oil to deprive the Kremlin of extra profits to fund its war in Ukraine as part of a new raft of sanctions aimed at forcing Moscow to the negotiating table, senior officials said on Tuesday.",
      "EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the bloc is \u201cproposing to lower the oil price cap from $60 to $45, which is lower than the market price, and lowering the oil price cap will hit Russia\u2019s revenues hard.\u201d",
      "Kallas said the EU also wants to impose \u201csanctions on the Nord Stream pipelines to prevent Russia generating any revenue in the future. In this way, it sends a clear signal we are not going back to business as usual.\u201d",
      "All 27 EU member countries must all agree for the sanctions to enter force.",
      "In 2023, Ukraine\u2019s Western allies limited sales of Russian oil to $60 per barrel but the price cap was largely symbolic as most of Moscow\u2019s crude \u2014 its main moneymaker \u2014 cost less than that. Still, the cap was there in case oil prices rose.",
      "Oil income is the linchpin of Russia\u2019s economy, allowing President Vladimir Putin to pour money into the armed forces while avoiding worsening inflation for everyday people and a currency collapse.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she assumed that the price cap would be discussed and agreed among the leaders of the Group of Seven major world economic powers when they meet in Canada on June 15-17.",
      "She said the United States and its G7 partners realize \u201cthat the oil price has lowered so much that the effectiveness of the cap is to be questioned, and therefore we all want to lower the oil price from $60 per barrel down to $45 per barrel.\u201d",
      "The Nord Stream gas pipelines were built to carry Russian natural gas to Germany but are not in operation. They were sabotaged in 2022, but the source of the underwater explosions has remained a major international mystery.",
      "The Commission has said that it wants to impose sanctions on the operating consortium to discourage investors from trying to use the pipelines in future.",
      "The blasts happened as Europe attempted to wean itself off Russian energy sources following the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and contributed to tensions that followed the start of the war.",
      "Von der Leyen noted on Tuesday that at the beginning of the war in 2022, \u201cRussia had 12 billion euros ($14 billion) of energy revenues from fossil fuels\" from Europe per month. \"And now we\u2019re down to 1.8 billion (euros).\u201d",
      "The new EU sanctions would also target Russia\u2019s banking sector, with the aim of limiting the Kremlin\u2019s ability to raise funds or carry out financial transactions. A further 22 Russian banks will be hit with measures, von der Leyen said.",
      "An export ban worth some 2.5 billion euros would also be imposed, and the assets frozen of more than 20 Russian and foreign companies alleged to be providing support to the Kremlin\u2019s war machine.",
      "Von der Leyen said the sanctions are aimed at forcing Russia into serious talks about peace with Ukraine. \u201cWe need a real ceasefire, and Russia has to come to the negotiating table with a serious proposal,\u201d she told reporters.",
      "The EU has imposed several rounds of sanctions on Russia since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Around 2,400 officials and \u201centities\u201d \u2013 often government agencies, banks and organizations \u2013 have been hit.",
      "It\u2019s last raft of sanctions, imposed on May 20, targeted almost 200 ships in Russia\u2019s sanction-busting shadow fleet of tankers, and tightened trade restrictions to stop produce that could be used for military purposes from reaching Russia\u2019s armed forces.",

      "LONDON -- Britain will invest 14.2 billion pounds ($19 billion) to build a new nuclear station that will reduce the U.K.'s reliance on volatile international fossil fuel markets, the government said Tuesday.",
      "Officials said the investment will go into building the new Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk, on England's eastern coast, saying it will generate enough low-carbon electricity to power 6 million homes when it becomes operational in the 2030s.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer said previous governments had dithered and delayed over nuclear power. No new nuclear plant has been opened in the U.K. since Sizewell B in 1995.",
      "\u201cHaving our own energy in this country that we control, gives us security, gives us independence, so (Russian President Vladimir) Putin can\u2019t put his boot on our throat,\" Starmer said. \u201cAnd it means that we can control the prices in a way that we haven\u2019t been able to in recent years, which has meant very high prices for businesses, for households and for families.\"",
      "The government also announced that Rolls-Royce is the preferred bidder to develop a number of small modular reactors, which it said can power around 3 million homes and help fuel power-hungry industries like AI data centers.",
      "The Treasury said building Sizewell C will create 10,000 jobs. The investment announced Tuesday is in addition to 3.7 billion pounds the U.K. government already committed to the project.",
      "Nuclear power is seen as an increasingly important electricity source as the government seeks to decarbonize Britain\u2019s electricity grid by 2030, replacing fossil fuels with low-carbon power.",
      "The U.K. also wants to reduce its dependence on imported oil and gas, especially in light of soaring energy prices following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",
      "But critics have said nuclear plants are far more expensive and slow to build compared with renewable energy options such as solar and wind power. Environmental groups have also argued Sizewell C will damage local nature reserves that host wildlife like otters and marsh birds.",
      "About 300 people joined a protest against the development at the Suffolk site over the weekend.",
      "\u201cNet zero is supposed to happen by 2030 \u2014 there is no way this is going to be completed by then,\" said Jenny Kirtley, a local resident who chairs the campaign group Together Against Sizewell C.",

That marked a downgrade from the 2.3% U.S. growth it had forecast back for 2025 back in January.",

      "The Chinese economy is forecast to see growth slow from 5% in 2024 to 4.5% this year and 4% next. The world\u2019s second-largest economy has been hobbled by the tariffs that Trump has imposed on its exports, by the collapse of its real estate market and by an aging workforce.",
      "The World Bank expects the 20 European countries that share the euro currency to collectively grow just 0.7% this year, down from an already lackluster 0.9% in 2024. Trump\u2019s tariffs are expected to hurt European exports. And the unpredictable way he rolls them out \u2014 announcing them, suspending them, coming up with new ones \u2014 has created uncertainty that discourages business investment.",
      "India is once again expected to the be world\u2019s fastest-growing major economy, expanding at a 6.3% clip this year. But that\u2019s down from 6.5% in 2024 and from the 6.7% the bank had forecast for 2025 in January. In Japan, economic growth is expected to accelerate this year \u2013 but only from 0.2% in 2024 to a sluggish 0.7% this year, well short of the 1.2% the World Bank had forecast in January.",

      "Attorneys for the federal government and the mining company agreed during a recent hearing to the 60-day delay. That time frame also is specified in the legislation that Congress passed and then-President Barack Obama signed in 2014 authorizing the exchange.",
      "The group Apache Stronghold, the San Carlos Apache Tribe and others welcomed more time to fight for Oak Flat, an area they consider as holy.",
      "\u201cIn this critical moment, we call on the Trump administration and Congress to halt the transfer to a Chinese-owned mine, and honor what is sacred,\u201d said Wendsler Nosie Sr., leader of Apache Stronghold. \"As we continue to fight in court, know this: Nothing will turn us away from defending the spiritual essence of our people, the lifeblood that connects us to the creator and this land.\u201d",
      "A statement from Resolution Cooper said the ruling is consistent with prior decisions and gives the parties time to review the final environmental impact statement that will be issued later this month.",
      "\u201cWe are confident the project satisfies all applicable legal requirements,\u201d said Resolution president and general manager Vicky Peacey.",
      "She added that years of consultation with tribes and communities resulted in changes to the mining plan to reduce potential effects.",
      "The fight over Oak Flat dates back about 20 years, when legislation proposing the land exchange was first introduced. It failed repeatedly in Congress before being included in a must-pass national defense spending bill in 2014.",
      "San Carlos Apache Chairman Terry Rambler said Monday that the bill was not in the best interest of the American people, Arizona or his tribe. He said concerns persist about the mine's use of groundwater and the pending obliteration of the culturally significant site.",
      "Apache Stronghold and the tribe sued the U.S. government in 2021 to protect the place tribal members call Chi\u2019chil Bildagoteel, which is dotted with ancient oak groves and traditional plants the Apaches consider essential to their religion. The U.S. Supreme Court recently rejected an appeal by the Apache group, letting lower court rulings stand.",
      "The project has support in nearby Superior and other traditional mining towns in the area. The company \u2014 a subsidiary of international mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP \u2014 estimates the mine will generate $1 billion a year for Arizona\u2019s economy and create thousands of jobs.",

      "A Brooklyn jury on Monday found Nicole Daedone, founder of OneTaste Inc., and Rachel Cherwitz, the California-based company\u2019s former sales director, guilty after deliberating for less than two days following a five-week trial. The two each face up to 20 years in prison when sentenced later.",

      "They said Daedone, 57, of New York, and Cherwitz, 44, of California, used economic, sexual and psychological abuse, intimidation and indoctrination to force OneTaste members into sexual acts they found uncomfortable or repulsive, such as having sex with prospective investors or clients.",
      "The two told followers the questionable acts were necessary in order to obtain \u201cfreedom\u201d and \u201cenlightenment\u201d and demonstrate their commitment to the organization\u2019s principles.",

      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says that Canada will meet NATO\u2019s military spending guideline by early next year",
      "TORONTO -- Canada will meet NATO's military spending guideline by early next year and diversify defense spending away from the United States, which he says no longer plays a predominant role on the world stage, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Monday.",
      "Carney said Canada will achieve NATO\u2019s spending target of 2% of gross domestic product five years earlier than it had previously planned.",
      "\u201cOur military infrastructure and equipment have aged, hindering our military preparedness,\" Carney said. \u201cOnly one of our four submarines is seaworthy. Less than half of our maritime fleet and land vehicles are operational. More broadly we are too reliant on the United States.\u201d",
      "According to NATO figures, Canada was estimated to be spending 1.33% of GDP on its military budget in 2023, below the 2% target that NATO countries have set for themselves. Canada previously said it was on track to meet NATO\u2019s spending target by the end of the decade.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to protect Canadians, not to satisfy NATO accountants,\u201d Carney said.",
      "The announcement of increased spending came as Canada is about to host U.S. President Donald Trump and other leaders at a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations in Alberta on June 15-17, and before the NATO summit in Europe. It also comes as NATO allies are poised to increase the commitment well beyond the 2% target.",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said last week that most U.S. allies at NATO endorse Trump\u2019s demand that they invest 5% of gross domestic product on their defense needs and are ready to ramp up security spending even more.",
      "Carney has said that he intends to diversify Canada\u2019s procurement and enhance the country\u2019s relationship with the EU.",
      "\u201cWe should no longer send three quarters of our defense capital spending to America,\u201d Carney said in a speech at the University of Toronto. \u201cWe will invest in new submarines, aircraft, ships, armed vehicles and artillery, as well as new radar, drones and sensors to monitor the seafloor and the Arctic.\u201d",
      "Canada has been in discussions with the European Union to join an EU drive to break its security dependency on the United States, with a focus on buying more defense equipment, including fighter jets, in Europe. Carney\u2019s government is reviewing the purchase of U.S. F-35 fighter jets to see if there are other options.",
      "\u201cWe stood shoulder to shoulder with the Americans throughout the Cold War and in the decades that followed, as the United States played a predominant role on the world stage. Today, that predominance is a thing of the past,\u201d Carney said in French.",
      "He added that with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the United States became the global hegemon, noting its gravitational pull, always strong, became virtually irresistible and made the U.S. \u201cour closest ally and dominant trading partner.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow the United States is beginning to monetize its hegemony: charging for access to its markets and reducing its relative contributions to our collective security,\u201d Carney said.",
      "The prime minister said that \"a new imperialism threatens.\u201d",
      "\u201cMiddle powers compete for interests and attention, knowing that if they are not at the table, they will be on the menu,\" Carney said.",
      "Trump\u2019s calls to make Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians, and Carney won the job of prime minister after promising to confront the increased aggression shown by Trump.",
      "Carney said that the long-held view that Canada\u2019s geographic location will protect Canadians is becoming increasingly archaic.",
      "European allies and Canada have already been investing heavily in their armed forces, as well as on weapons and ammunition, since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.",

      "LONDON -- The British government on Monday reversed its unpopular plan to end winter home heating subsidies for millions of retirees.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer had signaled the u-turn last month after a loud outcry from the public and some members of his Labour Party who thought the relatively modest 1.5 billion-pound ($2 billion) savings were too politically costly.",
      "Treasury chief Rachel Reeves, who canceled the payment for home heating on all but the poorest retirees after Labour came to power last summer, said the benefit would be restored to 9 million people, or three-quarters of pensioners, in England and Wales whose incomes are below 35,000 pounds ($47,500). Reeves said the move was necessary last year because the previous Conservative government had left public finances in a dire state.",
      "\u201cTargeting winter fuel payments was a tough decision, but the right decision because of the inheritance we had been left by the previous government,\" Reeves said. \u201cIt is also right that we continue to means-test this payment so that it is targeted and fair, rather than restoring eligibility to everyone including the wealthiest.\u201d",
      "The payments are worth between 200 and 300 pounds ($271 and $406) a year. The reversal will cost the government 1.25 billion, Reeve said.",
      "Canceling the payments for most people last winter was blamed for contributing to Starmer's swift decline in popularity after his party came to power in a landslide. He was blamed for punishing elderly people on limited incomes who struggled to make ends meet during a cost-of-living crisis.",
      "Labour fared poorly in local elections in England last month, with many party representatives blaming the removal of the winter fuel payment.",
      "Kemi Badenoch, leader of the main opposition Conservative Party, quickly pounced on Starmer's about-face.",
      "\u201cKeir Starmer has scrambled to clear up a mess of his own making,\" she said. \u201cThis humiliating u-turn will come as scant comfort to the pensioners forced to choose between heating and eating last winter. The prime minister should now apologize for his terrible judgment.\u201d",

      "The crypto industry is seeing growing support from the Democratic Party, though it's far from unanimous",
      "WASHINGTON -- As President Donald Trump builds a crypto empire \u2014 including hosting a private dinner with top investors at his golf club \u2014 Democrats have united in condemning what they call blatant corruption from the White House.",
      "But the Democratic Party\u2019s own relationship with the emerging crypto industry is far less cut and dried.",
      "Work in the Republican-led Senate to legitimize cryptocurrency by adding guardrails has drawn backing from some Democrats, underscoring growing support for the industry in the party. But divisions have opened over the bill, with many demanding it prevent the Republican president and his family from directly profiting from cryptocurrency.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m all on board with the idea of regulating crypto,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. \u201cBut at this moment, when cryptocurrency is being so clearly used by Donald Trump to facilitate his corruption, I don\u2019t think you can close your eyes to that when you\u2019re legislating.\u201d",
      "The legislation is moving ahead more rapidly than Congress usually acts when an industry is new. But the big money and campaign donations flowing from cryptocurrency firms have made them a new powerhouse on the political scene, one that's increasingly gaining allies and capturing the attention of lawmakers.",
      "A look at what to know about the industry's clout and the political fight over what's known as the GENIUS Act:",
      "To understand the growing clout of the crypto industry, look no further than the 2024 election. Fairshake, a crypto super political action committee, and its affiliated PACs spent more than $130 million in congressional races.",
      "Fairshake spent roughly $40 million supporting Republican Bernie Moreno in Ohio in an effort to defeat Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. Brown, who lost to Moreno by more than 3 percentage points, was seen as a chief critic of the industry as the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.",
      "\u201cDC received a clear message that being anti-crypto is a good way to end your career, as it doesn\u2019t represent the will of the voters,\u201d Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, wrote in a social media post the day after the 2024 election.",
      "Coinbase \u2014 the largest crypto exchange in the U.S. and biggest contributor to Fairshake \u2014 does not view support for its industry as partisan, according to Kara Calvert, the company's vice president of U.S. policy. The industry also spent heavily to support Democrats Ruben Gallego and Elissa Slotkin in their races for open Senate seats in battleground states.",
      "Fairshake spent $10 million in support of Slotkin during her successful Senate run against Republican Mike Rodgers, and Slotkin, who won the Michigan race by fewer than 20,000 votes, spoke in favor of crypto on the campaign trail. Slotkin declined to be interviewed.",
      "Similar dynamics are setting up ahead of 2026 in contested House and Senate races. Fairshake said in January that it already had $116 million in cash on hand aimed at the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not slowing down, and everything remains on the table,\u201d Josh Vlasto, a spokesperson for Fairshake, told The Associated Press.",
      "Hours before a May 19 vote to move forward on cryptocurrency legislation in the Senate, an advocacy group tied to Coinbase sent an email to the offices of U.S. senators warning that the vote would count toward their crypto-friendliness scores.",
      "\u201cWhat the spending does is put crypto on the map. It lets members know that this is not a phase, this is real industry, with real dollars, that is developing its hold in Washington,\u201d said Calvert.",
      "A significant number of Democrats, 16, joined Republicans in advancing the crypto legislation. The GENIUS Act would create a new regulatory structure for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency typically pegged to the U.S. dollar. It is viewed as a step toward consumer protections and greater legitimacy for the industry.",
      "The sticking point for many Democrats is that while the bill prohibits members of Congress and their families from profiting off stablecoins, it excludes the president from those restrictions.",
      "Trump, once a skeptic of the industry, has vowed in his second term to make the U.S. the global capital of crypto. Meanwhile, he and his family have moved aggressively into nearly every corner of the industry: mining operations, billion-dollar bitcoin purchases, a newly minted stablecoin and a Trump-branded meme coin.",
      "Days after Trump\u2019s interests in the industry became public in early May, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York urged the Democratic caucus to unite and vote against the package to have a stronger hand in negotiations, according to a person familiar with the matter who insisted on anonymity to discuss private discussions.",
      "On May 8, a bloc of Senate Democrats who had previously backed the GENIUS Act reversed course \u2014 ultimately voting to block the bill from advancing. Negotiations between Senate Democrats and Republicans followed. The White House was also involved, and in contact with senators' offices on both sides of the aisle, according to a senior official granted anonymity to discuss private conversations.",
      "The new version of the bill is now expected to pass the 100-member Senate this month. Amendments are still possible. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. has filed an amendment \u2014 cosponsored by Schumer \u2014 that would bar the president and his family from profiting off stablecoins, though it\u2019s unlikely to pass.",
      "\u201cThere is room for improvements as there often is with a lot of legislation. But with this in particular, we\u2019ve got issues with the president,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona \u201cHaving said that, this was negotiated with Democrats and Republicans. We got to a place. We voted on it. I expect this is the version we\u2019re going to pass.\u201d",
      "Still, the legislation is stirring unease. Schumer, asked if he\u2019s urging members to vote against the bill, noted that he has opposed the legislation and said \u201cthere\u2019s division in our caucus on that issue.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a gaping hole in this bill that everybody sees,\" Murphy said. \"After it\u2019s passed, it will be illegal for me to issue a cryptocurrency, but it\u2019s legal for the president of the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf this bill passes, we kind of go from a dirt road to a paved road,\u201d he said.",
      "If the Senate approves the stablecoin legislation, the bill will still need to clear the House before reaching the president\u2019s desk.",
      "Crypto advocates say the next priority is pushing Congress for market structure legislation, a far more sweeping effort than simply regulating stablecoins.",
      "\u201cStablecoin is one step of the path. Then you need market structure. We're hopeful that the Senate works together to pass something quickly,\u201d Calvert said.",
      "Some Democrats view the legislation as a chance to impose basic guardrails on a rapidly growing industry that's particularly popular among men and younger voters, two groups that drifted from the party in 2024.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate has set an ambitious timeline for passing President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping legislation to cut taxes and spending. But getting it on the Republican president's desk by July 4 will require some big decisions, and soon.",
      "Republican senators are airing concerns about different parts of the legislation, including cuts to Medicaid, changes to food aid and the impact on the deficit. To push the bill to passage, Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota and other negotiators will need to find a compromise that satisfies both ends of their conference \u2014 and that can still satisfy the House, which passed the bill last month by only one vote.",
      "A look at some of the groups and senators who leaders will have to convince as they work to push Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d bill toward a Senate vote:",
      "Every Republican senator represents a state with a rural constituency \u2014 and some of their states are among the most rural in the country. Many in those less-populated areas rely heavily on Medicaid for health care, leading several of them to warn that the changes to the program in the bill could be devastating to communities that are already struggling.",
      "Of particular concern is a freeze on a so-called provider tax that some states use to help pay for large portions of their Medicaid programs. The extra tax often leads to higher payments from the federal government, which critics say is a loophole that allows states to inflate their budgets. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and several others have argued that freezing that tax revenue would hurt rural hospitals, in particular.",
      "\u201cHospitals will close,\u201d Hawley said last month. \u201cIt\u2019s that simple. And that pattern will replicate in states across the country.\u201d",
      "Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville said Thursday that provider taxes in his state are \u201cthe money we use for Medicaid.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou start cutting that out, we\u2019ve got big problems,\u201d Tuberville said. Eliminating those taxes \u201cmight lose some folks.\u201d",
      "At the same time, Republican senators have little interest in a House-passed provision that spends more money by raising a cap on state and local tax deductions, known as SALT. The higher cap traditionally benefits more urban areas in states with high taxes, such as New York and California.",
      "The House included the new cap after New York Republicans threatened to oppose the bill, but Senate Republicans uniformly dislike it. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to have to be some adjustment\u201d on the SALT provision, Thune said Wednesday, noting that \u201csenators are just in a very different place\u201d from the House.",
      "The House-passed bill would also shift some Medicaid and food stamp costs to states, a change that has the former governors in the Senate, in particular, worried.",
      "West Virginia Sen. Jim Justice, who was governor of his state for eight years before his election to the Senate last year, said he favors many aspects of the bill. He supports the new work requirements for Medicaid and food stamp recipients, the restrictions on benefits for immigrants who are in the country illegally and the efforts to cut down on fraud. \u201cThere\u2019s real savings there,\u201d Justice said. \u201cBut then we ought to stop.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re on our way to cannibalizing ourselves,\u201d Justice said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to hurt kids and hurt our families.\u201d",
      "The provision stirring the most unease would shift 5% of administrative costs to the state for administering food stamps \u2014 known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. States that have high error rates in the program would have to take on an even higher percentage of federal costs.",
      "North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, also a former governor, said senators are working to get feedback from current governors and may propose some \u201cincentive-oriented ideas\u201d instead of a penalty for the high error rates.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the states have really looked at the impacts of some of this yet,\u201d Hoeven said.",
      "Tuberville, who is running for governor of Alabama next year, said the program should be reformed instead of shifting costs.",
      "\u201cI know what our budget is and what we can afford, and we can\u2019t start a federal program and then say, \u2018Oh, let\u2019s, let\u2019s send it back to the states and let them take a big hunk of it,\u2019\u201d Tuberville said. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s not the way we do it.\u201d",
      "Thune needs to bring Republican moderates on board with the bill, including Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski. Both have reservations with the Medicaid cuts, among other things.",
      "Collins said she wants to review how the SNAP changes will affect her state. Murkowski has questioned expiring subsidies for the Affordable Care Act and whether they might be needed if people are kicked off Medicaid.",
      "Last month, Murkowski said she wants to make sure that people are not negatively impacted by the bill, \u201cso we\u2019re looking at it through that lens for both Medicaid and on energy.\u201d",
      "Murkowski and Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, John Curtis of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas have also supported energy tax credits that would be phased out quickly under the House bill. The four senators argued that the quick repeal creates uncertainty for businesses and could raise prices for consumers.",
      "Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Mike Lee of Utah and Rick Scott of Florida have argued the legislation does not save enough money and threatened to vote against it.",
      "Paul is considered the least likely to support the measure. He says he won\u2019t vote for it if it raises the debt ceiling \u2014 a key priority for GOP leaders in both the House and the Senate. The package would raise the nation\u2019s debt limit by $4 trillion to allow more borrowing to pay the nation's bills, as the Treasury Department says the limit needs to be raised by the middle of July.",
      "Johnson has been railing against the legislation since it was unveiled in the House, arguing that it does little to reduce government spending over time. He took those arguments to Trump last week at a meeting between the president and members of the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "After the meeting, Johnson said he would continue to argue that the bill needs to do more to cut costs. But he said he came away with the recognition that he needed to be \u201cmore positive\u201d as Trump exerts political pressure on Republicans to pass it.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re a long ways from making the deficit curve bend down, but I recognize that\u2019s going to take time,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe truth is, there are a lot of good things in this bill that I absolutely support. I want it to succeed.\u201d",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- A special judicial committee in Dubai has reportedly ordered the parent company of one of the region's retail giants to restructure its board, trying to end years of turmoil after the death of its billionaire founder and secure the future of the owner of the Mall of the Emirates.",
      "The changes at Majid Al Futtaim come as Dubai tries to guide the family-run businesses that powered the city-state's growth in the United Arab Emirates through generational change. Authorities also likely want to avoid any further infighting that could slow down the growth of a firm that long has made hiring Emiratis a key goal.",
      "The Financial Times first reported on the changes to Majid Al Futtaim's board, saying it came at the orders of a government-established special judicial committee.",
      "In 2022, Dubai\u2019s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, established a special judicial committee to look after the estate of Majid Al Futtaim's founder \u2014 also named Majid Al Futtaim \u2014 following his death in 2021.",
      "Responding to questions Monday from The Associated Press, the company appeared to acknowledge the changes at Majid Al Futtaim Capital, which oversees its group of companies.",
      "The changes \u201creflect a shareholder-led effort to evolve governance in line with the long-term interests of the Group,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThese changes do not affect the operations or governance of Majid Al Futtaim Holding. Majid Al Futtaim continues to operate under an independent board and strong oversight.\u201d",
      "Dubai's government did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Financial Times described Majid Al Futtaim's parent company as now being overseen by five government and four family representatives.",
      "Succession battles aren\u2019t unusual in the United Arab Emirates, where family-run businesses dominate private enterprise. Rulers have given merchant families broad control over different sectors in exchange for the promise of big investments and fast-paced development.",
      "But over the years, that economic strategy has caused headaches for authorities, who have intervened when patriarchs die and tensions between disgruntled relatives boil over.",
      "Majid Al Futtaim is a mainstay of the local consumer economy. It\u2019s also a giant in the broader Gulf Arab region, owning and operating prominent hotels, entertainment venues and shopping malls. Its portfolio includes the Mall of the Emirates, a major tourist draw in Dubai that houses the Middle East\u2019s first-ever indoor ski slope. It also runs regional franchises for global brands, including Lego.",
      "Majid Al Futtaim\u2019s revenues last year topped $9 billion.",
      "As crown prince in the 1990s, Sheikh Mohammed mediated a succession dispute between Al Futtaim, the founder, and a cousin. Al Futtaim used the funds from that settlement to start his namesake company.",

      "BAGHDAD -- Tensions have escalated between Iraq\u2019s central government in Baghdad and the semiautonomous Kurdish region in the country\u2019s north in a long-running dispute over the sharing of oil revenues.",
      "The central government has accused the Kurdish regional authorities of making illegal deals and facilitating oil smuggling. Baghdad cut off funding for public sector salaries in the Kurdish region ahead of the Eid al-Adha holiday. Kurdish authorities called the move \u201ccollective punishment\u201d and threatened to retaliate.",
      "It\u2019s the latest flare-up in a long-running dispute between officials in Baghdad and Irbil, the seat of the Kurdish regional government, over sharing of oil revenues. In 2014, the Kurdish region decided to unilaterally export oil through an independent pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan.",
      "The central government considers it illegal for Irbil to export oil without going through the Iraqi national oil company and filed a case against Turkey in the International Court of Arbitration, arguing that Turkey was violating the provisions of the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline agreement signed in 1973.",
      "Iraq stopped sending oil through the pipeline in March 2023 after the arbitration court ruled in Baghdad\u2019s favor. Attempts to reach a deal to restart exports have repeatedly stalled.",
      "Last month, Prime Minister Masrour Barzani of the Iraqi Kurdish regional government traveled to Washington, where he inked two major energy deals with U.S. companies. The federal government in Baghdad then sued in an Iraqi court, asserting that it was illegal for the regional government to make the deals without going through Baghdad.",
      "The Iraqi Ministry of Finance announced a decision last month to halt funding for salaries of public sector employees in the Kurdish region. The move sparked widespread outrage in Irbil, triggering strong political and public reactions.",
      "The ministry said in a statement that the decision was due to the Kurdish regional authorities\u2019 \u201cfailure to hand over oil and non-oil revenues to the federal treasury, as stipulated in the federal budget laws.\u201d It added that any transfer of funds would be conditional on \u201cthe region\u2019s commitment to transparency and financial accountability.\u201d",
      "The federal Ministry of Oil accused Irbil of failing to deliver crude oil produced in the region\u2019s fields to the ministry for export through the state-run SOMO company, which it said had led to massive financial losses amounting to billions of dollars.",
      "The ministry warned that \u201ccontinued non-compliance jeopardizes Iraq\u2019s international reputation and obligations, forcing the federal government to reduce oil production in other provinces to stay within Iraq\u2019s OPEC quota \u2014 which includes Iraqi Kurdish production, regardless of its legality.\u201d",
      "Baghdad has also accused Irbil of smuggling oil out of the country. An Iraqi official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly said the government had tracked 240 cases of illegal border crossings from Iraq\u2019s Kurdish region into Iran between Dec. 25, 2024, and May 24, 2025, aimed at smuggling oil derivatives.",
      "The Kurdish region\u2019s Ministry of Natural Resources in a statement called those allegations \u201ca smokescreen to distract from widespread corruption and smuggling in other parts of Iraq. The KRG agreed to sell its oil through SOMO, opened an escrow account, and handed over revenues \u2014 yet Baghdad failed to meet its financial obligations.\u201d",
      "It accused the federal government of being responsible for the halt in oil exports via Turkey due to the lawsuit it filed in 2023 and said the Kurdish region had delivered over 11 million barrels of oil to the Ministry of Oil without receiving any financial compensation.",
      "The ministry accused Baghdad of \u201cviolating the constitution and pursuing a deliberate policy of collective punishment and starvation against the people\" of the Kurdish region through the halt in funding for salaries.",
      "Barzani in a statement on the eve of the Eid al-Adha holiday described the withholding of salaries as an \u201cunjust and oppressive decision\u201d and a \u201cpolicy of mass starvation\u201d comparable to the chemical attacks and \u201cgenocide\u201d launched by Iraq\u2019s former longtime strongman ruler, Saddam Hussein, against the Kurds.",
      "The Iraqi Kurdish people \"have resisted with steadfastness and courage in the face of all forms of pressure and tyranny\u201d and \u201cregret was the fate of the tyrants,\" he said.",
      "In the meantime, residents of the Kurdish region feel caught in the middle of the yearslong political dispute once again.",
      "Saman Ali Salah, a public school teacher from the city of Sulaimaniyah, said the salary cutoff comes at a particularly bad time for him \u2014 his daughter was hit by a car 40 days ago and is still in the hospital. He blamed both Baghdad and Irbil for the situation.",
      "\u201cAll the money I had was spent on transportation from the house to the hospital and I haven\u2019t paid my rent for the past two months,\" Salah said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. All I can say is that God will take revenge on these so-called officials on Judgement Day.\u201d",

      "Cybersecurity investigators noticed a highly unusual software crash \u2014 it was affecting a small number of smartphones belonging to people who worked in government, politics, tech and journalism.",
      "The crashes, which began late last year and carried into 2025, were the tipoff to a sophisticated cyberattack that may have allowed hackers to infiltrate a phone without a single click from the user.",
      "The attackers left no clues about their identities, but investigators at the cybersecurity firm iVerify noticed that the victims all had something in common: They worked in fields of interest to China's government and had been targeted by Chinese hackers in the past.",
      "Foreign hackers have increasingly identified smartphones, other mobile devices and the apps they use as a weak link in U.S. cyberdefenses. Groups linked to China's military and intelligence service have targeted the smartphones of prominent Americans and burrowed deep into telecommunication networks, according to national security and tech experts.",
      "It shows how vulnerable mobile devices and apps are and the risk that security failures could expose sensitive information or leave American interests open to cyberattack, those experts say.",
      "\u201cThe world is in a mobile security crisis right now,\u201d said Rocky Cole, a former cybersecurity expert at the National Security Agency and Google and now chief operations officer at iVerify. \u201cNo one is watching the phones.\u201d",

      "\u201cThey were able to listen in on phone calls in real time and able to read text messages,\u201d said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois. He is a member of the House Intelligence Committee and the senior Democrat on the Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, created to study the geopolitical threat from China.",
      "Chinese hackers also sought access to phones used by Donald Trump and running mate JD Vance during the 2024 campaign.",
      "The Chinese government has denied allegations of cyberespionage, and accused the U.S. of mounting its own cyberoperations. It says America cites national security as an excuse to issue sanctions against Chinese organizations and keep Chinese technology companies from the global market.",

      "U.S. intelligence officials have said China poses a significant, persistent threat to U.S. economic and political interests, and it has harnessed the tools of digital conflict: online propaganda and disinformation, artificial intelligence and cyber surveillance and espionage designed to deliver a significant advantage in any military conflict.",
      "Mobile networks are a top concern. The U.S. and many of its closest allies have banned Chinese telecom companies from their networks. Other countries, including Germany, are phasing out Chinese involvement because of security concerns. But Chinese tech firms remain a big part of the systems in many nations, giving state-controlled companies a global footprint they could exploit for cyberattacks, experts say.",

      "Mobile devices can buy stocks, launch drones and run power plants. Their proliferation has often outpaced their security.",

      "It\u2019s unclear how the person obtained Wiles\u2019 connections, but they apparently gained access to the contacts in her personal cellphone, The Wall Street Journal reported. The messages and calls were not coming from Wiles\u2019 number, the newspaper reported.",
      "While most smartphones and tablets come with robust security, apps and connected devices often lack these protections or the regular software updates needed to stay ahead of new threats. That makes every fitness tracker, baby monitor or smart appliance another potential foothold for hackers looking to penetrate networks, retrieve information or infect systems with malware.",

      "U.S.-China trade talks in London this week are expected to take up a series of disputes that have buffeted relations",
      "BEIJING -- U.S.-China trade talks in London this week are expected to take up a series of fresh disputes that have buffeted relations, threatening a fragile truce over tariffs.",
      "Both sides agreed in Geneva last month to a 90-day suspension of most of the 100%-plus tariffs they had imposed on each other in an escalating trade war that had sparked fears of recession.",
      "Since then, the U.S. and China have exchanged angry words over advanced semiconductors that power artificial intelligence, \u201crare earths\u201d that are vital to carmakers and other industries, and visas for Chinese students at American universities.",
      "President Donald Trump spoke at length with Chinese leader Xi Jinping by phone last Thursday in an attempt to put relations back on track. Trump announced on social media the next day that trade talks would be held on Monday in London.",
      "The latest frictions began just a day after the May 12 announcement of the Geneva agreement to \u201cpause\u201d tariffs for 90 days.",
      "The U.S. Commerce Department issued guidance saying the use of Ascend AI chips from Huawei, a leading Chinese tech company, could violate U.S. export controls. That's because the chips were likely developed with American technology despite restrictions on its export to China, the guidance said.",
      "The Chinese government wasn't pleased. One of its biggest beefs in recent years has been over U.S. moves to limit the access of Chinese companies to technology, and in particular to equipment and processes needed to produce the most advanced semiconductors.",
      "\"The Chinese side urges the U.S. side to immediately correct its erroneous practices,\u201d a Commerce Ministry spokesperson said.",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick wasn't in Geneva but will join the talks in London. Analysts say that suggests at least a willingness on the U.S. side to hear out China's concerns on export controls.",
      "One area where China holds the upper hand is in the mining and processing of rare earths. They are crucial for not only autos but also a range of other products from robots to military equipment.",
      "The Chinese government started requiring producers to obtain a license to export seven rare earth elements in April. Resulting shortages sent automakers worldwide into a tizzy. As stockpiles ran down, some worried they would have to halt production.",
      "Trump, without mentioning rare earths specifically, took to social media to attack China.",
      "\u201cThe bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US,\u201d Trump posted on May 30.",
      "The Chinese government indicated Saturday that it is addressing the concerns, which have come from European companies as well. A Commerce Ministry statement said it had granted some approvals and \u201cwill continue to strengthen the approval of applications that comply with regulations.\u201d",
      "The scramble to resolve the rare earth issue shows that China has a strong card to play if it wants to strike back against tariffs or other measures.",
      "Student visas don't normally figure in trade talks, but a U.S. announcement that it would begin revoking the visas of some Chinese students has emerged as another thorn in the relationship.",
      "China's Commerce Ministry raised the issue when asked last week about the accusation that it had violated the consensus reached in Geneva.",
      "It replied that the U.S. had undermined the agreement by issuing export control guidelines for AI chips, stopping the sale of chip design software to China and saying it would revoke Chinese student visas.",
      "\u201cThe United States has unilaterally provoked new economic and trade frictions,\u201d the ministry said in a statement posted on its website.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a May 28 statement that the United States would \u201caggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.\u201d",
      "More than 270,000 Chinese students studied in the U.S. in the 2023-24 academic year.",

      "A new study that examined five years\u2019 worth of prices at one U.S. grocery chain found that digital price tags haven\u2019t led to demand-based pricing surges",
      "Digital price labels, which are rapidly replacing paper shelf tags at U.S. supermarkets, haven\u2019t led to demand-based pricing surges, according to a new study that examined five years' worth of prices at one grocery chain.",
      "But some shoppers, consumer advocates and lawmakers remain skeptical about the tiny electronic screens, which let stores change prices instantly from a central computer instead of having workers swap out paper labels by hand.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s corporations vs. the humans, and that chasm between us goes further and further,\u201d said Dan Gallant, who works in sports media in Edmonton, Canada. Gallant's local Loblaws supermarket recently switched to digital labels.",
      "Social media is filled with warnings that grocers will use the technology to charge more for ice cream if it\u2019s hot outside, hike the price of umbrellas if it\u2019s raining or to gather information about customers.",
      "Democratic U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania fired off a letter to Kroger last fall demanding to know whether it would use its electronic labels as part of a dynamic pricing strategy.",
      "Lawmakers in Rhode Island and Maine have introduced bills to limit the use of digital labels. In Arizona, Democratic state Rep. Cesar Aguilar recently introduced a bill that would ban them altogether.",
      "The bill hasn\u2019t gotten a hearing, but Aguilar said he\u2019s determined to start a conversation about digital labels and how stores could abuse them.",
      "\u201cGrocery stores study when people go shopping the most. And so you might be able to see a price go down one day and then go up another day,\u201d Aguilar told The Associated Press.",
      "Researchers say those fears are misplaced. A study published in late May found \u201cvirtually no surge pricing\u201d before or after electronic shelf labels were adopted. The study was authored by Ioannis Stamatopoulos of the University of Texas, Austin, Robert Evan Sanders of the University of California, San Diego and Robert Bray of Northwestern University",
      "The researchers looked at prices between 2019 and 2024 at an unnamed grocery chain than began using digital labels in October 2022. They found that temporary price increases affected 0.005% of products on any given day before electronic shelf labels were introduced, a share that increased by only 0.0006 percentage points after digital labels were installed.",
      "The study also determined that discounts were slightly more common after digital labels were introduced.",
      "Economists have long wondered why grocery prices don\u2019t change more often, according to Stamatopoulos. If bananas are about to expire, for example, it makes sense to lower the price on them. He said the cost of having workers change prices by hand could be one issue.",
      "But there\u2019s another reason: Shoppers watch grocery prices closely, and stores don\u2019t want to risk angering them.",
      "\u201cSelling groceries is not selling a couch. It\u2019s not a one-time transaction and you will never see them again,\u201d Stamatopoulos said. \u201cYou want them coming to the store every week.\u201d",
      "Electronic price labels aren\u2019t new. They\u2019ve been in use for more than a decade at groceries in Europe and some U.S. retailers, like Kohl's.",
      "But they\u2019ve been slow to migrate to U.S. grocery stores. Only around 5% to 10% of U.S. supermarkets now have electronic labels, compared to 80% in Europe, said Amanda Oren, vice president of industry strategy for North American grocery at Relex Solutions, a technology company that helps retailers forecast demand.",
      "Oren said cost is one issue that has slowed the U.S. rollout. The tiny screens cost between $5 and $20, Oren said, but every product a store sells needs one, and the average supermarket has 100,000 or more individual products.",
      "Still, the U.S. industry is charging ahead. Walmart, the nation's largest grocer and retailer, hopes to have digital price labels at 2,300 U.S. stores by 2026. Kroger is expanding the use of digital labels this year after testing them at 20 stores. Whole Foods is testing the labels in nearly 50 stores.",
      "Companies say electronic price labels have tremendous advantages. Walmart says it used to take employees two days to change paper price labels on the 120,000 items it has in a typical store. With digital tags, it takes a few minutes.",
      "The labels can also be useful. Some have codes shoppers can scan to see recipes or nutrition information. Instacart has a system in thousands of U.S. stores, including Aldi and Schnucks, that flashes a light on the digital tag when Instacart shoppers are nearby to help them find products.",
      "Ahold Delhaize\u2019s Albert Heijn supermarket chain in the Netherlands and Belgium has been testing an artificial intelligence-enabled tool since 2022 that marks down prices on its digital labels every 15 minutes for products nearing expiration. The system has reduced more than 250 tons of food waste annually, the company said.",
      "But Warren and Casey are skeptical. In their letter to Kroger, the U.S. senators noted a partnership with Microsoft that planned to put cameras in grocery aisles and offer personalized deals to shoppers depending on their gender and age.",
      "In its response, Kroger said the prices shown on its digital labels were not connected to any sort of facial recognition technology. It also denied surging prices during periods of peak demand.",
      "\u201cKroger\u2019s business model is built on a foundation of lowering prices to attract more customers,\u201d the company said.",
      "Aguilar, the Arizona lawmaker, said he also opposes the transition to digital labels because he thinks they will cost jobs. His constituents have pointed out that grocery prices keep rising even though there are fewer workers in checkout lanes, he said.",
      "\u201cThey are supposed to be part of our community, and that means hiring people from our community that fill those jobs,\" Aguilar said.",
      "But Relex Solutions' Oren said she doesn't think cutting labor costs is the main reason stores deploy digital price tags.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about working smarter, not harder, and being able to use that labor in better ways across the store rather than these very mundane, repetitive tasks,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "The tax cuts in President Donald Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill would likely gouge a $2.4 trillion hole in the federal budget",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014",
      "The tax cuts in President Donald Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill Act would likely gouge a hole in the federal budget.",
      "The president has a patch handy, though: his sweeping import taxes \u2014 tariffs.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office, the government\u2019s nonpartisan arbiter of tax and spending matters, says the One Big Beautiful Bill, passed by the House last month and now under consideration in the Senate, would increase federal budget deficits by $2.4 trillion over the next decade. That is because its tax cuts would drain the government\u2019s coffers faster than its spending cuts would save money.",
      "By bringing in revenue for the Treasury, on the other hand, the tariffs that Trump announced through May 13 \u2014 including his so-called reciprocal levies of up to 50% on countries with which the United States has a trade deficit \u2014 would offset the budget impact of the tax-cut bill and reduce deficits over the next decade by $2.5 trillion.",
      "So it\u2019s basically a wash.",
      "That\u2019s the budget math anyway. The real answer is more complicated.",
      "Actually using tariffs to finance a big chunk of the federal government would be a painful and perilous undertaking, budget wonks say. \u201cIt\u2019s a very dangerous way to try to raise revenue,\u201d said Kent Smetters of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Penn Wharton Budget Model, who served in President George W. Bush\u2019s Treasury Department.",
      "Trump has long advocated tariffs as an economic elixir. He says they can protect American industries, bring factories back to the United States, give him leverage to win concessions over foreign governments \u2014 and raise a lot of money. He\u2019s even suggested that they could replace the federal income tax, which now brings in about half of federal revenue.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s possible we\u2019ll do a complete tax cut,\u2019\u2019 he told reporters in April. \u201cI think the tariffs will be enough to cut all of the income tax.\u2019\u2019",
      "Economists and budget analysts do not share the president\u2019s enthusiasm for using tariffs to finance the government or to replace other taxes. \u201cIt\u2019s a really bad trade,\u2019\u2019 said Erica York, the Tax Foundation\u2019s vice president of federal tax policy. \u201cIt\u2019s perhaps the dumbest tax reform you could design.\u2019\u2019",
      "For one thing, Trump\u2019s tariffs are an unstable source of revenue. He bypassed Congress and imposed his biggest import tax hikes through executive orders. That means a future president could simply reverse them.",
      "\u201cOr political whims in Congress could change, and they could decide, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going revoke this authority because we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good thing that the president can just unilaterally impose a $2 trillion tax hike,\u2019 \u2019\u2019 York said.",
      "Or the courts could kill his tariffs before Congress or future presidents do. A federal court in New York has already struck down the centerpiece of his tariff program \u2014 the reciprocal and other levies he announced on what he called \u201cLiberation Day\u2019\u2019 April 2 \u2014 saying he\u2019d overstepped his authority. An appeals court has allowed the government to keep collecting the levies while the legal challenge winds its way through the court system.",
      "Economists also say that tariffs damage the economy. They are a tax on foreign products, paid by importers in the United States and usually passed along to their customers via higher prices. They raise costs for U.S. manufacturers that rely on imported raw materials, components and equipment, making them less competitive than foreign rivals that don\u2019t have to pay Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "Tariffs also invite retaliatory taxes on U.S. exports by foreign countries. Indeed, the European Union this week threatened \u201ccountermeasures\u2019\u2019 against Trump\u2019s unexpected move to raise his tariff on foreign steel and aluminum to 50%.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not just getting the effect of a tax on the U.S. economy,\u201d York said. \u201cYou\u2019re also getting the effect of foreign taxes on U.S. exports.\u2019\u2019",
      "She said the tariffs will basically wipe out all economic benefits from the One Big Beautiful Bill's tax cuts.",
      "Smetters at the Penn Wharton Budget Model said that tariffs also isolate the United States and discourage foreigners from investing in its economy.",
      "Foreigners see U.S. Treasurys as a super-safe investment and now own about 30% of the federal government\u2019s debt. If they cut back, the federal government would have to pay higher interest rates on Treasury debt to attract a smaller number of potential investors domestically.",
      "Higher borrowing costs and reduced investment would wallop the economy, making tariffs the most economically destructive tax available, Smetters said \u2014 more than twice as costly in reduced economic growth and wages as what he sees as the next-most damaging: the tax on corporate earnings.",
      "Tariffs also hit the poor hardest. They end up being a tax on consumers, and the poor spend more of their income than wealthier people do.",
      "Even without the tariffs, the One Big Beautiful Bill slams the poorest because it makes deep cuts to federal food programs and to Medicaid, which provides health care to low-income Americans. After the bill\u2019s tax and spending cuts, an analysis by the Penn Wharton Budget Model found, the poorest fifth of American households earning less than $17,000 a year would see their incomes drop by $820 next year. The richest 0.1% earning more than $4.3 million a year would come out ahead by $390,070 in 2026.",
      "\u201cIf you layer a regressive tax increase like tariffs on top of that, you make a lot of low- and middle-income households substantially worse off,\u2019\u2019 said the Tax Foundation\u2019s York.",
      "Overall, she said, tariffs are \u201ca very unreliable source of revenue for the legal reasons, the political reasons as well as the economic reasons. They\u2019re a very, very inefficient way to raise revenue. If you raise a dollar of a revenue with tariffs, that\u2019s going to cause a lot more economic harm than raising revenue any other way.\u2019\u2019",

      "A year from the largest World Cup ever, there has been no announcement on general ticket sales, prices for most seats, location of a draw and security arrangements as FIFA mostly avoids disclosing details of an event set for 16 stadiums across the Unit...",
      "NEW YORK -- A year from the largest World Cup ever, there has been no announcement on general ticket sales, prices for most seats, location of a draw or security arrangements as FIFA has mostly avoided disclosing details of an event set for 16 stadiums across the United States, Mexico and Canada.",
      "There is uncertainty about whether fans from some nations will be welcome \u2014 11 of the venues are located in the U.S., where all matches will be played from the quarterfinals on.",
      "Security is a concern, too. At the last major soccer tournament in the U.S., the 2024 Copa America final at Miami Gardens, Florida, started 82 minutes late after spectators breached security gates.",
      "\u201cThat was certainly a reminder and a wake-up call if anybody needed it that those types of things are going to be used in terms of the ultimate assessment of whether this World Cup is successful,\" said former U.S. defender Alexi Lalas, now Fox's lead soccer analyst.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump's travel ban on citizens from 12 nations exempted athletes, coaches, staff and relatives while not mentioning fans. Vice President JD Vance made what could be interpreted as a warning on May 6.",
      "\u201cOf course everybody is welcome to come and see this incredible event. I know we\u2019ll have visitors probably from close to 100 countries. We want them to come. We want them to celebrate. We want them to watch the game,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when the time is up they\u2019ll have to go home. Otherwise they\u2019ll have to talk to Secretary Noem,\u201d he added, speaking alongside Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem.",
      "The 1994 World Cup sparked the launch of Major League Soccer with 12 teams in 1996, and $50 million in World Cup profits seeded the U.S. Soccer Foundation, tasked with developing the sport\u2019s growth. MLS now has 30 teams, plays in 22 soccer specific stadiums and has club academies to grow the sport and improve talent.",
      "Next year\u2019s tournament will include 104 games, up from 64 from 1998 through 2022, and the 11 U.S. stadiums are all NFL homes with lucrative luxury suites and club seating. It also will be the first World Cup run by FIFA without a local organizing committee.",
      "\u201cThe legacy initiative of 2026 is around how we ensure that soccer is everywhere in this county,\" U.S. Soccer Federation CEO JT Batson said. \"How do we ensure that every American can walk, ride their bike or take public transit to a safe place to play soccer? How do we make it to where every school in America has soccer accessible to their students? And how do we make it to wherever every American can truly see themselves in the game?\u201d",
      "Interest in soccer has vastly increased in the U.S., with England's Premier League averaging 510,000 viewers per match window on NBC's networks last season and the European Champions League final drawing more than 2 million viewers in each of the past five years on CBS. However, CBS broadcast just 26 of 189 Champions League matches on TV in 2024-25 and streamed the rest.",
      "MLS drew about 12.2 million fans last year, second to 14.7 million in 2023-24 for the Premier League's 20 teams, but MLS has largely disappeared from broadcast TV since starting a 10-year contract with Apple TV+ in 2023. Apple spokesman Sam Citron said the company does not release viewer figures.",
      "In a fractured television landscape, different deals were negotiated by FIFA, UEFA, MLS, the NWSL, the USSF and the five major European leagues.",
      "\u201cYou basically have over 2,800 game windows per season aired in the United States and so that requires distribution largely on streaming platforms like Paramount+ or ESPN+, but it's difficult for new fan adoption and it makes reach kind of challenging,\u201d said Gerry Cardinale, managing partner of RedBird Capital Partners, which holds controlling interests in AC Milan and Toulouse and owns a non-controlling stake of Fenway Sports Group, parent of Liverpool. \u201cKids today are getting weaned on Premier League football and Serie A football, and when you watch that as a product, it\u2019s hard for MLS to compete.\u201d",
      "The 1994 World Cup, a 24-nation tournament, drew a record 3.58 million fans for 52 matches. Ticket prices ranged from $25-$75 for most first round games and $180-$475 for the final at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.",
      "FIFA, which has about 800 people working at an office in Coral Gables, Florida, says it will announce information on general tickets in the third quarter. It wouldn't say whether prices will be fixed or variable.",
      "Hospitality packages are available on FIFA's website through On Location. For the eight matches at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, including the final on July 19, prices range from $25,800 to $73,200 per person.",
      "FIFA appears to be using variable pricing for this year's Club World Cup, played at 12 U.S. stadiums from June 14 to July 13, and some prices repeatedly have been slashed. Marriott Bonvoy, a U.S. Soccer Federation partner, has been offering free tickets to some of its elite members.",
      "Asked about Club World Cup ticket sales and team base camp arrangements, Manolo Zubiria, the World Cup\u2019s chief tournament officer, hung up four minutes and five questions into a telephone interview with The Associated Press. Brendan O\u2019Connell, the publicist who arranged the interview, wrote in an email to the AP: \u201cThe guest was not prepared for those questions.\u201d",
      "FIFA's media relations staff would not make FIFA president Gianni Infantino available to discuss the tournament.",
      "Ahead of the 1994 World Cup, FIFA announced in May 1992 the draw would take place at Las Vegas on Dec. 18 or 19, 1993. FIFA has not revealed plans for this year's draw but appears to be planning for Las Vegas on Dec. 5.",
      "Regular ticket sales began in February 1993 for the U.S. soccer family and general first- and second-round sales started that June. Fans submitted lottery applications in October 1993 for games from the quarterfinals on.",
      "While not detailing ticketing plans for next year's tournament, FIFA is spreading it beyond the host cites and lists about 60 possible base camps for teams to use, paired with hotels. Some are fancy \u2014 The Greenbrier Resort in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia \u2014 and some more Spartan \u2014 the Courtyard by Marriott Mesa at Wrigleyville West in Arizona.",
      "Thousands of arrangements must be coordinated. Major League Baseball is drawing up its schedule to ensure that the four teams whose ballparks share parking lots with World Cup stadiums \u2014 in Arlington, Texas; Kansas City, Missouri; Philadelphia; and Seattle \u2014 won\u2019t play home games on the dates of tournament matches.",
      "Boris Gartner, CEO of La Liga North America, a joint venture of the Spanish soccer league and Relevent Sports, said the 2026 World Cup should be viewed as just another step in the sport's long-term growth in the United States.",
      "\u201cIf you have a clear understanding of the market and the audience, a clear understanding of the value that these properties bring to media companies, and you mix content with a commercial strategy, with the right media distribution strategy, this is something that will continue to grow over the next two decades,\" he said. \u201cIf more people are watching the NWSL, more people are going to be interested in soccer that could potentially end up watching a Bundesliga game or La Liga game.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The wheels came off for the Edmonton Oilers in their 6-1 loss to the Florida Panthers in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final",
      "SUNRISE, Fla. -- Falling behind early, parading to the penalty box and losing grip of their composure, the Edmonton Oilers find themselves in an all-too-familiar position: trailing the Stanley Cup Final against the Florida Panthers.",
      "Not much went right for them in Game 3 on Monday night, a 6-1 blowout loss that put them down 2-1 in the series after taking the opener at home. Many of their 85 penalty minutes, the most by a team in the final in nearly four decades, came in garbage time, but there is far more concern about the mistakes that piled up to put them in a hole.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t play very well,\u201d said Evander Kane, who was whistled for two of his three minor penalties in a miserable first period and got a misconduct late. \"That\u2019s evident. We have nobody to blame but ourselves. We can definitely be a lot better.\u201d",
      "Stuart Skinner got pulled after allowing five goals on 23 shots, but captain Connor McDavid acknowledged, \u201cI don\u2019t know how much we\u2019re going to put on Stu.\u201d The play in front of him was disjointed and disconnected, at 5 on 5, on the power play and on the penalty kill.",
      "If not for Skinner, the score could have gotten out of hand much earlier because the Western Conference champions had their worst showing since perhaps the first couple of games of the playoffs.",
      "\u201cIt was a weird game,\u201d McDavid said. \u201cObviously it wasn\u2019t our best \u2014 not our best at all. I don\u2019t think our best has shown up all series long. But it\u2019s coming. We\u2019ll shift the focus to finding a way to get a win in Game 4.\u201d",
      "Even with an extra day off before Game 4 on Thursday night, coach Kris Knoblauch scheduled practice for his team Tuesday afternoon. There is much to discuss and work on.",
      "\u201cCollectively, goaltender, defense, all our forwards, we all have to be better,\u201d Knoblauch said. \"They played a heck of a game, and we\u2019re going to have to raise ours.\u201d",
      "Being more disciplined is a good place to start.",
      "After giving up a goal to Brad Marchand 56 seconds in, Edmonton took four minor penalties in the first period. The dam eventually broke on a power-play goal that made it too tough a deficit to overcome.",
      "\u201cAlmost half the period you\u2019re killing, so it\u2019s not a good way to get into your game,\u201d McDavid said. \"Never got to our game.\u201d",
      "The Oilers' play was almost indistinguishable from how they've looked for much of this run, getting balanced scoring and star performances from McDavid and Draisaitl. Ill-timed defensive breakdowns proved costly, and guys lost their cool \u2014 like Jake Walman squirting water at Panthers players on their bench from his place on the visiting side.",
      "\u201cI obviously did that for a reason,\u201d Walman said, reluctant to explain why. \u201cIt\u2019s just gamesmanship, I guess.\u201d",
      "By the time brawls ensued in the third period, the game was out of hand. Players downplayed the margin of defeat, quick to try to spin their thoughts forward to what they need to do to tie the final.",
      "\u201cWe know what we\u2019re going to be up against,\u201d Skinner said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change how we\u2019re going to respond again. We\u2019ve got two days to come back and I think there\u2019s some things that we\u2019re going to have to change.\u201d",
      "That could mean lineup changes and certainly some major adjustments by Knoblauch and his staff. The Oilers also need to be better prepared to play in Game 4, perhaps channeling the pain from back-to-back losses.",
      "\u201cLosing in the playoffs, whether it\u2019s in round 1 Game 1 or the Stanley Cup Final, it\u2019s never a good feeling, but we\u2019ve been here before,\" Kane said. \"We\u2019ve been down in series before, and we\u2019ve had tough losses. It will sting right now and we\u2019ll flush it tomorrow and get ready for Thursday.\u201d",

      "Otto Kemp went undrafted out of Point Loma Nazarene University in California",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- Otto Kemp wandered alone for about 20 minutes in his first trip to Citizens Bank Park \u2014 \u201cpeople were (like) what is this guy doing in this place?\u201d \u2014 when he spotted Phillies catcher J.T. Realmuto. Hours before Realmuto would score the winning run in an extra-innings comeback \u2014 a run set-up in large part by Kemp's bunt single in the two-run rally \u2014 he found the rookie and showed him the way to the clubhouse.",
      "\u201cI kind of walked with him and let him take me,\u201d Kemp said, laughing. \u201cJust trying to enjoy it. Get the lay of the land. Every clubhouse is different. Enjoy the day. Enjoy the moment.\u201d",
      "Kemp's improbable rise from undrafted Division II prospect out of Point Loma Nazarene University in California to signing a free-agent minor-league deal with the Phillies in 2022 through four minor-league stops finally brought him Monday night for the first time to Citizens Bank Park.",
      "Not as a fan such as reliever Orion Kerkering, who had to scrounge for upper deck tickets as a prospect to watch the 2022 World Series. Or even former Phillies pitcher Tyler Phillips, who practically grew up at the ballpark as a diehard fan of the team.",
      "Kemp saved his first trip to the ballpark for when he finally made the major leagues.",
      "\u201cI just tried to keep it special,\u201d he said. \u201cI just tried to keep it something that I get to do on the first day I get to the big leagues. It was kind of just a little bit of motivation to keep me pushing and get to this point.\u201d",
      "The 25-year-old Kemp's push took him first to Pittsburgh when he was called up Saturday from Triple-A Lehigh Valley with slugger Bryce Harper on the injured list. Kemp made his third straight start Monday night, this one against the Chicago Cubs and he finished a sparkling 3 for 5 with an error, his first career hit and run scored.",
      "Kemp said he hadn\u2019t bunted since he played collegiate summer baseball for the St. Cloud Rox in 2021.",
      "\u201cI popped it up straight to the catcher,\u201d he said with a laugh.",
      "The seemingly lost art in baseball came right back to Kemp. It certainly helped that he told the Phillies coaching staff over the weekend that, yes, he could in fact bunt.",
      "Realmuto made it 3-all when he drove in the automatic runner with a single off Cubs reliever Daniel Palencia.",
      "The Phillies then improbably got two straight bunt singles, the first from Bryson Stott \u2014 a late-inning replacement after he was benched amid a 2-for-24 slump \u2014and then from Kemp, who had the third of his first three big league hits in the game to set up the clutch swing from Marsh.",
      "Marsh \u2014 batting just .228 on the season \u2014 delivered a 381-foot single to center that scored Realmuto for the 4-3 victory and snapped the Phillies' five game losing streak. Marsh, a fan-favorite with his stringy hair and ZZ Top-esque beard, said it was the first walk-off winner of his career at any level of baseball.",
      "Kemp singled in the fifth for his first hit \u2014 he said he would frame the baseball \u2014 and scurried to third on Cubs starter Matthew Boyd\u2019s errant pickoff attempt. Kemp scored on Weston Wilson\u2019s RBI single for a 2-1 lead.",
      "Kemp's surprise call-up at around 11 p.m. Friday night in Charlotte, North Carolina, where the Iron Pigs played turned into a whirlwind trip for him and his family and friends. Kemp had an early morning flight on Saturday to Pittsburgh while his wife and dog drove from North Carolina and his parents scrambled to find a red-eye from California and made it to the game just in time.",
      "Kemp had his wife, his dad, three friends and his Point Loma college baseball coach Justin James and his family and friends at the game Monday for the home debut.",
      "\u201cIt's cool to execute that bunt and get it down and thank him for raising me in a West Coast baseball program,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cHe's stoked. He's just so fired up. Just to see me in that moment and out on that field, it's cool for him to see one of his products and how he helped me get to this point.\u201d",
      "Phillies manager Rob Thomson said Kemp could play first base and even the outfield the longer he stays in the major leagues. Kemp played all over the field this season at Triple-A with 33 starts at third base, 17 combined starts at second and first base and seven starts in the outfield. It was all enough to impress Thomson and the Phillies front office.",

      "Atlanta's Ozzie Albies got his 1,000th career hit when he singled to left in the eighth inning.",
      "The second game of this series Tuesday is a matchup of right-handers, with Grant Holmes (3-4, 3.99 ERA) starting for Atlanta and Quinn Priester (3-2, 3.88) pitching for Milwaukee.",

    "story": [
      "The Boston Red Sox called up top prospect Roman Anthony two days after the 21-year-old outfielder hit a 497-foot grand slam for Triple-A Worcester",
      "BOSTON -- Roman Anthony was in Worcester, waiting for the 275-mile bus ride that would take him to Allentown, Pennsylvania, for his next Triple-A game, when WooSox manager Chad Tracy told the team their departure would be delayed because someone might need to head an hour east to Boston instead.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t really think anything of it, to be honest,\u201d Anthony told reporters in the Red Sox dugout at Fenway Park before making his major league debut in Boston's 10-8, 11-inning loss to Tampa Bay on Monday night.",
      "\u201cI was just kind of waiting around in the food room with a few of the guys, and then all of a sudden he came out and just said, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re going to the big leagues,\u2019\u201d Anthony said. \u201cFrom there on out it\u2019s kind of been a little bit of a blur. But it was amazing. You dream of that every single day. So, to finally hear it was definitely awesome.\u201d",
      "Anthony, who played right field and batted fifth, received the biggest cheer of all during pregame introductions and then a standing ovation from the crowd of 31,422 when he came to bat in the second inning, with a runner on first and nobody out. He popped up to left field and got another cheer as he returned to the dugout.",
      "In the third, he may have been robbed of his first major league hit when he lined a ball up the middle that hit pitcher Shane Baz \u2014 at 111 mph. It deflected to the third baseman, who made the throw to first for the out. Anthony also struck out looking with runners on first and second in the third and walked in the seventh.",
      "In the ninth, with the crowd again on its feet, he came up with runners on second and third and hit a hard bouncer up the middle for an RBI groundout. He was due to lead off the 11th, but manager Alex Cora pinch-hit for him against left-hander Ian Seymour.",
      "\u201cIt was nice to finally take the field, forget about all the outside noise and just be able to take the field with the guys,\" he told reporters afterward. \"Unfortunate we couldn't get a win, but it was a good experience \u2014 good to just get the first one over with.\u201d",
      "Anthony fielded two balls easily in right field \u2014 a pair of singles in the fourth inning \u2014 but in the fifth he let a rolling ball go under his glove for a two-base error that led to an unearned run, giving Tampa a 3-0 lead.",
      "\u201cIt just can't happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's tough when you lose a game like that, you feel like that's the reason we lost \u2014 little things like that. Just got to learn from it and be better.\u201d",
      "A 21-year-old second-round draft pick who went viral over the weekend when he hit a 497-foot grand slam in Worcester, Anthony was the top-rated prospect in the minors before his call-up. He batted .288 with 10 homers and 29 RBIs in 58 games in Triple-A this season.",
      "His accomplishments in the minors had Red Sox fans clamoring for his call-up, especially with the team languishing in fourth place in the AL East, 8 1/2 games behind the rival New York Yankees. But while fellow prospects Kristian Campbell and Marcelo Mayer got the call, the Red Sox remained patient on Anthony until an injury to Wilyer Abreu left them needing another outfielder.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming,\u201d said Mayer, who was called up about two weeks ago. \u201cIt\u2019s been talked about for a very long time, and it\u2019s kind of crazy that today\u2019s the day that we\u2019re all going to share the field together in the big leagues. I\u2019m super excited. I think we have a really good team, and he\u2019s just another great addition to that.\u201d",
      "Cora said he noticed something was wrong with Abreu after Sunday\u2019s game against the Yankees. When the team realized it would be more than a day or two, they decided to make the move and put Abreu on the 10-day injured list with a left oblique strain. The Red Sox made room for Anthony on the 40-man roster by designating first baseman/outfielder Ryan Noda for assignment.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to win ballgames,\u201d Cora said. \u201cThe kid has done an amazing job getting ready for this moment. We\u2019re excited. It\u2019s a big day for the organization.\u201d",
      "Anthony was perhaps known only to the most dedicated fans before his homer on Saturday that was the longest measured this year by Statcast, which tracks the major leagues, Triple-A and the Class A Florida State League. Since Statcast started tracking in the majors in 2015, only five home runs have gone farther, including Nomar Mazara's 505-foot shot in 2019 for the Rangers.",
      "After getting the promotion, Anthony had time to call his parents and siblings and an old baseball coach and gather most of his equipment \u2014 his own glove, a single bat and a borrowed pair of cleats \u2014 before driving down the MassPike to Boston. He arrived in Boston a few hours before game time and by 7:30 p.m. he was taking aim at the historic red seat that marks Ted Williams\u2019 502-foot homer that is the longest ever at Fenway Park.",
      "\u201cIt happened quick. I think no matter when that call comes, nobody\u2019s really expecting it,\" he said before the game. \u201cObviously a little bit of a short notice. But, you know, better than being on the bus to Lehigh Valley right now.\u201d",

      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- A.J. Greer is back in for the Florida Panthers in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Final on Monday night after missing the first two in the series against the Edmonton Oilers because of injury.",
      "Coach Paul Maurice confirmed Greer would return on Florida\u2019s fourth line. Jesper Boqvist comes out of the lineup to make room for Greer, who will be making his first career appearance in the final.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a dream come true, but I\u2019m not really trying to focus on that,\u201d Greer said after the team's morning skate. \u201cIt\u2019s another game for me and I\u2019m just trying to enjoy it, but I\u2019m not trying to associate anything bigger than just my next shift, really.\u201d",
      "Greer, 28, gutted through injury for part of this playoff run before exiting in the Eastern Conference final against Carolina when it was clear he wasn't healthy enough to stay in. Maurice lauded Greer for his lack of selfishness and an abundance of self-awareness to understand when the pain threshold was reached and do what's best for the team.",
      "\u201cGood on him for recognizing that,\u201d Maurice said. \u201cWe were fortunate that we were able to heal A.J. to a place that he\u2019s really confident in what he\u2019s doing. ... He\u2019s been such a positive part of what we do.\u201d",
      "Greer almost wasn't here at all. A little over four years ago, he was languishing in the minors and almost giving up on his NHL dream.",
      "\u201cI was pretty much 24 hours away from just calling it, going to Europe and trying to just get a paycheck, trying to squeeze out every dollar that I can out of this sport and then live my life,\u201d Greer said. \u201cFortunately, things kind of bounced my way.\u201d",
      "Greer was essentially a throw-in as part of a trade to the New Jersey Devils that got the New York Islanders Kyle Palmieri and Travis Zajac, who helped them reach the East final. Greer \u2014 who was a second-round pick of Colorado in 2015 and played 37 games for the Avalanche from 2016-18 \u2014 developed some confidence with the American Hockey League's Utica Comets and cracked the Devils' roster a few times.",
      "Agent Philippe Lecavalier challenged Greer over whether he wanted to be an AHL player or adapt his style to be a role player in the NHL.",
      "\u201cYou could say I wanted to try to prove him wrong,\u201d Greer said. \u201cI kind of just went day by day, got better mentally, physically and matured with my game. I understood if I wanted to ever play in the NHL again, the way I have to play and the things I have to do \u2014 and I got a chance, so I\u2019m very grateful for that. It all led up to here.\u201d",
      "At 6-foot-3 and 209 pounds, Greer has been a physical force for Florida as the Panthers try to repeat as champions. He is one of the newcomers, along with their leading scorer in the final, Nate Schmidt, and teammates are happy to have Greer back.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a pain to play against,\u201d Evan Rodrigues said. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy that can change the momentum of a game. He\u2019s heavy on the forecheck. For the most part, I don\u2019t think you want to get hit by him. He\u2019s a really good presence for us. And he chips in offensively. He lays the body. Just overall a pain the neck to play against.\u201d",
      "That came with time and trial and error as Greer learned how to have an impact with limited ice time. This spring brought his first taste of the Stanley Cup playoffs, and he has made the most of his nearly eight minutes a game.",
      "\u201cMy game\u2019s grown, especially this year,\u201d Greer said. \u201cMy confidence has grown, and I\u2019m ready to take on the biggest challenge that I\u2019ve really faced in my career.\u201d",

      "The announcement \u2014 the first to publicly denounce a gaming app \u2014 indicates that authorities are widening the crackdown that has followed anti-government protests in 2019. Authorities have crushed or silenced many dissenting voices through prosecutions under the 2020 national security law imposed by Beijing and a similar, homegrown law enacted last year.",
      "In a statement, police warned residents against downloading the \u201cReversed Front: Bonfire\" application, saying those with the app installed might be seen as possessing a publication with a seditious intention.",
      "They also warned people against providing financial assistance to the application developer, including making in-app purchases.",
      "\u201c'Reversed Front: Bonfire' was released under the guise of a game with the aim of promoting secessionist agendas such as \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 and \u2018Hong Kong independence,\u2019 advocating armed revolution and the overthrow of the fundamental system of the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d police said.",
      "The game application was developed by ESC Taiwan, which did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for comment. On the application's Facebook page, the developer posted about surging searches for the game name and a Hong Kong broadcaster\u2019s news report about Tuesday\u2019s development.",
      "According to the application\u2019s introduction, players can assume the role of Hong Kong, Tibet, Uyghur, Taiwan or Cathaysian Rebel factions, among others, to overthrow the communist regime. They may also choose to lead the communists to defeat all enemies.",
      "The game\u2019s website says it \u201cis a work of nonfiction. Any similarity to actual agencies, policies or ethnic groups of the PRC in this game is intentional.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday night, the app was still available on Apple's App Store but not on the Google Play store. The game publisher last month said Google Play had taken the app down because it did not prohibit users from adopting hateful language in naming.",
      "Apple, Google and Meta have not immediately commented.",
      "After playing the game for about three months, Kuo Hao Fu in Taiwan said he found that its content uses a humorous approach to describe serious political issues. Fu disagreed with the police accusations, saying players can also choose to be part of the force representing China.",
      "\u201cThe Hong Kong police's actions demonstrate how Hong Kong's democratic freedoms have been controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen even this level cannot be tolerated, it completely destroys creative freedom in gaming.\u201d",
      "China considers Taiwan its own territory, to be brought under its control by force if necessary. Many Taiwanese in the self-ruled island showed concerns about Hong Kong's declining freedoms under Beijing's grip.",
      "The Beijing and Hong Kong governments insist the city's national security laws were necessary to return stability to the city following the protests.",

      "Satellite photos show emperor penguins in one region of Antarctica declined 22% in the past 15 years",
      "WASHINGTON -- The population of emperor penguins in one part of Antarctica appears to be declining faster than previously thought, according to a new analysis of satellite imagery released Tuesday.",
      "The estimated population of 16 penguin colonies \u2014 visible in satellite photos taken between 2009 and 2024 \u2013 had declined 22% during that period mainly because of climate change that's shrinking the amount of available sea ice. It's unclear whether this drop is seen across the continent, scientists said.",
      "\u201cSea ice is very important for the penguins because they breed on sea ice and forage on sea ice,\u201d said Peter Fretwell with British Antarctic Survey, who helped analyze the data.",
      "Scientists previously estimated that the total emperor penguin population declined about 10% across all of Antarctica over the past decade and a half. The latest survey included a region covering the Antarctic Peninsula, Weddell Sea and Bellingshausen Sea.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely alarming that the numbers are so much worse than predicted,\u201d said Daniel Zitterbart, a penguin researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "There are uncertainties in the latest estimate. The analysis relies on a calculation of how densely the penguins are clustered in each area where they're detected in a single satellite photo taken each year.",
      "The colonies studied represent about 30% of the total emperor penguin population, which lives only in Antarctica. The loss of stable sea ice may be affecting the penguins in ways beyond shrinking their breeding grounds.",
      "\u201cMore predators like leopard seals and orcas may be able to come in closer to the colonies if sea ice breaks up earlier in the year,\u201d said Fretwell.",

      "Nicki Townsend is unfazed. Wearing only rubber gloves and an outfit suitable for a yoga class, she approaches with soothing words. \u201cAll right, baby,\" she coos as she deftly drapes a towel over his head, grabs him by the scruff of his neck, scoops up his wounded legs and moves him to a clean cage.",
      "It\u2019s not the way her day typically begins, but there\u2019s nothing routine about rescuing foxes.",
      "\u201cYou can never predict what you\u2019re going to arrive at,\u201d Townsend said.",
      "While not as visible as phone boxes or double-decker buses, the red fox is a fixture in London, a city not known for its wildlife. But living on the streets, alleys and back gardens of a dense urban environment can be rough and when foxes need help, they have their own ambulance service \u2014 and Townsend may be on her way.",
      "The foxes didn't invade London so much as adapt and expand their range inward as the city spread to their habitat in the 1930s and suburbs grew.",
      "But people and the bushy-tailed member of the canine family have not always lived in harmony, and the species has admirers and adversaries.",
      "For everyone enchanted seeing a fox trotting nonchalantly down their street at dusk or basking in a sunny backyard, there are plenty who see them as pests. They poop where they like, tear into garbage and the vixens in heat let out terrifying shrieks in the dead of winter when attracting a mate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like Marmite with foxes,\u201d Townsend said, referring to the food spread that is an acquired and divisive taste. \u201cYou either love them or hate them.\u201d",
      "The divide between the two camps led Trevor Williams to found what became The Fox Project nearly 35 years ago.",
      "Once a bass player in the rock group Audience that opened for Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, Williams had been active in the campaign to stop fox hunting when he redirected his protection efforts to the city, where foxes were once routinely killed.",
      "\u201cBecause of the myths that have occurred over the years, there\u2019s still a lot of suspicion about what foxes might be,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou know, they\u2019re going to bite the baby, they\u2019re going to eat the cat, they\u2019re going to run away with your husband.\u201d",
      "The project has since grown from providing information on deterring foxes to rescuing 1,400 a year, including 400 cubs, though only about half survive to be released.",
      "There are estimated to be 15,000 foxes in London. The project covers a swath of south London and its leafy suburbs while other organizations not devoted solely to foxes handle other parts of the city.",
      "While the omnivores survive on small animals, bugs and berries in the wild, they favor easily scavenged leftovers in the city and handouts that make them more dependent on humans.",
      "Their main urban menaces are cars, getting snagged in soccer nets or getting stuck in tight spaces. In their effort to get free, they often get nasty abrasions that can become infected. Many also suffer from mange, a parasitic infestation that leads to all kinds of problems.",
      "Townsend pilots her VW Caddy on city streets, highways and narrow lanes that roll through lush hills, responding to calls about injured or ill foxes or cubs that have lost their mothers.",
      "She's seen a bit of everything since her first humbling call 2 1/2 years ago when the supposedly injured fox bolted.",
      "\u201cIn my inexperience, I chased after him, which is comical because you\u2019re never going to outrun a fox,\u201d she said. \u201cI just remember he ran very fast and I looked silly running after him.\u201d",
      "Despite many challenging situations \u2014 she once managed to rescue a fox that lost its footing atop a fence and ended upside down at eye level with its paw lodged between boards \u2014 she's only been bitten once.",
      "Her van carries the distinctly musky scent of foxes. The odor becomes unpleasant when an anxious passenger in a litter of cubs relieves itself enroute to being delivered to a foster care pen where they will stay until being released in the wild.",
      "\u201cFeel free to open the window,\u201d said Townsend, who is accustomed to the stench. \u201cThis is a stinky job.\"",
      "On a recent day, she was dispatched to meet a heartbroken couple who found a cub with a puncture wound collapsed on their back lawn.",
      "\u201cWe thought he was asleep at first, so we went to go and have a close look because we love them,\" Charlotte English said. \u201cThen he just didn\u2019t move, so we knew something was wrong.\u201d",
      "That cub had to be put to sleep, as did the adult Townsend transferred at the start of her shift.",
      "Cubs that recover are socialized in packs of five until they mature and are then released in a rural location while the adults are freed in the neighborhoods where they were found.",
      "Given a second chance, it's not clear how well the foxes fare, because they are rarely tracked. A 2016 study in the journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science found that rehabilitated foxes were more likely to behave as if they had been displaced when returned to their original territory. They were tracked wandering farther away, potentially exposing them to more traffic and greater stress.",
      "\u201cIt is a gap in the knowledge and there\u2019s an assumption that when you release them, they thrive and I think that that assumption needs to be challenged more,\u201d said Bryony Tolhurst, a University of Brighton honorary research fellow and lead author of the study.",
      "For Townsend, fox deaths are offset by the joy of seeing little ones venture into the unknown or an adult darting into a neighborhood it instantly recognizes.",
      "\u201cSometimes they look back and people like to romanticize that they\u2019re saying \u2018thank you,'\" she said. \"They\u2019re just making sure we\u2019re not chasing after them.\u201d",

      "Financial aid fraud is exploding, thanks to the rise of artificial intelligence",
      "It was an unusual question coming from a police officer. Heather Brady was napping at home in San Francisco on a Sunday afternoon when the officer knocked on her door to ask: Had she applied to Arizona Western College?",
      "She had not, and as the officer suspected, somebody else had applied to Arizona community colleges in her name to scam the government into paying out financial aid money.",
      "When she checked her student loan servicer account, Brady saw the scammers hadn't stopped there. A loan for over $9,000 had been paid out in her name \u2014 but to another person \u2014 for coursework at a California college.",
      "\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine how many people this is happening to that have no idea,\u201d Brady said.",
      "The rise of artificial intelligence and the popularity of online classes have led to an explosion of financial aid fraud. Fake college enrollments have been surging as crime rings deploy \u201cghost students\u201d \u2014 chatbots that join online classrooms and stay just long enough to collect a financial aid check.",
      "In some cases, professors discover almost no one in their class is real. Students get locked out of the classes they need to graduate as bots push courses over their enrollment limits. And victims of identity theft who discover loans fraudulently taken out in their names must go through months of calling colleges, the Federal Student Aid office and loan servicers to try to get the debt erased.",
      "On Friday, the U.S. Education Department introduced a temporary rule requiring students to show colleges a government-issued ID to prove their identity. It will apply only to first-time applicants for federal student aid for the summer term, affecting some 125,000 borrowers. The agency said it is developing more advanced screening for the fall.",
      "\u201cThe rate of fraud through stolen identities has reached a level that imperils the federal student aid program,\u201d the department said in its guidance to colleges.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of fraud reports obtained through a public records request shows California colleges in 2024 reported 1.2 million fraudulent applications, which resulted in 223,000 suspected fake enrollments. Other states are affected by the same problem, but with 116 community colleges, California is a particularly large target.",
      "Criminals stole at least $11.1 million in federal, state and local financial aid from California community colleges last year that could not be recovered, according to the reports.",
      "Colleges typically receive a portion of the loans intended for tuition, with the balance going directly to students for other expenses. Community colleges are targeted in part because their lower tuition means larger percentages of grants and loans go to borrowers.",
      "Scammers frequently use AI chatbots to carry out the fraud, targeting courses that are online and allow students to watch lectures and complete coursework on their own time.",
      "In January, Wayne Chaw started getting emails about a class he never signed up for at De Anza Community College, where he had taken coding classes a decade earlier. Identity thieves had obtained his Social Security number and collected $1,395 in financial aid in his name.",
      "The energy management class required students to submit a homework assignment to prove they were real. But someone wrote submissions impersonating Chaw, likely using a chatbot.",
      "\u201cThis person is typing as me, saying my first and last name. ... It\u2019s very freaky when I saw that,\u201d said Chaw.",
      "The fraud involved a grant, not loans, so Chaw himself did not lose money. He called the Social Security Administration to report the identity theft, but after five hours on hold, he never got through to a person.",
      "As the Trump administration moves to dismantle the Education Department, federal cuts may make it harder to catch criminals and help victims of identity theft. In March, the Trump administration fired more than 300 people from the Federal Student Aid office, and the department\u2019s Office of Inspector General, which investigates fraud, has lost more than 20% of its staff through attrition and retirements since October.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just nervous that I\u2019m going to be stuck with this,\u201d Brady said. \u201cThe agency is going to be so broken down and disintegrated that I won\u2019t be able to do anything, and I\u2019m just going to be stuck with those $9,000\u201d in loans.",
      "Criminal cases around the country offer a glimpse of the schemes' pervasiveness.",
      "In the past year, investigators indicted a man accused of leading a Texas fraud ring that used stolen identities to pursue $1.5 million in student aid. Another person in Texas pleaded guilty to using the names of prison inmates to apply for over $650,000 in student aid at colleges across the South and Southwest. And a person in New York recently pleaded guilty to a $450,000 student aid scam that lasted a decade.",
      "Brittnee Nelson of Shreveport, Louisiana, was bringing her daughter to day care two years ago when she received a notification that her credit score had dropped 27 points.",
      "Loans had been taken out in her name for colleges in California and Louisiana, she discovered. She canceled one before it was paid out, but it was too late to stop a loan of over $5,000 for Delgado Community College in New Orleans.",
      "Nelson runs her own housecleaning business and didn\u2019t go to college. She already was signed up for identity theft protection and carefully monitored her credit. Still, her debt almost went into collections before the loan was put in forbearance. She recently got the loans taken off her record after two years of effort.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like if someone came into your house and robbed you,\u201d she said.",
      "The federal government's efforts to verify borrowers' identity could help, she said.",
      "\u201cIf they can make these hurdles a little bit harder and have these verifications more provable, I think that\u2019s really, really, really going to protect people in the long run,\u201d she said.",
      "Delgado spokesperson Barbara Waiters said responsibility for approving loans ultimately lies with federal agencies.",
      "\u201cThis is an unfortunate and serious matter, but it is not the direct or indirect result of Delgado\u2019s internal processes,\u201d Waiters said.",
      "In San Francisco, the loans taken out in Brady's name are in a grace period, but still on the books. That has not been her only challenge. A few months ago, she was laid off from her job and decided to sign up for a class at City College San Francisco to help her career. But all the classes were full.",
      "After a few weeks, Brady finally was able to sign up for a class. The professor apologized for the delay in spots opening up: The college has been struggling with fraudulent applications.",

      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia on Monday filed a lawsuit in bankruptcy court seeking to block the sale of personal genetic data by 23andMe without customer consent. The lawsuit comes as a biotechnology company seeks the court's approval to buy the struggling firm.",
      "Biological samples, DNA data, health-related traits and medical records are too sensitive to be sold without each person\u2019s express, informed consent, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in a news release about the lawsuit. Customers should have the right to control such deeply personal information and it cannot be sold like ordinary property, it said.",
      "23andMe customers use saliva-based DNA testing kits to learn about their ancestry and find long-lost relatives. Founded in 2006, the company also conducted health research and drug development. But it struggled to find a profitable business model since going public in 2021. In March it laid off 40% of its staff and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the Eastern District of Missouri, raising concerns about the safety of customer data.",
      "Regeneron Pharmaceuticals said last month it aimed to buy the company for $256 million. Regeneron said it would comply with 23andMe\u2019s privacy policies and applicable law. It said it would process all customer personal data in accordance with the consents, privacy policies and statements, terms of service, and notices currently in effect and have security controls in place designed to protect such data.",
      "A court-appointed, independent consumer privacy ombudsman was due to examine the proposed sale and how it might affect consumer privacy and report to the court by Tuesday.",

      "It\u2019s one of crypto\u2019s hottest trends: publicly traded companies buying bitcoin and then buying even more.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s media company just announced a plan to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, joining a growing number of so-called \u201cbitcoin treasury companies\u201d as the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency hits all-time highs.",
      "The companies buy bitcoin for different reasons: Some hold it as a hedge against inflation or to signal support for the cryptocurrency industry, while some firms have made using debt and stock sales to buy bitcoin their primary business strategy.",
      "\u201cThe world at large has no idea what\u2019s happening and they\u2019re in for a big shock,\u201d Dylan LeClair, an executive at the Japan-based Metaplanet, which recently went from being a budget hotel firm to a bitcoin treasury company, said at a recent crypto conference. \u201cThis is a one-way train, nothing is going to stop this.\u201d",
      "The massive increases in some firms\u2019 stock price may seem to validate LeClair\u2019s bravado, but there are plenty of warnings that a downturn in bitcoin\u2019s prices could lead to large selloffs.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at bitcoin treasury companies by the numbers:",
      "That\u2019s how many bitcoins owned by MicroStrategy \u2013 the undisputed goliath of bitcoin treasury companies.",
      "With nearly 3% of the total bitcoin supply, MicroStrategy owns more bitcoins than every other bitcoin treasury company combined. It also owns more bitcoin than every nation state combined, according to the tracking site bitcointreasuries.net.",
      "Now called Strategy, the software company first started buying bitcoin in 2020 with reserve cash. Now, its software business is a small part of a perpetual bitcoin-buying machine that uses a variety of strategies \u2013 like selling shares or issuing debt \u2013 to keep growing its bitcoin holdings.",
      "That\u2019s how much MicroStrategy\u2019s stock price has increased in the last five years, compared to around 1,000% gain in bitcoin and the 1,500% jump for chipmaker and stock market darling Nvidia during that same period.",
      "The company\u2019s success has boosted the profile of MicroStrategy\u2019s founder and chairman, Michael Saylor, who has visited Trump at Mar-a-Lago and the White House while becoming bitcoin\u2019s enigmatic high priest.",
      "\u201cBitcoin is a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom, feeding on the fire of truth, exponentially growing ever smarter, faster, and stronger behind a wall of encrypted energy,\u201d Saylor said in a social media post.",
      "Saylor\u2019s success has also spawned many imitators.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of shocking \u2026 that it took someone four years after Michael Saylor started doing it to finally do it and pull the trigger and now it feels like everyone\u2019s pulling the trigger,\u201d said Eric Semler, the chairman of Semler Scientific, a healthcare company that started acquiring bitcoin last year.",
      "That\u2019s the average purchase price of bitcoin for half of the 61 publicly traded bitcoin strategy companies, excluding bitcoin mining companies and bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to a recent analysis by Standard Chartered.",
      "Geoff Kendrick, the bank\u2019s head of digital assets research, said in the report that restrictions on investors buying bitcoin directly help explain the popularity of bitcoin treasury companies, as their stocks can serve as bitcoin proxies. But as crypto becomes more mainstream, the case for investing in bitcoin treasury companies becomes weaker, Kendrick said.",
      "He added that bitcoin\u2019s volatility could force some newer bitcoin treasury companies to sell their holdings to satisfy their debts if it falls under the purchase price.",
      "\u201cThe question then becomes, how much pain can companies withstand before being forced to sell their BTC?\u201d Kendrick said, referring to the symbol for bitcoin.",
      "That\u2019s how much of a one-day percentage increase in stock prices firms have seen after recently announcing plans to hold other types of cryptocurrencies as corporate treasuries, highlighting how the appetite for such companies extends beyond bitcoin.",
      "SharpLink Gaming, a gambling marketing firm, saw its share price increase by more than 400% after it announced plans to buy up to $425 million in Ethereum, the second most popular form of cryptocurrency. And crypto firm Upexi saw its stock price soar more than 300% after it announced plans to buy $100 million of Solana, a cryptocurrency popular in the meme coin ecosystem.",

      "The scientist is accused of shipping biological material months ago to staff at a laboratory at the University of Michigan. The FBI, in a court filing, described it as material related to certain worms and requires a government permit.",
      "\u201cThe guidelines for importing biological materials into the U.S. for research purposes are stringent, but clear, and actions like this undermine the legitimate work of other visiting scholars,\u201d said John Nowak, who leads field operations at U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",

      "Nintendo's Switch 2 video-game console is out, and it makes some substantial improvements over its predecessor",
      "WASHINGTON -- I'm cruising around Bowser's Castle with my old pal Toad. It's not exactly relaxing, what with all the lava pits and banana peels and turtle shells littering the road. Add 23 other characters \u2014 is that a cow driving? \u2014 who are trying to get to the finish line first, and it's chaos.",
      "The hectic, high-speed insanity of any race in the new Mario Kart World would have caused the eight-year-old Switch console to wheeze a bit. And that's why we've got the Switch 2 ($449.99), the souped-up sequel to Nintendo's popular home-and-portable hybrid.",
      "It looks prettier, too. The 7.9-inch portable display (up from 6.2 inches) boosts the resolution to 1020p (from 720p), and while the LCD screen isn't quite as sharp as an OLED screen might have been, it's much cleaner than the original recipe Switch. It looks even better when connected to an HDTV since it now supports 4K and HDR.",
      "Nintendo has always stood apart from the technological arms race that fans of Sony\u2019s PlayStation and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox obsess over, insisting that first-rate games don\u2019t necessarily depend on high-powered computer chips. But you could feel the strain in 2023\u2019s The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, with its at-times blurry graphics and sluggish framerate. The Switch 2, with a faster framerate of 120 fps, corrects much of the fuzziness.",
      "That's not to say it comes close to matching the high-definition performance of the PlayStation 5 or the Xbox X/S. If you're expecting the jaw-dropping graphics of, say, Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Shadows ... well, no.",
      "There is good news for those of us who have gotten weary of the old Switch's dinky 32 gigabytes of internal storage. The Switch 2 multiplies that by eight, for 256 GB. Of course, flashier games take up more space, so if you want more room you'll have to invest in a microSD Express card \u2014 which is a bit pricier than the standard memory card used in most portable devices.",
      "The Switch 2's Joy-Con controllers have undergone some tinkering. As before, you can attach them to the sides of the screen if you're playing on the go. If you're at home, you can attach them to a doohickey that feels more like a traditional joystick. Either way, they're now more firmly connected with magnets, which provide a satisfying snap.",
      "Both the left and right Joy-Cons now include an optical mouse, which you can use by placing the controller on its edge and rolling it around on a table. (Nintendo says you can also use it on your pants, but I prefer using a clipboard on my lap.) It remains to be seen how many Switch 2 games will call for a mouse, but 2K's port of Sid Meier's Civilization VII seems like a good candidate.",
      "And then there's a new button labeled \u201cC\u201d on the right-hand Joy-Con. That calls up GameChat, which lets you start up a conversation with other players \u2014 provided you've all taken the time to register yourselves as friends. (Eventually, you'll also need to subscribe to the Nintendo Switch Online service, but that requirement doesn't kick in until March 31, 2026.) The microphone is built into the Switch 2, though if you want to upgrade to video chat, you'll need to buy a separate Nintendo camera.",
      "Finally, there\u2019s GameShare, which lets you play selected titles with other Switch users even if they don\u2019t own the software.",
      "Nintendo has been emphasizing the new social features in its marketing, though it feels like it's catching up to the competition. The kids I know who play Fortnite or Minecraft on competing consoles seem to have figured out long ago how to chat with their pals. Welcome to the 2010s?",
      "As with any console launch, the driving question is: Does it have the games?",
      "There are just a couple of Switch 2 exclusives out now: Mario Kart World and Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, a $10 demo package that really should have been free. There are some new-to-Nintendo ports of excellent titles like Split Fiction and Cyberpunk 2077. You can get upgrades of classics like the last two Legend of Zelda adventures. And the Switch 2 is fully backward-compatible, so you can play everything that came out for the Switch as well as a substantial library of older titles.",
      "There\u2019s no other machine that will let you play future installments of beloved franchises like Zelda, Super Mario Bros., Super Smash Bros. and Animal Crossing. None of those have been announced yet, but some marquee names \u2014 Donkey Kong and Kirby \u2014 will star in Switch 2 exclusives later this year.",
      "There\u2019s plenty of competition out there, though, and not just in the TV-connected console market Switch shares with the PlayStation and the Xbox. Nintendo no longer has the portable market to itself, thanks to Valve\u2019s SteamDeck. Some models of that device cost less than the Switch 2, and it already has a huge library of PC games. Meanwhile, Microsoft announced over the weekend that it's teaming up with Asus on the ROG Xbox Ally, a handheld that will be out before Christmas.",
      "Honestly, we\u2019ll probably have a better idea of the Switch\u2019s quality a few years down the line, after developers get a handle on what the new hardware can do. If you\u2019re dying to get back behind the wheel with Mario, Luigi and Princess Peach right now, though, you know what you need to do.",
      "\u2014\u2014",
      "A previous version of this story was corrected to say that the Switch 2 social options can be used without a subscription until March 31, 2026.",

      "Amazon says it will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, including one it is building alongside a nuclear power plant that has drawn federal scrutiny over its arrangement to essentially plug right into the power plant",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Amazon said Monday that it will spend $20 billion on two data center complexes in Pennsylvania, including one it is building alongside a nuclear power plant that has drawn federal scrutiny over an arrangement to essentially plug right into the power plant.",
      "Kevin Miller, vice president of global data centers at Amazon\u2019s cloud computing subsidiary, Amazon Web Services, told The Associated Press that the company will build another data center complex just north of Philadelphia.",
      "One data center is being built next to northeastern Pennsylvania's Susquehanna nuclear power plant. The other will be in Fairless Hills at a logistics campus, the Keystone Trade Center, on what was once a U.S. Steel mill.",
      "In a statement, Gov. Josh Shapiro called it the largest capital investment in Pennsylvania's history.",
      "The announcements add to the billions of dollars in Big Tech's data center cash already flowing into the state.",
      "Since 2024 started, Amazon has committed to about $10 billion apiece to data center projects in Mississippi, Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina as it ramps up its investment in infrastructure to compete with other tech giants to meet growing demand for artificial intelligence products.",
      "The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems.",
      "The majority owner of the Susquehanna nuclear power plant, Talen Energy, announced last year that it had sold its data center to Amazon for $650 million in a deal to eventually provide 960 megawatts. That's 40% of the output of one of the nation's largest nuclear power plants, or enough to power more than a half-million homes.",
      "However, the arrangement between Talen and Amazon \u2014 called a \u201cbehind the meter\u201d connection \u2014 has been held up by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the first such case to come before the agency.",
      "It has raised questions over whether diverting power to higher-paying customers will leave enough for others and whether it\u2019s fair to excuse big power users from paying for the grid.",
      "For Big Tech, plugging energy-hungry data centers directly into a power plant can take years off their development timelines and is a much faster route to procuring power than having to connect to the congested electricity grid.",
      "It\u2019s not clear when FERC, which blocked the deal on a procedural grounds, will decide the matter, leaving in limbo regulatory treatment of the deal and others that likely would follow.",
      "Already in Pennsylvania, Microsoft announced a deal with the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to restart the reactor under a 20-year agreement to supply its data centers in four states with energy.",
      "Meanwhile, the owners of what was once Pennsylvania\u2019s biggest coal-fired power plant say they will turn it into a $10 billion natural gas-powered data center campus.",

      "Opening arguments before a judge at the British High Court are scheduled for Monday. The trial could last for three weeks.",
      "Stability, based in London, owns a widely used AI image-making tool that sparked enthusiasm for the instant creation of AI artwork and photorealistic images upon its release in August 2022. OpenAI introduced its surprise hit chatbot ChatGPT three months later.",
      "Seattle-based Getty has argued that the development of the AI image maker, called Stable Diffusion, involved \u201cbrazen infringement\u201d of Getty\u2019s photography collection \u201con a staggering scale.\"",
      "Tech companies have long argued that \u201cfair use\u201d or \u201cfair dealing\u201d legal doctrines in the United States and United Kingdom allow them to train their AI systems on large troves of writings or images. Getty was among the first to challenge those practices when it filed copyright infringement lawsuits in the United States and the United Kingdom in early 2023.",
      "\u201cWhat Stability did was inappropriate,\u201d Getty CEO Craig Peters told The Associated Press in 2023. He said creators of intellectual property should be asked for permission before their works are fed into AI systems rather than having to participate in an \u201copt-out regime.\"",
      "Stability has argued that the case doesn't belong in the United Kingdom because the training of the AI model technically happened elsewhere, on computers run by U.S. tech giant Amazon.",
      "Similar cases in the U.S. have not yet gone to trial.",
      "Stable Diffusion\u2019s roots trace to Germany, where computer scientists at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich worked with the New York-based tech company Runway to develop the original algorithms. The university researchers credited Stability AI for providing the servers that trained the models, which require large amounts of computing power.",

      "Warner Bros. Discovery said Monday that Streaming & Studios will include Warner Bros. Television, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, DC Studios, HBO, and HBO Max, as well as their film and television libraries.",
      "The Global Networks company will include CNN, TNT Sports in the U.S., and Discovery, top free-to-air channels across Europe, and digital products such as the Discovery+ streaming service and Bleacher Report.",

      "Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav will serve as CEO of Streaming & Studios. Gunnar Wiedenfels, chief financial officer of Warner Bros. Discovery, will serve as CEO of Global Networks. Both will continue in their current roles until the separation.",
      "Just days ago Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders voted to reject the 2024 pay packages of some executives, including Zaslav's pay package of more than $51 million. The vote is symbolic, as it is nonbinding.",
      "\u201cBy operating as two distinct and optimized companies in the future, we are empowering these iconic brands with the sharper focus and strategic flexibility they need to compete most effectively in today\u2019s evolving media landscape,\" Zaslav said in a statement.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery said in December that it was implementing a restructuring plan that would have Warner Bros. Discovery serve as the parent company for two operating divisions, Global Linear Networks and Streaming & Studios. The announcement was taken as a preview of the separation of divisions that was announced Monday.",

      "After stumbling out of the starting gate in Big Tech\u2019s pivotal race to capitalize on artificial intelligence, Apple tried to regain its footing Monday during a developers conference that focused mostly on incremental advances and cosmetic changes in it...",
      "CUPERTINO, Calif. -- After stumbling out of the starting gate in Big Tech\u2019s pivotal race to capitalize on artificial intelligence, Apple tried to regain its footing Monday during an annual developers conference that focused mostly on incremental advances and cosmetic changes in its technology.",
      "The presummer rite, which attracted thousands of developers from nearly 60 countries to Apple's Silicon Valley headquarters, subdued compared with the feverish anticipation that surrounded the event in the last two years.",
      "Apple highlighted plans for more AI tools designed to simplify people's lives and make its products even more intuitive. It also provided an early glimpse at the biggest redesign of its iPhone software in a decade. In doing so, Apple executives refrained from issuing bold promises of breakthroughs that punctuated recent conferences, prompting CFRA analyst Angelo Zino to deride the event as a \u201cdud\u201d in a research note.",
      "In 2023, Apple unveiled a mixed-reality headset that has been little more than a niche product, and last year WWDC trumpeted its first major foray into the AI craze with an array of new features highlighted by the promise of a smarter and more versatile version of its virtual assistant, Siri \u2014 a goal that has yet to be realized.",
      "\u201cThis work needed more time to reach our high-quality bar,\u201d Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s top software executive, said Monday at the outset of the conference. The company didn't provide a precise timetable for when Siri's AI upgrade will be finished but indicated it won't happen until next year at the earliest.",
      "\"The silence surrounding Siri was deafening,\" said Forrester Research analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee said. \u201cNo amount of text corrections or cute emojis can fill the yawning void of an intuitive, interactive AI experience that we know Siri will be capable of when ready. We just don\u2019t know when that will happen. The end of the Siri runway is coming up fast, and Apple needs to lift off.\u201d",
      "The showcase unfolded amid nagging questions about whether Apple has lost some of the mystique and innovative drive that has made it a tech trendsetter during its nearly 50-year history.",
      "Instead of making a big splash as it did with the Vision Pro headset and its AI suite, Apple took a mostly low-key approach that emphasized its effort to spruce up the look of its software with a new design called \u201cLiquid Glass\" while also unveiling a new hub for its video games and new features like a \u201cWorkout Buddy\u201d to help manage physical fitness.",
      "Apple executives promised to make its software more compatible with the increasingly sophisticated computer chips that have been powering its products while also making it easier to toggle between the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.",
      "\u201cOur product experience has become even more seamless and enjoyable,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook told the crowd as the 90-minute showcase wrapped up.",
      "IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo said Apple seemed to be largely using Monday's conference to demonstrate the company still has a blueprint for success in AI, even if it's going to take longer to realize the vision that was presented a year ago.",
      "\u201cThis year\u2019s event was not about disruptive innovation, but rather careful calibration, platform refinement and developer enablement \u2014positioning itself for future moves rather than unveiling game-changing technologies,\u201d Jeronimo said.",
      "Besides redesigning its software. Apple will switch to a method that automakers have used to telegraph their latest car models by linking them to the year after they first arrive at dealerships. That means the next version of the iPhone operating system due out this autumn will be known as iOS 26 instead of iOS 19 \u2014 as it would be under the previous naming approach that has been used since the device's 2007 debut.",
      "The iOS 26 upgrade is expected to be released in September around the same time Apple traditionally rolls out the next iPhone models.",
      "Apple opened the proceedings with a short video clip featuring Federighi speeding around a track in a Formula 1 race car. Although it was meant to promote the June 27 release of the Apple film, \u201cF1\u201d starring Brad Pitt, the segment could also be viewed as an unintentional analogy to the company's attempt to catch up to the rest of the pack in AI technology.",
      "While some of the new AI tricks compatible with the latest iPhones began rolling out late last year as part of free software updates, the delays in a souped-up Siri became so glaring that the chastened company stopped promoting it in its marketing campaigns earlier this year.",
      "While Apple has been struggling to make AI that meets its standards, the gap separating it from other tech powerhouses is widening. Google keeps packing more AI into its Pixel smartphone lineup while introducing more of the technology into its search engine to dramatically change the way it works. Samsung, Apple's biggest smartphone rival, is also leaning heavily into AI. Meanwhile, ChatGPT recently struck a deal that will bring former Apple design guru Jony Ive into the fold to work on a new device expected to compete against the iPhone.",
      "Besides grappling with innovation challenges, Apple also faces regulatory threats that could siphon away billions of dollars in revenue that help finance its research and development. A federal judge is currently weighing whether proposed countermeasures to Google's illegal monopoly in search should include a ban on long-running deals worth $20 billion annually to Apple while another federal judge recently banned the company from collecting commissions on in-app transactions processed outside its once-exclusive payment system.",
      "On top of all that, Apple has been caught in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump's trade war with China, a key manufacturing hub for the Cupertino, California, company. Cook successfully persuaded Trump to exempt the iPhone from tariffs during the president's first administration, but he has had less success during Trump's second term, which seems more determined to prod Apple to make its products in the U.S.",
      "The multidimensional gauntlet facing Apple is spooking investors, causing the company's stock price to plunge by 20% so far this year \u2014 a decline that has erased about $750 billion in shareholder wealth. After beginning the year as the most valuable company in the world, Apple now ranks third behind longtime rival Microsoft, another AI leader, and AI chipmaker Nvidia.",
      "Apple's shares closed down by more than 1% on Monday \u2014 an early indication the company's latest announcements didn't inspire investors.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014",
      "Cybersecurity investigators noticed a highly unusual software crash \u2014 it was affecting a small number of smartphones belonging to people who worked in government, politics, tech and journalism.",
      "The crashes, which began late last year and carried into 2025, were the tipoff to a sophisticated cyberattack that may have allowed hackers to infiltrate a phone without a single click from the user.",
      "The attackers left no clues about their identities, but investigators at the cybersecurity firm iVerify noticed that the victims all had something in common: They worked in fields of interest to China's government and had been targeted by Chinese hackers in the past.",
      "Foreign hackers have increasingly identified smartphones, other mobile devices and the apps they use as a weak link in U.S. cyberdefenses. Groups linked to China's military and intelligence service have targeted the smartphones of prominent Americans and burrowed deep into telecommunication networks, according to national security and tech experts.",
      "It shows how vulnerable mobile devices and apps are and the risk that security failures could expose sensitive information or leave American interests open to cyberattack, those experts say.",
      "\u201cThe world is in a mobile security crisis right now,\u201d said Rocky Cole, a former cybersecurity expert at the National Security Agency and Google and now chief operations officer at iVerify. \u201cNo one is watching the phones.\u201d",
      "U.S. authorities warned in December of a sprawling Chinese hacking campaign designed to gain access to the texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans.",
      "\u201cThey were able to listen in on phone calls in real time and able to read text messages,\u201d said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois. He is a member of the House Intelligence Committee and the senior Democrat on the Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, created to study the geopolitical threat from China.",
      "Chinese hackers also sought access to phones used by Donald Trump and running mate JD Vance during the 2024 campaign.",
      "The Chinese government has denied allegations of cyberespionage, and accused the U.S. of mounting its own cyberoperations. It says America cites national security as an excuse to issue sanctions against Chinese organizations and keep Chinese technology companies from the global market.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. has long been using all kinds of despicable methods to steal other countries\u2019 secrets,\u201d Lin Jian, a spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry, said at a recent press conference in response to questions about a CIA push to recruit Chinese informants.",
      "U.S. intelligence officials have said China poses a significant, persistent threat to U.S. economic and political interests, and it has harnessed the tools of digital conflict: online propaganda and disinformation, artificial intelligence and cyber surveillance and espionage designed to deliver a significant advantage in any military conflict.",
      "Mobile networks are a top concern. The U.S. and many of its closest allies have banned Chinese telecom companies from their networks. Other countries, including Germany, are phasing out Chinese involvement because of security concerns. But Chinese tech firms remain a big part of the systems in many nations, giving state-controlled companies a global footprint they could exploit for cyberattacks, experts say.",
      "Chinese telecom firms still maintain some routing and cloud storage systems in the U.S. \u2014 a growing concern to lawmakers.",
      "\u201cThe American people deserve to know if Beijing is quietly using state-owned firms to infiltrate our critical infrastructure,\u201d U.S. Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich. and chairman of the China committee, which in April issued subpoenas to Chinese telecom companies seeking information about their U.S. operations.",
      "Mobile devices can buy stocks, launch drones and run power plants. Their proliferation has often outpaced their security.",
      "The phones of top government officials are especially valuable, containing sensitive government information, passwords and an insider's glimpse into policy discussions and decision-making.",
      "The White House said last week that someone impersonating Susie Wiles, Trump\u2019s chief of staff, reached out to governors, senators and business leaders with texts and phone calls.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how the person obtained Wiles\u2019 connections, but they apparently gained access to the contacts in her personal cellphone, The Wall Street Journal reported. The messages and calls were not coming from Wiles\u2019 number, the newspaper reported.",
      "While most smartphones and tablets come with robust security, apps and connected devices often lack these protections or the regular software updates needed to stay ahead of new threats. That makes every fitness tracker, baby monitor or smart appliance another potential foothold for hackers looking to penetrate networks, retrieve information or infect systems with malware.",
      "Federal officials launched a program this year creating a \u201ccyber trust mark\u201d for connected devices that meet federal security standards. But consumers and officials shouldn\u2019t lower their guard, said Snehal Antani, former chief technology officer for the Pentagon\u2019s Joint Special Operations Command.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re finding backdoors in Barbie dolls,\u201d said Antani, now CEO of Horizon3.ai, a cybersecurity firm, referring to concerns from researchers who successfully hacked the microphone of a digitally connected version of the toy.",
      "It doesn't matter how secure a mobile device is if the user doesn't follow basic security precautions, especially if their device contains classified or sensitive information, experts say.",
      "Mike Waltz, who departed as Trump's national security adviser, inadvertently added The Atlantic's editor-in-chief to a Signal chat used to discuss military plans with other top officials.",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth had an internet connection that bypassed the Pentagon\u2019s security protocols set up in his office so he could use the Signal messaging app on a personal computer, the AP has reported.",
      "Hegseth has rejected assertions that he shared classified information on Signal, a popular encrypted messaging app not approved for the use of communicating classified information.",

      "A new study that examined five years\u2019 worth of prices at one U.S. grocery chain found that digital price tags haven\u2019t led to demand-based pricing surges",
      "Digital price labels, which are rapidly replacing paper shelf tags at U.S. supermarkets, haven\u2019t led to demand-based pricing surges, according to a new study that examined five years' worth of prices at one grocery chain.",
      "But some shoppers, consumer advocates and lawmakers remain skeptical about the tiny electronic screens, which let stores change prices instantly from a central computer instead of having workers swap out paper labels by hand.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s corporations vs. the humans, and that chasm between us goes further and further,\u201d said Dan Gallant, who works in sports media in Edmonton, Canada. Gallant's local Loblaws supermarket recently switched to digital labels.",
      "Social media is filled with warnings that grocers will use the technology to charge more for ice cream if it\u2019s hot outside, hike the price of umbrellas if it\u2019s raining or to gather information about customers.",
      "Democratic U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania fired off a letter to Kroger last fall demanding to know whether it would use its electronic labels as part of a dynamic pricing strategy.",
      "Lawmakers in Rhode Island and Maine have introduced bills to limit the use of digital labels. In Arizona, Democratic state Rep. Cesar Aguilar recently introduced a bill that would ban them altogether.",
      "The bill hasn\u2019t gotten a hearing, but Aguilar said he\u2019s determined to start a conversation about digital labels and how stores could abuse them.",
      "\u201cGrocery stores study when people go shopping the most. And so you might be able to see a price go down one day and then go up another day,\u201d Aguilar told The Associated Press.",
      "Researchers say those fears are misplaced. A study published in late May found \u201cvirtually no surge pricing\u201d before or after electronic shelf labels were adopted. The study was authored by Ioannis Stamatopoulos of the University of Texas, Austin, Robert Evan Sanders of the University of California, San Diego and Robert Bray of Northwestern University",
      "The researchers looked at prices between 2019 and 2024 at an unnamed grocery chain than began using digital labels in October 2022. They found that temporary price increases affected 0.005% of products on any given day before electronic shelf labels were introduced, a share that increased by only 0.0006 percentage points after digital labels were installed.",
      "The study also determined that discounts were slightly more common after digital labels were introduced.",
      "Economists have long wondered why grocery prices don\u2019t change more often, according to Stamatopoulos. If bananas are about to expire, for example, it makes sense to lower the price on them. He said the cost of having workers change prices by hand could be one issue.",
      "But there\u2019s another reason: Shoppers watch grocery prices closely, and stores don\u2019t want to risk angering them.",
      "\u201cSelling groceries is not selling a couch. It\u2019s not a one-time transaction and you will never see them again,\u201d Stamatopoulos said. \u201cYou want them coming to the store every week.\u201d",
      "Electronic price labels aren\u2019t new. They\u2019ve been in use for more than a decade at groceries in Europe and some U.S. retailers, like Kohl's.",
      "But they\u2019ve been slow to migrate to U.S. grocery stores. Only around 5% to 10% of U.S. supermarkets now have electronic labels, compared to 80% in Europe, said Amanda Oren, vice president of industry strategy for North American grocery at Relex Solutions, a technology company that helps retailers forecast demand.",
      "Oren said cost is one issue that has slowed the U.S. rollout. The tiny screens cost between $5 and $20, Oren said, but every product a store sells needs one, and the average supermarket has 100,000 or more individual products.",
      "Still, the U.S. industry is charging ahead. Walmart, the nation's largest grocer and retailer, hopes to have digital price labels at 2,300 U.S. stores by 2026. Kroger is expanding the use of digital labels this year after testing them at 20 stores. Whole Foods is testing the labels in nearly 50 stores.",
      "Companies say electronic price labels have tremendous advantages. Walmart says it used to take employees two days to change paper price labels on the 120,000 items it has in a typical store. With digital tags, it takes a few minutes.",
      "The labels can also be useful. Some have codes shoppers can scan to see recipes or nutrition information. Instacart has a system in thousands of U.S. stores, including Aldi and Schnucks, that flashes a light on the digital tag when Instacart shoppers are nearby to help them find products.",
      "Ahold Delhaize\u2019s Albert Heijn supermarket chain in the Netherlands and Belgium has been testing an artificial intelligence-enabled tool since 2022 that marks down prices on its digital labels every 15 minutes for products nearing expiration. The system has reduced more than 250 tons of food waste annually, the company said.",
      "But Warren and Casey are skeptical. In their letter to Kroger, the U.S. senators noted a partnership with Microsoft that planned to put cameras in grocery aisles and offer personalized deals to shoppers depending on their gender and age.",
      "In its response, Kroger said the prices shown on its digital labels were not connected to any sort of facial recognition technology. It also denied surging prices during periods of peak demand.",
      "\u201cKroger\u2019s business model is built on a foundation of lowering prices to attract more customers,\u201d the company said.",
      "Aguilar, the Arizona lawmaker, said he also opposes the transition to digital labels because he thinks they will cost jobs. His constituents have pointed out that grocery prices keep rising even though there are fewer workers in checkout lanes, he said.",
      "\u201cThey are supposed to be part of our community, and that means hiring people from our community that fill those jobs,\" Aguilar said.",
      "But Relex Solutions' Oren said she doesn't think cutting labor costs is the main reason stores deploy digital price tags.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about working smarter, not harder, and being able to use that labor in better ways across the store rather than these very mundane, repetitive tasks,\u201d she said.",

      "Maybe, that is. It all depends on Trump\u2019s appetite for revenge and how the dispute unfolds.",
      "Joked Telemetry Insight auto analyst Sam Abuelsamid, \u201cSince Trump has no history of retaliating against perceived adversaries, he\u2019ll probably just let this pass.\u201d",
      "Turning serious, he sees trouble ahead for Musk.",
      "\u201cFor someone that rants so much about government pork, all of Elon\u2019s businesses are extremely dependent on government largesse, which makes him vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Trump and the federal government also stand to lose from a long-running dispute, but not as much as Musk.",
      "The dispute comes just a week before a planned test of Tesla\u2019s driverless taxis in Austin, Texas, a major event for the company because sales of its EVs are lagging in many markets, and Musk needs a win.",
      "Trump can mess things up for Tesla by encouraging federal safety regulators to step in at any sign of trouble for the robotaxis.",
      "Even before the war of words broke out on Thursday, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration requested data on how Musk\u2019s driverless, autonomous taxis will perform in low-visibility conditions. That request follows an investigation last year into 2.4 million Teslas equipped with full self-driving software after several accidents, including one that killed a pedestrian.",
      "A spokesman for NHTSA said the probe was ongoing and that the agency \"will take any necessary actions to protect road safety.\u201d",
      "The Department of Justice has also probed the safety of Tesla cars, but the status of that investigation is unclear. The DOJ did not respond immediately to requests for comment.",
      "The promise of a self-driving future led by Tesla inspired shareholders to boost the stock by 50% in the weeks after Musk confirmed the Austin rollout. But on Thursday, the stock plunged more than 14% amid the Trump-Musk standoff. On Friday, it recovered a bit, bouncing back nearly 4%.",
      "\u201cTesla\u2019s recent rise was almost entirely driven by robotaxi enthusiasm,\" said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. \u201cElon\u2019s feud with Trump could be a negative.\u201d",
      "One often-overlooked but important part of Tesla\u2019s business that could take a hit is its sales of carbon credits.",
      "As Musk and Trump were slugging it out Thursday, Republican senators inserted new language into Trump\u2019s budget bill that would eliminate fines for gas-powered cars that fall short of fuel economy standards. Tesla has a thriving side business selling \u201cregulatory credits\u201d to other automakers to make up for their shortfalls.",
      "Musk has downplayed the importance of the credits business, but the changes would hurt Tesla as it reels from boycotts of its cars tied to Musk\u2019s time working for Trump.",

      "Artificial Intelligence\u2019s use in filmmaking is growing",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Artificial intelligence 's use in movie making is exploding. And a young film festival, now in its junior year, is showcasing what this technology can do on screen today.",
      "The annual AI Film Festival organized by Runway, a company that specializes in AI-generated video, kicked off in New York Thursday night with ten short films from around the world making their debut on the big screen.",
      "\u201cThree years ago, this was such a crazy idea,\u201d Runway CEO Crist\u00f3bal Valenzuela told the crowd. \u201cToday, millions of people are making billions of videos using tools we only dreamed of.\u201d",
      "The film festival itself has grown significantly since its 2023 debut. About 300 people submitted films when it first began, Valenzuela said, compared to about 6,000 submissions received this year.",
      "The one and half-hour lineup stretched across a range of creative styles and ambitious themes \u2014 with Jacob Alder's \u201c Total Pixel Space \" taking home the festival's top prize. The 9-minute and 28-second film questions how many possible images \u2014 real or not \u2014 exist in the digital space, and uses math to calculate a colossal number. A stunning series of images, ranging from the familiar life moments to those that completely bend reality, gives viewers a glimpse of what's out there.",
      "Meanwhile, Andrew Salter's \u201cJailbird,\" which snagged second place, chronicles a chicken's journey \u2014 from the bird's perspective \u2014 to a human prison in the United Kingdom to take part in a joint-rehabilitation program. And \u201cOne,\u201d a futuristic story by Ricardo Villavicencio and Edward Saatchi about interplanetary travel followed in third place.",
      "The 10 films shown were finalists selected from thousands submitted to Runway's AI Film Festival this year. The shorts will also be shown at screenings held in Los Angeles and Paris next week.",
      "How AI is used and executed is a factor judges evaluate when determining festival winners. But not every film entered was made entirely using AI. While submission criteria requires each movie include the use of AI-generated video, there's no set threshold, meaning some films can take a more \u201cmixed media\u201d approach \u2014 such as combining live shots of actors or real-life images and sounds with AI-generated elements.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to encourage people to explore and experiment with it,\u201d Valenzuela said in an interview prior to Thursday's screening.",
      "Creating a coherent film using generative AI is no easy feat. It can take a long list of directions and numerous, detailed prompts to get even a short scene to make sense and look consistent. Still, the scope of what this kind of technology can do has grown significantly since Runway's first AI Film Festival in 2023 \u2014 and Valenzuela says that's reflected in today's submissions. While there are still limits, AI-generated video is becoming more and more life-like and realistic.",
      "Runway encourages the use of its own AI tools for films entered into its festival, but creators are also allowed to turn to other resources and tools as they put together the films \u2014 and across the industry, tools that use AI to create videos spanning from text, image and/or audio prompts have rapidly improved over recent years, while becoming increasingly available.",
      "\u201cThe way (this technology) has lived within film and media culture, and pop culture, has really accelerated,\u201d said Joshua Glick, an associate professor of film and electronic arts at Bard College.",
      "He adds that Runway's film fest, which is among a handful of showcases aimed at spotlighting AI's creative capabilities, arrives as companies in this space are searching for heightened \u201clegitimacy and recognition\u201d for the tools they are creating \u2014 with aims to cement partnerships in Hollywood as a result.",
      "AI's presence in Hollywood is already far-reaching, and perhaps more expansive than many moviegoers realize. Beyond \u201cheadline-grabbing\u201d (and at times controversial) applications that big-budget films have done to \u201cde-age\u201d actors or create eye-catching stunts, Glick notes, this technology is often incorporated in an array of post-production editing, digital touch-ups and additional behind-the-scenes work like sorting footage.",
      "Industry executives repeatedly point to how AI can improve efficiency in the movie making process \u2014 allowing creatives to perform a task that once took hours, for example, in a matter of minutes \u2014 and foster further innovation.",
      "Still, AI's rapid growth and adoption has also heightened anxieties around the burgeoning technology \u2014 notably its implications for workers.",
      "The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees \u2014 which represents behind-the-scenes entertainment workers in the U.S. and Canada \u2014 has \u201clong embraced new technologies that enhance storytelling,\u201d Vanessa Holtgrewe, IATSE's international vice president, said in an emailed statement. \u201cBut we\u2019ve also been clear: AI must not be used to undermine workers\u2019 rights or livelihoods.\u201d",
      "IATSE and other unions have continued to meet with major studios and establish provisions in efforts to provide guardrails around the use of AI. The Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists has also been vocal about AI protections for its members, a key sticking point in recent labor actions.",
      "For Runway's AI Film Festival, Valenzuela hopes screening films that incorporate AI-generated video can showcase what's possible \u2014 and how he says this technology can help, not hurt, creatives in the work they do today.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s natural to fear change ... (But) it's important to understand what you can do with it,\" Valenzuela said. Even filmmaking, he adds, was born \u201cbecause of scientific breakthroughs that at the time were very uncomfortable for many people.\"",

      "Britain\u2019s competition regulator says Amazon has pledged to beef up its systems to combat fake online reviews",
      "LONDON -- Amazon has pledged to beef up fight against fake reviews, Britain's competition regulator said Friday after an investigation into whether big online platforms are doing enough to crack down on phony online ratings for products and services.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority said it secured the \u201cundertakings\u201d from Amazon, after getting a similar agreement earlier this year from Google to clamp down on rogue reviews plaguing the internet.",
      "The company promised to strengthen its existing systems for fighting fake reviews. It will also tackle catalog abuse, which involves sellers boosting star ratings for a product by hijacking good reviews from a completely different one.",
      "As an example, a shopper might come across a pair of headphones with a five-star rating. But, after looking closer, most of the reviews are for a mobile phone charger, the watchdog said.",
      "As part of its commitments, Amazon has agreed to sanction anyone caught using these tactics. Businesses could be banned from selling on the Amazon website and users posting fake reviews could be banned from posting them, the CMA said.",
      "The watchdog's chief executive, Sarah Cardell, said that so many people shop on Amazon and \u201cstar ratings and reviews have a huge impact on their choices.\u201d",
      "Amazon's pledges \u201cmean people can make decisions with greater confidence \u2013 knowing that those who seek to pull the wool over their eyes will be swiftly dealt with.\u201d",
      "The pledges apply to Amazon's U.K. website. The company said in a statement that it has zero tolerance for fake reviews and that the measures build on Amazon's existing efforts to tackle them.",
      "\u201cWe invest significant resources to proactively stop fake reviews ever appearing on our store, including on expert human investigators and machine learning models that analyse thousands of data points to detect risk,\" the company said.",
      "The CMA opened its investigations into Amazon and Google in 2021 to examine whether the two companies broke U.K. consumer law by failing to protect shoppers. It began looking into phony reviews on some big websites amid the boom in online shopping fueled by the coronavirus pandemic.",

      "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be the next U.S. surgeon general has repeatedly said the nation\u2019s medical, health and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans\u2019 health.",
      "Yet as Dr. Casey Means has criticized scientists, medical schools and regulators for taking money from the food and pharmaceutical industries, she has promoted dozens of health and wellness products \u2014 including specialty basil seed supplements, a blood testing service and a prepared meal delivery service \u2014 in ways that put money in her own pocket.",
      "A review by The Associated Press found Means, who has carved out a niche in the wellness industry, set up deals with an array of businesses.",
      "In her newsletter, on her social media accounts, on her website, in her book and during podcast appearances, the entrepreneur and influencer has at times failed to disclose that she could profit or benefit in other ways from sales of products she recommends. In some cases, she promoted companies in which she was an investor or adviser without consistently disclosing the connection, the AP found.",
      "Means, 37, has said she recommends products that she has personally vetted and uses herself. She is far from the only online creator who doesn\u2019t always follow federal transparency rules that require influencers to disclose when they have a \u201cmaterial connection\u201d to a product they promote.",
      "Still, legal and ethics experts said those business entanglements raise concerns about conflicting interests for an aspiring surgeon general, a role responsible for giving Americans the best scientific information on how to improve their health.",
      "\u201cI fear that she will be cultivating her next employers and her next sponsors or business partners while in office,\u201d said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive ethics watchdog monitoring executive branch appointees.",
      "The nomination, which comes amid a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails, also has raised questions about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded that sells subscriptions for devices that continuously monitor users\u2019 glucose levels, could benefit from this administration\u2019s health guidance and policy.",
      "Though scientists debate whether continuous glucose monitors are beneficial for people without diabetes, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promoted their use as a precursor to making certain weight-loss drugs available to patients.",
      "The aspiring presidential appointee has built her own brand in part by criticizing doctors, scientists and government officials for being \u201cbought off\u201d or \u201ccorrupt\u201d because of ties to industry.",
      "Means' use of affiliate marketing and other methods of making money from her recommendations for supplements, medical tests and other health and dietary products raise questions about the extent to which she is influenced by a different set of special interests: those of the wellness industry.",
      "Means earned her medical degree from Stanford University, but she dropped out of her residency program in Oregon in 2018, and her license to practice is inactive. She has grown her public profile in part with a compelling origin story that seeks to explain why she left her residency and conventional medicine.",
      "\u201cDuring my training as a surgeon, I saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is and left to focus on how to keep people out of the operating room,\u201d she wrote on her website.",
      "Means turned to alternative approaches to address what she has described as widespread metabolic dysfunction driven largely by poor nutrition and an overabundance of ultra-processed foods. She co-founded Levels, a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app that can also give users insights from blood tests and continuous glucose monitors. The company charges $199 per year for an app subscription and an additional $184 per month for glucose monitors.",
      "Means has argued that the medical system is incentivized not to look at the root causes of illness but instead to maintain profits by keeping patients sick and coming back for more prescription drugs and procedures.",
      "\u201cAt the highest level of our medical institutions, there are conflicts of interest and corruption that are actually making the science that we\u2019re getting not as accurate and not as clean as we\u2019d want it,\u201d she said on Megyn Kelly's podcast last year.",
      "But even as Means decries the influence of money on science and medicine, she has made her own deals with business interests.",
      "During the same Megyn Kelly podcast, Means mentioned a frozen prepared food brand, Daily Harvest. She promoted that brand in a book she published last year. What she didn\u2019t mention in either instance: Means had a business relationship with Daily Harvest.",
      "Influencer marketing has expanded beyond the beauty, fashion and travel sectors to \u201cencompass more and more of our lives,\u201d said Emily Hund, author of \u201cThe Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media.\u201d",
      "With more than 825,000 followers on Instagram and a newsletter that she has said reached 200,000 subscribers, Means has a direct line into the social media feeds and inboxes of an audience interested in health, nutrition and wellness.",
      "Affiliate marketing, brand partnerships and similar business arrangements are growing more popular as social media becomes increasingly lucrative for influencers, especially among younger generations. Companies might provide a payment, free or discounted products or other benefits to the influencer in exchange for a post or a mention. But most consumers still don\u2019t realize that a personality recommending a product might make money if people click through and buy, said University of Minnesota professor Christopher Terry.",
      "\u201cA lot of people watch those influencers, and they take what those influencers say as gospel,\u201d said Terry, who teaches media advertising and internet law. Even his own students don\u2019t understand that influencers might stand to benefit from sales of the products they endorse, he added.",
      "Many companies, including Amazon, have affiliate marketing programs in which people with substantial social media followings can sign up to receive a percentage of sales or some other benefit when someone clicks through and buys a product using a special individualized link or code shared by the influencer.",
      "Means has used such links to promote various products sold on Amazon. Among them are books, including the one she co-wrote, \u201cGood Energy\"; a walking pad; soap; body oil; hair products; cardamom-flavored dental floss; organic jojoba oil; a razor set; reusable kitchen products; sunglasses; a sleep mask; a silk pillowcase; fitness and sleep trackers; protein powder and supplements.",
      "She also has shared links to products sold by other companies that included \u201caffiliate\u201d or \u201cpartner\u201d coding, indicating she has a business relationship with the companies. The products include an AI-powered sleep system and Daily Harvest, for which she curated a \u201cmetabolic health collection.\u201d",
      "On a \u201cMy Faves\u201d page that was taken down from her website shortly after Trump picked her, Means wrote that some links \u201care affiliate links and I make a small percentage if you buy something after clicking them.\u201d",
      "It's not clear how much money Means has earned from her affiliate marketing, partnerships and other agreements. Daily Harvest did not return messages seeking comment, and Means said she could not comment on the record during the confirmation process.",
      "Means has raised concerns that scientists, regulators and doctors are swayed by the influence of industry, oftentimes pointing to public disclosures of their connections. In January, she told the Kristin Cavallari podcast \u201cLet\u2019s Be Honest\u201d that \u201crelationships are influential.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s huge money, huge money going to fund scientists from industry,\" Means said. \"We know that when industry funds papers, it does skew outcomes.\u201d",
      "In November, on a podcast run by a beauty products brand, Primally Pure, she said it was \u201cinsanity\u201d to have people connected to the processed food industry involved in writing food guidelines, adding, \u201cWe need unbiased people writing our guidelines that aren\u2019t getting their mortgage paid by a food company.\u201d",
      "On the same podcast, she acknowledged supplement companies sponsor her newsletter, adding, \u201cI do understand how it\u2019s messy.\u201d",
      "Influencers who endorse or promote products in exchange for payment or something else of value are required by the Federal Trade Commission to make a clear and conspicuous disclosure of any business, family or personal relationship. While Means did provide disclosures about newsletter sponsors, the AP found in other cases Means did not always tell her audience when she had a connection to the companies she promoted. For example, a \u201cClean Personal & Home Care Product Recommendations\u201d guide she links to from her website contains two dozen affiliate or partner links and no disclosure that she could profit from any sales.",
      "Means has said she invested in Function Health, which provides subscription-based lab testing for $500 annually. Of the more than a dozen online posts the AP found in which Means mentioned Function Health, more than half did not disclose she had any affiliation with the company.",
      "Means also listed the supplement company Zen Basil as a company for which she was an \u201cInvestor and/or Advisor.\u201d The AP found posts on Instagram, X and on Facebook where Means promoted its products without disclosing the relationship.",
      "Though the \u201cAbout\u201d page on her website discloses an affiliation with both companies, that\u2019s not enough, experts said. She is required to disclose any material connection she has to a company anytime she promotes it.",
      "Representatives for Function Health did not return messages seeking comment through their website and executives' LinkedIn profiles. Zen Basil's founder, Shakira Niazi, did not answer questions about Means' business relationship with the company or her disclosures of it. She said the two had known each other for about four years and called Means' advice \u201ctransformational,\u201d saying her teachings reversed Niazi's prediabetes and other ailments.",
      "\u201cI am proud to sponsor her newsletter through my company,\u201d Niazi said in an email.",
      "While the disclosure requirements are rarely enforced by the FTC, Means should have been informing her readers of any connections regardless of whether she was violating any laws, said Olivier Sylvain, a Fordham Law School professor who was previously a senior adviser to the FTC chair.",
      "\u201cWhat you want in a surgeon general, presumably, is someone who you trust to talk about tobacco, about social media, about caffeinated alcoholic beverages, things that present problems in public health,\u201d Sylvain said, adding, \u201cShould there be any doubt about claims you make about products?\u201d",
      "Means isn\u2019t the first surgeon general nominee whose financial entanglements have raised eyebrows.",
      "Jerome Adams, who served as surgeon general from 2017 to 2021, filed federal disclosure forms that showed he invested in several health technology, insurance and pharmaceutical companies before taking the job \u2014 among them Pfizer, Mylan and UnitedHealth Group. He also invested in the food and drink giant Nestle.",
      "He divested those stocks when he was confirmed for the role and pledged that he and his immediate family would not acquire financial interest in certain industries regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Vivek Murthy, who served as surgeon general twice, under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, made more than $2 million in COVID-19-related speaking and consulting fees from Carnival, Netflix, Estee Lauder and Airbnb between holding those positions. He pledged to recuse himself from matters involving those parties for a period of time.",
      "Means has not yet gone through a Senate confirmation hearing and has not yet announced the ethical commitments she will make for the role.",
      "Hund said that as influencer marketing becomes more common, it is raising more ethical questions, such as what past influencers who enter government should do to avoid the appearance of a conflict.",
      "Other administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, have also promoted companies on social media without disclosing their financial ties.",
      "\u201cThis is like a learning moment in the evolution of our democracy,\u201d Hund said. \u201cIs this a runaway train that we just have to get on and ride, or is this something that we want to go differently?\u201d",

      "As President Donald Trump and Elon Musk argued on social media on Thursday, the world's richest man threatened to decommission a space capsule used to take astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station.",
      "After Trump threatened to cut government contracts given to Musk's SpaceX rocket company and his Starlink internet satellite services, Musk responded via X that SpaceX \"will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.\u201d",
      "It's unclear how serious Musk's threat was. But the capsule, developed with the help of government contracts, is an important part of keeping the space station running. NASA also relies heavily on SpaceX for other programs including launching science missions and, later this decade, returning astronauts to the surface of the moon.",
      "SpaceX is the only U.S. company capable right now of transporting crews to and from the space station, using its four-person Dragon capsules.",
      "Boeing\u2019s Starliner capsule has flown astronauts only once; last year\u2019s test flight went so badly that the two NASA astronauts had to hitch a ride back to Earth via SpaceX in March, more than nine months after launching last June.",
      "Starliner remains grounded as NASA decides whether to go with another test flight with cargo, rather than a crew.",
      "SpaceX also uses a Dragon capsule for its own privately run missions. The next one of those is due to fly next week on a trip chartered by Axiom Space, a Houston company.",
      "Cargo versions of the Dragon capsule are also used to ferry food and other supplies to the orbiting lab.",
      "Russia\u2019s Soyuz capsules are the only other means of getting crews to the space station right now.",
      "The Soyuz capsules hold three people at a time. For now, each Soyuz launch carries two Russians and one NASA astronaut, and each SpaceX launch has one Russian on board under a barter system. That way, in an emergency requiring a capsule to return, there is always someone from the U.S. and Russian on board.",
      "With its first crew launch for NASA in 2020 \u2014 the first orbital flight of a crew by a private company \u2014 SpaceX enabled NASA to reduce its reliance on Russia for crew transport. The Russian flights had been costing the U.S. tens of millions of dollars per seat, for years.",
      "NASA has also used Russian spacecraft for cargo, along with U.S. contractor Northrup Grumman.",
      "The company has used its rockets to launch several science missions for NASA as well as military equipment.",

      "SpaceX\u2019s Starship mega rocket is what NASA has picked to get astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface of the moon, at least for the first two landing missions. Starship made its ninth test flight last week from Texas, but tumbled out of control and broke apart.",

      "\"This is the first, perhaps, of many,\" Trump said of the deployment of 4,000 National Guardsmen and 700 Marines to Los Angeles as demonstrators clash with law enforcement amid the protests.",
      "Demonstrators have clashed with law enforcement sporadically for days, and Trump called in the National Guard, against Gov. Gavin Newsom's wishes, in an attempt to quell the violence and allow immigration enforcement to continue.",
      "\"You know, if we didn't attack this one very strongly, you'd have them all over the country, but I can inform the rest of the country, that when they do it, if they do it, they're going to be met with equal or greater force,\" Trump continued.",
      "The president's threats come as California's leaders and 22 Democratic governors decry Trump's show of force as a breach of the state's sovereignty and a provocative escalation.",
      "Trump's words were echoed in testimony given by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth during a congressional hearing on Capitol Hill earlier in the day.",
      "\"So in Los Angeles, we believe that ICE, which is a federal law enforcement agency, has the right to safely conduct operations in any state, in any jurisdiction in the country,\" Hegseth said. \"ICE agents should be allowed to be safe and doing their operations, and we have deployed National Guard and the Marines to protect them in the execution of their duties, because we ought to be able to enforce ... immigration law in this country.\"",
      "The president suggested he is open to invoking the Insurrection Act in response to the protests. The act authorizes the president to deploy military forces inside the United States to suppress rebellion or violence.",
      "The National Guard and Marines, under Trump's current authorization, are not allowed to act in a law enforcement capacity because of the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act.",
      "\"There were areas of Los Angeles last night where you could call it an insurrection,\" Trump said.",
      "Trump repeated claims, without evidence, that the protesters are \"paid insurrectionists.\" He decried some protesters who were damaging streets and targeting members of the National Guard.",
      "Despite claims from Trump that there were fires and \"bad scenes\" on Monday night, there wasn't anything all that violent. ABC News observed police moved protesters using skirmish lines and less lethal rounds around the city for a few hours, but there was no widespread violence compared to the weekend.",

      "The original plan from major progressive organizing group Indivisible and others to counter the military parade with protests was first announced in early May. But Indivisible Co-Executive Director Ezra Levin told MSNBC on Monday night that President Donald Trump\u2019s response to protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Los Angeles has brought many more people to the No Kings website, and that the group has scheduled more trainings this week in response to the \u201coverwhelming interest.\u201d",
      "In its May news release announcing the events, Indivisible said that the parade is meant to be a \"made-for-TV display of dominance for [Trump's] birthday\" and that the president is using the military's birthday to celebrate his own, which also falls on June 14.",
      "Last month, when asked about reports of the military parade by NBC News, Trump said the parade plans were \u201cnot for my birthday\u201d but are for Flag Day and to celebrate the military. The Pentagon and Army have said they are planning their own birthday celebration and not planning to sing \u201chappy birthday\u201d to the president.",
      "Indivisible has also called out what it says is overreach by the White House against courts and slammed deportations and administration actions it said have hurt civil rights and decimated services people need.",
      "\u201cThis country doesn\u2019t belong to a king -- and we\u2019re not letting him throw himself a parade funded by tens of millions of our taxpayer dollars while stealing from us and stripping away our rights, our freedoms, and the programs our families rely on,\u201d Indivisible said in a statement last month. \u201cOn June 14th, we\u2019re coming together to send one clear message: No Thrones. No Crowns. No Kings.\u201d",
      "In a press release on Friday, Indivisible said in addition to locations across the country, there are events planned in Europe and South America.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump and his regime are cracking down on media, on business, on higher education, and on civil society more broadly -- anyone who opposes them,\" Indivisible co-executive director Leah Greenberg said in a statement Friday. \"That is the context in which Donald Trump rolled out his plans for his birthday parade ... He wants people to think that his power is inevitable, that its consolidation is a given. What we want is to show that it\u2019s just as likely -- more likely, even -- that this is going to be a short-lived era.\u201d",
      "In a \u201ctoolkit\u201d document for organizers posted on their website, Indivisible and the coalition of more than 200 groups overseeing the events gave instructions for how people can assemble and register their own protests, but asked that organizers not schedule any events in Washington, D.C., in order to make other places the \u201ccenter of gravity,\u201d and because the coalition wants to draw a contrast with Trump.",
      "The document also asks participants to keep the protests nonviolent and to de-escalate any confrontations between protesters and others, and say weapons should not be brought to the events.",
      "Indivisible was also among the groups organizing the widely attended national \u201cHands Off\u201d protests in April.",
      "Organizers of the protests are cognizant of the \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests coming amid the White House\u2019s crackdown on protests in Los Angeles, but they express confidence in running their events successfully and say they\u2019ve gotten even more interest now.",
      "\u201cWe do not want to give Trump an excuse to crack down on peaceful protests, which is exactly what he wants to do. We don't want to give him some sort of narrative excuse to say protesters are protesting the military \u2026 This is a democracy. And in a democracy, power depends on the people. It flows from the people. It depends on the consent of the governed, and on Saturday we're going to show up to make that point very clear,\u201d Levin told MSNBC.",

      "A federal grand jury returned a three-count indictment on Tuesday.",
      "A federal grand jury has returned an indictment charging New Jersey Rep. LaMonica McIver for allegedly assaulting law enforcement officers outside of an immigration detention facility last month, officials announced Tuesday.",
      "The three-count indictment charges the Democratic congresswoman with \"forcibly impeding and interfering with federal law enforcement officers\" at the facility, New Jersey U.S. Attorney Alina Habba said in a post on X.",
      "\"As I have stated in the past, it is my Constitutional obligation as the Chief Federal Law Enforcement Officer for New Jersey to ensure that our federal partners are protected when executing their duties,\" Habba said. \"While people are free to express their views for or against particular policies, they must not do so in a manner that endangers law enforcement and the communities those officers serve.\"",

      "\"The facts of this case will prove I was simply doing my job and will expose these proceedings for what they are: a brazen attempt at political intimidation,\" she said in a statement on X. \"This indictment is no more justified than the original charges, and is an effort by Trump's administration to dodge accountability for the chaos ICE caused and scare me out of doing the work I was elected to do. But it won't work -- I will not be intimidated.\"",

    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says President Trump has the right to send troops to \"any state, in any jurisdiction in the country,\"",
    "story": [
      "Pentagon budget official estimated LA troop deployment to cost $134 million.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told lawmakers Tuesday that he and President Donald Trump have the power to send National Guard and active-duty troops anywhere in the country to ensure Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can enforce the law, an assertion that -- if carried out -- would open the door to a historic clash between Trump and Democratic governors.",
      "\"We believe that ICE, which is a federal law enforcement agency, has the right to safely conduct operations in any state, in any jurisdiction in the country,\" Hegseth told the House Appropriations Defense subcommittee.",
      "\"ICE ought be able to do its job, whether it's Minneapolis or Los Angeles,\" he added.",
      "Hegseth's testimony before a House panel came as some 4,800 National Guard and Marines were en route to Los Angeles for a 60-day deployment after protestors clashed with law enforcement, setting cars on fire and spraying graffiti on buildings.",
      "President Donald Trump also opened the door for possible military deployments elsewhere, telling reporters on Tuesday that if protests break out in other states \"they will be met with equal or greater force.\"",
      "The move to call in U.S. troops, including 700 Marines, ignored objections by state authorities and was sharply criticized by Democratic lawmakers and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who called the deployment inflammatory and warned it would only escalate tensions.",
      "At Tuesday's hearing, Rep. Betty McCollum of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the House subcommittee, called the decision \"premature\" and \"downright escalatory.\" She said Marines aren't suited for a domestic mission in which they could be asked to use their combat training and firepower, typically reserved for foreign adversaries, on Americans.",
      "\"Active-duty military has absolutely no role in domestic law enforcement, and they are not trained for those missions. I ask you, Mister secretary, and I ask the president, follow the law,\" she said.",
      "The Pentagon's top acting budget official, Bryn Woollacott MacDonnell, estimated the deployment would cost $134 million and said the money would be pulled from existing operations and maintenance accounts.",
      "The Trump administration said the troops are being used under a legal authority known as Title 10 of the U.S. Code, which allows the president to deploy military forces to protect federal buildings and personnel in cases of \"a rebellion or danger of rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States\" or when \"the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\"",
      "U.S. officials said the \"rules for force\" for such an engagement would restrict troops from patrolling U.S. streets or helping law enforcement arrest protestors. Troops would carry guns and ammunition separately for use only in self-defense and to protect federal property.",
      "But experts say the rules of protecting federal buildings and personnel could get murky if service members are asked to protect ICE personnel during an immigration raid or if protestors attack buildings.",
      "Rachel VanLandingham, a professor at Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles and former chief legal advisor to U.S. Central Command, said she is skeptical that Marines who are trained to fight and win foreign wars are sufficiently trained to police Americans.",
      "\"Protection means you protect by using force. So, what kind of force are we using? What kind of forces are they trained to use?\" she told ABC's \"Start Here\" podcast.",
      "\"You fight like you train,\" and \"they have never trained to be working with the National Guard in this capacity,\" she added.",
      "Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Eric Smith said that the 700 Marines were trained in crowd control as part of their standard annual training protocols. He noted the Marines were equipped with shields and batons.",
      "\"I would say that all Marines are trained in crowd control, embassy reinforcement, etc. So, this is part of their training,\" Smith told the Senate Armed Services Committee.",
      "When asked how much training in crowd control they received, Smith said he believed it was \"in excess of two hours.\"",
      "Sen. Elissa Slotkin, a Michigan Democrat, said she was skeptical that amount was adequate, noting police forces typically receive 600 hours of crowd control training by comparison.",
      "\"I don't question that these things in LA have gotten violent. That's not my question, and I condemn it. I'm worried about the reputation of the US military in the United States of America,\" she said, adding that Marines were \"designed\" to be lethal.",
      "\"The idea that an apolitical military, which we all should cherish and value, are now going to be thrown into a situation\" isn't right, she said. \"We don't need them to create a dramatic story.\"",
      "Still in question is whether Trump is considering to escalate the situation by invoking the Insurrection Act, an 1807 law that says the president can call on a militia or the U.S. armed forces if there's been \"any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy\" in a state that \"opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws.\" Such a declaration, which incredibly rare, would effectively turn U.S. troops into his own police force that could be used against protestors.",
      "The Insurrection Act has been invoked in response to 30 crises over its history, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, including by presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy to desegregate schools after the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in Brown v. Board of Education.",
      "The hearing was supposed to be a review of President Donald Trump's upcoming budget, which has not been released. Hegseth spoke only in broad strokes about the military's spending plan, instead highlighting recent gains in recruiting numbers and speaking in general about the importance of new technology initiatives in the Army.",
      "On his Truth Social platform on Sunday, Trump referred to the L.A. protesters as \"violent, insurrectionist mobs\" and \"paid insurrectionists.\"",
      "The Pentagon has not had a news conference since the deployment of troops to Los Angeles, referring reporters with questions about the mission on Monday to Hegseth's posts on the social media site X.",
      "Following his testimony, Hegseth traveled with the president to Fort Bragg in North Carolina to participate in activities tied to the Army's 250th birthday celebration.",

      "Huerta was released on bond this week, after three days in custody.",
      "Authorities released labor leader David Huerta on bond this week, days after his arrest for allegedly obstructing federal officers while protesting an immigration raid in Los Angeles.",
      "Huerta, the 58-year-old California president of the Service Employees International Union, one of the nation\u2019s largest labor unions, said he remains focused on immigrants detained in LA.",
      "An advocate for workers and immigrants in Southern California for decades, Huerta has become a flashpoint in an ongoing standoff between federal immigration enforcement officers and protesters.",
      "Since protests broke out in LA on Friday in response to immigration raids, the Trump administration has deployed 4,000 National Guardsmen and 700 Marines to the area. Some demonstrators have damaged property but the protests have been largely peaceful.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about David Huerta:",
      "Huerta was arrested while demonstrating against an immigration raid at a workplace in downtown LA. He was charged with conspiracy to impede an officer, a felony that carries a prison sentence of up to six years.",
      "Federal law describes the offense as the use of \u201cforce, intimidation, or threat\u201d by two or more people to prevent federal officers from carrying out their duties, according to 18 U.S. Code Section 372.",
      "Huerta arrived at a metal gate near the workplace in the late morning on Friday, according to a criminal complaint, which alleged Huerta shouted expletives and banged on the gate in an effort to intimidate federal agents.",
      "As a white law enforcement van approached the gate, Huerta stood in the path of the vehicle with his hands on his hips, the criminal complaint said.",
      "When officers asked protesters to clear the way, Huerta refused, the complaint added, saying an officer \u201cput his hands on Huerta\u201d in an attempt to move him out of the way of the vehicle. According to the complaint, Huerta then pushed the officer and the officer tackled him, ultimately putting Huerta in handcuffs.",
      "In a post on X on Friday, U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli described the arrest of Huerta, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t care who you are\u2014if you impede federal agents, you will be arrested and prosecuted.\u201d",
      "Some union leaders and Democratic U.S. House members criticized the arrest as an effort to intimidate protesters and criminalize peaceful demonstrations.",
      "Democratic Rep. Judy Chu, whose district includes part of Los Angeles, said in a statement that federal authorities had sought to \u201csilence those who dare to speak out against the Trump Administration\u2019s cruel and unlawful immigration agenda.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is clear that SEIU President David Huerta was exercising his right to observe law enforcement activity and stand with community in peaceful protest to these raids,\u201d Chu added.",
      "After his arrest, Huerta was taken to a hospital, where he was treated for a head injury. He then entered federal custody. Authorities released Huerta on Monday on $50,000 bond.",
      "Huerta did not enter a plea, and his arraignment is scheduled for July 7, Courthouse News Service reported.",
      "\u201cIt was not my intention to get arrested,\u201d Huerta told reporters outside the courthouse after his release, appearing to hold back tears.",
      "Huerta said his focus remains on immigrants detained by federal officers. \u201cWhile we\u2019re here and there are protests outside, that means, in there, they are on lockdown,\u201d Huerta said.",
      "Huerta is a longtime organizer and labor leader at the Service Employees International Union, which boasts 2.2 million members nationwide.",
      "He began his career as a California-based organizer with Janitors for Justice, a nationwide labor campaign that sought to raise wages and improve working conditions for cleaners at commercial buildings. The workforce \u2013 made up largely of immigrants \u2013 won concessions from employers in a number of major cities, including Los Angeles.",
      "Over a decades-long tenure at SEIU, Huerta oversaw organizing campaigns involving thousands of janitors and other service workers. He also led efforts to bring immigrant workers into the organization\u2019s activities, including English classes for union members.",
      "President Barack Obama awarded Huerta as a National Champion of Change in 2014.",
      "In 2022, Huerta was elected president of the California SEIU, which counts 750,000 union members.",
      "The union helped spearhead an effort to win a $20 an hour minimum wage for some 500,000 fast food workers throughout California, many of whom are immigrants. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, signed into law in November 2023 a measure enshrining the elevated minimum wage for fast food workers. The law took effect last April.",

      "President Donald Trump likes to say he\u2019s bringing in trillions of dollars in investments from foreign countries",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump likes to say he's bringing in trillions of dollars in investments from foreign countries, but a provision in his tax cuts bill could cause international companies to avoid expanding into the United States.",
      "The House-passed version of the legislation would allow the federal government to impose taxes on foreign-parented companies and investors from countries judged as charging \u201cunfair foreign taxes\u201d on U.S. companies.",
      "Known as Section 899, the measure could cause companies to avoid investing in the the U.S. out of concern they could face steep taxes. The fate of the measure rests with the Senate \u2014 setting off a debate about its prospects and impact.",
      "A new analysis by the Global Business Alliance, a trade group representing international companies such as Toyota and Nestl\u00e9, estimates that the provision would cost the U.S. 360,000 jobs and $55 billion annually over 10 years in lost gross domestic product. The analysis estimates that the tax could cut a third off the economic growth anticipated from the overall tax cuts by Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation.",
      "\"While proponents say this punitive tax hike is intended as a retaliatory measure against foreign governments, this report confirms that the real victims are American workers in states like North Carolina, South Carolina, Indiana, Tennessee and Texas,\" said Jonathan Samford, president and CEO of the Global Business Alliance.",
      "Republican Rep. Jason Smith of Missouri, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, has defended the provision as protecting U.S. interests by giving the president a tool that can be used against countries with tax codes that, in the federal government's opinion, put American companies at a disadvantage.",
      "\u201cIf these countries withdraw these taxes and decide to behave, we will have achieved our goal,\" Smith said in a statement last week. \"It\u2019s just common sense. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to move quickly to pass this bill and protect Americans from economic bad actors around the world.\u201d",
      "The tax gets at a fundamental tension within Trump's policy agenda: a contradiction in the broad strokes of Trump simultaneously trying to tax imports and foreign profits at higher rates while also seeking investments from companies headquartered abroad.",
      "In late May, Trump defended his approach by saying that his tariffs were causing more countries to invest in the U.S. to avoid imports getting taxed. While some countries and companies have made announcements, there is not evidence of the investments pushing up spending on new factories as measured in the government's monthly report on construction spending.",
      "The Republican president said his tendency to impose steep tariffs, then retreat to lower rates, had succeeded.",
      "\u201cWe have $14 trillion now invested, committed to investing,\u201d Trump said then. \u201cYou know we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. I went to Saudi Arabia, the king told me, he said, you got the hottest -- we have the hottest country in the world right now.\u201d",
      "The Global Business Alliance was among the groups that signed a letter on Monday warning of the consequences of Section 899 to Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo of Idaho, both Republicans.",
      "The Investment Company Institute, representing financial firms, said the provision \u201ccould limit foreign investment to the U.S. \u2014 a key driver of growth in American capital markets that ultimately benefits American families saving for their futures.\u201d",
      "The analysis performed by EY Quantitative Economics and Statistics notes there is a degree of uncertainty in how the taxes under Section 899 could be implemented. But they could be charged against companies based in countries that tax digital services, as is the case in parts of Europe.",
      "If the U.S. judged the taxes unfair, there would be a 30% tax rate on foreign companies' profits and income. People working in the U.S. for the companies who are not citizens could also be taxed, among other provisions.",
      "The possibility of the taxes and seemingly arbitrary nature by which they could be imposed is also a challenge, said Chye-Ching Huang, executive director of New York University's Tax Law Center.",
      "\u201cSection 899 creates a game of political chicken with trade partners that risks harming businesses, consumers, and workers in the hopes of securing US multinationals the ability to shift more of their profits out of the US to tax havens,\" Huang said in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s a high-risk strategy that could expand the damage of the failed tariff war.\u201d",
      "There could also be political repercussions if key states in Trump's political coalition from 2024 suffer layoffs or simply find job growth slowing. The Global Business Alliance finds job losses could amount to 44,200 in Florida, 27,700 in Pennsylvania, 24,500 in North Carolina and 23,500 in Michigan.",

      "President Donald Trump defended his decision to send the National Guard troops to Los Angeles to quash protests that turned violent, saying in a social media post on Sunday that \"if we had not done so, Los Angeles would have been completely obliterated.\"",
      "Trump alleged the nation's second largest city, which covers more than 500 square miles, had been \"invaded and occupied by illegal aliens and criminals\" and that he had directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Attorney General Pam Bondi to coordinate with all relevant agencies to \"take all such actions necessary to liberate Los Angeles from the Migrant Invasion, and put an end to these Migrant riots.\"",
      "While Trump has painted Los Angeles as being under siege and out of control, most of the demonstrations this past weekend over his administration's crackdown on illegal immigration has been concentrated in downtown Los Angeles near the federal building and federal detention center. Other protests have also occurred outside of the downtown area, one in the Los Angeles County city of Paramount, about 14 miles from downtown, and another in Compton, which is next to Paramount, and about 12 miles from downtown LA, according to local law enforcement.",
      "Meanwhile the rest of Los Angeles appeared to go about life as normal over the weekend. The city's annual Pride Parade even took place on Sunday without incident in Hollywood about 7 miles from downtown.",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom have accused Trump of making sensational public claims about how widespread the violence has been, and both have said the Los Angeles police and sheriff's departments could handle the unrest on their own.",
      "\"He flamed the fires and illegally acted\" by mobilizing the National Guard to go to LA without the conscent of local and state officials, Newsom said of the president in a statement on Monday posted on social media. \"The order he signed doesn\u2019t just apply to CA. It will allow him to go into ANY STATE and do the same thing. We\u2019re suing him.\"",
      "On Monday, a U.S. official confirmed that 700 Marines in California have been ordered to assist in Los Angeles and they\u2019re expected to arrive over the next 24 hours, a U.S. official confirmed.",
      "LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell has decried the escalation of violence during the protests, saying officers had been targeted with Molotov cocktails, fireworks and rocks.",
      "But he also said Monday that the arrival of the military troops in Los Angeles \"presents a significant logistical and operation challenge for those of us charged with safeguarding this city.\"",
      "\"The Los Angeles Police Department, alongside our mutual aid partners, has decades of experience managing large-scale public demonstrations, and we remain confident in our ability to do so professionally and effectively. That said, our top priority is the safety of both the public and the officers on the ground,\" McDonnell said.",
      "At a news conference Monday evening, as the protests entered their fourth night -- with some tense confrontations between protesters and police leading to the firing of less lethal munitions by police -- Bass insisted the city could handle the unrest on its own.",
      "Asked about the deployment of the Marines, Bass responded incredulously.",
      "\"We didn't need the National Guard,\" she told reporters. \"Why on earth -- what are they going to do? Do you know what the National Guard is doing now? They are guarding two buildings. They're guarding the federal building here in downtown and they're guarding the federal building in Westwood. That's what they're doing. So they need Marines on top of it, I don't understand that.\"",
      "Trump bypassed Newsom and activated 2,100 California National Guard troops, including 1,700 on the ground in Los Angeles as of Monday night and the remainder on standby to be sent there, the U.S. Northern Command said in a social media post late Monday night. It marks the first time a president has mobilized troops without a governor's consent since President Lyndon B. Johnson did so in 1965, when he sent National Guard troops to Alabama to protect civil rights activists marching from Selma to Montgomery.",
      "Protest erupts",
      "The protests erupted on Friday in downtown Los Angeles after word filtered into the community that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents were conducting raids on multiple locations in the downtown area without the consent of city officials, including a Home Depot in the Westlake neighborhood near downtown. The raids resulted in the arrests of 40 people, 35 of them Mexican citizens, Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Sunday.",
      "Dozens of protesters began gathering in the Fashion District of downtown, where one of the raids occurred at an apparel business, officials said. Around 3 p.m. local time on Friday, aerial footage taken by ABC Los Angeles station KABC, showed what appeared to be ICE agents loading two white vans with people in handcuffs. As the vans left the apparel business, protesters tried unsuccessfully to stop them, including one individual who was seen lying down in the path of one of the vans.",
      "As the raids were unfolding on Friday, Mayor Bass, issued a post on X, condemning ICE's actions, writing, \"we will not stand for this.\"",
      "Around 6 p.m. on Friday, crowds gathered outside the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building and the U.S. Courthouse downtown and began vandalizing the buildings, spay painting profanities directed at ICE on the facade and clashing with ICE agents. Federal authorities asked the LAPD to assist around 6:30 p.m., but it took city officers about an hour to arrive at the scene due to \"significant traffic congestions, and the presence of demonstrators, and notably, by the fact that federal agents had deployed irritants into the crowd prior to LAPD's arrival.\"",
      "The LAPD declared the protest an \"unlawful assembly\" soon after officers arrived on scene on Friday night, writing on social media that \"officers are reporting that a small group of violent individuals are throwing large pieces of concrete\" and warning protesters that \"the use of less lethal munitions has been authorized by the Incident Commander\" to disperse the crowd.",
      "\"Within 55 minutes of receiving the call, we began to disperse the hostile and riotous crowd,\" the LAPD said.",
      "Video showed police in riot gear confronting protesters with batons and firing what appeared to be tear gas canisters and flash bangs at the demonstators.",
      "Demonstration moves to Paramount",
      "On Saturday, the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department received calls around 10:15 a.m. that a \"significant\" crowd was gathering in Paramount and obstructing traffic and that deputies observed the presence of federal agents in the area.",
      "\"As the situation escalated, the crowd of protesters became increasingly agitated, throwing objects and exhibiting violent behavior toward federal agents and deputy sheriffs,\" the sheriff's department said in a statement. \"In response, the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department (LASD) requested additional resources countywide, deploying additional deputies to maintain order.\"",
      "The sheriff's department said it responded to the scene to protect federal agents under attack, but emphasized, \"This does not mean that we are assisting with their immigration actions or operations.\"",
      "Bass said that there were no ICE raids in Paramount or anywhere else in Los Angeles County on Saturday. She said the building that protesters gathered near was being used as a staging area for federal resources.",
      "Around the same time, a protest broke out in neighboring Compton, where a vehicle was set ablaze in the street near the iconic Dale's Donuts sign, according to video taken at the scene.",
      "The LAPD said 29 people were arrested during Saturday's protest, mostly for failing to disperse, but overall it said in a statement that demonstrations across the city of Los Angeles on Saturday \"remained peaceful, and we commend all those who exercised their First Amendment rights responsibly.\"",
      "Trump deploys National Guard",
      "On Saturday night, Trump signed a presidential memorandum authorizing the deployment of National Guard members to Los Angeles, saying it was necessary to \"address the lawlessness\" in Los Angeles.",
      "Newsom called Trump's move, \"purposely inflammatory and will only escalate tensions.\"",
      "Bass agreed and issued a plea to the White House to reverse the decision.",
      "\"Deploying federalized troops on the heels of these raids is a chaotic escalation,\" Bass said in a statement posted on social media on Saturday afternoon. \"The fear people are feeling in our city right now is very real -- it's felt in our communities and within our families and it puts our neighborhoods at risk. This is the last thing that our city needs, and I urge protestors to remain peaceful.\"",
      "Newsom called the president's decision \"an alarming abuse of power.\"",
      "Around 2:18 a.m. local time time on Sunday, the LAPD issued a traffic advisory, reporting that demonstrators were approaching the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles and warned that the unlawful assembly order declared on Friday was still in effect. Around the same time, the LAPD said it received reports that demonstrators were jumping onto the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation tracks near the Little Tokyo Train Station downtown, causing all trains to be halted as officers reponded.",
      "The National Guard began arriving in Los Angeles around 4 a.m. on Sunday, taking up a position outside the Roybal federal building.",
      "Protesters who defied the order to stay away, assembled in front of the Roybal federal building, heckling National Guard members and police within earshot. Around 3:30 p.m., the LAPD issued another traffic advisory that a group of demonstrators was marching into the downtown area.",
      "Later Sunday, demonstrators began approaching to 101 Freeway and eventually got onto the southbound lanes of the freeway, prompting authorities to close the freeway in both directions, police said.",
      "The protest soon devolved into demonstrators standing on an overpass throwing concrete, bottles and other objects at officers attempting to remove demonstrators from the freeway.",
      "As the protest grew more rowdy, several Waymo autonomous vehicles were set on fire in the downtown area, prompting the company to halt service to downtown LA. Police said protesters threw fireworks at officers during the standoff and police said stores were looted in the downtown area.",
      "Officials said two LAPD officers were injured by motorcyclists attempting to breach a skirmish line police had established.",
      "The LAPD said 21 people were arrested on Sunday on charges ranging from attempted murder with a Molotov cocktail to looting to failure to disperse. The California Highway Patrol said 19 people were arrested for disobeying orders to disperse from the 101 Freeway.",
      "The LAPD announced on Monday that the police force was going on \"Tactical Alert,\" meaning all personnel are to remain on duty as the city braced for another evening of protests.",
      "As protests in Los Angeles entered their fourth night, photos from the scene showed tense moments as demonstrators confronted authorities.",
      "At one point, police said protesters near Temple Street and Los Angeles Street in downtown LA began throwing objects at police and police authorized the use of \"less lethal munitions\" in response.",

      "The institution, which is the world's largest museum, education and research complex, sent the statement after a Monday Board of Regents meeting with Vice President JD Vance and Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts, according to a document the Smithsonian sent ABC News on Monday.",
      "Board of Regent meetings are held at least four times a year. Vance and Roberts are both ex officio members, meaning they act in advisory roles.",
      "\"All personnel decisions are made by and subject to the direction of the Secretary, with oversight by the Board,\" the Smithsonian said in its statement. \"Lonnie G. Bunch, the Secretary, has the support of the Board of Regents in his authority and management of the Smithsonian.\"",

Gary Peters (D-MI); Representatives selected by the Speaker of the House, including Rep. Doris Matsui (D-CA), Rep. Adrian Smith (R-NE) and Rep. Carlos Gimenez (R-FL); and nine Citizen Regents, according to a document the Smithsonian sent ABC News on Monday.",
      "The Smithsonian's statement comes after Trump's May 30 announcement on social media that he fired Sajet, the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery director. He described Sajet as \"a highly partisan person, and a strong supporter of DEI, which is totally inappropriate for her position.\"",
      "Sajet rejected artist Julian Raven's 2016 Trump painting for submission in the National Portrait Gallery, according to a statement from a Smithsonian spokesperson on Tuesday. She is still reporting to work at the Portrait Gallery, the spokesperson noted.",

For that, we must all work to do better,\" Bunch, the board secretary, said in a message to Smithsonian staff on Monday after the board meeting.",
      "\"Our institution must be a place where people feel inspired and challenged, but most importantly feel welcome. ... As always, we thank the President and Congress for their steady commitment to the Smithsonian and to preserving it for our visitors and our country.\"",
      "The museum also appeared to address the Trump administration's concerns about biased content and staff at the institution in its statement on Monday.",

    "story": [
      "After a bruising war between Israel and Hezbollah, Lebanon\u2019s new leaders sense an opportunity to revitalize the country\u2019s devastated economy with help from its wealthy Gulf neighbors",
      "BEIRUT -- Fireworks lit up the night sky over Beirut\u2019s famous St. Georges Hotel as hit songs from the 1960s and 70s filled the air in a courtyard overlooking the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "The retro-themed event was hosted last month by Lebanon\u2019s Tourism Ministry to promote the upcoming summer season and perhaps recapture some of the good vibes from an era viewed as a golden one for the country. In the years before a civil war began in 1975, Lebanon was the go-to destination for wealthy tourists from neighboring Gulf countries seeking beaches in summer, snow-capped mountains in winter and urban nightlife year-round.",
      "In the decade after the war, tourists from Gulf countries \u2013 and crucially, Saudi Arabia \u2013 came back, and so did Lebanon\u2019s economy. But by the early 2000s, as the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah gained power, Lebanon's relations with Gulf countries began to sour. Tourism gradually dried up, starving its economy of billions of dollars in annual spending.",
      "Now, after last year's bruising war with Israel, Hezbollah is much weaker and Lebanon's new political leaders sense an opportunity to revitalize the economy once again with help from wealthy neighbors. They aim to disarm Hezbollah and rekindle ties with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries, which in recent years have prohibited their citizens from visiting Lebanon or importing its products.",
      "\u201cTourism is a big catalyst, and so it\u2019s very important that the bans get lifted,\u201d said Laura Khazen Lahoud, the country's tourism minister.",
      "On the highway leading to the Beirut airport, once-ubiquitous banners touting Hezbollah\u2019s leadership have been replaced with commercial billboards and posters that read \u201ca new era for Lebanon.\u201d In the center of Beirut, and especially in neighborhoods that hope to attract tourists, political posters are coming down, and police and army patrols are on the rise.",
      "There are signs of thawing relations with some Gulf neighbors. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have lifted yearslong travel bans.",
      "All eyes are now on Saudi Arabia, a regional political and economic powerhouse, to see if it will follow suit, according to Lahoud and other Lebanese officials. A key sticking point is security, these officials say. Although a ceasefire with Israel has been in place since November, near-daily airstrikes have continued in southern and eastern Lebanon, where Hezbollah over the years had built its political base and powerful military arsenal.",
      "As vital as tourism is \u2014 it accounted for almost 20% of Lebanon's economy before it tanked in 2019 \u2014 the country's leaders say it is just one piece of a larger puzzle they are trying to put back together.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s agricultural and industrial sectors are in shambles, suffering a major blow in 2021, when Saudi Arabia banned their exports after accusing Hezbollah of smuggling drugs into Riyadh. Years of economic dysfunction have left the country's once-thriving middle class in a state of desperation.",
      "The World Bank says poverty nearly tripled in Lebanon over the past decade, affecting close to half its population of nearly 6 million. To make matters worse, inflation is soaring, with the Lebanese pound losing 90% of its value, and many families lost their savings when banks collapsed.",
      "Tourism is seen by Lebanon's leaders as the best way to kickstart the reconciliation needed with Gulf countries -- and only then can they move on to exports and other economic growth opportunities.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the thing that makes most sense, because that\u2019s all Lebanon can sell now,\u201d said Sami Zoughaib, research manager at The Policy Initiative, a Beirut-based think tank.",
      "With summer still weeks away, flights to Lebanon are already packed with expats and locals from countries that overturned their travel bans, and hotels say bookings have been brisk.",
      "At the event hosted last month by the tourism ministry, the owner of the St. Georges Hotel, Fady El-Khoury, beamed. The hotel, owned by his father in its heyday, has acutely felt Lebanon's ups and downs over the decades, closing and reopening multiple times because of wars. \u201cI have a feeling that the country is coming back after 50 years,\u201d he said.",
      "On a recent weekend, as people crammed the beaches of the northern city of Batroun, and jet skis whizzed along the Mediterranean, local business people sounded optimistic that the country was on the right path.",
      "\u201cWe are happy, and everyone here is happy,\u201d said Jad Nasr, co-owner of a private beach club. \u201cAfter years of being boycotted by the Arabs and our brothers in the Gulf, we expect this year for us to always be full.\u201d",
      "Still, tourism is not a panacea for Lebanon's economy, which for decades has suffered from rampant corruption and waste.",
      "Lebanon has been in talks with the International Monetary Fund for years over a recovery plan that would include billions in loans and require the country to combat corruption, restructure its banks, and bring improvements to a range of public services, including electricity and water.",
      "Without those and other reforms, Lebanon's wealthy neighbors will lack confidence to invest there, experts said. A tourism boom alone would serve as a \u201cmorphine shot that would only temporarily ease the pain\" rather than stop the deepening poverty in Lebanon, Zoughaib said.",
      "The tourism minister, Lahoud, agreed, saying a long-term process has only just begun.",
      "\"But we\u2019re talking about subjects we never talked about before,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think the whole country has realized that war doesn\u2019t serve anyone, and that we really need our economy to be back and flourish again.\u201d",

      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- The health of the Chesapeake Bay declined in an annual report card on the nation's largest estuary released Tuesday, with scientists noting the effect of extreme rainfall patterns during the hottest year on record.",
      "The University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science gave the bay a C grade in its report card. That compares to a C-plus grade the bay received last year, which was the highest grade it had received since 2002.",
      "\u201cThere was a substantial upturn in the overall Bay Health score in 2024, and it came down a little this year,\" said Heath Kelsey, director of UMCES Integration and Application Network. \"Over the long term, though, there is still an improving trend from the 1980s until now. We think extreme weather may have had some impact on the scores this year.\u201d",
      "The report noted that last year was the hottest year on record, with extreme rainfall patterns.",
      "\u201cWhile parts of the watershed experienced drought, brief but intense downpours can cause water to flow over the ground rather than soak into it, increasing the fertilizer, dirt, and debris carried into waterways,\u201d the report said.",
      "Bill Dennison, vice president for Science Application at UMCES, said the changing climate is definitely having an effect on the bay.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that we saw in Maryland, in particular, was a prolonged summer drought \u2014 not so much spring, but a summer drought \u2014 punctuated by these extreme runoff events,\u201d Dennison said. \u201cSo what was happening was that the crops didn't have enough water, so they're not soaking up the nutrients.\"",
      "As a result, when it did rain, there were excess nutrients, like nitrogen and phosphorus, that were flowing into the bay, Dennison said.",
      "\u201cNow sadly, this is kind of our future,\" Dennison said at a news conference at the Annapolis Maritime Museum near the bay. \u201cThis is the kind of weather patterns that are starting to become more common, which is drought punctuated by extreme events.\u201d",
      "Warmer weather winters and higher temperatures mean less oxygen in the water for aquatic life, stressing fish and shellfish, Dennison added.",
      "\u201cSo these are some of the things that we have to overcome and build more resilience into our system,\u201d Dennison said.",
      "Despite the grade drop, the report cited long-term improvements in dissolved oxygen in the bay's waters. That's the amount of oxygen present in the water that is needed to support bay aquatic life.",
      "The report also noted long-term improvements in aquatic grasses, which provide habitat and food for various species, improve water quality and protect shorelines from erosion.",
      "Phosphorus and nitrogen levels also have improved in the long-term in another positive sign. While they are needed by the bay's organisms, excessive nitrogen and phosphorus degrade the bay\u2019s water quality. Excess nitrogen and phosphorus fuel algal blooms that can cloud the water and block sunlight from reaching underwater grasses.",
      "Water clarity and chlorophyll-a scores, however, have declining long-term trends, the report said. Chlorophyll-a in the bay is an indicator of phytoplankton abundance and water quality.",
      "Improving trends can be attributed to management and restoration efforts at the regional, state, and local levels, the report said. Regionally, wastewater treatment plants have been upgraded and programs have been put in place to reduce nutrient and sediment input.",
      "The health of the bay is a reflection of what\u2019s happening across its six-state watershed, which includes Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia along with the District of Columbia.",
      "UMCES, which is marking its 100th anniversary, also provides a grade for the overall watershed health in its report card. It gave the watershed a grade of C-plus. The watershed health grade includes ecological, societal and economic indicators.",

      "The group\u2019s holiday observances garnered national attention in 2023 after a Mississippi man destroyed their Iowa Statehouse display depicting the horned deity Baphomet, which was permitted in the rotunda along with a Christmas tree and other religious holiday installations.",
      "The temple's application for a display and event in December 2024 was denied, a decision that the organization says violated its members' constitutional rights and Iowa civil rights law.",
      "Messages seeking comment were left with the state\u2019s Department of Administrative Services, which oversees the use of public space in the Iowa Capitol; and with Gov. Kim Reynolds\u2019 office.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa filed the complaint with Iowa\u2019s civil rights office Tuesday on behalf of Mortimer Adramelech, minister of Satan for the Iowa Satanic Temple congregation. Rita Bettis Austen, ACLU Iowa's legal director, said the complaint with the civil rights office is the first step required before a legal claim of discrimination under Iowa civil rights law can be filed in court. The state's ACLU chapter hopes the complaint will be enough for state officials to reverse course.",
      "The ACLU of Iowa also filed a lawsuit in April after Gov. Kim Reynolds' office withheld or redacted requested records related to the Satanic Temple's display and event, citing executive privilege.",
      "The complaint references a decision by Adam Steen, administrative services director, to deny the group\u2019s application because obscene materials and gratuitous violence are not permitted in the building that regularly hosts children of all ages. Steen told the group the costumes they proposed for the event included sticks that could be \u201cused as weapons on children\u201d and \u201cpositions the event to be harmful to minors.\u201d",
      "The Satanic Temple alleges that was an \u201cabsurd, unfounded concern\u201d used to justify the denial and that their application specified the event would be family friendly. The complaint cites open records that the organization says make it clear the governor\u2019s office and Steen were meeting at the time to prepare a response.",
      "\u201cThe simple truth is the State of Iowa does not want to allow Satanists to enjoy the same access to the Iowa State Capitol as other \u2018mainstream\u2019 religions, in particular Christianity, and in particular during the Christmas holiday season,\u201d the complaint reads.",

      "The City Council of San Jose, California, is voting on a controversial proposal that would make homeless people eligible for arrest if they reject three offers of housing",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Homeless people who reject three offers of shelter could be arrested under a controversial proposal before the city council of the most populous city in California's Silicon Valley on Tuesday.",
      "The proposal being pushed by San Jose Mayor Matt Mahon is eye-opening because it comes from a liberal city headed by a Democrat in the left-leaning San Francisco Bay Area. It is among the stricter anti-encampment deterrents proposed by elected officials since the Supreme Court in 2023 made it easier to ban homeless people from camping on public property.",
      "And it's another sign of just how frustrated people have become with squalid tents lining sidewalks and riverbanks, and erratic behavior of those using drugs or in distress in a state with an estimated 187,000 homeless people. California is home to roughly a quarter of all homeless people in the country.",
      "Mahan says most people do accept offers of shelter. But he wants to make clear to the small percentage of people who refuse, that as the city builds more shelter and interim housing, they have a responsibility to move indoors.",
      "\u201cI think we need a cultural change, a culture of accountability for everyone involved,\u201d said Mahan. \u201cI don\u2019t want to use the criminal justice system to make vulnerable people\u2019s lives harder. I want to use it as a last resort.\u201d",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and former mayor of San Francisco, has repeatedly urged cities to ban encampments. Arrests for illegal lodging have soared in San Francisco, and its current mayor, Daniel Lurie, has reiterated that it is not appropriate for people to live outdoors.",
      "Advocates for homeless people say cracking down on encampments is traumatizing and even counterproductive. Forcing a person to clear out sets them back in their search for stability as they could lose important documents needed to apply for work and housing, they said.",
      "\u201cPushing people with mental health needs or drug addiction into incarceration \u2014 without any crime committed \u2014 is both inhumane and ineffective,\u201d said Otto Lee, president of the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors, in a written statement emailed Monday to The Associated Press.",
      "Lee and other county leaders are opposed to the mayor's proposal. They say they need more housing, beds and services, and not punishment.",
      "The \u201cresponsibility to shelter\u201d proposal does not mandate an arrest after three rejected offers. After talking with the city attorney's office and police, Mahan said it made more sense to give front-line outreach workers and police officers discretion to decide when to escalate or prioritize a situation. The city will set up a new six-officer quality of life unit within the police department.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to overly tie their hands and tell them this is the only way to do it,\u201d the mayor said.",
      "People who repeatedly violate the city's encampment code of conduct \u2014 which also includes keeping tents free of trash and not blocking the public right of way \u2014 could be sent to a recovery center for detox or petitioned for court-mandated treatment to mental health and substance use disorder care, Mahan said.",
      "San Jose has nearly 1,400 shelter spots and hopes to add another 800 by the end of the year. Officials are aware they do not have enough beds, and Mahan said that people will not be punished if beds are unavailable or the only options are unsuitable.",

    "story": [
      "The current unrest in Los Angeles is a lot different from the last time a U.S. president called out the National Guard to respond to violence on the streets",
      "The images of cars set ablaze, protesters tossing rocks at police and officers firing nonlethal rounds and tear gas at protesters hearkens back to the last time a president sent the National Guard to respond to violence on Los Angeles streets.",
      "But the unrest during several days of protests over immigration enforcement is far different in scale from the 1992 riots that followed the acquittal of white police officers who were videotaped beating Black motorist Rodney King.",
      "President George H.W. Bush used the Insurrection Act to call in the National Guard after requests from Mayor Tom Bradley and Gov. Pete Wilson. After the current protests began Friday over Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids, President Donald Trump ordered the deployment of 4,100 National Guard troops and 700 Marines despite strident opposition from Mayor Karen Bass and Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "Trump cited a legal provision to mobilize federal service members when there is \u201ca rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.\u201d California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit Monday saying Trump had overstepped his authority.",
      "Outrage over the verdicts on April 29, 1992 led to nearly a week of widespread violence that was one of the deadliest riots in American history. Hundreds of businesses were looted. Entire blocks of homes and stores were torched. More than 60 people died in shootings and other violence, mostly in South Los Angeles, an area with a heavily Black population at the time.",
      "Unlike the 1992 riots, protests have mainly been peaceful and been confined to a roughly five-block stretch of downtown LA, a tiny patch in the sprawling city of nearly 4 million people. No one has died. There's been vandalism and some cars set on fire but no homes or buildings have burned.",
      "At least 50 people have been arrested for everything from failing to follow orders to leave to looting, assault on a police officer and attempted murder for tossing a Molotov cocktail.",
      "Several officers have had minor injuries and protesters and some journalists have been struck by some of the more than 600 rubber bullets and other \u201cless-lethal\u201d munitions fired by police.",
      "The 1992 uprising took many by surprise, including the Los Angeles Police Department, but the King verdict was a catalyst for racial tensions that had been building in the city for years.",
      "In addition to frustration with their treatment by police, some directed their anger at Korean merchants who owned many of the local stores. Black residents felt the owners treated them more like shoplifters than shoppers. As looting and fires spread toward Koreatown, some merchants protected their stores with shotguns and rifles.",

    "story": [
      "Georgia\u2019s highest court is overturning four rules passed by the State Election Board just before last year\u2019s general election",
      "ATLANTA -- Georgia's highest court on Tuesday overturned four rules passed by the State Election Board just before last year's general election, ruling the board overstepped its authority and intruded on lawmaking power reserved for legislators under the state constitution.",
      "The state Supreme Court's unanimous decision limits the future rulemaking ability of the State Election Board and other executive branch agencies of Georgia's government.",
      "The board passed a slate of new rules in August and September that mostly had to do with processes after ballots are cast, spawning a flurry of lawsuits.",
      "President Donald Trump narrowly lost the state in 2020 and alleged without evidence that election fraud had cost him victory. Three Trump-endorsed Republicans hold the majority on the five-person State Election Board.",
      "The new rules brought an outcry that the board's majority was trying to improperly use its power to help Trump. The board members claimed the changes were needed to improve the accuracy of results.",
      "Fulton County Superior Court Judge Thomas Cox ruled in October that seven of the rules were \u201cillegal, unconstitutional and void,\u201d but the board appealed.",
      "Trump beat Democratic former Vice President Kamala Harris in November to win Georgia.",
      "In its decision, the state Supreme Court invalidated the requirements that ballots be hand-counted after the close of polls, that someone delivering an absentee ballot in person provide a signature and photo ID, that county election board members be allowed to conduct a \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d before certifying results and that county election board members be granted broad access to election-related documents.",
      "The court let stand a rule requiring video surveillance and recording of ballot drop boxes after polls close during early voting. It told a lower court to decide whether Chatham County Board of Elections member James Hall has the right to challenge two other rules, which expand designated areas where partisan poll watchers can stand at tabulation centers and require daily public updates of the number of votes cast during early voting.",
      "As part of its decision, the court overturned a 1990 decision that widened the rulemaking power of state agencies. Chief Justice Nels Peterson wrote that the decision was a mistake because it doesn't \u201cprovide clear, objective guidelines that cabin an executive branch agency's exercise of discretion.\u201d",
      "The reversal parallels the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning last year of a doctrine that said courts had to defer to how administrative agencies interpreted laws in writing rules.",
      "What was called the Chevron doctrine gave federal agencies the authority to make rules for implementing laws passed by Congress that were unclear.",
      "Scot Turner, a former state representative and one of the people who challenged the rules, said the court's decision will rein in \u201cunelected bureaucrats.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis ruling makes clear: the legislative power belongs to the General Assembly, not executive branch agencies operating without proper constraints,\u201d Turner said in a statement.",
      "The court ruled that the State Election Board had asserted \u201cthe type of unfettered discretion that we have now reiterated is constitutionally intolerable.\u201d",
      "That analysis applied to the rule allowing county board members to conduct \u201creasonable inquiry\u201d into whether results are valid, which the court said could delay finalizing votes and contradicted state law that says counties \u201cshall\u201d certify results. The court also ruled that election board members could only examine documents when there were discrepancies in the number of voters or ballots.",
      "The court ruled that the rule requiring poll officials to hand-count the total number of ballots \u2014 not individual votes \u2014 contradicted state law. That's because it allowed the hand-count to take place after Election Day, while state law requires ballots to be tabulated \u201cas soon as\u201d polls close.",
      "A rule requiring people to provide a signature and photo ID when delivering an absentee ballot was invalid, the court ruled, because it \u201cinvents new requirements\u201d not found in law.",

    "story": [
      "A new lawsuit alleges that a deaf man who was killed in Baltimore's jail was forced to share a cell with a first-degree murder suspect whose violent behavior had already alarmed his previous cellmate",
      "BALTIMORE -- In the days before Javarick Gantt was strangled to death in jail, he was forced to share a cell with a first-degree murder suspect whose violent behavior had already alarmed his previous cellmate, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday.",
      "Gantt, who used sign language because he was deaf, struggled to communicate with corrections officers and other detainees, making him especially vulnerable to violence, his family alleges. Their lawsuit sheds new light on the circumstances surrounding the 2022 jailhouse killing, which raised significant concerns about operations in the Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center.",
      "Gordon Staron, 36, was awaiting trial in an apparently random stabbing attack that prosecutors called an \u201caxe murder.\u201d Gantt, by comparison, was facing minor charges. Attorneys for Gantt\u2019s family argue the two men never should have been assigned to the same cell, saying in court papers that his death was \u201centirely predictable and preventable.\u201d",
      "The family wants to know how the state-run detention facility let this happen, but they\u2019ve been stonewalled from the beginning in their attempts to get information, said Gantt\u2019s father, Rick Barry Sr.",
      "\u201cNothing, zero, no answers,\u201d Barry said in a phone interview.",
      "The Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, which runs the jail, didn\u2019t immediately provide comment Tuesday.",
      "Staron ultimately pleaded guilty to strangling Gantt after a jury convicted him in the axe attack. He was sentenced last year to life without parole.",
      "Gantt, 34, weighed little over 100 pounds (45 kilograms), records show. Most significantly, he wasn\u2019t able to call for help because he communicated primarily by sign language, according to court papers.",
      "The lawsuit argues he stood little chance against a cellmate who was experiencing serious mental health issues, displaying paranoid and volatile behavior, and being treated for alcohol and substance abuse. Staron was initially arrested after he drove into Baltimore from the suburbs and attacked a homeless man at a bus stop, according to prosecutors.",
      "Nonetheless, records show he and Gantt received similar security classifications, the scoring system jail administrators use to determine where detainees are housed.",
      "About two weeks before Gantt\u2019s death, Staron was involved in an altercation and punched two other men, according to police reports. Afterward, his frightened cellmate asked to be moved, leaving an empty bed that would soon be occupied by Gantt, the lawsuit says.",
      "Gantt was transferred into Staron\u2019s cell after reporting that his previous cellmate \u201chad been bullying him and attempting to assault him,\u201d according to the lawsuit. He communicated the message in sign language after flagging someone down from his cell window. A corrections officer then asked administrators to move Gantt \u201cto a safer cell,\u201d which landed him with Staron, according to jail records.",
      "\u201cWith his disability, I feel he was overlooked,\u201d Gantt\u2019s father said.",
      "That was nine days before Gantt was found unresponsive when he didn\u2019t get up for breakfast. Other inmates reported hearing him \u201cmaking noises and banging on his cell door\u201d during the night, according to police, but several hours passed before corrections officers noticed something was wrong.",
      "Gantt\u2019s family says he should have received special accommodations and safety precautions. They also allege that corrections officers failed to properly monitor the dorm the night of his death. The lawsuit against the state corrections department and staff members seeks damages in excess of $50 million.",
      "Gantt, who left behind a young daughter, was jailed for months amid a backlogged court system. His charges stemmed from a 2019 domestic dispute in which no one was seriously injured. But largely because he missed court dates and probation check-ins, he was ordered held without bail and remained behind bars awaiting trial.",
      "A judge decided to keep Gantt incarcerated even after he explained that he was struggling to navigate the bureaucracy of the courts.",
      "\u201cThis was my first time on probation,\u201d he said through a sign language interpreter during a bail hearing, according to the lawsuit. \u201cThey didn\u2019t tell me what to expect, what to do.\u201d",
      "Despite his hearing impairment, Gantt was gregarious and open-hearted, with many friends in the deaf community and beyond, loved ones said. He formed close bonds wherever he went \u2014 including in the Baltimore area, where he had moved somewhat recently after growing up in Florida. But his father said Gantt became helpless and confused when the legal system failed to properly accommodate his disability.",
      "\u201cThe tragedy is that no one has told this family anything, at any time,\u201d said Baltimore attorney Andrew Slutkin, who represents the family. \u201cThere\u2019s been no communication of what happened, how it happened and what they\u2019re doing to prevent it from happening again.\u201d",

      "Clouds of tear gas wafting over a throng of protesters on a blocked freeway. Federal immigration agents in tactical garb raiding businesses in search of immigrants without legal status. A messy war of words between President Donald Trump and Gov. Gavin Newsom. Photos captured several Waymo robotaxis set on fire and graffiti scrawled on a federal detention center building, while videos recorded the sounds of rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades hitting crowds.",
      "In a city still reeling from January's deadly wildfires \u2014 and with the World Cup soccer championships and the 2028 Olympics on the horizon \u2014 Mayor Karen Bass has been urging residents to come together to revitalize LA's image by sprucing up streets, planting trees and painting murals so LA shows its best face to nations near and far.",
      "\u201cIt's about pride,\u201d she's said. \u201cThis is the city of dreams.\u201d",
      "Instead, a less flattering side of Los Angeles has been broadcast to the world in recent days. Protests have mostly taken place in a small swath of downtown in the sprawling city of 4 million people. As Trump has activated nearly 5,000 troops to respond in the city, Bass has staunchly pushed back against his assertions that her city is overrun and in crisis.",
      "Bass, in response to Trump, said she was troubled by depictions that the city has been \u201cinvaded and occupied by illegal aliens and criminals, and that now violent, insurrectionist mobs are swarming our federal agents. I don\u2019t know if anybody has seen that happen, but I\u2019ve not seen that happen.\u201d",
      "The series of protests began Friday outside a federal detention center, where demonstrators demanded the release of more than 40 people arrested by federal immigration authorities.",
      "Immigration advocates say the people who were detained do not have criminal histories and are being denied their due process rights.",
      "Much like New York, Los Angeles is an international city that many immigrants call home. The city\u2019s official seal carries images referencing the region\u2019s time under Spanish and Mexican rule. Over 150 languages are spoken by students in the Los Angeles Unified School District. About half of the city's residents are Latino and about one-third were born outside the U.S.",
      "Bass faulted the Trump administration for creating \"a chaotic escalation\u201d by mobilizing troops to quell protests.",
      "\"This is the last thing that our city needs,\" Bass said.",
      "Los Angeles resident Adam Lerman, who has attended the protests, warned that protests would continue if the Trump administration pushes more raids in the city.",
      "\u201cWe are talking about a new riot every day,\u201d Lerman said. \u201dEverybody knows they are playing with fire.\"",
      "It's not the publicity LA needs as it looks to welcome the world for international sporting events on a grand scale.",
      "\u201cAt this stage in the process, most host cities and countries would be putting the final touches on their mega-event red carpet, demonstrating to the world that they are ready to embrace visitors with open arms,\u201d said Jules Boykoff, a Pacific University professor who has written widely on the political and economic impacts of the Olympic Games. The scenes of conflict are \u201cnot exactly the best way to entice the world to plan their next tourist trip to the U.S. to watch a sports mega-event.\u201d",
      "The federal raids and protests have created another dicey political moment for Bass, who has been struggling with a budget crisis while trying to recover from political fallout from the wildfires that ignited when she was out of the country.",
      "She's been careful not to discourage protests but at the same time has pleaded for residents to remain peaceful. The mayor will likely face backlash for involving the Los Angeles Police.",
      "And she needs to fight the perception that the city is unsafe and disorderly, an image fostered by Trump, who in social media posts has depicted Bass as incompetent and said the city has been \u201cinvaded\u201d by people who entered the U.S. illegally. Los Angeles is sprawling \u2014 roughly 470 square miles (750 square kilometers) \u2014 and the protests were mostly concentrated downtown.",
      "\"The most important thing right now is that our city be peaceful,\" Bass said. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to fall into the chaos that I believe is being created by the (Trump) administration.\u201d",
      "On Monday, workers were clearing debris and broken glass from sidewalks and power-washing graffiti from buildings \u2014 among the structures vandalized was the one-time home of the Los Angeles Times across the street from City Hall. Downtown has yet to bounce back since long-running pandemic lockdowns, which reordered work life and left many office towers with high vacancy rates.",
      "Trump and California officials continued to spar online and off, faulting each other for the fallout. At the White House, Trump criticized California leaders by saying \u201cthey were afraid of doing anything\u201d and signaled he would support Newsom's arrest over his handling of the immigration protests.",
      "If Los Angeles' image was once defined by its balmy Mediterranean climate and the glamor of Hollywood, it's now known \u201cprimarily for disaster,\u201d said Claremont McKenna College political scientist Jack Pitney.",
      "\u201cA lot of perception depends on images,\" Pitney added. Right now, the dominant image \"is a burning Waymo.\u201d",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to field sharp questions from members of Congress about his tumultuous start as Pentagon chief in a series of hearings beginning Tuesday",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to field sharp questions from members of Congress about his tumultuous start as Pentagon chief, including his sharing of sensitive military details over a Signal chat, in three separate Capitol Hill hearings beginning Tuesday.",
      "Lawmakers also have made it clear they are unhappy that Hegseth has not provided details on the administration's first proposed defense budget, which President Donald Trump has said would total $1 trillion, a significant increase over the current spending level of more than $800 billion.",
      "It will be lawmakers' first chance to ask Hegseth about a myriad of other controversial spending by the Pentagon, including plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on security upgrades to turn a Qatari jet into Air Force One and to pour as much as $45 million into a parade recently added to the Army's 250th birthday bash, which happens to coincide with Trump's birthday on Saturday.",
      "Lawmakers may quiz Hegseth on the latest searing images coming out of the immigration raid protests in Los Angeles. Hegseth has deployed about 700 active-duty Marines to assist more than 4,100 National Guard troops in protecting federal buildings and personnel. But there are questions about what the troops will have to do and how much it will all cost.",
      "Under the Posse Comitatus Act, troops are prohibited from policing U.S. citizens on American soil. Invoking the Insurrection Act, which allows troops to do that, is incredibly rare, and it's not clear if Trump plans to do it.",
      "The commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Eric Smith, will be on Capitol Hill testifying at a separate budget hearing at the same time as Hegseth and is likely to face similar questions.",
      "Hegseth has spent vast amounts of time during his first five months in office promoting the social changes he's making at the Pentagon. He\u2019s been far less visible in the administration\u2019s more critical international security crises and negotiations involving Russia, Ukraine, Israel, Gaza and Iran.",
      "Most recently, Hegseth directed the renaming of a Navy ship that had honored Harvey Milk, a slain gay rights activist who served as a sailor during the Korean War. His spokesman, Sean Parnell, said the renaming was needed to ensure \"the names attached to all DOD installations and assets are reflective of the commander-in-chief\u2019s priorities, our nation\u2019s history, and the warrior ethos.\u201d",
      "Hegseth has posted numerous videos of his morning workouts with troops or of himself signing directives to purge diversity and equity programs and online content from the military. He has boasted of removing transgender service members from the force and firing so-called woke generals, many of whom were women.",
      "He was on the international stage about a week ago, addressing an annual national security conference in Asia about threats from China. But a trip to NATO headquarters last week was quick and quiet, and he deliberately skipped a gathering of about 50 allies and partners where they discussed ongoing support for Ukraine.",
      "Hegseth's hearing Tuesday before the House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee will be his first public appearance on Capitol Hill since he squeaked through his Senate confirmation with a tie-breaking vote. It was the closest vote of any Cabinet member.",
      "While he has talked a lot about making the military more lethal, it was his use of the unclassified, unsecured Signal messaging app that quickly caught public attention.",
      "Set up by then-national security adviser Mike Waltz, a group chat included Hegseth and other senior administration leaders and was used to share information about upcoming military strikes in Yemen.",
      "The chat became a public embarrassment because the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently added to it. Waltz took responsibility for the gaffe, but Hegseth was roundly criticized for sharing details about the military strikes in this chat and in another one that included his wife and brother.",
      "Multiple investigations are looking into his use of Signal. The Defense Department's acting inspector general has been looking into the initial chat at the request of the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Pentagon\u2019s watchdog also is reviewing whether any of Hegseth's aides were asked to delete any Signal messages.",
      "While any number of those issues could come up at the House Armed Services Committee hearing Thursday, money issues are more likely to be the focus of the hearings Tuesday in the House and Wednesday before the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee.",
      "Already defense leaders have been grilled in other hearings on the plans to retrofit the Qatari jet and the costs of the military parade. Trump has long wanted a parade, and Army leaders defended it as a good way to attract new recruits.",
      "Other questions may involve the costs of expanding the use of military forces to secure the southern border, the plans for the Golden Dome missile defense program, and how the department intends to fund modernization programs for drones and other critical weapons systems.",

      "President Donald Trump plans to speak at Fort Bragg to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump plans to speak at Fort Bragg on Tuesday to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army as he deploys the military in an attempt to quiet immigration protests in Los Angeles.",
      "Fort Bragg, located near Fayetteville, North Carolina, serves as headquarters for U.S. Army Special Operations Command. Highly trained units like the Green Berets and the Rangers are based there.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll will also be at Tuesday's event, along with service members, veterans and their families.",
      "Trump has promoted the Army's anniversary as a reason to hold a military parade in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, which is also his 79th birthday. Tanks and other vehicles will roll down city streets in a reminder of how the Republican president is reshaping the armed forces after returning to the White House this year.",
      "Trump, who sees the military as a critical tool for domestic goals, has used the recent protests in Los Angeles as an opportunity to deploy the National Guard and U.S. Marines to quell disturbances that began as protests over immigration raids.",
      "Trump has authorized the deployment of 4,000 National Guard soldiers to the city over the objections of Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom. About 700 Marines were also due to formally deploy to Los Angeles.",
      "California sued Trump over the deployment, with the state attorney general arguing that the president had \u201ctrampled\u201d the state's sovereignty. California leaders accused Trump of fanning protesters' anger, leading crowds to block off a major freeway and set self-driving cars on fire.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re gonna have troops everywhere,\" Trump said over the weekend. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let this happen to our country.\u201d",
      "Fort Bragg has been in the middle of a cultural tug-of-war over the military. It was named after a Confederate general, then renamed to Fort Liberty two years ago.",
      "Hegseth brought back the Bragg name but said it was being used to honor an Army paratrooper who served in World War II.",

      "Alabama is preparing to execute a man with nitrogen gas for the 1988 beating death of a woman",
      "ATMORE, Ala. -- A man convicted of beating a woman to death nearly 37 years ago is scheduled to be executed Tuesday in Alabama in what will be the nation's sixth execution with nitrogen gas.",
      "Gregory Hunt is scheduled to be put to death Tuesday night at a south Alabama prison. Hunt was convicted of killing Karen Lane, a woman he had been dating for about a month, according to court records.",
      "The Alabama execution is one of four that had been scheduled this week in the United States. Executions are also scheduled in Florida and South Carolina. A judge in Oklahoma on Monday issued a temporary stay for an execution in that state, but the state attorney general is seeking to get it lifted.",
      "Lane was 32 when she was murdered Aug. 2, 1988, in the Cordova apartment she shared with a woman who was Hunt's cousin.",
      "Prosecutors said Hunt broke into her apartment and killed her after sexually abusing her. A physician who performed an autopsy testified that she died from blunt force trauma and that Lane had sustained some 60 injuries, including 20 to the head.",
      "A jury on June 19, 1990, found Hunt guilty of capital murder during sexual abuse and burglary. Jurors recommended by a vote of 11-1 that he receive a death sentence, which a judge imposed.",
      "Hunt's final request for a stay of execution, which he filed himself, focused on claims that prosecutors made false statements to jurors about evidence of sexual abuse. The element of sexual abuse is what elevated the crime to a death penalty offense.",
      "In a filing to the U.S. Supreme Court, Hunt, acting as his own attorney, wrote that a prosecutor told jurors that cervical mucus was on a broomstick near Hunt\u2019s body. However, the victim did not have a cervix because of an earlier hysterectomy. The Alabama attorney general\u2019s office called the claim meritless and said even if the prosecutor erred in that statement, it did not throw the conviction into doubt.",
      "Hunt, speaking by telephone last month from prison, did not dispute killing Lane but maintained he did not sexually assault her. He also described himself as someone who was changed by prison.",
      "\u201cKaren didn\u2019t deserve what happened to her,\u201d Hunt said.",
      "Hunt said he had been drinking and doing drugs on the night of the crime and became jealous when he saw Lane in a car with another man.",
      "\u201cYou have your come-to-Jesus moment. Of course, after the fact, you can't believe what has happened. You can't believe you were part of it and did it,\u201d Hunt said.",
      "Hunt, who was born in 1960 and came to death row in 1990, is now among the longest-serving inmates on Alabama's death row. He said prison became his \u201chospital\u201d to heal his broken mind. He said since 1988, he has been leading a Bible class attended by two dozen or more inmates.",
      "\u201cJust trying to be a light in a dark place, trying to tell people if I can change, they can too. ... become people of love instead of hate,\" he said.",
      "Lane\u2019s sister declined to comment when reached by telephone. The family is expected to give a written statement Tuesday night.",
      "\u201cThe way she was killed is just devastating,\u201d Denise Gurganus, Lane\u2019s sister, told TV station WBRC at a 2014 vigil for crime victims. \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough to lose a family member to death, but when it\u2019s this gruesome.\u201d",
      "The Alabama attorney general's office, in asking justices to reject Hunt's request for a stay of execution, wrote that Hunt has now been on death row longer than Lane was alive.",
      "Alabama last year became the first state to carry out an execution with nitrogen gas. Nitrogen has now been used in five executions \u2014 four in Alabama and one in Louisiana. The method involves using a gas mask to force an inmate to breathe pure nitrogen gas, depriving them of the oxygen needed to stay alive.",
      "Hunt had named nitrogen as his preferred execution method. He made the selection before Alabama had developed procedures for using gas. Alabama also allows inmates to choose lethal injection or the electric chair.",

      "New Jersey voters are set to settle the Democratic and Republican primaries for governor",
      "TRENTON, N..J. -- New Jersey voters on Tuesday will settle the Democratic and Republican primaries for governor in a contest that could send signals about how the public is responding to President Donald Trump's agenda and how Democratic voters think their leaders should push back.",
      "New Jersey is one of just two states with a race for governor this year \u2014 the other is Virginia \u2014 and the fact two-term Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy is term-limited has created fresh drama for the open seat.",
      "There's a six-way race on the Democratic side that features several seasoned political figures. Trump\u2019s endorsement of former state lawmaker Jack Ciattarelli may have given him a boost on the Republican side, where he faces four primary challengers.",
      "Polls are open from 6 a.m. until 8 p.m. Tuesday, but it's not the only day of voting. Early in-person voting was held from June 3-8. Mail-in ballots were sent to voters beginning in April.",
      "The contest hinges in part on New Jersey issues, including high property taxes and the soaring cost of living, but national politics are sure to figure in. Trump, who has long had a strong presence in New Jersey, waded into the race with his endorsement, attacking Democratic control of state government. Democrats are looking for a winning message and leadership after the sting of bitter losses in 2024.",
      "\"Because these are the first major elections since Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House, there\u2019s a tremendous amount at stake simply through public perception,\" said Ben Dworkin, director of the Rowan Institute for Public Policy & Citizenship.",
      "For Democrats? \u201cThey'll just get further in a hole if they don't hold this seat,\u201d he said.",
      "For Republicans? They could win because New Jersey tends to be purple during gubernatorial years, Dworkin said, but that would be viewed as a tremendous victory for Trump.",
      "The Democrats running are Mayors Ras Baraka of Newark and Steven Fulop of Jersey City; U.S. Reps. Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill; teachers union President Sean Spiller and former state Senate President Steve Sweeney. The Democratic campaign has been hard fought and pricey, with tens of millions spent in one of the country's most expensive media markets.",
      "On the Republican side, most of the candidates declared their support for the president's agenda, pressing for a state-level version of the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency. They've also said they would end so-called sanctuary policies and, in a New Jersey-specific pitch, called for the end of the state's 2020 law banning single-use plastic bags.",
      "Ciattarelli has said he would sign an order on his first day in office ending New Jersey's Immigrant Trust Directive, which bars local police from cooperating with federal officials on civil immigration matters. He has also said he would direct whomever he names attorney general to end lawsuits against the Trump administration, including a case aimed at stopping the president's order ending birthright citizenship for people whose parents were in the country illegally.",
      "Murphy, who became the first Democrat to be reelected in more than four decades in 2021, is barred from running again by term limits and hasn't endorsed a successor in the primary.",
      "Both parties will look to build their general election campaigns on widespread voter frustration. For Democrats, that means focusing on the parts of Trump\u2019s aggressive second-term agenda that are unpopular. Republicans, meanwhile, are casting blame for economic hardships on Democrats who\u2019ve run state government for the last eight years.",
      "New Jersey has been reliably Democratic in Senate and presidential contests for decades. But the odd-year races for governor have tended to swing back and forth, and each of the last three GOP governors has won a second term.",
      "Democrats have the largest share of registered voters in the state, followed closely by independent voters and then Republicans, who have roughly 800,000 fewer registrations than the Democratic Party. But the GOP has made gains in recent years, shaving the Democrats\u2019 lead of more than 1 million more registrations to the current level.",

      "A man convicted of raping and killing a woman three decades ago after kidnapping her from a supermarket parking lot in Florida is scheduled to be executed Tuesday.",
      "Anthony Wainwright, 54, is scheduled to receive a lethal injection at Florida State Prison near Starke. He was convicted in the April 1994 killing of 23-year-old Carmen Gayheart, a mother of two young children, in Lake City.",
      "Wainwright would be the sixth person put to death in Florida this year. The state also executed six people in 2023, but only carried out one execution last year. There are four executions scheduled around the country this week, including another one on Tuesday in Alabama. On Monday an Oklahoma judge granted a temporary stay of execution for a man scheduled to be put to death Thursday.",
      "Richard Hamilton, the other man convicted in Gayheart\u2019s killing, was also sentenced to death. But he died on death row in January 2023 at the age of 59.",
      "Gayheart's sister, who plans to attend the execution, said three decades is too long to wait for justice.",
      "\u201cIt's ridiculous how many appeals they get,\u201d Maria David told The Associated Press, adding that each step of the appeals process reopened her family's wounds. \u201cYou have to relive it again because they have to tell the whole story again.\u201d",
      "Wainwright and Hamilton escaped from prison in North Carolina, stole a green Cadillac and burglarized a home the next morning, taking guns and money. Then they drove to Florida and when the Cadillac began to have problems in Lake City, they decided to steal another vehicle.",
      "They confronted Gayheart, a community college student, on April 27, 1994, as she loaded groceries into her blue Ford Bronco, according to court documents. They forced her into the vehicle at gunpoint and drove off. They raped her in the backseat and then took her out of the vehicle and tried to strangle her before shooting her twice in the back of the head, court filings say. They dragged her body several dozen yards from the road and drove off.",
      "The two men were arrested in Mississippi the next day after a shootout with police.",
      "A jury in 1995 convicted Wainwright of murder, kidnapping, robbery and rape and unanimously recommended that he be sentenced to death.",
      "Wainwright's lawyers have filed multiple unsuccessful appeals over the years based on what they said were problems with his trial and evidence that he suffered from brain damage and intellectual disability.",
      "Since his execution was scheduled, his lawyers have argued in state and federal court filings that his execution should be put on hold to allow time for courts to hear additional legal arguments in his case.",
      "In a filing with the U.S. Supreme Court, his lawyers argue that his case has been \u201cmarred by critical, systemic failures at virtually every stage and through the signing of his death warrant.\u201d Those failures include flawed DNA evidence that wasn't disclosed to the defense until after opening statements, erroneous jury instructions, inflammatory and inaccurate closing arguments and missteps by court-appointed lawyers, the filing says.",
      "The filing also says that a jailhouse informant who testified at Wainwright's trial finally admitted last month that he and another informant had testified in exchange for lighter sentences, a fact that had not been disclosed to the defense.",
      "The Supreme Court on Monday denied Wainwright's final appeals without comment.",
      "David, Gayheart's sister, said she feels cheated that Hamilton died before the state could execute him.",
      "She said she was \u201covercome with emotion\u201d when she heard the governor had signed a death warrant for Wainwright. Her parents both died while waiting for justice to be served, she said, but she plans to be there to witness the final chapter of her family's tragedy.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that would keep me from seeing this all the way through,\u201d she said.",
      "Her sister loved animals and surprised her by training to become a nurse rather than a veterinarian, David said. Gayheart was two years younger than her sister but became a mother first, and David said she marveled at her sister's patience with her young children.",
      "\u201cShe was here, she mattered, she should be remembered, and she was loved,\u201d David said of her sister.",
      "Over the years, she has kept a book where she put every court filing, from the initial indictment through the latest appeals.",
      "\u201cI'm looking forward to getting the last pieces of paperwork that say he's been executed to put into the book and never having to think about Anthony Wainwright ever again,\u201d she said.",

      "Financial aid fraud is exploding, thanks to the rise of artificial intelligence",
      "It was an unusual question coming from a police officer. Heather Brady was napping at home in San Francisco on a Sunday afternoon when the officer knocked on her door to ask: Had she applied to Arizona Western College?",
      "She had not, and as the officer suspected, somebody else had applied to Arizona community colleges in her name to scam the government into paying out financial aid money.",
      "When she checked her student loan servicer account, Brady saw the scammers hadn't stopped there. A loan for over $9,000 had been paid out in her name \u2014 but to another person \u2014 for coursework at a California college.",
      "\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine how many people this is happening to that have no idea,\u201d Brady said.",
      "The rise of artificial intelligence and the popularity of online classes have led to an explosion of financial aid fraud. Fake college enrollments have been surging as crime rings deploy \u201cghost students\u201d \u2014 chatbots that join online classrooms and stay just long enough to collect a financial aid check.",
      "In some cases, professors discover almost no one in their class is real. Students get locked out of the classes they need to graduate as bots push courses over their enrollment limits. And victims of identity theft who discover loans fraudulently taken out in their names must go through months of calling colleges, the Federal Student Aid office and loan servicers to try to get the debt erased.",
      "On Friday, the U.S. Education Department introduced a temporary rule requiring students to show colleges a government-issued ID to prove their identity. It will apply only to first-time applicants for federal student aid for the summer term, affecting some 125,000 borrowers. The agency said it is developing more advanced screening for the fall.",
      "\u201cThe rate of fraud through stolen identities has reached a level that imperils the federal student aid program,\u201d the department said in its guidance to colleges.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of fraud reports obtained through a public records request shows California colleges in 2024 reported 1.2 million fraudulent applications, which resulted in 223,000 suspected fake enrollments. Other states are affected by the same problem, but with 116 community colleges, California is a particularly large target.",
      "Criminals stole at least $11.1 million in federal, state and local financial aid from California community colleges last year that could not be recovered, according to the reports.",
      "Colleges typically receive a portion of the loans intended for tuition, with the balance going directly to students for other expenses. Community colleges are targeted in part because their lower tuition means larger percentages of grants and loans go to borrowers.",
      "Scammers frequently use AI chatbots to carry out the fraud, targeting courses that are online and allow students to watch lectures and complete coursework on their own time.",
      "In January, Wayne Chaw started getting emails about a class he never signed up for at De Anza Community College, where he had taken coding classes a decade earlier. Identity thieves had obtained his Social Security number and collected $1,395 in financial aid in his name.",
      "The energy management class required students to submit a homework assignment to prove they were real. But someone wrote submissions impersonating Chaw, likely using a chatbot.",
      "\u201cThis person is typing as me, saying my first and last name. ... It\u2019s very freaky when I saw that,\u201d said Chaw.",
      "The fraud involved a grant, not loans, so Chaw himself did not lose money. He called the Social Security Administration to report the identity theft, but after five hours on hold, he never got through to a person.",
      "As the Trump administration moves to dismantle the Education Department, federal cuts may make it harder to catch criminals and help victims of identity theft. In March, the Trump administration fired more than 300 people from the Federal Student Aid office, and the department\u2019s Office of Inspector General, which investigates fraud, has lost more than 20% of its staff through attrition and retirements since October.",

Another person in Texas pleaded guilty to using the names of prison inmates to apply for over $650,000 in student aid at colleges across the South and Southwest.

      "Investigators have been looking for Travis Caleb Decker, 32, since the night of May 30, when he failed to return the girls to their mother's home in Wenatchee, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of Seattle, after a scheduled visit.",

The campsite, west of Leavenworth, is about 11 miles (18 km) from the Pacific Crest Trail, which runs from the U.S.-Mexico border to the U.S.-Canada border.",
      "Decker has been charged with murder and kidnapping. According to a probable cause statement filed in Chelan County Superior Court last week, Decker's truck was left at the campsite, and it had two bloody handprints on the tailgate. In a news release Monday, the Chelan County Sheriff's Office said tests revealed that one blood sample taken from the scene belonged to a male, and another turned out to be from an animal.",
      "The sheriff's office did not say whether the tested samples had been taken from the tailgate. DNA and fingerprint analyses are pending, the news release said. Decker's dog was also found alive at the scene and turned over to the humane society for care.",
      "The sheriff's office said that while it is retaining command of the criminal investigation, it had turned over control of the search efforts to federal authorities to give its personnel time to rest. Officials have searched hundreds of square miles, much of it mountainous and remote, by land, water and air.",
      "Decker has also been charged in federal court with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. According to an affidavit filed by deputy U.S. marshal Keegan Stanley in that case, Decker has training in navigation, survival and other skills that make him \u201ca very avid and well-versed outdoorsman.\u201d",
      "Decker once spent 2.5 months in the backwoods living off the grid, Stanley wrote, and in the days before he took the girls, he searched online for how to relocate to and find a job in Canada.",
      "Decker was an infantryman in the Army from March 2013 to July 2021 and deployed to Afghanistan for four months in 2014, according to Army spokesperson Lt. Col. Ruth Castro. From 2014 to 2016, he was an automatic rifleman with the 75th Ranger Regiment at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington.",
      "Last September his ex-wife, Whitney Decker, wrote in a petition to modify their parenting plan that his mental health issues had worsened and that he had become increasingly unstable, often living out of his truck. She sought to restrict him from having overnight visits with the girls until he found housing.",
      "An autopsy on Friday determined the cause of death to be suffocation, the sheriff's office said. The girls had been bound with zip ties and had plastic bags placed over their heads.",
      "Authorities have reopened popular camping and backpacking areas in the Icicle Creek area, near where the girls were discovered. Other trails in the Lake Chelan National Recreation Area have reopened for day use but not camping.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump is moving swiftly to act on his immigration promises with little internal restraint, determined to test the bounds of his executive authority in order to fulfill the promises of his reelection campaign",
      "WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump made no secret of his willingness to exert a maximalist approach to enforcing immigration laws and keeping order as he campaigned to return to the White House. The fulfillment of that pledge is now on full display in Los Angeles.",
      "The president has put hundreds of National Guard troops on the streets to quell protests over his administration's immigration raids, a deployment that state and city officials say has only inflamed tensions. Trump called up the California National Guard over the objections of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom \u2014 the first time in 60 years a president has done so \u2014 and is deploying active-duty troops to support the guard.",
      "By overriding Newsom, Trump is already going beyond what he did to respond to Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, when he warned he could send troops to contain demonstrations that turned violent if governors in the states did not act to do so themselves. Trump said in September of that year that he \u201ccan\u2019t call in the National Guard unless we\u2019re requested by a governor\u201d and that \u201cwe have to go by the laws.\u201d",
      "But now, the past and current president is moving swiftly, with little internal restraint to test the bounds of his executive authority in order to deliver on his promise of mass deportations. What remains to be seen is whether Americans will stand by him once it\u2019s operationalized nationwide, as Trump looks to secure billions from Congress to dramatically expand the country's detention and deportation operations.",
      "For now, Trump is betting that they will.",
      "\u201cIf we didn't do the job, that place would be burning down,\" Trump told reporters Monday, speaking about California. \u201cI feel we had no choice. ... I don't want to see what happened so many times in this country.\u201d",
      "The protests began to unfold Friday as federal authorities arrested immigrants in several locations throughout the sprawling city, including in the fashion district of Los Angeles and at a Home Depot. The anger over the administration\u2019s actions quickly spread, with protests in Chicago and Boston as demonstrations in the southern California city also continued Monday.",
      "But Trump and other administration officials remained unbowed, capitalizing on the images of burning cars, graffiti and Mexican flags \u2014 which, while not dominant, started to become the defining images of the unrest \u2014 to bolster their law-and-order cause.",
      "Leaders in the country\u2019s most populous state were similarly defiant.",
      "California officials sued the Trump administration Monday, with the state\u2019s attorney general, Rob Bonta, arguing that the deployment of troops \u201ctrampled\u201d on the state\u2019s sovereignty and pushing for a restraining order. The initial deployment of 300 National Guard troops was expected to quickly expand to the full 4,000 that has been authorized by Trump.",
      "The state\u2019s senior Democratic senator, Alex Padilla, said in an interview that \u201cthis is absolutely a crisis of Trump\u2019s own making.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of people who are passionate about speaking up for fundamental rights and respecting due process, but the deployment of National Guard only serves to escalate tensions and the situation,\u201d Padilla told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what Donald Trump wanted to do.\u201d",
      "Padilla slammed the deployment as \u201ccounterproductive\u201d and said the Los Angeles Sheriff\u2019s Department was not advised ahead of the federalization of the National Guard. His office has also pushed the Pentagon for a justification on the deployment, and \u201cas far as we\u2019re told, the Department of Defense isn\u2019t sure what the mission is here,\" Padilla added.",
      "Much of this was predictable.",
      "During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump pledged to conduct the largest domestic deportation operation in American history to expel millions of immigrants in the country without legal status. He often praised President Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019s military-style immigration raids, and the candidate and his advisers suggested they would have broad power to deploy troops domestically to enact Trump's far-reaching immigration and public safety goals.",
      "Trump\u2019s speedy deployment in California of troops against those whom the president has alluded to as \u201cinsurrectionists\u201d on social media is a sharp contrast to his decision to issue no order or formal request for National Guard troops during the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, despite his repeated and false assertions that he had made such an offer.",
      "Trump is now surrounded by officials who have no interest in constraining his power. In 2020, Trump\u2019s then-Pentagon chief publicly rebuked Trump\u2019s threat to send in troops using the Insurrection Act, an 1807 law that empowers the president to use the military within the U.S. and against American citizens.",
      "Current Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth signaled support on his personal X account for deploying troops to California, writing, \u201cThe National Guard, and Marines if need be, stand with ICE,\u201d referring to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.",
      "The Defense Department said Monday it is deploying about 700 active-duty Marines to Los Angeles to support National Guard troops already on the ground to respond to the protests.",
      "Protesters over the weekend blocked off a major freeway and burned self-driving cars as police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades in clashes that encompassed several downtown blocks in Los Angeles and led to several dozen arrests. Much of the city saw no violence.",
      "But the protests prompted Trump to issue the directive Saturday mobilizing the California National Guard over Newsom's objections. The president and his top immigration aides accused the governor of mismanaging the protests, with border czar Tom Homan asserting in a Fox News interview Monday that Newsom stoked anti-ICE sentiments and waited two days to declare unlawful assembly in the city.",
      "Trump told Newsom in a phone call Friday evening to get the situation in Los Angeles under control, a White House official said. It was only when the administration felt Newsom was not restoring order in the city \u2014 and after Trump watched the situation escalate for 24 hours and White House officials saw imagery of federal law enforcement officers with lacerations and other injuries \u2014 that the president moved to deploy the Guard, according to the official, who was granted anonymity to discuss private deliberations.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s an incompetent governor,\u201d Trump said Monday. \u201cLook at the job he\u2019s doing in California. He\u2019s destroying one of our great states.\u201d",
      "Local law enforcement officials said Los Angeles police responded as quickly as they could once the protests erupted, and Newsom repeatedly asserted that state and city authorities had the situation under control.",
      "\u201cLos Angeles is no stranger to demonstrations and protests and rallies and marches,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cLocal law enforcement knows how to handle this and has a rapport with the community and community leaders to be able to allow for that.\u201d",
      "The aggressive moves prompted blowback from some of Trump's erstwhile allies. Ileana Garcia, a Florida state senator who in 2016 founded the group Latinas for Trump and was hired to direct Latino outreach, called the recent escalation \u201cunacceptable and inhumane.\u201d",
      "\u201cI understand the importance of deporting criminal aliens, but what we are witnessing are arbitrary measures to hunt down people who are complying with their immigration hearings \u2014 in many cases, with credible fear of persecution claims \u2014 all driven by a Miller-like desire to satisfy a self-fabricated deportation goal,\" said Garcia, referring to Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff and key architect of Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.",
      "The tactics could be just a preview to what more could come from the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress. GOP lawmakers are working to pass a massive tax-and-border package that includes billions to hire thousands of new officers for Border Patrol and for ICE. The goal, under the Trump-backed plan, is to remove 1 million immigrants without status annually and house 100,000 people in immigration detention centers.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon was scrambling Monday to establish rules to guide U.S. Marines who could be faced with the rare and difficult prospect of using force against citizens on American soil, now that the Trump administration is deploying active duty troops to the immigration raid protests in Los Angeles.",
      "U.S. Northern Command said it is sending 700 Marines into the Los Angeles area to protect federal property and personnel, including federal immigration agents. The 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines are coming from Twentynine Palms, California, and will augment about 4,100 National Guard members already in LA or authorized to be deployed there to respond to the protests.",
      "The forces have been trained in deescalation, crowd control and standing rules for the use of force, Northern Command said.",
      "But the use of the active duty forces still raises difficult questions.",
      "The Marines are highly trained in combat and crisis response, with time in conflict zones like Syria and Afghanistan. But that is starkly different from the role they will face now: They could potentially be hit by protesters carrying gas canisters and have to quickly decide how to respond or face decisions about protecting an immigration enforcement agent from crowds.",
      "According to a U.S. official, troops will be armed with their normal service weapons but will not be carrying tear gas. They also will have protective equipment such as helmets, shields and gas masks.",
      "When troops are overseas, how they can respond to threats is outlined by the rules of engagement. At home, they are guided by standing rules for the use of force, which have to be set and agreed to by Northern Command, and then each Marine should receive a card explaining what they can and cannot do, another U.S. official said.",
      "For example, warning shots would be prohibited, according to use-of-force draft documents viewed by The Associated Press. Marines are directed to deescalate a situation whenever possible but also are authorized to act in self-defense, the documents say.",
      "The AP reviewed documents and interviewed nine U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet public, about the guidance being determined for the Marines.",
      "The Pentagon also is working on a memo with clarifying language for the Marines that will lay out the steps they can take to protect federal personnel and property. Those guidelines also will include specifics on the possibility that they could temporarily detain civilians if troops are under assault or to prevent harm, the first U.S. official said.",
      "Those measures could involve detaining civilians until they can be turned over to law enforcement.",
      "Having the Marines deploy to protect federal buildings allows them to be used without invoking the Insurrection Act, one U.S. official said.",
      "The Insurrection Act allows the president to direct federal troops to conduct law enforcement functions in national emergencies. But the use of that act is extremely rare. Officials said that has not yet been done in this case and that it's not clear it will be done.",
      "President George H.W. Bush used the Insurrection Act to respond to riots in Los Angeles in 1992 after the acquittal of white police officers who were videotaped beating Black motorist Rodney King.",
      "If their role expands if the violence escalates, it is not clear under what legal authority they would be able to engage, said Elizabeth Goitein, a senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law.",
      "\u201cIf in fact those Marines are laying hands on civilians, doing searches, then you have pretty powerful legal concerns,\u201d Goitein said. \u201cNo statutory authority Trump has invoked so far permits this.\u201d",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth tweeted late Saturday that he was considering deploying the Marines to respond to the unrest after getting advice earlier in the day from Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, according to one of the U.S. officials.",
      "Still, the tweet, which was posted to Hegseth's personal X account and not to his official government account, caught many inside the Pentagon by surprise. As late as Monday, the military's highest offices were still considering the potential ramifications.",
      "But the Marine Corps were asking broader questions, too: Do they send more senior, experienced personnel so as not to put newer, less experienced troops at risk of potentially making a judgment call on whether to use force against a civilian?",
      "What's lawful under a domestic deployment \u2014 where troops may end up in a policing role \u2014 is governed by the Fourth Amendment in the U.S. Constitution, which forbids seizure of persons, including temporarily restraining them, unless it could be considered reasonable under the circumstances.",
      "Troops under federal authorities are in general prohibited from conducting law enforcement on U.S. soil under the Posse Comitatus Act.",

      "An Oklahoma judge has granted a temporary stay of execution to a man whose transfer to death row was expedited by the Trump administration",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- An Oklahoma judge granted a temporary stay of execution Monday to a man whose transfer to death row was expedited by the Trump administration and who was scheduled to receive a lethal injection this week.",
      "John Fitzgerald Hanson, 61, was set to die Thursday for killing a Tulsa woman in 1999.",
      "Hanson\u2019s lawyers have argued that he did not receive a fair clemency hearing last month before the state\u2019s five-member Pardon and Parole Board. They claim board member Sean Malloy was biased because he worked for the Tulsa County District Attorney\u2019s Office when Hanson was being prosecuted.",
      "Malloy has said he never worked on Hanson's case at the time and was unfamiliar with it before the clemency hearing. Malloy was one of three members who voted 3-2 to deny Hanson a clemency recommendation.",
      "\u201cA condemned prisoner, such as Mr. Hanson, possesses a clear and grave interest in the right to due process and the equitable administration of Oklahoma's constitutional process for executive clemency,\u201d Hanson's attorney, Emma Rolls, wrote in their petition.",
      "Attorney General Gentner Drummond argued that the district judge doesn't have the authority to stay the execution and has asked the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals to vacate it.",
      "Hanson was sentenced to death in Tulsa County after he was convicted of carjacking, kidnapping and killing Mary Bowles. Authorities said he and an accomplice kidnapped the woman from a Tulsa shopping mall.",
      "Hanson was transferred to Oklahoma custody in March by federal officials following through on President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping executive order to more actively support the death penalty.",
      "Hanson had been serving a life sentence in federal prison in Louisiana for several federal convictions, including being a career criminal, that predate his state death sentence.",
      "Both Drummond and his predecessor, John O\u2019Connor, had sought Hanson\u2019s transfer during President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, but the U.S. Bureau of Prisons denied it, saying it was not in the public interest.",

    "story": [
      "The 2025 Tribeca Festival continues this week with movie screenings, Q&As, industry panel discussions and public performances across New York City. But one program in this year's festival takes place in virtual worlds.",
      "For more than a decade, Tribeca has been expanding its focus beyond cinema and television to include new avenues of storytelling through the use of virtual reality, augmented reality, and other nascent technologies, producing some vivid immersive displays. Even if the storytelling aspect of the programs were limited, the artistic expressions could be powerful. This was especially true with past exhibits that enveloped the viewer in massive spaces, in which computer-generated imagery or time-lapse photography placed the viewer in new worlds, from exploding galaxies to swirling blood vessels.",
      "Hosted under the umbrella title \"In Search of Us,\"\u00a0this year's installation in Lower Manhattan ties 11 projects together under the rubric of impacts on humanity \u2014 exploring topics from artificial intelligence to climate change, war, school shootings and transphobia. The exhibits with the most profound effects are those with the strongest and most emotional stories embedded inside them.",
      "Within a simple, delineated space furnished with minimal furniture, \"Fragile Home,\" by Ond\u0159ej Moravec and Victoria Lopukhina, uses mixed reality to recreate a home in Ukraine that comes under bombardment. Wearing goggles, the viewer walks through a comfortable, well-appointed living room, past a dinner table and a purring cat, and looks outside the window to a peaceful vista \u2014 all of which, in a flash, is replaced by the home's bombed-out remains, vandalized with Russian forces' \"Z\" graffiti.",
      "The sense of violation is made so powerful in so simple a setting \u2014 and the recognition that such destruction is multiplied millions of times over is heart-wrenching. But the objects that survived \u2014 those with personal meaning to just a handful of people \u2013 become representations of resilience to many.",
      "\"Scent,\" by Alan Kwan, is a first-person cinematic game in which the player becomes a dog wandering a landscape, who observes people being attacked and killed by malevolent forces. In between avoiding bombs and gunfire, the dog helps guide the souls of those killed to become reincarnated. It's a meditative view of cruel violations impacting humanity and nature.",
      "Armed with a tablet, viewers of the augmented reality \"There Goes Nikki\" can wander a garden populated by virtual flowers, and a visualization of the late poet Nikki Giovanni reciting her poem, \"Quilting the Black-eyed Pea (We're going to Mars).\" By Idris Brewster, Michele Stephenson and Joe Brewster.",
      "How dangerous is artificial intelligence? How dumb is it? How snarky?\u00a0 \"AI & Me: The Confessional and AI Ego,\" directed by Daniela Nedovescu and Octavian Mot, provides viewers with an opportunity to become test subjects, as it were, to AI's judgmental streak. Upon sitting in a chair, the participant is captured on camera and analyzed by AI, which conjures up your name, personality traits, and goals. How close are they to reality? Prepare to get snarked. But if the AI program \"likes\" you? Your AI-altered image will turn up in its pantheon of favored carbon-based units (pictured above, right).",
      "Other exhibits are immersive representations of culture \u2014 some self-generated, some created by AI.",
      "\"Uncharted\" (VR, by Kidus Hailesilassie) combines footage of a dancer with spoken word and visualizations of symbols to become a rapturous demonstration of pan-African language and storytelling.",
      "The interactive \"New Maqam City,\" by MIPSTERZ, allows you to become a DJ, manipulating drum beat patterns recognizable in Muslim communities around the world to create a transcendent vibe.",
      "\"The Innocence of Unknowing\" is a video essay and AI project studying media coverage of mass shootings, projected within a simulated classroom. (Created by Ryat Yezbick and Milo Talwani through the MIT Open Documentary Lab.)",
      "One of the strongest impacts of any installation was made by \"In the Current of Being,\" by Cameron Kostopoulos. Using haptic VR, the viewer is literally strapped into a chair; electrodes are attached to your fingertips, arms, and torso, along with VR goggles. Interesting, you think. Then, the presentation begins, recounting the true story of a survivor of electroshock conversion therapy. (As a teenager, Carolyn Mercer had been \"treated\" with electrical shocks in an attempt to \"cure\" her from becoming trans.) As images of female beauty are flashed before you, electrical impulses throb across your body. This is not virtual reality; the extreme discomfort is very real, forcing me out of the presentation less than halfway through. The upshot: aversion therapy works, because I will never allow VR electrodes to be attached to my body ever again.",
      "Beyond the confines of\u00a0 the exhibition space at 161 Water Street, the two-part \"The Power Loom and The Founders Pillars\" (by Lesiba Mabitsela, Meghna Singh and Simon Wood) includes a site-specific AR experience, visible on a mobile app six blocks away, at the New York Stock Exchange, creating a memorial to enslaved people once sold at the Wall Street Slave Market, established in the 18th century.",
      "While the Tribeca Festival proper concludes on June 15, \"In Search of Us,\" presented in partnership with Onassis ONX and Agog: The Immersive Media Institute, runs through June 29. For more details and ticket info click here.",

      "Baldoni also filed a defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, which was the first to report Lively's sexual harassment complaint. That lawsuit was also dismissed Monday.",
      "Lawyers for Lively called the judge's decision \"a total victory and a complete vindication.\"",
      "\"As we have said from day one, this '$400 million' lawsuit was a sham, and the Court saw right through it,\" attorneys Esra Hudson and Mike Gottlieb said in a statement.",

      "\"Our journalists went out and covered carefully and fairly a story of public importance, and the court recognized that the law is designed to protect just that sort of journalism,\" a spokesperson said in a statement. \"We will continue to stand up in court for our journalism and for our journalists when their work comes under attack.\"",
      "Representatives for Baldoni did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "\"What the judge is saying is that Blake Lively's accusations were part of legal filings and therefore they were protected, that they can't form the basis of a defamation suit,\" Levinson told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Baldoni and his production company, Wayfarer Studios, which was a plaintiff in his suit, are able to amend claims related to Lively allegedly breaking her contract by June 23, the judge ruled.",
      "The legal fight between Lively and Baldoni came months after the August 2024 release of \"It Ends With Us,\" an adaptation of the 2016 Colleen Hoover novel about a relationship that becomes abusive.",
      "But rumors of their feud swirled during the promotion of the film, as Baldoni did most of his press separately from Lively and other cast members.",
      "Lively's complaint alleged that following a meeting to address \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\" by Baldoni, who also directed the film, and Jamey Heath, the CEO of Wayfarer and a producer of the film, they began \"a multi-tiered plan\" to ruin the actress' reputation.",
      "Her complaint included screenshots of alleged texts between Baldoni's publicist, Jennifer Abel, and crisis PR specialist Melissa Nathan, in which Abel says Baldoni \"wants to feel like she can be buried.\" Nathan's alleged replies include \"we can't write we will destroy her\" and \"you know we can bury anyone.\"",
      "In the now-dismissed countersuit, Baldoni alleged Lively \"stole Wayfarer's movie, hijacked Wayfarer's premiere, destroyed Plaintiffs' personal and professional reputations and livelihood, and aimed to drive Plaintiffs out of business entirely.\"",

      "Kennedy said he is \"retiring\" all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, asserting that it \"has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine.\"",
      "\"A clean sweep is needed to re-establish public confidence in vaccine science,\" Kennedy wrote in an opinion piece published by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Kennedy's move was quickly rebuked by a number of doctors groups. A statement released by the American Medical Association said it \"upends a transparent process that has saved countless lives.\" The American Academy of Pediatrics called it\u00a0part of an \"escalating effort by the Administration to silence independent medical expertise and stoke distrust in lifesaving vaccines.\"",
      "It comes after months of criticism over how Kennedy has wielded his authority and platform as the head of the nation's public health agencies, including\u00a0ordering changes to COVID-19 vaccine guidance, terminating bird flu vaccine\u00a0research funding, forcing out federal vaccines officials and spreading myths about\u00a0measles shots.",
      "The members of the committee are independent medical and public health experts who advise and vote on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations. The CDC sets immunization schedules for both adults and children based on recommendations from ACIP.",
      "Experts and health authorities closely watch the committee's decisions, since their recommendations are tied to a number of federal policies, including requirements for insurance coverage and liability protections.",

      "The American Public Health Association\u00a0denounced\u00a0it as an undemocratic \"coup\" of the process. The Infectious Disease Society of America called it \"reckless, shortsighted and severely harmful.\" The American College of Physicians accused Kennedy of having \"circumvented the standard, transparent vaccine review processes\" at the CDC.",
      "\"Today's announcement will seriously erode public confidence in our government's ability to ensure the health of the American public and it will endanger the safety, welfare and lives of our patients,\" Dr. Jason Goldman, the group's president and a liaison to the committee, said in\u00a0a statement.",
      "Kennedy raised concern about conflicts of interest among ACIP members, but Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said the committee members cannot own stock in or be on any kind of advisory board for pharmaceutical companies.",
      "\"Kennedy, on the other hand, is conflicted,\" Gounder said on \"CBS Mornings.\" \"He has sued multiple vaccine manufacturers. He has stood to gain or lose from the outcome of these decisions. That is by definition conflicted.\"",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician and the top Republican in the Senate's health committee, also expressed concern, saying \"now the fear is that the ACIP will be filled up with people who know nothing about vaccines except suspicion.\"",
      "\"I've just spoken with Secretary Kennedy, and I'll continue to talk with him to ensure this is not the case,\" Cassidy\u00a0posted on X.",
      "Cassidy had been a key vote in Kennedy's confirmation process, coming out in favor of Kennedy's nomination only after Kennedy offered a number of reassurances, including to \"maintain\" the committee \"without changes.\"",
      "Career CDC officials usually select experts to sit on the committee out of the applications it receives, forwarding picks to the secretary to be signed off on.",
      "Kennedy said the Trump administration would not have been able to appoint a majority of new members until 2028 because some of the current members were last-minute appointees of the Biden administration.",
      "\"The prior administration made a concerted effort to lock in public health ideology and limit the incoming administration's ability to take the proper actions to restore public trust in vaccines,\" Kennedy said.",
      "It is unclear who is being considered to replace the committee's members or how they are being selected. A spokesperson for the department did not comment when asked.",
      "The move comes a week after a committee leader, Dr. Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos, resigned from her role following an order from Kennedy to change the CDC's guidance on COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration wants to shutter the CDC's National Asthma Control Program, which provides millions in funding to state-administered initiatives aimed at fighting the disease.",
    "story": [
      "Esther Bejarano's son was 11 months old when asthma landed him in the hospital. She didn't know what had triggered his symptoms \u2014 neither she nor her husband had asthma \u2014 but she suspected it was the pesticides sprayed on the agricultural fields near her family's home.",
      "Pesticides are a known contributor to asthma and are commonly used where Bejarano lives in California's Imperial Valley, a landlocked region that straddles two counties on the U.S.-Mexico border and is one of the main producers of the nation's winter crops. It also has some of the worst air pollution in the nation and one of the highest rates of childhood asthma emergency room visits in the state, according to data collected by the California Department of Public Health.",
      "Bejarano has since learned to manage her now-19-year-old son's asthma and works at Comite Civico del Valle, a local rights organization focused on environmental justice in the Imperial Valley. The organization trains health care workers to educate patients on proper asthma management, enabling them to avoid hospitalization and eliminate triggers at home. The course is so popular that there's a waiting list, Bejarano said.",
      "But the group's Asthma Management Academy program and similar initiatives nationwide face extinction with the Trump administration's mass layoffs, grant cancellations, and proposed budget cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Environmental Protection Agency. Asthma experts fear the cumulative impact of the reductions could result in more ER visits and deaths, particularly for children and people in low-income communities \u2014 populations disproportionately vulnerable to the disease.",
      "\"Asthma is a preventive condition,\" Bejarano said. \"No one should die of asthma.\"",
      "Asthma can block airways, making it hard to breathe, and in severe cases can cause death if not treated quickly. Nearly 28 million people in the U.S. have asthma, and about 10 people still die every day from the disease, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.",
      "In May, the White House released a budget proposal that would permanently shutter\u00a0the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Asthma Control Program, which was already gutted by federal health department layoffs in April. It's unclear whether Congress will approve the closure.",
      "Last year, the program allotted $33.5 million to state-administered initiatives in 27 states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, D.C., to help communities with asthma education. The funding is distributed in four-year grant cycles, during which the programs receive up to $725,000 each annually.",
      "Comite Civico del Valle's academy in Southern California, a clinician workshop in Houston, and asthma medical management training in Allentown, Pennsylvania \u2014 ranked the most challenging U.S. city to live in with asthma \u2014 are among the programs largely surviving on these grants. The first year of the current grant cycle ends Aug. 31, and it's unknown whether funding will continue beyond then.",
      "Data suggests that the CDC's National Asthma Control Program has had a significant impact. The agency's own research has shown that the program saves $71 in health care costs for every $1 invested. And the asthma death rate decreased 44% between the 1999 launch of the program and 2021, according to the American Lung Association.",
      "\"Losing support from the CDC will have devastating impacts on asthma programs in states and communities across the country, programs that we know are improving the lives of millions of people with asthma,\" said Anne Kelsey Lamb, director of the Public Health Institute's Regional Asthma Management and Prevention program. \"And the thing is that we know a lot about what works to help people keep their asthma well controlled, and that's why it's so devastating.\"",
      "The Trump administration cited cost savings and efficiency in its April announcement of the cuts to HHS. Requests for comment from the White House and HHS's CDC about cuts to federal asthma and related programs were not answered.",
      "The information wars",
      "Fresno, in the heart of California's Central Valley, is one of the country's top 20 \"asthma capitals,\" with high rates of asthma and related emergencies and deaths. It's home to programs that receive funding through the National Asthma Control Program. Health care professionals there also rely on another aspect of the program that is under threat if it's shuttered: countrywide data.",
      "The federal asthma program collects information on asthma rates and offers a tool to study prevalence and rates of death from the disease, see what populations are most affected, and assess state and local trends. Asthma educators and health care providers worry that the loss of these numbers could be the biggest impact of the cuts, because it would mean a dearth of information crucial to forming educated recommendations and treatment plans.",
      "\"How do we justify the services we provide if the data isn't there?\" said Graciela Anaya, director of community health at the Central California Asthma Collaborative in Fresno.",
      "Mitchell Grayson, chair of the Asthma and Allergy Foundation's Medical Scientific Council, is similarly concerned.",
      "\"My fear is we're going to live in a world that is frozen in Jan. 19, 2025, as far as data, because that was the last time you know that this information was safely collected,\" he said.",
      "Grayson, an allergist who practices in Columbus, Ohio, said he also worries government websites will delete important recommendations that asthma sufferers avoid heavy air pollution, get annual flu shots, and get COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "Disproportionate risk",
      "Asthma disproportionately affects communities of color because of \"historic structural issues,\" said Lynda Mitchell, CEO of the Asthma and Allergy Network, citing a higher likelihood of living in public housing or near highways and other pollution sources.",
      "She and other experts in the field said cuts to diversity initiatives across federal agencies, combined with the rollback of environmental protections, will have an outsize impact on these at-risk populations.",
      "In December, the Biden administration awarded nearly $1.6 billion through the EPA's Community Change Grants program to help disadvantaged communities address pollution and climate threats. The Trump administration moved to cut this funding in March. The grant freezes, which have been temporarily blocked by the courts, are part of a broader effort by the Trump EPA to eliminate aid to environmental justice programs across the agency.",
      "In 2023 and 2024, the National Institutes of Health's Climate Change and Health Initiative received $40 million for research, including on the link between asthma and climate change. The Trump administration has moved to cut that money. And a March memo essentially halted all NIH grants focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI \u2014 funds many of the asthma programs serving low-income communities rely on to operate.",
      "On top of those cuts, environmental advocates like Isabel Gonz\u00e1lez Whitaker of Memphis, Tennessee, worry that the proposed reversals of environmental regulations will further harm the health of communities like hers that are already reeling from the effects of climate change. Shelby County, home to Memphis, recently received an F on the American Lung Association's annual report card for having so many high ozone days.

    "published": "Tue, 10 Jun 2025 17:31:19 -0400",
    "summary": "Here's why McDonald's is more exposed than other fast-food brands to shifts in eating habits as a result of weight-loss drugs.",
    "story": [
      "McDonald's shares dropped Tuesday as weight-loss drugs threaten to take a big bite out of the fast food chain's earnings.",
      "Shares were down by as much as 1.7% Tuesday, after equity analysis firm Redburn Atlantic downgraded the burger giant's stock rating two notches, from buy to sell.",
      "Changes in Americans' eating habits spurred by the use of the class of drugs known as GLP-1s, which are designed to help regulate users' blood sugar and appetite, pose an underappreciated threat to some food businesses, according to Redburn Atlantic analysts Chris Luyckx and Edward Lewis.",
      "As a result, McDonald's could lose up to 28 million customer visits, resulting in a revenue loss of $482 million per year \u2014 about 0.9% of the company's sales, according to the analysis.",
      "The appetite-suppressing drugs are expected to have a transformative effect on how Americans consume food. At particular risk are brands that cater to lower-income consumers \u2014 a category to which McDonald's belongs.",
      "That's because spending on food away from home among lower-income households who start using GLP-1 drugs declines and tends to remain depressed, according to the report, creating \"material implications for chains with broad mass-market exposure.\"",
      "Higher-income users of the drugs, by contrast, decrease their spending before reverting to old spending patterns within one year, the analysis found.",
      "\"Behaviour changes extend beyond the individual user \u2014 reshaping group dining, influencing household routines and softening habitual demand. A 1% drag today could easily build to 10% or more over time, particularly for brands skewed toward lower income consumers or group occasions,\" the analysts said in a research note.",
      "Pricing fatigue",
      "Inflationary pressures and consumers' strained budgets only compound problems for McDonald's, according to the report.",
      "\"Consumers are showing clear signs of pricing fatigue after years of aggressive menu inflation,\" the analysts wrote. \"Although the gap between eating out and at home has narrowed, it remains historically wide, reinforcing value concerns.\"",
      "The Redburn analysis refers to GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy as \"demand disruptors\" for restaurants like McDonald's, because they reduce users' appetites and limit the number of calories they consume each day. These features of the drugs \"could have serious implications for the restaurant industry,\" Redburn analysts wrote.",
      "To be sure, adoption of the drugs is not yet widespread, with just 12% of U.S. adults ever having tried the meds. Currently, only 6% of the adult population uses the drugs.",
      "Wider adoption of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss could ultimately lead to a broad-based reduction in Americans' caloric intake at restaurants, including fast food joints, reversing a decades-long trend. From 1977 to 2018, the total share of calories consumed at restaurants nearly tripled, according to Redburn Atlantic's analysis of U.S. Department of Agriculture data.",
      "Compared with other fast food brands, McDonald's is the most exposed to taking a hit from the increased usage of GLP-1 drugs, according to the research.",
      "More pressing challenges",
      "However, Peter Saleh, managing director and restaurant and food distributors analyst at BTIG global financial services, said McDonald's is facing other headwinds, and he wouldn't expect GLP-1s to meaningfully eat into its earnings, at least not in the near-term.",
      "For one, McDonald's core customer base consists of low- and middle-income consumers who are unlikely to be able to afford GLP-1 drugs, said Saleh, who doesn't foresee there being much overlap between the fast food giant's patrons and adopters of the drugs.",
      "\"I don't think there would be a meaningful GLP-1 impact on McDonald's right now, but that's not to say that in three or four years that won't be the case,\" he said. \"I just don't think we are there yet.\"",

      "On June 4, Lindell wrote on social media that \"My employee-owned company and I are in jury trial NOW and need your support!\" He included a link to a landing page on his company's website that includes the line, \"Use promo code JURY\" to receive a \"free Multi-Use MyPillow 2.0\" with any purchase.",
      "The website also includes a link to \"Mike Lindell Legal Defense Fund,\" which asks for donations of between $10 to $1,000. The fundraising effort notes that Lindell has spent \"nearly all his resources ... to exposing corruption in our election systems.\"",
      "MyPillow didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The sales and fundraising efforts come after Lindell told CBS MoneyWatch in 2023 that he had $10,000 to his name after spending millions of his own funds on proving his election theories. The businessman also said he had lost about $7 million after Walmart and other big-box stores dropped his line of bedding.",
      "\"I urgently need your financial support to cover the massive expenses\" of the trial, Lindell said in a video posted to the legal defense site.",
      "On Monday, Lindell took the stand in the defamation trial, which is being held at a federal courthouse in Denver and expected to continue this week. He denied making any statements he knew to be false about Eric Coomer, the former Dominion executive who sued Lindell in 2022 over his statements.",
      "In his Monday testimony, Lindell also reiterated his previous claims that Coomer was \"part of the biggest crime this world has ever seen,\" while he painted himself as the victim of \"lawfare,\" or when people are sued to scare them into silence.",

      "Several conservative news organizations, including Fox News, Newsmax and One America News, have settled defamation lawsuits from voting machine companies over allegations that they promoted falsehoods about the 2020 presidential election. Fox News agreed to pay almost $800 million in its settlement with Dominion.",
      "In April, a judge ruled that Newsmax made defamatory statements about Dominion Voting related to the news channel's claims the voting machine company had rigged votes in the 2020 presidential election, and said the case could proceed to trial, according to the New York Times.\u00a0In 2021, Newsmax also apologized to Coomer for airing false allegations against him.",

Lindell told CBS at the time that he blamed \"cancel culture\" for the revenue slump.",
      "During his testimony, Lindell noted that he once had a net worth of $60 million, but is now millions of dollars in debt, prompting him to turn to crowdfunding to raise money for his legal costs. He also noted that MyPillow had liquidated inventory \"because we had no money left.\"",
      "Lindell added that his fundraising efforts have generated about $362,000 so far.",
      "Lindell's debunked election theories have caused him additional financial problems. In 2021, he had offered to pay $5 million to anyone who could prove computer data he had acquired wasn't, in fact, 2020 election data.",

      "There's also a splashy update to iPhone photo display: With iOS 26, users will\u00a0 be able to view pictures in 3D across the Photos app, lock screen and home screen.",
      "Apple is also making changes to its messages app. Texters with iOS 26 will be able to change the background, or wallpaper, of a chat conversation. The feature is similar to the \"chat theme\" setting on WhatsApp but with more options. In group chats, dots will appear to indicate who is typing \u2014 something previously reserved for one-on-one chats. Texters will also be able create and share polls directly in group messages.",
      "Filtering texts and calls will also become a lot easier with a new screening feature.",
      "\"Unknown senders appear in a dedicated area where you can decide if you want to mark the number as known, ask for more information or delete until you accept messages from unknown senders will remain silenced and won't appear as notifications,\" said Darin Adler, a vice president at Apple.",
      "When you receive a call from an unknown number, Apple will answer the phone silently, record the caller's name and the reason for their call, and then put their response into a written message for the owner of the phone so they can decide whether they want to actually pick up.",
      "There is a slight catch to keep in mind: These new iOS26 features will be reserved for iPhone 11 and later models.",
      "Design upgrades, including Liquid Glass",
      "Alan Dye, Apple's vice president of human interface design, calls the new OS, the company's \u00a0\"broadest design update ever.\"",
      "A hallmark feature of the new OS is\u00a0Liquid Glass, described by the company as an \"expressive material\" meant to mimic the qualities of glass. The dynamic new interface make apps, widgets and docs appear translucent, allowing users to see multiple layers of their screen at once.",
      "Liquid Glass also creates more movement on your interface by morphing into your display. For example, as messages pop up on your home screen, the time display starts to shrink to accommodate them. The color of Liquid Glass also shifts depending on the content on your screen and adapts between light and dark environments.",
      "\"From navigating apps to system experiences like the lock screen notifications and control center app icons have been crafted with multiple layers of Liquid Glass and come to life in light mode, dark mode, colorful, new tints, or an all new clear look,\" said Dye during the company's keynote Monday.",
      "Apple Intelligence",
      "Apple also delivered long-awaited updates to Apple Intelligence, the company's artificial intelligence system that's now integrated with ChatGPT. AI-powered features arriving this fall include Live Translation, which automatically translates messages as they're being received.",
      "\"So if you're making plans with some new friends while studying abroad, your message can be translated as you type and delivered in their preferred language, and when they respond, each text can be instantly translated for you,\" said Leslie Ikemoto, an engineering director at Apple said at the conference Monday.",
      "Visual Intelligence, another AI tool, allows users to take a screenshot of an image they see online \u2014 say, a cute sweater they come across on one of their apps \u2014 and then look up where to find a similar design online. They can also ask ChatGPT specific questions about the image, such as, keeping with the example of the sweater, \"What material is this made of?\"",
      "Another feature builds on Apple broad selection of emojis by giving users the power to combine and personalize existing emojis to create their own unique expressions. In their presentation, Apple showed how someone could merge the lightbulb emoji with the sloth emoji to indicate they were the last one to get a joke, for example.",
      "Still lingering on Apple's to do list is new AI integrations for Siri. Apple introduced updates to the voice assistant at last year's conference, but the full suite of upgrades for the voice assistant have yet to take effect. \"We're continuing our work to deliver the features that make Siri even more personal,\" said senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi on Monday. \"This work needed more time to reach our high quality bar, and we look forward to sharing more about it in the coming year.\"",
      "In a research note, Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives noted that the Apple Intelligence rollout has been slower than expected, but also estimates that over the next few years, 25% of the world population will access AI through an Apple-powered device.",
      "\"While many on [Wall] Street are heading into WWDC as underwhelming given the slower-than-expected rollout of Apple Intelligence, we disagree with this bearish narrative and strongly believe this will be the start of AI monetization period of the Apple ecosystem as the company will continue to lay the foundation through its new operating system updates across Mac, iOS, iPad and others with its '26\" update,'\" Ives said.",

    "summary": "GOP Sen. Josh Hawley's position on the minimum wage aligns him with some of the Senate's most liberal members.",
    "story": [
      "Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley plans to introduce legislation Tuesday to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour \u2014 a position that aligns one of the most conservative Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill with some of the most liberal members of Congress.",
      "The legislation, called the \"Higher Wages for American Workers Act,\" would raise the federal standard starting in 2026 and would also call for an increase in subsequent years to match inflation, CBS News has exclusively learned. Vermont Democratic Sen. Peter Welch has signed on as a co-sponsor.",
      "\"For decades, working Americans have seen their wages flatline. One major culprit of this is the failure of the federal minimum wage to keep up with the economic reality facing hard-working Americans every day,\" Hawley said in a statement to CBS News. \"This bipartisan legislation would ensure that workers across America benefit from higher wages.\"",
      "\"We're in the midst of a severe affordability crisis, with families in red and blue states alike struggling to afford necessities like housing and groceries,\" Welch said in a statement to CBS News. \"A stagnant federal minimum wage only adds fuel to the fire. Every hard-working American deserves a living wage that helps put a roof over their head and food on the table \u2014 $7.25 an hour doesn't even come close.\"",
      "The federal minimum wage currently sits at $7.25 per hour and has not risen since 2009, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.",
      "The move by Hawley puts him at odds with conservative party orthodoxy, which has traditionally opposed a federal minimum wage increase on the grounds that it would be costly for businesses and ultimately, for consumers. But Hawley's pitch is reflective of the party's realignment in the Trump era, where the president's brand of populism has fueled a shift among working-class voters away from Democrats and toward Republicans.",
      "Hawley has been pushing Republicans to embrace this shift. The minimum wage legislation is part of a broader, aspirational package of legislative proposals he dubbed the \"Pro-Worker Framework for the 119th Congress.\" This includes a proposal to help strengthen protections for union jobs, as well as for organizing and collective bargaining.",
      "Earlier this year, he teamed up with Sen. Bernie Sanders to introduce legislation to cap credit card interest rates at 10%. And in the last Congress, he introduced legislation that would require companies with revenues of $1 billion or more to pay their employees at least $15 per hour. In recent weeks, Hawley has been urging his party against cuts to Medicaid benefits in the budget reconciliation bill.",
      "In November, voters in Hawley's home state of Missouri approved a ballot measure to raise the state's minimum wage to $15 per hour, starting in 2026. But the Legislature repealed part of the law that would allow later increases to adjust for inflation.",
      "Earlier this year, President Trump rescinded a Biden-era executive order that raised the minimum wage for federal contractors to $17.75 per hour. At his Senate confirmation hearing in January, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he does not support raising the federal minimum wage, arguing that it is a decision best left up to the states.",

Gavin Newsom asked a federal court to block the deployment of troops onto city streets.",
      "The Marines join approximately 2,100 members of the California National Guard who are now on location in the greater L.A. area, operating in Los Angeles, Paramount and Compton.

      "Asian needle ants prey on other insects and are capable of displacing ant species that are critical for seed dispersal, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Researchers have documented large decreases in seed dispersal in forests where Asian needle ants are present.",
      "\"Thus, this invasive species could have dramatic, long-term negative effects on forest understory,\" the service says.",
      "What should people do if they see Asian needle ants?",
      "Asian needle ants are about 0.2 inches in length, and dark brown or black with the end of the antennae and the legs being a lighter orange-brown, the U.S. Forest Service says. Other ant species can look similar, \"so it takes an experienced eye to positively identify them,\" the service says.",
      "Suiter says that you can send a photograph or a specimen to a local University of Georgia Extension office, which can help with identification. The public can also contact a professional to come out and bait for the ants, he says.",
      "The U.S. Forest Service advises people to avoid the pest and to be especially vigilant in areas with logs, rotting wood or rocks where the ants can nest.",
      "\"Unfortunately, as with many invasive species, it appears Asian needle ants are here to stay,\" the service says.",

      "After unsuccessful attempts to re-establish communications, flight controllers in Tokyo uplinked commands to reboot the Resilience lander's flight computer. But there was no response.",

      "The landing attempt came two years after ispace's first lander malfunctioned during the final stages of its descent to the moon, making a similar hard landing. But Hakamada said it was too early to establish any common cause and that engineers needed more time to analyze the telemetry that made it back to Earth.",
      "Carrying cameras, a few science payloads, a tiny rover and even an art project, Resilience   fired its thrusters just after 2:10 p.m. EDT to begin the 66-minute descent from a 62-mile-high circular orbit to touchdown near the center of Mare Frigoris \u2014 the Sea of Cold \u2014 in the moon's northern hemisphere at 60 degrees north latitude.",
      "All appeared to be going smoothly when, around 3:17 p.m. \u2014 the projected landing time \u2014 telemetry suddenly ceased. The last data received indicated a higher-than-expected descent velocity and an altitude of 630 feet above the surface.",

Even if the storytelling aspect of the programs were limited, the artistic expressions could be powerful. This was especially true with past exhibits that enveloped the viewer in massive spaces, in which computer-generated imagery or time-lapse photography placed the viewer in new worlds, from exploding galaxies to swirling blood vessels.",
      "Hosted under the umbrella title \"In Search of Us,\"\u00a0this year's installation in Lower Manhattan ties 11 projects together under the rubric of impacts on humanity \u2014 exploring topics from artificial intelligence to climate change, war, school shootings and transphobia.

      "Within a simple, delineated space furnished with minimal furniture, \"Fragile Home,\" by Ond\u0159ej Moravec and Victoria Lopukhina, uses mixed reality to recreate a home in Ukraine that comes under bombardment. Wearing goggles, the viewer walks through a comfortable, well-appointed living room, past a dinner table and a purring cat, and looks outside the window to a peaceful vista \u2014 all of which, in a flash, is replaced by the home's bombed-out remains, vandalized with Russian forces' \"Z\" graffiti.",

      "One of the strongest impacts of any installation was made by \"In the Current of Being,\" by Cameron Kostopoulos. Using haptic VR, the viewer is literally strapped into a chair; electrodes are attached to your fingertips, arms, and torso, along with VR goggles. Interesting, you think. Then, the presentation begins, recounting the true story of a survivor of electroshock conversion therapy. (As a teenager, Carolyn Mercer had been \"treated\" with electrical shocks in an attempt to \"cure\" her from becoming trans.) As images of female beauty are flashed before you, electrical impulses throb across your body. This is not virtual reality; the extreme discomfort is very real, forcing me out of the presentation less than halfway through. The upshot: aversion therapy works, because I will never allow VR electrodes to be attached to my body ever again.",

      "Apple is also making changes to its messages app. Texters with iOS 26 will be able to change the background, or wallpaper, of a chat conversation. The feature is similar to the \"chat theme\" setting on WhatsApp but with more options. In group chats, dots will appear to indicate who is typing \u2014 something previously reserved for one-on-one chats. Texters will also be able create and share polls directly in group messages.",

For example, as messages pop up on your home screen, the time display starts to shrink to accommodate them. The color of Liquid Glass also shifts depending on the content on your screen and adapts between light and dark environments.",
      "\"From navigating apps to system experiences like the lock screen notifications and control center app icons have been crafted with multiple layers of Liquid Glass and come to life in light mode, dark mode, colorful, new tints, or an all new clear look,\" said Dye during the company's keynote Monday.",

      "Apple also delivered long-awaited updates to Apple Intelligence, the company's artificial intelligence system that's now integrated with ChatGPT. AI-powered features arriving this fall include Live Translation, which automatically translates messages as they're being received.",
      "\"So if you're making plans with some new friends while studying abroad, your message can be translated as you type and delivered in their preferred language, and when they respond, each text can be instantly translated for you,\" said Leslie Ikemoto, an engineering director at Apple said at the conference Monday.",
      "Visual Intelligence, another AI tool, allows users to take a screenshot of an image they see online \u2014 say, a cute sweater they come across on one of their apps \u2014 and then look up where to find a similar design online. They can also ask ChatGPT specific questions about the image, such as, keeping with the example of the sweater, \"What material is this made of?\"",
      "Another feature builds on Apple broad selection of emojis by giving users the power to combine and personalize existing emojis to create their own unique expressions. In their presentation, Apple showed how someone could merge the lightbulb emoji with the sloth emoji to indicate they were the last one to get a joke, for example.",
      "Still lingering on Apple's to do list is new AI integrations for Siri.

    "summary": "We asked three experts what fresh college graduates can do to prepare as artificial intelligence changes how Americans work. Here's what they said.",
    "story": [
      "New college graduates this year face an especially daunting task \u2014 putting their degrees to work just as \"generative\" artificial intelligence technology like ChatGPT is beginning to change the American workplace.",
      "\"We are entering an entirely new economy, so the knowledge economy that we have been in for the last 50 years or so is on the way out, and a new economy is on the way in,\" Aneesh Raman, Chief Economic Opportunity Officer at LinkedIn, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The impact of AI on Americans recently out of college is already visible across a range of industries and jobs, from technology and finance to media, legal fields and market research. As a result, for the first time\u00a0unemployment among fresh grads recently surpassed the nation's overall jobless rate \u2014 a shift some experts attribute in part to the creeping influence of AI.",
      "\"There are signs that entry-level positions are being displaced by artificial intelligence at higher rates than the roles above them,\" said Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.",
      "With the adoption of AI at work only expected to accelerate, we asked three experts across academia, recruitment and consulting for advice on how new college grads should navigate this new normal. Here's what they said.",
      "Become fluent in AI",
      "Perhaps most important, young job-seekers start using gen-AI tools \u2014 today.",
      "\"Almost anybody in that audience, irrespective of the job that they're pursuing, will be expected to use AI with some facility right away,\" said Joseph Fuller, a professor at Harvard Business School and founder of the Managing the Future of Work\u00a0project, comparing the task to learning how to use Microsoft Office for a previous generation of grads.",
      "To get the ball rolling, experts encourage those who are starting to hunt for work to familiarize themselves with the array of tools at their disposal, such as Anthropic's Claude or OpenAI's ChatGPT. That means learning how to engage with such tools beyond simply using them as a search engine.",
      "\"You want to get in a dialogue with it,\" Fuller said. \"You want to ask it to take different perspectives.\"",
      "Emily Rose McRae, an analyst at research and advisory firm Gartner, said learning how to use AI apps can also be a good way to develop transferable skills. For example, asking AI to summarize documents and then validating its findings to ensure accuracy.",
      "Meanwhile, although AI can be helpful when it comes time to filling out job applications, users should proceed with caution given that recruiters can often spot AI-generated language, experts note. Nearly two-thirds of job candidates today use AI at some point in the application process, according to a\u00a0report from recruitment firm Career Group Companies.",
      "\"If you're using it to write your cover letter and your resume and you did not review it, everyone can tell,\" McRae said.",
      "Another way to gain potentially valuable experience with AI, while also seeking work, is for interview practice. For example, users can ask the chatbot both to provide sample questions they might face in an interview and then rate the quality of their responses.",
      "\"If you are using it as a tool to get your own understanding of self in interviews, you're going to start being leaps ahead of everyone else,\" Raman said.",
      "Hone your soft skills",
      "Experts say that as AI surpasses humans in executing certain tasks \u2014 think actuarial math or corporate compliance, for example \u2014more attention will shift to job candidates' so-called soft skills, such as problem solving and communication.",
      "\"You cannot outsource your thinking to AI,\" LinkedIn's Raman said. \"You have to continue to hone critical thinking and complex strategy thinking.\"",
      "The focus will be less on your pedigree \u2014 where you went to school or even whether you have a college degree \u2014 he added, and more on what he calls the \"5 Cs\": curiosity, compassion, creativity, courage and communication.",
      "To improve their soft skills, Fuller encourages entry-level job candidates to work on turning what they regard as their biggest weakness into a strength. For instance, if you typically shy away from public speaking or talking in groups, push yourself to get comfortable in those situations.",
      "\"The inability to do that is going to be penalized more severely in the work of the future than it has been in the past,\" he said.",
      "The Harvard professor also suggested highlighting examples of advanced social skills directly on your resume to help paint a picture for recruiters of how you can contribute to the workplace.",
      "Choose your employer wisely",
      "Beyond skills development, experts say college grads should be thoughtful about the type of company they choose to work at, knowing that AI could drastically alter the business in the coming years.",
      "\"The most important thing, if you're a new grad, is where you work \u2014 not what you do at the place you're going to work,\" Raman told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He encouraged college graduates to seek out employers that are integrating AI responsibly and with respect for their workforce \u2014 as opposed to embracing it chiefly to replace people. Companies that are adapting to what is a major technological shift in real time will typically offer the best opportunities for learning and growth, Fuller said.",
      "In evaluating a prospective employer, young job candidates should try to gain an understanding of how they fit into the company's future. For example, McRae recommends asking hiring managers up front what types of investments the organization is making in its employees and what the room for growth looks like.",
      "\"What are they telling me they care about? What do career paths look like for this role like now? How do you help people develop the skills they need to become experts?\" she said.",
      "In researching companies, McRae also encouraged recent college grads to look for places that offer apprenticeship or rotational programs, which can offer ways to quickly ramp up their knowledge base, especially if traditional entry-level roles are in short supply.",

    "summary": "Meta platforms such as Instagram have marketed AI tools that let users create sexually explicit images of real people.",
    "story": [
      "Meta has removed a number of ads promoting \"nudify\" apps \u2014 AI tools used to create sexually explicit deepfakes using images of real people \u2014 after a CBS News investigation found hundreds of such advertisements on its platforms.",
      "\"We have strict rules against non-consensual intimate imagery; we removed these ads, deleted the Pages responsible for running them and permanently blocked the URLs associated with these apps,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS News in an emailed statement.",
      "CBS News uncovered dozens of those ads on Meta's Instagram platform, in its \"Stories\" feature, promoting AI tools that, in many cases, advertised the ability to \"upload a photo\" and \"see anyone naked.\" Other ads in Instagram's Stories promoted the ability to upload and manipulate videos of real people. One promotional ad even read \"how is this filter even allowed?\" as text underneath an example of a nude deepfake.",
      "One ad promoted its AI product by using highly sexualized, underwear-clad deepfake images of actors Scarlett Johansson and Anne Hathaway. Some of the ads' URL links redirect to websites that promote the ability to animate real people's images and get them to perform sex acts. And some of the applications charged users between $20 and $80 to access these \"exclusive\" and \"advance\" features. In other cases, an ad's URL redirected users to Apple's app store, where \"nudify\" apps were available to download.",
      "An analysis of the advertisements in Meta's ad library found that there were, at a minimum, hundreds of these ads available across the company's social media platforms, including on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, the Facebook Messenger application and Meta Audience Network \u2014 a platform that allows Meta advertisers to reach users on mobile apps and websites that partner with the company.",
      "According to Meta's own Ad Library data, many of these ads were specifically targeted at men between the ages of 18 and 65, and were active in the United States, European Union and United Kingdom.",
      "A Meta spokesperson told CBS News the spread of this sort of AI-generated content is an ongoing problem and they are facing increasingly sophisticated challenges in trying to combat it.",
      "\"The people behind these exploitative apps constantly evolve their tactics to evade detection, so we're continuously working to strengthen our enforcement,\" a Meta spokesperson said.",
      "CBS News found that ads for \"nudify\" deepfake tools were still available on the company's Instagram platform even after Meta had removed those initially flagged.",
      "Deepfakes are manipulated images, audio recordings, or videos of real people that have been altered with artificial intelligence to misrepresent someone as saying or doing something that the person did not actually say or do.",
      "Last month, President Trump signed into law the bipartisan \"Take It Down Act,\" which, among other things, requires websites and social media companies to remove deepfake content within 48 hours of notice from a victim.",
      "Although the law makes it illegal to \"knowingly publish\" or threaten to publish intimate images without a person's consent, including AI-created deepfakes, it does not target the tools used to create such AI-generated content.",
      "Those tools do violate platform safety and moderation rules implemented by both Apple and Meta on their respective platforms.",
      "Meta's advertising standards policy says, \"ads must not contain adult nudity and sexual activity. This includes nudity, depictions of people in explicit or sexually suggestive positions, or activities that are sexually suggestive.\"",
      "Under Meta's \"bullying and harassment\" policy, the company also prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company says its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share nonconsensual intimate imagery.",
      "Apple's guidelines for its app store explicitly state that \"content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy\" is banned.",
      "Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell University's tech research center, has been studying the surge in AI deepfake networks marketing on social platforms for more than a year. He told CBS News in a phone interview on Tuesday that he'd seen thousands more of these ads across Meta platforms, as well as on platforms such as X and Telegram, during that period.",
      "Although Telegram and X have what he described as a structural \"lawlessness\" that allows for this sort of content, he believes Meta's leadership lacks the will to address the issue, despite having content moderators in place.",
      "\"I do think that trust and safety teams at these companies care. I don't think, frankly, that they care at the very top of the company in Meta's case,\" he said. \"They're clearly under-resourcing the teams that have to fight this stuff, because as sophisticated as these [deepfake] networks are \u2026 they don't have Meta money to throw at it.\"",
      "Mantzarlis also said that he found in his research that \"nudify\" deepfake generators are available to download on both Apple's app store and Google's Play store, expressing frustration with these massive platforms' inability to enforce such content.",
      "\"The problem with apps is that they have this dual-use front where they present on the app store as a fun way to face swap, but then they are marketing on Meta as their primary purpose being nudification. So when these apps come up for review on the Apple or Google store, they don't necessarily have the wherewithal to ban them,\" he said.",
      "\"There needs to be cross-industry cooperation where if the app or the website markets itself as a tool for nudification on any place on the web, then everyone else can be like, 'All right, I don't care what you present yourself as on my platform, you're gone,'\" Mantzarlis added.",
      "CBS News has reached out to both Apple and Google for comment as to how they moderate their respective platforms. Neither company had responded by the time of writing.",
      "Major tech companies' promotion of such apps raises serious questions about both user consent and about online safety for minors. A CBS News analysis of one \"nudify\" website promoted on Instagram showed that the site did not prompt any form of age verification prior to a user uploading a photo to generate a deepfake image.",
      "Such issues are widespread. In December, CBS News' 60 Minutes reported on the lack of age verification on one of the most popular sites using artificial intelligence to generate fake nude photos of real people.",
      "Despite visitors being told that they must be 18 or older to use the site, and that \"processing of minors is impossible,\" 60 Minutes was able to immediately gain access to uploading photos once the user clicked \"accept\" on the age warning prompt, with no other age verification necessary.",
      "Data also shows that a high percentage of underage teenagers have interacted with deepfake content. A March 2025 study conducted by the children's protection nonprofit Thorn showed that among teens, 41% said they had heard of the term \"deepfake nudes,\" while 10% reported personally knowing someone who had had deepfake nude imagery created of them.",

Gavin Newsom asked a federal court to block the deployment of troops onto city streets.",
      "The Marines join approximately 2,100 members of the California National Guard who are now on location in the greater L.A. area, operating in Los Angeles, Paramount and Compton. A top Pentagon official testified to Congress that the estimated cost of deploying the National Guard and the Marines is roughly $134 million.",

      "Notably, the filing says the state \"does not seek to prevent any of those forces from protecting the safety of federal buildings or other real property owned or leased by the federal government, or federal personnel on such property,\" but instead \"seeks narrow relief tailored to avoid irreparable harm to our communities and the rule of law that is likely to result\" if Marines and the National Guard are used for immigration and law enforcement.",
      "The U.S. Northern Command said in a statement\u00a0Monday evening that Marines from 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division had been activated to prepare for the deployment. The Marines are based in Twentynine Palms, a city east of Los Angeles.",
      "Northern Command said the Marines would \"seamlessly integrate\" with hundreds of members of the National Guard to protect \"federal personnel and federal property.\" They have been trained in \"de-escalation, crowd control and standing rules for the use of force,\" the military added.",
      "A U.S. military official said the Marines are at a staging area in the greater L.A. area awaiting specific instructions. Appearing before the Armed Services Committee, Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Eric Smith referred specific questions to Northern Command but said the Marines who have been deployed have received crowd-control training and have equipment like shields and batons. He said the Marines \"don't have arrest authority\" and are there \"to protect federal property and federal personnel.\"",
      "Under federal law, active-duty military cannot be used for domestic law enforcement purposes without the president invoking what's known as the Insurrection Act, a step President Trump has not taken.

Their presence is what's causing people to feel a little bit more on edge,\" Padilla said. \"As things have been quieting down a little bit more each day, now he's capturing that, not with a de-escalation, but now potentially sending the Marines.\"",

Charges against him have since been dropped.",

    "summary": "The case could mark a turning point for due process rights in the U.S., Kilmar Abrego Garcia's attorney says.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A lawyer for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the mistakenly deported man who was recently brought back from El Salvador to face charges in the U.S., said his case is bigger than one individual.",
      "Chris Newman, who represents Abrego Garcia' family, told CBS News' Major Garrett in an interview that he does not see the case as a referendum on immigration, but as a potential turning point in the erosion of due process rights in the U.S.",
      "\"The Trump administration is very invested in making this a referendum on the immigration debate, which, as you know, has become coarsened and polarized,\" Newman said. \"And that is one way to look at it. And I think certainly a lot of people view it that way. I don't view it that way. I view this as a core constitutional order case, a core due process case. And it just so happens that a Salvadoran immigrant is defending bedrock constitutional protections for all of us.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. on Friday to face charges of human smuggling, amid an escalating battle between the Trump administration and the courts.",
      "The case ignited widespread outrage after Abrego Garcia was sent to El Salvador and held in an infamous supermax prison along with hundreds of other deportees, despite a judge ruling years earlier that he shouldn't be deported to El Salvador. The Trump administration admitted that his deportation was an \"administrative error.\"",
      "A judge had ordered the government to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S., but the administration did not bring him back for months, arguing it was up to the Salvadoran government whether to release him.",
      "The indictment, which was unsealed Friday, alleges that Abrego Garcia and others transported thousands of migrants across the U.S. who were in the country illegally. It also claims that many of the undocumented migrants were members of the gang MS-13. The administration has also accused Abrego Garcia of MS-13 membership, which his family and attorneys strongly deny.",
      "\"Until Friday, Kilmar Abrego Garcia had never been charged with any crime, either in the United States or El Salvador, but you wouldn't know that if you watched White House press briefings for the last two months,\" Newman said. \"All we've been asking up until this point is for Kilmar to have his day in court so he could defend himself.\"",
      "In court papers over the weekend, Abrego Garcia's lawyers accused the Trump administration of an \"elaborate, all-of-government effort to defy court orders, deny due process, and disparage Abrego Garcia.\" The administration says it has complied with court orders by returning Abrego Garcia to the U.S.",
      "Newman said that Democratic lawmakers who visited Abrego Garcia when he was imprisoned in El Salvador came back with a warning from Salvadorians whose family members had been treated similarly by President Nayib Bukele's government.",
      "\"We in El Salvador have no more guardrails. We have no more Supreme Court. We have no more check against President Bukele, other than public opinion. You all have to fight to make sure that you keep the bedrock institutions of your democracy because we've already lost them in El Salvador,\" Newman said of their message.",

      "She said her husband got physical \"at least about 10 times out of the month,\" which made her afraid \"most of the time.\"",
      "Those in a similar position who are still in jail could soon see some relief in Georgia. A new law passed in Georgia called the Survivor Justice Act would allow domestic violence survivors to ask for lower sentences in court if they can present evidence that abuse led them to commit their crimes. Under the law, Dickens' sentence could have been as little as 10 years.",

If all of the procedures are carried out as planned, the inmates' deaths will bring the national total of executions to 23 so far this year, according to the Death Penalty Information Center which tracks the number. In 2024, there were 25 executions across the U.S.",
      "While four inmates being scheduled to die in the same week is not an anomaly in the U.S., their executions present an overall uptick in the use of capital punishment nationwide since January. They also come as the Trump administration seeks to resume death row executions at the federal level.",
      "Here's what to know about the executions that have been ordered this week.",
      "Anthony Wainwright, Florida",
      "Florida inmate Anthony Wainwright, 54, received a lethal injection and was pronounced dead Tuesday night at Florida State Prison near Starke, The Associated Press reported.",
      "His death warrant, issued by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, set a weeklong window for the execution to take place. The window started at noon local time on Tuesday. Wainwright's execution was the sixth in Florida in 2025.",
      "Wainwright was sentenced to death in 1995, after receiving multiple convictions related to a \"crime spree\" the previous year, which included the abduction, rape and murder of 23-year-old Carmen Gayheart, according to court documents. He and an accomplice, Richard Hamilton, were found to have committed the crimes after escaping prison in North Carolina in 1994.",
      "Gregory Hunt, Alabama",
      "Alabama inmate\u00a0Gregory Hunt, 65, was executed Tuesday by nitrogen asphyxiation and declared dead at a south Alabama prison, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Hunt received capital punishment after his conviction for the 1988 murder of Karen Lane, according to the state's Department of Corrections. The death warrant, signed by Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, established a 30-hour time frame for the execution to occur, starting at 12 a.m. local time Tuesday.",
      "Hunt is the fifth person in Alabama to die by\u00a0nitrogen hypoxia\u00a0\u2014 a controversial method in which the inmate is deprived of oxygen through inhalation of pure nitrogen.",
      "As\u00a0states that still practice capital punishment\u00a0faced difficulties obtaining drugs for\u00a0lethal injections, nitrogen hypoxia was developed as a workaround to the primary method used around the country. Execution by nitrogen asphyxiation has been the subject of intense public scrutiny within the U.S. and overseas, with U.N.\u00a0human rights advocates arguing\u00a0that it \"could amount to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment under international human rights law.\"",
      "Alabama carried out the country's first known execution with the method on\u00a0Kenneth Smith\u00a0in January 2024. Since then, Louisiana became the only other state to\u00a0execute a death row inmate with nitrogen gas\u00a0in March of this year.",
      "John Fitzgerald Hanson, Oklahoma",
      "The execution of John Fitzgerald Hanson, also known as George John Hanson, 61, was scheduled for Thursday in Oklahoma \u2014 but a judge on Monday granted a temporary stay of the execution.",
      "Hanson's lawyers have argued he did not receive a fair\u00a0clemency hearing last month\u00a0before the state's five-member Pardon and Parole Board. They claim board member Sean Malloy was biased because he worked for the Tulsa County District Attorney's Office when Hanson was being prosecuted.",
      "Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond\u00a0argued the district judge doesn't have the authority to stay the execution and has asked the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals to vacate it.",
      "Hanson was convicted of capital murder in Oklahoma for the 1999 death of 77-year-old Mary Bowles in Tulsa, according to court records. In order to carry out Hanson's death sentence, Drummond requested his extradition back into the state from Louisiana, where the inmate had been incarcerated for decades while serving a separate life sentence for robbery.",
      "His\u00a0transfer to death row\u00a0was expedited by the Trump administration. If Hanson is executed, he will be the state's second execution this year.",

      "The two death row inmates in South Carolina\u00a0died by\u00a0firing squad\u00a0this year after the state legislature approved the method partly due to prison officials not being able to obtain\u00a0drugs needed for lethal injections.

      "Under Title 18, defense personnel are generally prohibited from direct law enforcement activities, including arrests of civilians, but they may detain individuals temporarily to protect federal property or personnel under \"exigent circumstances.\" Historically, the civil-military boundary and constitutional protections limit arrest authority to authorized federal law enforcement officers. Under the federal law known as Posse Comitatus, the U.S. military is prohibited from enforcing domestic laws, unless explicitly authorized by Congress. Unless Mr. Trump invokes the Insurrection Act \u2014 and he has not done so \u2014 there is no exception to Posse Comitatus.",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant DHS secretary, indicated that Noem had sent the letter before the president deployed the Guard troops.

      "Mr. Trump, Hegseth and Noem met Monday at the White House \"to go over the situation on the ground,\" according to three sources familiar with the meeting.",
      "On Monday, Hegseth activated about 700 active-duty Marines to join the 2,100 National Guard troops deployed in Los Angeles, Paramount and Compton, California. But he \"did not take any action on Noem's letter,\" one of the sources said.",
      "The president on Saturday had directed the National Guard to protect federal immigration officials, federal law enforcement and federal buildings in L.A., amid immigration enforcement action and protests. Mr. Trump said Guard personnel would be in the area for 60 days, or at the defense secretary's discretion.",
      "Thousands of protesters demonstrated Sunday, blocking a major freeway and setting self-driving cars on fire as law enforcement used tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bangs to control the crowd. On Monday, according to the Associated Press, protests were mostly peaceful.",

      "Protests in Los Angeles against Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids prompted President Trump to order\u00a0about 700 active-duty Marines\u00a0to join the National Guard troops previously deployed to the city, actions that spurred legal pushback from California Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "A defense official told CBS News the Marines arrived in greater Los Angeles on Tuesday morning, joining about 2,100 members of the California National Guard who are now operating in Los Angeles, Paramount and Compton. Acting Defense Department comptroller Bryn MacDonnell estimated the cost of deploying the National Guard will be $134 million while testifying Tuesday before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense.",
      "Earlier, the U.S. Northern Command had said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0that Marines would \"seamlessly integrate\" with Guard members to assist them in \"protecting federal personnel and federal property.\" They are trained in \"de-escalation, crowd control and standing rules for the use of force,\" the statement said.",

      "California officials on Tuesday asked a federal judge to issue an order restricting how the Trump administration can use Marines and National Guard troops in response to the protests. The state\u00a0sued the Trump administration on Monday for deploying the Guard without consulting Newsom, a move the governor had called \"illegal and immoral\"\u00a0in a social media post. In another post Monday morning, Newsom said Mr. Trump \"illegally acted to federalize the National Guard,\" adding, \"We're suing him.\"",
      "Newsom suggested late Monday that his office could pursue additional legal action against the administration over its planned use of Marines, which the governor also called illegal.",
      "As of Tuesday afternoon, at least 146 people have been arrested by LAPD officers since the protests started, the police department said. They were arrested on a range of charges, including failure to disperse, objects and fireworks thrown at officers, looting and arson, according to the LAPD. Police said 96 of those arrests were made Monday night, mostly on charges for failure to disperse, in addition to one charge each for assault with a deadly weapon, resisting arrest and vandalism.",
      "California Highway Patrol has also arrested at least 17 people and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has arrested at least another five, the agencies told CBS News.",

      "He reminded reporters that police must comply with the California Values Act, a Los Angeles \"sanctuary city\" ordinance also known as SB 54, which prevents local and state law enforcement agencies from assisting federal immigration enforcement activity.",
      "On Sunday, many protesters dispersed as evening fell and police declared an unlawful assembly, a precursor to officers moving in and arresting people who didn't leave.",
      "But some of those remaining threw objects at police from behind a makeshift barrier that spanned the width of a street and others hurled chunks of concrete, rocks, electric scooters and fireworks at California Highway Patrol officers and their vehicles parked on the closed southbound 101 Freeway. Officers ran under an overpass to take cover.",
      "CBS News Los Angeles reported that several fires were set in dumpsters and trash bins, and at least one store had windows shattered by alleged looters. Dozens of buildings were tagged with graffiti, including the LAPD Headquarters, the U.S. Courthouse and the old Los Angeles Times building.",
      "Footage from the CBS News Los Angeles helicopter showed that multiple windows of the police headquarters had been shattered as well.",
      "Separately, police in San Francisco issued a statement late Monday saying, \"Thousands participated in demonstrations today that were overwhelmingly peaceful. At the very end of the night, two small groups broke off and committed vandalism and other criminal acts. Detained multiple individuals who refused to comply and made arrests.\" The statement referred to protests at the city's Civic Center and in its Mission District.",

      "L.A. demonstrations intensified",
      "Sunday's protests in Los Angeles, a sprawling city of 4 million people, were centered in several blocks of downtown. It was the third and most intense day of demonstrations against Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown in the region, as the arrival of around 300 Guard troops spurred anger and fear among many residents.",
      "The Guard was deployed specifically to protect federal buildings, including the downtown detention center where protesters concentrated.",
      "McDonnell, the L.A, police chief, said officers were \"overwhelmed\" by the remaining protesters. He said they included regular agitators who show up at demonstrations to cause trouble.",

      "Mr. Trump responded to McDonnell on Truth Social, telling him to arrest protesters in face masks.",
      "\"Looking really bad in L.A. BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!\" he wrote.",
      "Starting in the morning, the troops stood shoulder to shoulder, carrying long guns and riot shields as protesters shouted \"shame\" and \"go home.\" After some closely approached the Guard members, another set of uniformed officers advanced on the group, shooting smoke-filled canisters into the street.",
      "Minutes later, L.A. police fired rounds of crowd-control munitions to disperse the protesters, whom they said were assembled unlawfully. Much of the group then moved to block traffic on the 101 Freeway until state patrol officers cleared them from the roadway by late afternoon.",
      "Nearby, at least four self-driving Waymo cars were set on fire, sending large plumes of black smoke into the sky and exploding intermittently as the electric vehicles burned. By evening, police had issued an unlawful assembly order shutting down several blocks of downtown Los Angeles.",
      "Flash-bangs echoed out every few seconds into the evening.",
      "National Guard troops mobilized and Marines activated",
      "The military said Monday that it was\u00a0mobilizing another 2,000 members of the California National Guard to respond to the protests.",

      "The move adds to 2,000 National Guard troops who were\u00a0called up\u00a0by the president late Saturday to protect federal personnel and property.",
      "The military\u00a0also activated\u00a0about 700 active-duty Marines on Monday to assist the Guard, U.S. Northern Command said in a\u00a0statement. The 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines are based in Twentynine Palms, a city east of Los Angeles.",
      "How the demonstrations started",
      "The arrival of the National Guard followed two days of protests that began Friday in downtown Los Angeles before spreading on Saturday to Paramount, a heavily Latino city south of the city, and neighboring Compton.",
      "Federal agents arrested immigrants in LA's fashion district, in a Home Depot parking lot and at several other locations on Friday. The next day, they were staging at a Department of Homeland Security office near another Home Depot in Paramount, which drew out protesters who suspected another raid. Federal authorities later said there was no enforcement activity at that Home Depot.",
      "The weeklong tally of immigrant arrests in the LA area climbed above 100, federal authorities said. Many more were arrested while protesting, including a prominent union leader who was accused of impeding law enforcement.",
      "What are officials saying?",
      "In addition to suing the Trump administration over the deployment of National Guard members, Newsom suggested late Monday that\u00a0California would also sue over the deployment of the Marines\u00a0to L.A.",
      "\"U.S. Marines serve a valuable purpose for this country \u2014 defending democracy. They are not political pawns,\" the governor wrote in\u00a0a post on X. \"The Secretary of Defense is illegally deploying them onto American streets so Trump can have a talking point at his parade this weekend. It's a blatant abuse of power.\"",
      "Newsom had requested that Mr. Trump remove the guard members in a letter Sunday afternoon, calling their deployment a \"serious breach of state sovereignty.\" He was in Los Angeles meeting with local law enforcement and officials.",
      "The deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state's National Guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration's mass deportation efforts.",
      "Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass blamed the increasingly aggressive protests on the president's decision to deploy the Guard, calling it a move designed to enflame tensions. They've both urged protesters to remain peaceful.",
      "\"What we're seeing in Los Angeles is chaos that is provoked by the administration,\" Bass said in an afternoon press conference. \"This is about another agenda, this isn't about public safety.\"",
      "But McDonnell, the LAPD chief, said the protests were following a similar pattern for episodes of civil unrest, with things ramping up in the second and third days.",
      "He pushed back against claims by the Trump administration that the LAPD had failed to help federal authorities when protests broke out Friday after a series of immigration raids. His department responded as quickly as it could, and had not been notified in advance of the raids and therefore was not pre-positioned for protests, he said.",
      "Newsom, meanwhile, has repeatedly said that California authorities had the situation under control. He mocked Mr. Trump for posting a congratulatory message to the Guard on social media before troops had even arrived in Los Angeles, and said on MSNBC that Mr. Trump never floated deploying the Guard during a Friday phone call. He called the president a \"stone-cold liar.\"",
      "The admonishments didn't deter the administration.",
      "\"It's a bald-faced lie for Newsom to claim there was no problem in Los Angeles before President Trump got involved,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement.",
      "Democratic California Rep. Maxine Waters on Sunday strongly rebuked the president's decision to deploy the National Guard, calling the situation \"outrageous\" and \"horrible\" and adding that she believes Mr. Trump is using L.A., a sanctuary city, as an example.",
      "\"He's using deportation as a way to enhance his position with all those right-wingers out there who do not want this country to be a country of people coming from other places,\" the Democrat told a reporter outside the Metropolitan Detention Center. \"I think he's up to creating martial law.\"",
      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris also condemned the Trump administration's actions in L.A. on Sunday, calling the deployment of the National Guard \"a dangerous escalation meant to provoke chaos.\"",
      "\"In addition to the recent ICE raids in Southern California and across our nation, it is part of the Trump Administration's cruel, calculated agenda to spread panic and division,\" said Harris, who also previously served as a senator and attorney general of California. \"This Administration's actions are not about public safety \u2014 they're about stoking fear. Fear of a community demanding dignity and due process.\"",
      "Some perspective on the protests",

    "story": [
      "Protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions in Los Angeles have continued for several days, with the Trump administration deploying National Guard troops and hundreds of Marines in response.",
      "The protests began on Friday, when immigration raids took place in the Los Angeles area. Video from Friday afternoon showed protesters gathering outside a clothing warehouse that ICE was targeting, and protesters attempting to stop a law enforcement van. Over the weekend, the protests escalated, with some demonstrations declared unlawful assemblies and the National Guard being mobilized.",
      "Here's what to know about the catalyst for the protests and key moments in the Trump administration's response.",
      "What is ICE doing in Los Angeles?",
      "ICE agents are in Los Angeles as part of President Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration in the United States. Arrests by the agency during Mr. Trump's second term topped 100,000 as of last week, according to\u00a0internal government data\u00a0obtained by CBS News. Agents have detained people on immigration charges in courthouses, at worksites and in communities across the country.",
      "ICE recorded more than 1,200 arrests across the U.S. on Monday, according to agency data obtained by CBS News.",
      "There were more than 55,000 individuals in ICE detention as of Tuesday morning, according to the agency data.",
      "Why are people protesting in Los Angeles?",
      "CBS News immigration and politics reporter Camilo Montoya-Galvez said that on Friday, ICE said it arrested over 40 suspected undocumented migrants at a work site. Another 77 people were arrested by ICE and federal partners across the greater L.A. area on Friday, he said, citing ICE data.",
      "ICE officials confirmed that four federal search warrants were served at three locations in downtown Los Angeles on Friday. The Associated Press reports that agents arrested immigrants in L.A.'s fashion district, as well as in a Home Depot parking lot and at other locations on Friday. The operations are wider in scope than previous ICE actions, and represent a shift from the agency's targeted enforcement operations.",
      "\"How did we get from gang members to Home Depot?\" Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass asked \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Maurice DuBois\u00a0on Monday.",
      "The Friday arrests appeared to be the catalyst for the protests, Montoya-Galvez said. The demonstrations started in downtown L.A. on Friday, then spread to Paramount and Compton on Saturday.",
      "The demonstrations have been largely peaceful, though outbreaks of violence over the weekend and on Monday resulted in arrests.",
      "The ICE actions also continued over the weekend. Federal agents have targeted schools, local businesses and communities in Los Angeles, \"CBS Mornings\"\u00a0reported on Tuesday. One recent video appeared to show a father being detained and taken by agents in front of his family at a Culver City car wash over the weekend.",
      "The protests in Los Angeles have been centered on the ICE actions and arrests in the area, and have demanded an end to ICE raids and enforcement actions there.",
      "\"This is a city of immigrants. This is a city that wants to help you get your legal status,\" Bass said. \"This is a city that embraces everybody that is here, regardless of when you got here or where you came from.\"",
      "Trump's crackdown on protests",
      "The Trump administration has responded strongly to the Los Angeles protests. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that the administration would not allow for a \"repeat of 2020,\" referencing the protests that erupted after George Floyd's murder.",
      "On Saturday, June 7, Mr. Trump deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles, marking the first time a president sent troops into a state without a state request in decades, legal experts told CBS News. Mr. Trump invoked Title 10, a federal code that allows the president to call in the National Guard in the event that \"the United States, or any of the commonwealths or possessions, is invaded or is in danger of invasion by a foreign nation; there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the government of the United States; or the president is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said in his order\u00a0deploying National Guard troops that the protests threaten \"Federal immigration detention facilities and other Federal property,\" making the protests \"a form of rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.\" The order called for at least 2,000 National Guard troops.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized the move on social media, writing that there was \"currently no unmet need\" and describing the deployment as \"purposefully inflammatory.\" California also sued the Trump administration, with attorneys for the state saying Mr. Trump \"unlawfully bypassed\" Newsom by putting National Guard troops under federal control without the governor's permission.",
      "\"At no point in the past three days has there been a rebellion or an insurrection. Nor have these protests risen to the level of protests or riots that Los Angeles and other major cities have seen at points in the past, including in recent years,\" the lawsuit reads.",
      "On Monday, June 9, the Trump administration activated hundreds of U.S. Marines to join the National Guard troops. A defense official said that 700 active-duty Marines started arriving in L.A. on Tuesday morning. Newsom said he could take legal action over the use of Marines, calling it illegal.",
      "Military officials said the Marines would \"seamlessly integrate\" with the National Guard to protect \"federal personnel and federal property.\" The troops have been trained in \"de-escalation, crowd control and standing rules for the use of force,\" military officials said.",
      "Also on June 9, the Trump administration said it was mobilizing another 2,000 National Guard troops to the Los Angeles area.",
      "State and local officials have said that the deployments could aggravate the already tense situation in the city.",
      "\"We didn't have a problem until Trump got involved,\" Newsom\u00a0posted on X\u00a0Monday.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth defended the administration's mobilization of the National Guard and Marine Corps members, saying, \"We believe ICE agents should be allowed to be safe in doing their operations and we have deployed National Guard and the Marines to protect them in the execution of their duties because we ought be able to enforce immigration law in this country.\"",
      "Hegseth, testifying Tuesday before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, claimed ICE agents are \"being attacked for doing their job, which is deporting illegal criminals.\"",
      "\"If they're attacked, that's lawless, and President Trump believes in law and order,\" Hegseth said, arguing the president \"has every authority.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has not invoked the Insurrection Act, a 19th-century law that gives military troops domestic law enforcement authority to quell domestic unrest. On Friday, June 6, Mr. Trump said \"if there's an insurrection,\" he \"would certainly invoke it.\"",

      "Four Austin police officers were injured and authorities used chemical irritants to disperse a crowd of several hundred demonstrators who made their way to the J.J. Pickle Federal Building, which houses an ICE office. State officials had closed the Capitol to the public an hour early in anticipation of the protest.",
      "Austin police used pepper spray balls and state police used tear gas when demonstrators began trying to deface the federal building with spray paint.

Three officers were injured by \"very large\" rocks and another was injured while making an arrest, she said.",

      "Dallas",
      "A protest that drew hundreds to a rally on a city bridge lasted for several hours Monday night before Dallas police declared it an \"unlawful assembly\" and warned people to leave or face possible arrest.",
      "Dallas police initially posted on social media that officers would not interfere with a \"lawful and peaceful assembly of individuals or groups expressing their First Amendment rights.\" But officers later moved in and local media reported seeing some in the crowd throw objects as officers used pepper spray and smoke to clear the area. At least one person was arrested.",
      "\"Peaceful protesting is legal,\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, posted on X. \"But once you cross the line, you will be arrested.\"",
      "Seattle",
      "About 50 people gathered outside the immigration court in downtown Seattle on Tuesday, chanting with drums and holding up signs that said \"Free Them All; Abolish ICE\" and \"No to Deportations.\" The protest was initially peaceful but protesters began putting scooters in front of the entryways to the building before police arrived.",
      "Mathieu Chabaud, with Students for a Democratic Society at the University of Washington, said they were there in solidarity with the protesters in Los Angeles, \"and to show that we're opposed to ICE in our community.\"",
      "Legal advocates who normally attend the immigration court hearings as observers and to provide support to immigrants were not allowed inside the building. Security guards also turned away the media. The hearings are normally open to the public.",
      "Santa Ana, California",
      "In Santa Ana near Los Angeles, armored vehicles blocked the road Tuesday morning leading into the Civic Center, where federal immigration officers and numerous city and county agencies have their offices.",

      "Massey is one of the 10 inmates who escaped a New Orleans jail on May 16 by yanking open a faulty cell door, removing a toilet, crawling through a hole in the wall behind it and scaling a barbed wire fence in the early morning hours. The\u00a0jailbreak went unnoticed for hours.",
      "Massey, 32, faces charges of kidnapping, rape, domestic battery involving strangulation and motor vehicle theft. In an\u00a0Instagram post\u00a0shared Friday, a person claiming to be Massey stated he is \"innocent.\"",

      "The sanctions were not laid out in detail, but could include bans on Smotrich and Ben-Gvir entering the U.S. allies' territory, and the freezing of some foreign-held assets.",
      "\"Settler violence is incited by extremist rhetoric which calls for Palestinians to be driven from their homes, encourages violence and human rights abuses and fundamentally rejects the two-state solution. Settler violence has led to the deaths of Palestinian civilians and the displacement of whole communities,\" the statement said. \"Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich have incited extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights. Extremist rhetoric advocating the forced displacement of Palestinians and the creation of new Israeli settlements is appalling and dangerous. These actions are not acceptable. We have engaged the Israeli Government on this issue extensively, yet violent perpetrators continue to act with encouragement and impunity. This is why we have taken this action now \u2014 to hold those responsible to account.\"",
      "The countries said that while the sanctions announced Tuesday \"focus on the West Bank,\" Israel's actions there \"cannot be seen in isolation from the catastrophe in Gaza. We continue to be appalled by the immense suffering of civilians, including the denial of essential aid.\"",
      "The five nations said the measures \"do not deviate from our unwavering support for Israel's security and we continue to condemn the horrific terror attacks of 7 October by Hamas,\" adding that in their view, the rhetoric of the two Israeli cabinet members also undermines \"Israel's own security and its standing in the world.\"",

We reject any notion of equivalence: Hamas is a terrorist organization that committed unspeakable atrocities, continues to hold innocent civilians hostage, and prevents the people of Gaza from living in peace,\" Rubio said in a statement. \"We remind our partners not to forget who the real enemy is. The United States urges the reversal of the sanctions and stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Israel.\"",
      "The sanctions were announced as the Palestinian Red Crescent in the Israeli-occupied West Bank said 80 people were injured Tuesday during Israel's ongoing military operations in the Palestinian territory, in the town of Nablus, specifically. Israel insists its military operations in the West Bank are necessary to root out terrorists who plan and launch attacks from the territory.",
      "British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said Tuesday that the Israeli officials had used \"horrendous extremist language\" and that he'd \"encourage the Israeli government to disavow and condemn that language.\"",

      "CBS News has met Palestinian residents and Israeli activists in the West Bank who say violent attacks by Israeli settlers have increased significantly since the war in Gaza began, including attacks that have driven people from their land.",
      "The statement published Tuesday by the British Foreign Ministry said there had been more than 1,900 \"attacks against Palestinian civilians since January last year\" in the territory.",
      "Smotrich said in a social media post that he'd heard about the sanctions as he attended the inauguration of a new settlement in the West Bank on Tuesday. Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory, which are illegal under international law, have flourished over the last two years, and Smotrich said Tuesday: \"We are determined to continue building.\"",
      "Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar called the sanctions \"outrageous.\" He said he'd discussed the measures with Netanyahu, and that Israel would decide upon its response next week.",
      "Israeli human rights lawyer Eitay Mack, who has spent years campaigning for international sanctions against Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, told The Associated Press that Tuesday's move was \"historic,\" but that it was \"unbelievable that it took so long for Western governments to sanction Israeli politicians \u2014 and the fact that it's being done while Trump is president is quite amazing.\"",
      "\"It is a message to Netanyahu himself that he could be next,\" Mack told the AP.",
      "All of the nations behind the new sanctions are closely allied with the U.S., and three of them are fellow members of the NATO alliance. Australia and New Zealand are not NATO members, but they work closely with the U.S. through the \"Five Eyes\" intelligence sharing alliance, along with the U.K. and Canada.",
      "More Palestinians reportedly killed near U.S.-backed group's aid hub",
      "While the negotiations drag on, the war raging in Gaza continues to take a steep daily toll in Palestinian lives.",
      "The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health said Tuesday that more than 30 people had been killed around two of the controversial, U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's aid distribution hubs in the enclave. Witnesses said the victims were shot, echoing accounts of numerous previous incidents around the GHF's four operational distribution hubs in Gaza.",
      "The Israeli military said it was aware of reports of people being injured in the area, and that the details were under review.",
      "Soldiers \"fired warning shots hundreds of meters from the aid distribution site\" in question before it opened on Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement.",
      "The shots were fired \"toward suspects who posed a threat to the troops,\" according to the IDF.",
      "Israel does not allow foreign journalists to enter Gaza, so it was difficult to determine what actually happened on Tuesday, as it has been in all of the previous reported killings near the GHF hubs.",
      "The GHF, in a daily note on its operations sent to media outlets, said: \"Aid distribution at both sites proceeded without incident\" on Tuesday.",
      "The U.S.-based group's aid centers, which are staffed by armed, private American contractors, are located adjacent to heavily militarized zones in the Gaza Strip, which the IDF has declared off-limits to civilians from dusk to dawn.",
      "CBS News' local team in Gaza has reported widespread confusion among families trying to seek aid at the hubs. Residents have told CBS News that it is often unclear which of the four aid hubs are open at any given time. Large crowds have gathered near the hubs in the overnight hours, with people hoping to be first in line for food distribution, which can start as early as 6 a.m. local time.",
      "Nevertheless, video has shown steady streams of people leaving the centers with sacks containing aid, including dried lentils and cooking oil.",
      "Virtually no one in Gaza has gas left to power stoves, however, so families have been burning trash, including plastic, to cook with. Many of the dry goods in the GHF aid parcels are inedible unless they're cooked.",
      "Trump says Iran involved in talks with Hamas and Israel",
      "President Trump told reporters at a White House event on Monday night that Iran is involved in negotiations between Hamas and the U.S. and Israel aimed at securing a ceasefire in Gaza and the return of Israeli hostages from the Palestinian territory.",
      "\"Gaza right now is in the midst of a massive negotiation between us and Hamas and Israel, and Iran actually is involved,\" he said. He didn't offer any further details, but said: \"We'll see what's going to happen with Gaza. We want to get the hostages back.\"",
      "The U.S. has long been engaged in ongoing negotiations in Qatar aimed at brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, but there has been no indication of an imminent breakthrough in those talks, though Netanyahu said in a video message Tuesday that the dialogue had advanced.",
      "Iran has never been mentioned by the U.S. previously as a party to the talks, and no member of Netanyahu's government has ever acknowledged engaging in negotiations with Iran. Israeli media outlets cited anonymous officials on Tuesday as denying any discussion with Iran, but there was no on-the-record statement from Netanyahu's government about Mr. Trump's remarks, which came after a telephone call between the two leaders earlier on Tuesday.",
      "Netanyahu and Mr. Trump reportedly discussed the separate talks the U.S. has been holding with Iranian negotiators aimed at striking a new deal to impose limits on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for the easing of crushing economic sanctions. Those talks are due to resume toward the end of this week, either in Oman or Oslo, but thus far the Iranian government has said the country will not agree to abandon entirely its domestic enrichment of uranium, something the White House continues to insist on publicly.",
      "Israel strikes Houthi-held port in Yemen",
      "Israel's navy has also stepped up its attacks on the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, firing two missiles at Houthi-held port facilities in the Red Sea port city of Hodeida, the IDF said Tuesday.",
      "The military said the strikes were carried out to \"stop the use of the port for military purposes,\" including the movement of weapons.",
      "Hodeida's docks have been attacked in the past by Israel's air force, and the strikes were meant as a fresh warning to the Houthis to stop firing missiles at Israel. On average, the rebels have launched a missile at Israel every other day for several months. Almost all have disintegrated in the air or been intercepted by Israeli air defenses.",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said if the attacks don't stop, Israel will impose a complete air and sea blockade on Houthi territory in Yemen, not unlike the one Israel is currently imposing on Gaza.",
      "\"We warned the Houthi terror organization that if they continue to fire at Israel, they will face a powerful response and enter a naval and air blockade,\" said Katz.",
      "The Houthis did not offer any assessment of the damage inflicted by the Israeli strike, and there was no video evidence immediately broadcast by the group's own satellite news outlet.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News' Bryan Llenas reports from New York City on Sean 'Diddy' Combs being reprimanded for body language directed at the jury.",
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' ex-girlfriend took the stand Monday and testified for the third day in the rapper's federal trial for sex crimes.",
      "His ex, who testified under the pseudonym \"Jane,\" told prosecutors that there were times she felt coerced into hotel nights with Diddy and that the Bad Boy Records founder still pays for both her legal fees and rent.",

      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' ex-girlfriend took the stand Monday and testified for the third day in the rapper's federal trial for sex crimes. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "\"Jane Doe commented on the consistency between her experience and that of Cassie Ventura after she read Ventura\u2019s civil lawsuit,\" Beidel said. \"If the jury also finds the two women\u2019s experiences similar, Jane Doe\u2019s testimony becomes powerful corroboration of Ventura\u2019s testimony. Adding in the voice memos could lend even more credence to the two women\u2019s accounts, as those voice memos are evidence of Mr. Combs\u2019 views at the time in his own words.\"",
      "Jane told the court that Diddy asked her about coercion after he allegedly forced her to take drugs before having sex with a male escort. She testified about Diddy's alleged violent behavior and said he once put her in a chokehold after kicking and punching her. The jury was shown video evidence of Jane's injuries, which included a bruised eye and welts on her forehead.",
      "Texts shown in federal court on Monday between Diddy and Jane revealed that she felt manipulated and wanted monetary income.",
      "The rapper allegedly texted Jane back, \"F--- you.\" Jane allegedly told Diddy, \"You're the only opportunist ... you had three years of fun with my body ... you were a full time job and consumed my life.\" The \"Last Night\" rapper allegedly texted back that he was blocking Jane's number and also calling the police.",
      "\"You conned me into sucking d--- for you,\" Jane allegedly texted. After several texts, she wrote, \"I'm going to kill myself.\"",
      "Diddy listened to testimony from an ex-girlfriend, who testified under the nickname \"Jane.\" (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "\"Early in the trial, the prosecutors introduced extensive evidence to support their theory that Combs used violence and threats of violence to coerce Ventura into engaging in sexual activity,\" former federal prosecutor Mark Chutkow told Fox News Digital. \"However, the prosecution\u2019s evidence of Jane Doe\u2019s alleged coercion centers more on emotional manipulation than violence.\u00a0That could prove to be a weakness for the prosecution case because Jane\u2019s evidence was introduced later in the trial, closer to when the jurors will deliberate.\"",
      "Mark Chuktow, who now practices at Dykema, added, \"As a result, it might dilute the impact of Ventura\u2019s earlier testimony because Jane\u2019s evidence is less clear-cut regarding whether Combs coerced her to engage in sexual activity.\u00a0To counter this, the prosecutors might put more weight in closing arguments on the evidence that Combs blackmailed both women into complying with his sexual demands through threats of destroying their reputations and careers by publicly exposing the video recordings of their participation in the freak-offs.",
      "\"Blackmail like this might resonate more with the jury than Combs\u2019 emotional manipulation of Jane when deciding whether or not the victims consented to the sexual activity.\"",

      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs talks with his lawyers on the 17th day of testimony in his federal trial. (Jane Rosenberg)",
      "Diddy then allegedly grabbed Jane by the hair and her arm and dragged her back into the house, saying she was \"f---ing crazy.\" She claimed to keep asking him to leave.",
      "\"Jane\u2019s testimony is more of the same in regards to the defendant\u2019s conduct, and it certainly does not paint a good picture of Mr. Combs,\" Los Angeles litigator John J. Perlstein told Fox News Digital. \"It is hard to say whether or not the jury is numb to it all. However, they are unlikely to be shocked by Jane\u2019s testimony given what everyone else has said thus far.",
      "\"This trial is a lengthy process for jurors, and recordings and videos of the testimonies typically fare better than readings.\"",
      "Jane also testified to being with Diddy when she saw the video of the rapper assaulting Cassie Ventura at the InterContinental Hotel in 2016.

      "She told the court that she never heard the \"Victory\" rapper deny he was the one in the video assaulting Cassie. Jane testified that Diddy showed her a final draft of what he would say, and she understood he would post it on social media. She said she thought the message was heartfelt.",
      "Jane claimed they eventually talked about the video in June or July 2024. Diddy allegedly told her that was the only time he and Cassie had physical violence. Diddy allegedly told Jane that Cassie \"was a hitter.\"",

      "Attorney Christopher Melche told Fox News Digital, \"Jane testified about horrific acts of abuse in the relationship similar to what Cassie experienced, but what was unique about her testimony today is that Jane is still having her rent paid for by Diddy to this very day, and they continued their relationship right up to the time that he was arrested, so I'm not sure how the jury is going to reconcile all of these horrible things that happened to her and how her rent is being paid and accepted right 'til now.\"",

If found guilty, he faces a minimum of 15 years behind bars or a maximum sentence of life in prison.",
      "He has maintained his innocence throughout the trial, where witnesses have testified to alleged rape, sexual assault, severe physical abuse, forced labor and drug trafficking. The trial is expected to wrap up by July 4.",

      "The top Republican on that panel, Assemblyman Ed Ra, told the New York Post that remembering Oct. 7 and/or combating antisemitism should never be \"political.\"",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson urges you to use Apple\u2019s App Privacy Report to see what your apps are really up to.",
      "Apple\u2019s iPad has a strong reputation for security. Thanks to the system architecture of iOS, a non-jailbroken iPad isn\u2019t susceptible to typical viruses or malware infections. However, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s completely safe from every threat. As with any computer, there are still vulnerabilities that determined hackers can exploit.",
      "iPads are generally secure devices, but it\u2019s still possible for hackers to gain access, so knowing the warning signs of a hacked iPad can help you act quickly to protect your data. Moreover, an iPad often contains a lot of personal information about you and your family, so if it\u2019s ever hacked, it can be quite alarming.",

      "How to tell if your iPad has been hacked",
      "Be on the lookout for these signs that could indicate your iPad\u2019s security has been compromised:",
      "If your iPad suddenly feels more like a sluggish turtle than the speedy device it used to be, that\u2019s a warning sign. When a device is hacked, malicious software might be running in the background, using up memory and processing power. This can make apps slow to open, cause lagging or freezing and even lead to more frequent crashes. You might also notice the battery draining much faster than usual along with the slowdown, since unwanted software can chew through battery life while it secretly runs in the background.",
      "A sudden flood of pop-up ads or strange messages on your iPad screen is a big red flag. Under normal circumstances, iPads should not bombard you with random pop-ups, especially outside of safe apps or websites. If you start seeing lots of unsolicited ads or \"Your iPad is hacked!\" alerts popping up, it could mean an adware program or scam has found its way onto the device. These pop-ups might try to trick you or your kids into clicking links or downloading something harmful, so they\u2019re not just annoying, they\u2019re dangerous signs that something is wrong.",
      "An Apple iPad (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW TO PROTECT AN IPHONE & IPAD FROM MALWARE 2025",
      "Keep an eye on how the iPad is using the internet. An unusual spike in data usage or constant network activity (even when no one is actively using the iPad) might indicate the device is secretly sending or receiving information without your permission. For example, if your data plan suddenly maxes out or you notice the Wi-Fi icon flickering with activity when the iPad is idle, it could be a sign that a hacker\u2019s software is communicating in the background. Such suspicious network activity is concerning because it suggests someone else might be remotely accessing the iPad or siphoning off personal data.",
      "HOW TO TRANSFER INFO FROM AN OLD IPAD TO A NEW IPAD",
      "One clear warning sign is finding changes to your Apple account that you didn\u2019t make. If your Apple ID password was changed without your knowledge or you receive security alerts about logins you never did, be wary; a hacker may have gained access to your account.",
      "You might also discover that account details or settings (like your recovery email or trusted phone number) have been altered. Another clue is seeing unfamiliar charges or App Store purchases on your Apple ID bill, since unauthorized purchases or subscriptions often mean that someone has compromised your account and is using it maliciously.",

      "Top tips to protect your iPad from hackers and malware",
      "If you suspect your iPad has been hacked, taking immediate action can secure your device and give you peace of mind. Here are a few basic steps to help you respond:",
      "1) Reset your passwords: Change your Apple ID password right away (and any other important account passwords used on the iPad) to lock out any intruders. Using a strong password (think long, random and unique to each account) greatly reduces that risk. A password manager can help you generate and store complex passwords so you don\u2019t have to remember them all yourself. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "2) Remove unfamiliar apps: Check the iPad for any apps you or your child didn\u2019t install. If you find an unknown app or a suspicious profile, delete it immediately. This helps eliminate any malicious programs the hacker may have added. To do this, open\u00a0Settings, tap\u00a0General\u00a0>\u00a0iPad Storage, scroll to find the unfamiliar app, tap\u00a0it, then tap\u00a0Delete App and confirm.",
      "3) Update iOS: Make sure the iPad is running the latest version of iPadOS. Apple frequently releases security updates to fix vulnerabilities, so\u00a0updating the software can shut down any loopholes the hacker might have used. Turning on automatic updates is a good idea to stay protected going forward.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication: If you haven\u2019t already,\u00a0turn on two-factor authentication for your Apple ID account. This feature adds an extra verification step (like a code sent to your phone) whenever someone tries to sign in, which can stop hackers in their tracks even if they somehow know your password. It\u2019s an excellent safeguard to prevent unauthorized access.",
      "5) Have strong antivirus protection on all devices: Malware, spyware and viruses can run quietly in the background or compromise enough data before it is discovered. While not being hacked in the first place is the best position to be in, it is worse to give access to your iPad\u2019s data to a hacker for a prolonged period of time. That\u2019s why having strong antivirus software running consistently in the background of your device is a great way to prevent compromises from happening in the first place.\u00a0Best antivirus security software and apps to protect you.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It\u2019s important to remember that many of these symptoms can have innocent explanations, so don\u2019t panic at the first sign of trouble. For example, a new iOS update or a heavy app can temporarily slow down your iPad\u2019s performance, so one isolated issue doesn\u2019t always mean you\u2019ve been hacked. However, if you notice multiple warning signs at the same time or anything that just doesn\u2019t feel right, it\u2019s best to act quickly and err on the side of caution.",

      "6) Request an IRS Identity Protection PIN: Prevent fraudulent tax filings using your SSN by setting up an\u00a0Identity Protection PIN with the IRS. This six-digit number adds another layer of protection during tax season.",
      "7) Review your Social Security earnings record: Log in to your\u00a0\"My Social Security\" account regularly to review your earnings history and benefits. This helps ensure your information hasn\u2019t been altered or compromised.",

      "Glide underwater with CudaJet and make the ocean your playground. Kurt Knutsson discusses the redesigned tech that might be your next big thrilling adventure.",
      "If you've ever dreamed of gliding underwater with the freedom of a dolphin, the CudaJet might be the gadget for you. Unlike most underwater propulsion systems that strap onto your arms or legs, the CudaJet is worn like a backpack, giving you a hands-free way to cruise beneath the surface. It's a fresh approach that feels a lot more natural and comfortable, especially for longer swims.",
      "The CudaJet's story started almost seven years ago. Back then, it was just a prototype called the Cuda, a passion project by British designer Archie O'Brien during his final year at Loughborough College of Art and Design, now known as Loughborough Design School. Archie wanted something lighter and faster than anything else out there, and in 2023 his vision became reality with the first commercial CudaJet.",
      "Now, the CudaJet has been redesigned with a longer battery life, lighter build and updated features, making it even more appealing to underwater adventure seekers.",

      "CudaJet underwater jetpack: How it works and what\u2019s new",
      "So, what's it like to use? The main unit is a dual-jet-drive pack that attaches to a padded neoprene harness, which you wear on your torso. You control everything with a hardwired, trigger-style remote that lets you adjust your speed and keep an eye on the battery level. One of the biggest improvements for 2025 is the battery. While the original model provided approximately 40 minutes of underwater fun for every 75-minute charge, the latest version extends that time to a full 90 minutes per charge. That's more than double the original runtime, so you can explore even more on a single outing.",
      "CudaJet can take you down to a maximum depth of 131 feet, and it delivers about 88 pounds of thrust. That translates to a top speed of roughly 10 feet per second, or about 6.7 mph. Now, that might not sound fast on land, but underwater it's a whole different story. The company likes to point out that at 10 feet per second, the drag force on your body is about the same as flying through air at nearly 200 mph. It's an exhilarating experience that feels powerful and smooth.",
      "The 2025 redesign also trimmed some weight from the original, reducing it from approximately 33 pounds to just over 30 pounds, including the harness. The harness itself comes in four sizes, so you can get a fit that feels just right. Safety is clearly a priority as well. Each CudaJet ships with a factory-set safety depth of about 10 feet, which you can adjust up to the full 131 feet if you're feeling adventurous. If you ever go past your set limit, the motor cuts out and floats you right back to the surface. The controller's full-color display keeps you updated on your speed, battery and depth at all times.",

For those who want something even more exclusive, there's a Founder's Edition with lifetime product access, in-water training with the founder and a lifetime warranty, but only 20 of those are being made.",

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Online scams thrive on the urgency and fear of their victims. If you've ever been a victim of a scam, you\u2019d know that bad actors often try to rush you into taking action by creating a sense of fear. A scammer may call you impersonating a government agency and claim your Social Security number has been linked to drug trafficking.",
      "A phishing email might ask you to update your tax details or claim you\u2019ve won a lottery or a free product, all to get you to click a malicious link.",
      "A more effective tactic scammers use is sending fake login alerts. These are warnings that someone has logged into your account, prompting you to take immediate action. This method works well because legitimate services like Google, Apple, Netflix and Facebook also send these types of notifications when someone, including you, logs in from a new device. It can be tricky to tell the difference.",
      "As Robert from Danville asks, \"I constantly get in my spam junk folder emails saying 'someone has logged into your account.' Is this spam? legitimate? concerning? How do I know? How to avoid wasting time checking? How do I check?\"",
      "Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals \u2014 plus instant access to my\u00a0free Ultimate Scam Survival Guide when you sign up!",
      "Thanks for writing to us, Robert. I completely understand how tricky it can be to figure out whether these messages are legitimate or just another scam attempt. Let's break down what these urgent warnings usually look like and go over a few ways you can stay safe.",
      "A person logging into a Gmail account on a laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How login alert scams work and why they\u2019re so effective",
      "Scammers often pose as login alerts from Google, Apple, Meta or even your bank, complete with official-looking logos, because fear is effective. But not every alert is a scam. In many cases, these notifications are legitimate and can help you detect unauthorized access to your accounts. Let\u2019s focus on the scam side first.",
      "Login alert scams have been around for a while. Early reports date back to 2021, and the trend has persisted since then. In 2022, reports surfaced that scammers were impersonating Meta and sending phishing emails to users.",
      "FBI WARNS OF SCAM TARGETING VICTIMS WITH FAKE HOSPITALS AND POLICE",
      "One such email used a clean layout with minimal text. It avoided the usual scare tactics and stuck to a simple message. But that is not always the case. A common red flag in phishing attempts is the tendency to overload the email with unnecessary details. These messages often include cluttered formatting, excessive explanations and an increasing number of typos or design errors. One phishing email simply gets to the point:",
      "Someone tried to Iog into Your Account, User lD",
      "A user just logged into your Facebook account from a new device Samsung S21. We are sending you this email to verify it\u2019s really you.",
      "Thanks,",
      "The Facebook Team",
      "What\u2019s concerning now is that poor grammar is no longer a reliable sign of a scam. Thanks to AI, even those with limited English skills can write emails that sound polished and professional. As a result, many phishing messages today read just like legitimate emails from trusted companies.",
      "Receiving a phishing email is not the real issue. The real problem starts when you click on it. Most of these emails contain links that lead to fake login pages, designed to look exactly like platforms such as Facebook, Google or your bank.",
      "If you enter your credentials there, they go directly to the scammer. In some cases, simply clicking the link can trigger a malware download, especially if your browser is outdated or your device lacks proper security. Once inside, attackers can steal personal information, monitor your activity or take control of your accounts.",

      "DON'T CLICK THAT LINK! HOW TO SPOT AND PREVENT PHISHING ATTACKS IN YOUR INBOX",
      "How to tell if a login alert is real or fake",
      "Real login notifications\u00a0do exist; they\u2019re just much less scary. A genuine alert from Google, Apple or Microsoft will come from an official address (for example, no-reply@accounts.google.com or security@apple.com) and use consistent branding. The tone is factual and helpful.",
      "For instance, a legit Google security alert might say, \"We detected a login from a new sign-in to your Google Account on a Pixel 6 Pro device. If this was you, you don't need to do anything. If not, we'll help you secure your account.\"\u00a0\u00a0It may include a \"Check activity\" button, but that link always redirects to a google.com address, and it won\u2019t prompt you to reenter your password via the email link. Similarly, Apple notes it will never ask for passwords or verification codes via email.",
      "Legitimate Google notification\u00a0 (Google)",
      "FBI WARNS OF SCAM TARGETING VICTIMS WITH FAKE HOSPITALS AND POLICE",
      "What to do if you get a suspicious login alert email",
      "1. Don\u2019t click any links or attachments and use strong antivirus software: Instead, manually log in to the real site (or open the official app) by typing the URL or using a bookmarked link. This guarantees you\u2019re not walking into a scammer\u2019s trap. The FTC recommends this: if you have an account with that company, contact them via the website or phone number you know is real,\u00a0not the info in the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Remove your data from the internet: Scammers are able to send you targeted messages because your data, like your email address or phone number, is already out there. This often happens due to past data breaches and shady data brokers. A data removal service can help clean up your digital trail by removing your information from public databases and people-search sites. It\u2019s not a quick fix, but over time, it reduces how easily scammers can find and target you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "3. Check your account activity:\u00a0Go to your account\u2019s security or sign-in page. Services like Gmail, iCloud or your bank let you review recent logins and devices. If you see nothing unusual, you\u2019re safe. If you do find a strange login, follow the site\u2019s process (usually changing your password and logging out all devices). Even if you don\u2019t find anything odd, change your password as a precaution. Do it through the official site or app, not the email. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): This is your best backup. With\u00a02FA enabled, even if someone has your password, they can\u2019t gain access without your phone and an additional second factor. Both Google and Apple make 2FA easy and say it \"makes it harder for scammers\" to hijack your account.",
      "5. Report suspicious emails: If you receive a suspicious email claiming to be from a specific organization, report it to that organization\u2019s official support or security team so they can take appropriate action.",
      "THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING WRONG WHEN SCAMMERS CALL",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "You shouldn\u2019t have to vet every sketchy email. In fact, your email\u2019s spam filters catch most phishing attempts for you. Keep them enabled, and make sure your software is up to date so that malicious sites and attachments are blocked. Still, the most powerful filter is your own awareness. You're definitely not alone in this. People receive these spammy login scares every day. By keeping a cool head and following the steps above, you're already ahead of the game.",

This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

Consider a Personal Data Removal Service:\u00a0Your personal information is widely available online, which can make you a bigger target for these types of scams, therefore you might look into a personal data removal service.

    "story": [
      "E-BAR operates as a set of robotic handlebars that follow users.",
      "The demographic landscape in the U.S. is shifting rapidly, with the median age now at 38.9, almost a decade older than it was in 1980.",
      "By 2050, the population of adults over 65 is projected to surge from 58 million to 82 million, intensifying the already urgent challenge of eldercare. With falls remaining the top cause of injury among older adults, the need for innovative, tech-driven solutions has never been clearer.",
      "MIT engineers are stepping up to this challenge with E-BAR, a mobile robot designed to physically support seniors and prevent falls as they move around their homes.",
      "Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts, and exclusive deals \u2014 plus instant access to my\u00a0free Ultimate Scam Survival Guide when you sign up!",
      "An individual demonstrating the E-BAR. (MIT)",
      "How MIT\u2019s E-BAR robot helps prevent falls and support senior mobility",
      "E-BAR, short for\u00a0Elderly Bodily Assistance Robot, is not your typical assistive device. Rather than relying on harnesses or wearables, which many seniors find cumbersome or stigmatizing, E-BAR operates as a set of robotic handlebars that follow users from behind. This allows individuals to walk freely, lean on the robot's arms for support or receive full-body assistance when transitioning between sitting and standing. The robot's articulated body, constructed from 18 interconnected bars, mimics the natural movement of the human body, delivering a seamless and intuitive experience.",
      "AI ROBOTS HELP NURSES BEAT BURNOUT AND TRANSFORM HOSPITAL CARE",
      "The engineering behind E-BAR's mobility is equally impressive. The robot's 220-pound base is meticulously designed to support the weight of an average adult without tipping or slipping, and its omnidirectional wheels enable smooth navigation through tight spaces and around household obstacles. This means E-BAR can move effortlessly alongside users, providing support in real time, whether they are reaching for a high shelf or stepping out of a bathtub.",

      "BEST CREDIT CARDS FOR SENIORS AND RETIREES 2025",
      "Inside MIT\u2019s E-BAR: A fall-prevention robot designed for aging in place",
      "What sets E-BAR apart from previous eldercare robots is its integrated fall-prevention system. Each arm is embedded with airbags made from soft, grippable materials that can inflate instantly if a fall is detected. This rapid response cushions the user without causing bruising, and, crucially, it does so without requiring the user to wear any special gear. In lab tests, E-BAR successfully supported elderly volunteers as they performed everyday tasks that often pose a risk for falls, such as bending down, stretching up or navigating the tricky edge of a bathtub.",
      "Currently, E-BAR is operated via remote control, but the MIT team is already working on automating its navigation and assistance features. The vision is for future versions to autonomously follow users, assess their real-time fall risk using machine learning algorithms and provide adaptive support as their mobility needs evolve.",

      "Why E-BAR prioritizes dignity, usability and independence for older adults",
      "The E-BAR project is rooted in extensive interviews with seniors and caregivers, which revealed a strong preference for unobtrusive, non-restrictive support systems. E-BAR's U-shaped handlebars leave the front of the user completely open, allowing for a natural stride and easy exit at any time. The robot is slim enough to fit through standard doorways and is designed to blend into the home environment, making it a practical addition rather than an intrusive medical device.",
      "MIT researchers see E-BAR as part of a broader ecosystem of assistive technologies, each tailored to different stages of aging and mobility. While some devices may offer predictive fall detection or harness-based support, E-BAR's unique combination of full-body assistance, fall prevention and user autonomy addresses a critical gap for those who want to maintain independence but need occasional support.",

The research team is continuing to refine the design and aims to bring it to market in the coming years, but it could take 5\u201310 years before the device receives full regulatory approval and becomes commercially accessible.",
      "Looking forward, the research team is also focused on refining E-BAR's design to make it slimmer, more maneuverable and even more intuitive to use. They are also exploring ways to integrate advanced AI for real-time fall prediction and adaptive assistance, ensuring that the robot can meet users' changing needs as they age. The ultimate goal is to provide seamless, continuous support, empowering seniors to live safely and confidently in their own homes.",

It's easy to see how something like this could make a big difference for seniors wanting to stay independent without feeling tied down by bulky or uncomfortable devices.

      "LexisNexis filed a\u00a0notice with the Maine attorney general revealing that a hacker accessed consumer data through a third-party software development platform. The breach happened on Dec. 25, 2024, but the company only discovered it months later. LexisNexis was alerted on April 1, 2025, by an unnamed individual who claimed to have found sensitive files. It remains unclear whether this person was responsible for the breach or merely came across the exposed data.",
      "MASSIVE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 184 MILLION PASSWORDS AND LOGINS",
      "A spokesperson for LexisNexis confirmed that the hacker gained access to the company\u2019s GitHub account. This is a platform commonly used by developers to store and collaborate on code. Security guidelines repeatedly warn against storing sensitive information in such repositories; however, mistakes such as exposed access tokens and personal data files continue to occur.",
      "The stolen data varies from person to person but includes full names, birthdates, phone numbers, mailing and email addresses, Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers. LexisNexis has not confirmed whether it received any ransom demand or had further contact with the attacker.",

      "LexisNexis isn\u2019t a household name for most people, but it plays a major role in how personal data is harvested and used behind the scenes. The company pulls information from a wide range of sources, compiling detailed profiles that help other businesses assess risk and detect fraud. Its clients include banks, insurance companies and government agencies.",
      "In 2023, the New York Times reported that several car manufacturers had been sharing driving data with LexisNexis without notifying vehicle owners. That information was then sold to insurance companies, which used it to adjust premiums based on individual driving behavior. The story made one thing clear. LexisNexis has access to a staggering amount of personal detail, even from people who have never willingly engaged with the company.",
      "Law enforcement also uses LexisNexis tools to dig up information on suspects. These systems offer access to phone records, home addresses and other historical data. While such tools might assist in investigations, they also highlight a serious issue. When this much sensitive information is concentrated in one place, it becomes a single point of failure. And as the recent breach shows, that failure is no longer hypothetical.",

      "1. Remove your data from the internet:\u00a0The most effective way to take control of your data and avoid data brokers from selling it is to opt for data removal services. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "2. Review privacy settings: Take a few minutes to explore the privacy and security settings on the services you use. For example, limit who can see your social media posts, disable unnecessary location-sharing on your phone and consider turning off ad personalization on accounts like Google and Facebook.

      "With the unveiling of Otto Aviation\u2019s Phantom 3500, humans are heading toward a future of windowless jets.",
      "The aircraft is redefining air travel by eliminating traditional windows in favor of a sleek, aerodynamic design, something many engineers are surely happy about.",
      "It\u2019s a radical approach, but it\u2019s one that, on top of improving fuel efficiency and reducing drag, will still offer some of the best views using digital technology.",

      "Phantom 3500 (Otto Aviation)",
      "Why is windowless design such a big deal for aircraft?",
      "Most travelers don't realize that windows are structural weak points in an aircraft. They require extra reinforcement, add weight and disrupt the smooth flow of air over the fuselage (the main body of the plane). This increases drag, a resistance force that makes flight less efficient. By removing windows, the Phantom 3500's surface allows air to flow with minimal turbulence, helping the aircraft achieve what Otto Aviation describes as \"full laminar flow characteristics.\"",
      "HYPERSONIC JET PROMISES NYC TO LONDON IN UNDER AN HOUR",
      "This is a major contributor to its impressive aerodynamic performance. The windowless design is not just for aesthetics. Otto Aviation specifically engineered the fuselage to optimize laminar flow, using lightweight materials and smooth surfaces to further reduce drag and fuel consumption.",

      "How Phantom 3500 gives windowless passengers stunning digital views",
      "A common concern with windowless aircraft is claustrophobia. To address this, the Phantom 3500 features high-definition digital screens along the cabin walls and ceiling. These displays stream real-time video from cameras mounted on the aircraft's exterior, offering passengers a panoramic, immersive view of the skies. Otto Aviation refers to this system as Super Natural Vision, a proprietary technology that replaces traditional windows with state-of-the-art digital displays, seamlessly integrating real-time external views for a unique in-flight experience.",
      "The spacious, luminous cabin measures 800 cubic feet with a 6-foot-5-inch ceiling, comfortably accommodating four or more passengers in a luxurious, flexible layout. The cabin can seat up to nine passengers, depending on configuration, and is designed to maximize comfort and functionality. Freed from the constraints of window placement, the interior can be customized for relaxation, productivity or entertainment, ensuring passengers enjoy the journey as much as the destination.",

      "The Phantom 3500 builds on flight tests from Otto\u2019s Celera 500L prototype and Dassault Syst\u00e8mes\u2019 3DEXPERIENCE platform. By sustaining laminar flow, the aircraft aims to improve fuel efficiency by 35%. This allows it to maintain high-speed performance while consuming less fuel, making it one of the most aerodynamically efficient aircraft ever developed. It operates in the transonic range (Mach 0.8\u20131.2), balancing speed and efficiency. It can also reach a cruising altitude of 51,000 feet, significantly higher than most commercial airliners, which typically fly between 30,000 and 40,000 feet.",
      "Thanks to its streamlined fuselage and optimized aerodynamics, the Phantom 3500 burns 50% less fuel than conventional business jets. This reduction in fuel consumption translates to lower operating costs and a significant decrease in carbon emissions. The Phantom 3500\u2019s wings achieve complete laminar flow, allowing for smoother airflow and reduced drag, enabling the aircraft to take off from runways as short as 3,500 feet, nearly doubling the number of accessible airports in the U.S. alone compared to similar-sized jets.",

      "Of the nine countries that share a Baltic Sea coastline, only Russia is not a NATO member, and June's BALTOPS exercise aims to ensure those other countries can work together to defend the area, at a time when Moscow is turning up the heat.",
      "\"This year\u2019s BALTOPS is more than just an exercise,\" said U.S. Vice Admiral J.T. Anderson in a press release this week. \"It\u2019s a visible demonstration of our Alliance\u2019s resolve, adaptability and maritime strength.\"",
      "Over the last year there's been growing disquiet about Russia's malign influence in the Baltic Sea region, with several incidents of severed undersea cables. Suspicion has fallen on Russia's fleet of so-called \"ghost\" or \"shadow\" ships: hundreds of aging vessels, mostly oil tankers flying under foreign flags that are used to circumvent Western sanctions or trade in military hardware.",

      "There are also well-founded concerns that some of these ships are used for covert intelligence gathering, communication intercepts or to sabotage undersea infrastructure like internet cables or gas and electricity pipelines. Three crew members from a Cook Islands-registered vessel, believed to be part of Russia\u2019s ghost fleet, are currently facing charges in Finland over damage to an undersea cable that prosecutors say happened when the ship dragged its anchor for 60 miles along the floor of the Baltic Sea.",
      "\"There's a growing importance of the shadow fleet to Russia's wartime economy, and a growing awareness that NATO needs to stop it,\" Tony Lawrence, a naval expert and researcher at the International Centre for Defence and Security in Estonia, told Fox News Digital.",
      "But after a number of NATO navies adopted a tougher stance against the ghost ships through stop-and-search tactics, the Russians announced they would use their own navy to escort the fleet through the Baltic Sea.",
      "\"The Russian military presence in the region has always been visible, this is not a new feature. However, what is new is that Russia is protecting its shadow fleet tankers in the narrow pass of the Gulf of Finland,\" Finnish Defense Minister Antti H\u00e4kk\u00e4nen said in a recent television interview with Finland's YLE TV.",

      "NATO governments are keeping a close eye on the latest Baltic Sea developments and preparing for any possible increase in tensions. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen spoke at a meeting of NATO's Nordic and Baltic members this week, and described the Russian threat as real and serious. \"We see a more aggressive Russian approach in the Baltic Sea region,\" she told reporters.",
      "The Baltic Sea has relatively narrow waterways, where international maritime boundaries extend 12 miles from the coast, and Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) incorporate valuable fishing grounds or offshore wind farms. Add to this some of the busiest ferry routes in the world, commercial shipping traffic, military warships and civilian craft, and it raises the possibility that a more robust Russian naval posture in the area could increase the possibility of conflict.",
      "\"This is the risk of having more warships floating around the Baltic Sea, there is a potential for miscalculations that could escalate, and risk-reduction mechanisms that used to exist don't work any more because the [NATO and Russian] navies aren't talking to each other anymore,\" Lawrence told Fox News Digital.",

      "Does the Russian navy even have the capacity to escort every single ghost fleet ship in the Baltic? That seems unlikely, according to some.",
      "\"It's an escalation, of course, of Russian misbehavior in the Baltic Sea. But in practical terms I'm not sure it's going to make that much difference,\" Lawrence said.",
      "\"Russia's Baltic Sea fleet has always been the junior cousin of the Russian navy, and it's never been particularly well-equipped or enlarged, but it's still the biggest national navy operating in the Baltic, and they have ships that are attuned to the Baltic Sea, which is shallow, and its salinity is such that you need special kinds of sensors. And they know how to hide ships in the archipelagos of Sweden or Finland, so in that regard, they have a certain amount of specialist capability,\" Lawrence explained.",
      "The Baltic Sea war games this month \u2013 with the U.S. Navy's Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer USS Paul Ignatius and the Blue Ridge-class command and control ship USS Mount Whitney taking part \u2013 serve to remind the Russians of the power of NATO's combined naval assets in the region.",

      "And some of the smaller navies will be reassured by the presence of the American warships.",
      "A few weeks ago, Estonia's navy brought one suspected shadow fleet ship into its territorial waters for an inspection, and it complied. But when the Estonians tried the same tactic for a second time, the ship refused to stop and wouldn't come into port.",

      "\"That makes things more difficult for other nations because the shadow fleet is learning that it can just ignore what NATO navies do and there's little that NATO can do in that situation, especially if there are Russian ships escorting the shadow fleet,\" said Lawrence.",
      "\"But I don't think NATO nations are going to back down. They will still follow and challenge these shadow fleet ships, or even look at other legislation, like requiring proof of insurance, to stop them from transiting the Baltic Sea.\"",

      "Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Oren Marmorstein says Hamas is \"extremely afraid\" that the new humanitarian aid initiative could cause the terror group \"to lose its grip\" on the people of Gaza.",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a U.S. and Israeli-backed group, has been the subject of backlash since before it began distributing aid last month. Since the beginning of its operations there have been reports of violent incidents near distribution sites. Recently, the IDF admitted that troops shot \"suspects\" who failed to heed orders to back away from the soldiers.",
      "One of the most vocal critics of GHF has been the United Nations, with U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher urging the world to let his agency handle the situation. However, Israeli officials have pushed back on the U.N. narrative, saying that GHF is distributing aid without letting Hamas benefit.",

      "Marmorstein blamed Hamas for spreading \"fake news\" and \"fake information\" to take down the GHF.",
      "On Wednesday, the U.S. vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution that called for an immediate ceasefire, the return of all hostages and the lifting of all restrictions on humanitarian aid entering the Strip. Israel has repeatedly asserted that without limitations on aid entering Gaza, Hamas would be able to enrich itself and keep control over the area.",
      "In remarks ahead of the veto, U.S. Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires Dorothy Shea criticized the resolution, saying it failed to \"acknowledge the disastrous shortcomings of the prior method of aid delivery, which allowed Hamas to enrich itself at the expense of Palestinians, and failed to get food and water to those who needed it most.\"",

      "While Germany does spend more than 2% of its GDP on defense, Merz has backed the call to spend up to 5%, and he could use this to rally Trump to increase his support for Kyiv, and push for greater European involvement in future peace talks.",

      "Amid immigration raids, peaceful protests, attacks on law enforcement officers and the threat of his own arrest by federal agents, California Gov. Gavin Newsom is immersed in what could be the most consequential political fight of his career.",
      "The battle between the president and the governor of the nation\u2019s largest state instantly turned Newsom into the face of resistance to President Donald Trump\u2019s expansive interpretation of the authorities of his office and mass-deportation campaign. It comes at a time when Newsom, who is a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, has been taking heavy criticism from within his own party over his efforts \u2014 in part through his new podcast \u2014 to cast himself in the role of conciliator.",
      "\u201cFor someone like Newsom, the balance is: Is he able to be tough enough? Will he stand up to Trump? How does he lead at this moment?\u201d said Democratic strategist Karen Finney. \u201cThis is unprecedented. There\u2019s not a right answer. So far, he\u2019s doing the right things, being clear, consistent, clear communication.\u201d",
      "Newsom could try to turn the situation on Trump by pointing to government overreach, but at the same time, there is real risk of an eruption violence from rogue actors, said Matt Bennett, co-founder of Third Way, a center-left think tank.",
      "\u201cThe images of the militarization of this for no reason should be enough for Newsom to win this debate as long as they can keep control of the worst of the violence,\" he said.",
      "\u201cTrump always goes too far,\u201d Bennett added. \u201cLast time, he went too far with the Muslim ban. Then he really went too far with child separation \u2014 those images really hurt Trump. Here, it\u2019s a real question. It\u2019s a much closer call this time. We just don\u2019t know yet.\u201d",
      "As it is, Newsom must balance forces that are both inside and outside of his control. That includes competing with messaging from Trump (who frequently refers to the governor as \"Newscum\") and the president's top lieutenants, who are ever-present on cable news, social media and political podcasts. And it involves attempting to quell violent actors while pointing to Trump's actions \u2014 which have included deploying the U.S. Marines \u2014 as an overreach.",
      "For its part, the White House maintains it is winning the public relations battle, with officials tapping a refrain this week that it was the fight they wanted replete with made-for-TV images. That included images of billowing black smoke and Waymo vehicles that protesters had set on fire.",
      "On Monday, California filed suit against Trump for using emergency powers to deploy National Guard troops to the Los Angeles area over the weekend. Trump, citing a statute that allows the president to activate the guard to repel a foreign invasion or quell a rebellion, accused Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass of failing to protect federal agents and property from demonstrators.",
      "Newsom has slammed the step as escalatory, and said existing law enforcement could have handled any violence or destruction. He argued that the move was \u201cpurposefully inflammatory and will only escalate tensions\u201d and that there was \u201ccurrently no unmet need.\u201d",
      "Newsom has also been mounting his own messaging offensive, including on X, where he posted what appeared to be photos of troops crowded on a floor, apparently attempting to rest.",
      "\"You sent your troops here without fuel, food, water or a place to sleep. Here they are \u2014 being forced to sleep on the floor, piled on top of one another. If anyone is treating our troops disrespectfully, it is you @realDonaldTrump,\" Newsom said on X.",
      "On Sunday, Newsom chided Trump border czar Tom Homan, saying in an MSNBC interview: \"Tom, arrest me. Let\u2019s go.\"",
      "Late Monday, Newsom sat for a \"Pod Save America\" podcast recording in which he cast Trump's actions as unconstitutional and noted some of those assigned to Los Angeles \u2014 in his view, unnecessarily \u2014 were pried away from fentanyl investigations, and potentially from border operations, for \"this theatrical display of toughness by a president of the United States who is unhinged.\"",
      "By Tuesday morning, Newsom accused Trump and his top White House deportation architect Stephen Miller of sheltering insurrectionists.",
      "\"The only people defending insurrectionists are you and @realDonaldTrump. Or, are we pretending like you didn\u2019t pardon 1500 of them?\"",
      "On Tuesday afternoon, the two were locked in another public squabble after Trump told reporters he delivered some tough words to Newsom in a phone call Monday. Newsom said the two hadn't spoken since Friday, then posted an interview with NBC News from over the weekend in which Newsom contended he and Trump had a pleasant conversation and that the president barely talked about the issue at hand.",
      "The White House had a different take.",
      "\u201cThe President called Gavin Newsom to tell him to get his ass in gear,\" White House spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement. \"The only liar here is Newsom who continues to fail his state as he prioritizes doing interviews with leftist media to gaslight the public instead of helping his state.\u201d",
      "At that, Newsom responded on X: \"Donald Trump is a stone cold liar.\"",
      "Since November's presidential election, Newsom seemed content to lay low and get a better measure of Trump's political appeal as he contemplated a run for the Oval Office. He's also taken some heat from his own party for hosting MAGA figures on his podcast and saying he opposes allowing trans athletes on girls' teams in college and youth sports.",
      "Trump's move on the protests, however, has forced Newsom to pick sides on an issue that the president and White House officials believe they have the political edge.",
      "Now, Democratic leaders say their party is galvanizing behind Newsom \u2014 at least for the moment \u2014 and it would be difficult for prospective rivals to do anything but fall in line behind him when he is taking a stand on turf that is popular with Democratic voters.",
      "Friends of Newsom say it would be an unexpected political boon for the governor if Trump and Homan follow through on their threat to arrest him if they decide he has broken the law.",
      "That would be \"a Nelson Mandela moment\" for Newsom, said one longtime ally, referring to the imprisonment of the anti-apartheid leader and recalling that indictments helped Trump win the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.",
      "At the same time, that ally and others are careful to depict the governor as focused on the substance of the battle with Trump, rather than the political risks or rewards.",
      "\"He's not going to stand by idly while President Trump aims to destroy California,\" said California state Rep. Buffy Wicks, a Democrat who often aligns with Newsom. \"I do not think it's a political calculation. It's genuinely how he feels, and he's leading with his heart on it.\"",
      "Another observer had a different take: \u201cThis whole fiasco could make Gavin president,\u201d Anthony Scaramucci, the short-lived White House communications director in Trump\u2019s first term, wrote on X Monday.",
      "The obvious pitfall for Newsom is that Trump could take credit for restoring order or, if violence escalates, continue to pour blame on him. Democrats in the state say that they believe Trump is intentionally sowing discord and that Newsom's best political move is to do his job well.",
      "\"The most important thing he can do is show he can manage a crisis,\" said Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. \"Good governance is always the best politics \u2014 to just show competence contrasting with Trump\u2019s chaos.\"",
      "Trump has deployed 700 Marines to Los Angeles to support the roughly 300 National Guard members already on the ground. The president had already ordered the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops. It remains to be seen how the courts will come down on California's lawsuit.",
      "The relevant law allows the president to activate the National Guard domestically in order to quell a foreign invasion or a rebellion against the U.S. government, and Trump, calling protesters \"insurrectionists,\" declared the demonstrations a \"rebellion.\"",
      "The California attorney general argues in the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Northern California, that Trump has illegally usurped the authority of the state by fabricating a rebellion and that the presence of guard forces\u00a0is exacerbating tension between protesters and law enforcement officers.",
      "The powers to deploy the National Guard are divided between presidents and governors, with state executives generally controlling when they are activated within their own state \u2014 as opposed to being deployed to foreign wars.",
      "Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, said in an interview with NBC News that governors routinely work with the White House, regardless of party, to mobilize National Guard forces for a variety of tasks, including the response to natural disasters. At times, governors have asked presidents to deploy guard forces to restore order in their states during riots. But not since the Civil Rights era has a president called up the National guard to enforce the law over the objection of the state's governor.",
      "Democrats say that it's up to state and local law enforcement to keep the peace and that there was no need for Trump to federalize troops \u2014 especially without the consent of the governor.",
      "\"Gavin's mad as hell and he should be,\" McAuliffe said. \"This is the governor's responsibility, not the president's.\"",
      "Bennett flagged concerns about introducing the U.S. Marines into the situation, saying they are not trained in controlling crowds of Americans.",
      "\u201cThis is a very, very dangerous thing,\" Bennett said. \"God forbid, if they hurt somebody \u2026 that\u2019s real trouble for Trump. But [we\u2019re] not rooting for that.\u201d"

    "summary": "The Trump administration is planning to end a DHS terrorism prevention program that former officials and experts say has helped thwart attacks in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration plans to eliminate a Department of Homeland Security terrorism prevention program that former government officials and experts say has helped thwart attacks in the United States. The DHS budget submitted to Congress last month cancels the $18 million terrorism prevention grant program, saying it \u201cdoes not align with DHS priorities.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat line should be quoted after every future mass casualty event in this country,\u201d said a current senior DHS official who declined to be named, citing fear of being fired.",
      "Former DHS officials say they believe the modest program, which costs about 4% of the military's marching band budget, has stopped violent attacks. It is designed to prevent a type of terrorism that has become increasingly common: lone-wolf attacks by individuals who are not members of an organized group.",
      "Examples include the recent firebomb attack in Boulder, Colorado, on demonstrators marching in support of Israeli hostages; the murder of a young couple outside the Capitol Jewish Museum; the killing of 14 people in a New Year\u2019s attack in New Orleans; and the shooting of a United Health Care executive in Manhattan.",
      "\u201cWhen people say, \u2018You can\u2019t prove prevention doesn\u2019t work,\u2019 I ask them, \u2018Do you go to the doctor? Do you have a smoke detector in your home?\u2019 Then you believe in prevention,\u201d said Bill Braniff, a Biden administration appointee who oversaw the program as the director of DHS\u2019s Center for Prevention Partnerships and Programs.",
      "John Cohen, a former senior DHS counterterrorism official in the Obama and Biden administrations, said the threat is growing. \u201cWhy was DHS created? To help the nation be better prepared to stop terrorist attacks following Sept. 11,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have had since January a number of school shootings and four terrorist incidents \u2014 all by people who fit those behavioral profiles.\u201d",
      "The White House and DHS did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The program, formally known as the Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention Grant Program, recently drew scrutiny when ProPublica published an article about Braniff\u2019s successor, a 22-year-old former Trump campaign worker with no relevant experience.",
      "But the larger issue, experts say, is that the program is being zeroed out. They call that a short-sighted decision in an era when alienated loners are attempting mass violence attacks at a greater frequency than ever.",
      "\u201cDo I know for certain that we helped to avert school shootings and mass casualty attacks? I am 99% sure that we helped to avert a number of them,\u201d said Braniff, who now heads the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab at American University.",
      "Interest in and demand for the program is high and spans the country. In 2024, DHS reported receiving 178 eligible applications from 47 U.S. states and territories requesting $98.9 million for $18 million in available grants. The money funds state and local programs designed to help identify people who are radicalizing and potentially violent. They included school-based threat assessment teams, mental health teams and programs designed to inoculate children against extremist messages on social media.",
      "Specific examples are difficult to cite, in part because many cases are confidential, and in part because it\u2019s difficult to draw a straight line between a government program and a thwarted attack. But DHS documents cite a 2022 case as an example of how they believe the program helped stop a school shooting.",
      "After an outreach campaign at Palm Beach State College in Florida urging students to be vigilant about online threats of violence, a student anonymously reported to authorities about online posts threatening a mass shooting. Among the posts, according to court records, were threats to commit a \u201cmassacre,\u201d and an inquiry, \u201cwho\u2019s selling an AR-15?\u201d",
      "Authorities arrested and charged a young man, who ultimately was sentenced to probation and also was the subject of a risk protection order, records show.",
      "\u201cThis is not the time to be ending that office,\u201d said Cohen, the former senior DHS counterterrorism official. \u201cThis is the time to be expanding activities that are designed to detect emerging threats.\""

Kennedy Jr., has shown himself to be a domestic health threat,\u201d said Dr. Anna Yousaf, an infectious disease researcher at the CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.",
      "\u201cThese attacks against scientific standards and well-established processes culminated yesterday when Secretary Kennedy announced that he is firing all of the members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP,\u201d Yousaf continued, eliciting \u201cboos\u201d from the crowd.",
      "Kennedy announced Monday that he was removing all 17 members of the independent vaccine advisory panel. Months earlier, he oversaw a massive restructuring of federal health departments that included laying off 2,400 CDC employees and dismantling many agency programs.",
      "Many CDC staff members had looked forward to Tuesday\u2019s all-hands meeting as a place to air their concerns, but on Monday morning, Matthew Buzzelli, the CDC\u2019s chief of staff and most senior acting leader, sent an email to senior CDC officials canceling the agencywide meeting.",
      "While Buzzelli explained that the meeting was being rescheduled to review several in-process leadership updates, some CDC employees saw the move as another way to evade transparency. In a call to action distributed among current, fired and retired CDC employees, a group calling itself the Save CDC Campaign wrote that Buzzelli had \u201cavoided our questions, dismissed our concerns, and ignored the collective grief we share for the agency, colleagues, and programs we have lost.\u201d",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon declined to comment on the protest and the employees\u2019 concerns.",
      "A sense of rudderlessness inside the CDC has deepened in recent months, staff members said. The agency has been without a director since President Donald Trump returned to office.",
      "\u201cWe need to know who is in charge of the CDC. We need to know who is making decisions,\u201d said Kathleen Ethier, who directed the CDC\u2019s Division of Adolescent and School Health until January.",
      "CDC Director Mandy Cohen, a medical doctor, stepped down on Jan. 20 when Trump was inaugurated, as is customary. Shortly afterward, Susan Monarez, a microbiologist without a medical degree, was named acting director, awaiting the confirmation of Trump\u2019s pick to lead the agency, Dr. Dave Weldon, a former congressman. Then, in March, Trump abruptly withdrew Weldon\u2019s nomination, which Weldon attributed to renewed scrutiny of his past ties to anti-vaccine activists and discredited researchers.",
      "By the end of that month, when Trump announced Monarez as his new nominee for director, roughly a third of the CDC\u2019s senior managers had left their posts. Since then, Monarez has been absent from day-to-day operations, because of rules in the Vacancies Act that bar nominees from serving as acting directors of the agencies they\u2019ve been tapped to lead.",
      "It\u2019s unclear when Monarez\u2019s confirmation might proceed. Her nomination hearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, chaired by Bill Cassidy R-La., hasn\u2019t been scheduled \u2014 reportedly because she has yet to submit the required paperwork.",
      "In her absence, Kennedy handed operational control to Buzzelli, a former federal prosecutor with no public health background. A Democratic lawmaker wrote that Buzzelli was \u201cboth unqualified and legally ineligible to act as Acting Director of the CDC in any capacity.\u201d",
      "A current CDC official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity without authorization to speak to the media, said the absence of a director leaves the agency without an important check and balance.",
      "\u201cThe perception is that there is no buffer at CDC to protect it from what RFK Jr. wants to do,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe center directors are trying to fill the void but are in the dark. It does not feel like there is any venue to express opinions about the agency. So the only outlet is protest.\u201d",
      "Nixon, the HHS spokesperson, defended Buzzelli\u2019s role in a text message. \u201cThe CDC Chief of Staff has been carrying out some of the duties of the CDC Director as the Senior Official, as necessary, and is surrounded by highly qualified medical professionals and advisors to help fulfill these duties as appropriate,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Nixon said in April that Buzzelli would review vaccine recommendations made by ACIP, the group of independent advisers whom Kennedy fired Monday. But after ACIP\u2019s April meeting, weeks passed and no recommendations were approved.",
      "In May, Kennedy stepped in and signed off on three recommendations for Chikungunya vaccines for travelers and lab workers. But based on the CDC website, Kennedy has yet to approve two other ACIP recommendations \u2014 one for a meningococcal vaccine for certain teens and another for an RSV vaccine for high-risk adults in their 50s.",
      "ACIP is composed of pediatricians, geriatricians and other vaccine experts who volunteer to meet three times a year to analyze the latest data on safety and efficacy of vaccines, including newly approved inoculations and new data about existing vaccines. The group offers recommendations to the CDC about vaccine approvals, and while the CDC isn\u2019t required to follow the advice, it often does. The CDC\u2019s decisions about vaccines play an important role in which shots are required to enter public school and are made available to children for free.",
      "Kennedy, in firing the existing members, claimed they were plagued by conflicts of interest due to having received funding from pharmaceutical companies. ACIP members go through a rigorous vetting process before they are appointed and are required to disclose conflicts and recuse themselves from voting on those vaccines.",
      "The next ACIP meeting is scheduled for June 25-27. Kennedy said on X Tuesday evening that he would appoint new members in \"the coming days\" and that they would \"highly credentialed physicians and scientists\" and not \"ideological anti-vaxxers.\" Kennedy has faced criticism for his anti-vaccine activism, which includes founding the country's largest anti-vaccine nonprofit.",
      "Former acting CDC Director Richard Besser, who is also the president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a health-focused nonprofit organization, said he hopes the meeting won\u2019t happen as planned.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see getting 17 members to be vetted appropriately in that short a period of time,\u201d Besser said."

      "The House passed two of the bills Tuesday. One would bar noncitizens from voting in local elections in the nation's capital, overturning a Washington law that was passed in 2022. It passed 266-148, with 56 Democrats joining Republicans in support.",
      "The other bill would restore collective bargaining rights and a statute of limitations for Washington police officers involved in disciplinary cases. It passed 235-178, with 30 Democrats voting for it and four Republicans voting against it.",
      "Then, on Thursday, the House is expected to pass a third bill, the District of Columbia Federal Immigration Compliance Act, which would require the Washington government to comply with requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security to share information and detain undocumented immigrants. Under current Washington law, local authorities do not work with federal immigration officials unless they have judicial warrants.",
      "Altogether, the bills represent House Republicans\u2019 attempt to assert authority over deep-blue Washington at a time when the GOP has unified control of the federal government.",
      "\u201cHome rule\u201d \u2014 in which the Washington mayor and city council make their own laws but Congress has the ability to review them \u2014 has long been a point of contention. Democrats have pushed in recent years to grant full statehood to Washington, while Republicans have slammed decisions made by local leaders and sought to reverse them.",
      "\u201cD.C.\u2019s City Council made radical decisions in our nation\u2019s capital under the Biden-Harris administration, passing local laws that are woefully inconsistent with national standards or constitutional principles,\u201d Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, the chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee who authored the GOP voting bill, told NBC News in a statement.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m proud that the House is taking action to overturn several of these reckless measures \u2014 including my legislation to prohibit noncitizens from voting in local D.C. elections,\u201d he said.",
      "At the same time, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Republican leaders have been dragging their feet on a legislative fix for Washington's budget. A government funding bill that Congress passed in March to avert a shutdown included a provision requiring the city to revert to fiscal year 2024 funding levels, leaving it with a $1.1 billion shortfall.",
      "The move was quickly met with opposition from local leaders. The Senate voted by unanimous consent in March to undo it and restore Washington's authority to use local tax dollars as its leaders see fit. President Donald Trump endorsed the fix, calling on the House to \u201cimmediately\u201d pass the bill on social media on March 28.",
      "But months later, Johnson still hasn\u2019t held a vote on the bill, prompting criticism from Democrats and Mayor Muriel Bowser.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absurd that the House hasn\u2019t taken it up. It\u2019s absolutely irresponsible, unfair and beneath the credibility of leadership,\u201d said Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., who represents a congressional district just outside Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s not our money, it\u2019s D.C.\u2019s money ... and I don\u2019t know why the speaker hasn\u2019t put the Senate bill on the floor. It\u2019ll pass overwhelmingly.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a particular egregious example of substituting their judgment for those who are locally elected to govern the District of Columbia,\u201d Hoyer said.",
      "Last month, Johnson told reporters that he was in communication with Bowser and that the House would take up the funding fix \u201cas quickly as possible.\u201d He said passing Trump\u2019s massive domestic policy package had taken up \u201call of our energy\u201d and insisted the delay was not for a \u201cpolitical purpose.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re working on it right now. It\u2019s not like we\u2019ve closed the door to that,\u201d House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., told NBC News on Tuesday. \u201cBut obviously there are other problems we\u2019re trying to resolve along the way.\u201d",
      "Bowser\u2019s office denounced the GOP bills to revoke Washington law and \u2014 while noting that Washington has mitigated the most \u201ccatastrophic\u201d impacts of the budget restrictions \u2014 urged Congress to pass the funding fix.",
      "\u201cMayor Bowser continues to oppose all congressional interference in the lives and affairs of Washingtonians. DC will continue to fight to protect our home rule and self-determination,\u201d a Bowser spokesperson said in an email. \u201cIf Congress wants to be helpful, they should pass the District of Columbia Local Funds Act to fix their damage to DC\u2019s FY25 budget.\u201d",
      "Johnson\u2019s office had no comment when it was asked Tuesday when \u2014 or whether \u2014 he still plans to hold a vote on the funding fix.",
      "Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Mich., who is No. 4 in Republican leadership, said, \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know; I haven\u2019t heard yes or no,\u201d when she was asked whether the funding fix will come up for a vote.",
      "Other congressional Democrats said Republicans should stay out of Washington issues.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s bad enough, usually, when they\u2019re playing in D.C. local, home rule issues,\u201d said Rep. Glenn Ivey, D-Md., whose district abuts Washington. \u201cBut then to do it at a time when they haven\u2019t returned the $1.1 billion is especially egregious.\u201d",
      "Immigration has dominated the national political debate this week, with protests erupting in Los Angeles in response to the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation efforts. Republicans said the fight over immigration is a winning issue for the party, and they have continued to lean into it with the legislation on the floor this week.",

      "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.",
      "In today\u2019s edition, we explore how California Gov. Gavin Newsom is navigating a high-profile political fight with President Donald Trump. Plus, Steve Kornacki previews New Jersey\u2019s primary for governor before the results roll in tonight.",

      "Send your questions to politicsnewsletter@nbcuni.com and we may answer them in a future edition of the newsletter.",
      "Newsom locks horns with Trump in a politically defining moment",
      "Amid immigration raids, peaceful protests, attacks on law enforcement officers and the threat of his own arrest by federal agents, California Gov. Gavin Newsom is immersed in what could be the most consequential political fight of his career.",
      "The battle has instantly turned Newsom, the governor of the nation\u2019s largest state, into the face of resistance to President Donald Trump\u2019s expansive interpretation of the authorities of his office and mass-deportation campaign. It comes at a time when Newsom, who is a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, has been taking heavy criticism from within his own party over his efforts \u2014 in part through his new podcast \u2014 to cast himself in the role of conciliator.",
      "As it is, Newsom must balance forces that are both inside and outside of his control. That includes competing with messaging from Trump (who frequently refers to the governor as \u201cNewscum\u201d) and the president\u2019s top lieutenants, who are ever-present on cable news, social media and political podcasts. And it involves attempting to quell violent actors while pointing to Trump\u2019s actions \u2014 which have included deploying the U.S. Marines \u2014 as an overreach.",
      "For its part, the White House maintains it is winning the public relations battle, with officials tapping a refrain this week that it was the fight they wanted replete with made-for-TV images.",
      "But Newsom has been mounting his own messaging offensive on X and through media interviews. And Democratic leaders say their party is galvanizing behind him \u2014 at least for the moment \u2014 and it would be difficult for prospective rivals to do anything but fall in line behind him when he is taking a stand on turf that is popular with Democratic voters.",
      "Friends of Newsom say it would be an unexpected political boon for the governor if Trump and his border czar, Tom Homan, follow through on their threat to arrest him if they decide he has broken the law.",
      "Read more from Jon and Natasha \u2192",
      "Newsom vs. Johnson: Speaker Mike Johnson R-La., stopped short of saying Newsom should be arrested, but added that \u201che ought to be tarred and feathered.\u201d",
      "Newsom called it \u201ca fitting threat given the @GOP want[s] to bring our country back to the 18th Century.\u201d",
      "How Republicans are responding: GOP lawmakers like Johnson largely stood by Trump\u2019s handling of the situation in Los Angeles. But Republican Rep. David Valadao \u2014 who represents a battleground district in California \u2014 said he was \u201cconcerned about ongoing ICE operations\u201d in the state, urging the administration \u201cto prioritize the removal of known criminals.\u201d",
      "How Democrats are responding: While Democrats have largely been in unison with their criticism of Trump, there have been two notable exceptions.",
      "Congressional Black Caucus Chair Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., went further than her colleagues in saying Trump\u2019s actions rise to the level of impeachable offenses. On the other side, Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., referred to the situation in Los Angeles as \u201canarchy and true chaos.\u201d\u201cMy party loses the moral high ground when we refuse to condemn setting cars on fire, destroying buildings, and assaulting law enforcement,\u201d Fetterman said.",

      "The geographic dividing lines shaping New Jersey\u2019s primary",
      "Rep. Mikie Sherrill heads into today\u2019s primary as the favorite to win the Democratic nomination for governor of New Jersey. She has blanketed the pricey New York and Philadelphia metro airwaves with television ads, she enjoys the backing of much of the party\u2019s establishment, and she had opened double-digit leads in two polls that were released several weeks ago.",
      "There is uncertainty, though. Credible public polling has, overall, been limited and infrequent. And court-imposed changes to the layout of the primary ballot could dramatically dilute the power of the endorsements Sherrill has received from key county Democratic organizations.",
      "Sherrill\u2019s opponents have each made inroads. But, at least so far, that seems to have had the effect of keeping them in one another\u2019s way, preventing one from emerging as the clear alternative to Sherrill. Consider the state\u2019s political geography.",
      "You can draw a line south of Mercer and Monmouth counties, roughly where Route 195 would be on a map. Below that is South Jersey. Democratic politics here are dominated by an old-fashioned political machine that is backing the lone South Jersey candidate in the field: former state Sen. Steve Sweeney.",
      "The trouble for Sweeney is that only about 30% of all primary votes will come from this region. And because South Jersey is part of the Philadelphia media market, he\u2019s not well-known in the rest of the state, which is served heavily by the New York market.",
      "Then there\u2019s vote-rich North Jersey, where the other candidates can all claim some advantage. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka is likely to win his city \u2014 the state\u2019s largest \u2014 overwhelmingly. Newark is also the seat of Essex County, which has more registered Democrats than any other county. More than 40% of Essex\u2019s population is Black, which should further boost Baraka, the most prominent Black candidate in the race (Sean Spiller, who is president of the state teacher\u2019s union, is also Black). Nearby Union County, which has the second-highest share of Black residents, could offer another trove of votes.",
      "Baraka has also made a wider play for the party\u2019s progressive base. He has run hard to the left, and he burnished his anti-Trump credentials when he was arrested at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility last month. Coupled with deep Black support, that could be the makings of a potent coalition in a statewide primary.",
      "But Baraka has encountered traffic in the progressive lane thanks to the presence of Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, who is also embracing left-wing themes and has framed his candidacy as a war on the Democratic establishment.",
      "Another candidate, Rep. Josh Gottheimer, has pitched his message more toward the middle, promising tax cuts and emphasizing cost-of-living issues. Gottheimer won his House seat by flipping what had been a reliably Republican district, and he has amassed an enviable campaign bankroll. He figures to perform strongly in suburban Bergen County, his political base, and he has been endorsed by Bergen\u2019s official Democratic organization. But his only other party endorsement comes from tiny rural Warren County in the northwest corner of the state.",

    "story": [
      "The Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 proposed budget for 2026 eliminates specialized suicide hotline services for LGBTQ youth and young adults.",
      "The budget proposal, which the department published Friday, designates $520 million for 988, the suicide prevention line, and behavioral health crisis services, which is the same amount the Biden administration provided for 988. However, the 2026 budget proposal would end government funding for LGBTQ-specific counseling to 988 callers upon request.",
      "When asked for comment, a spokesperson for HHS directed NBC News to the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget.",
      "Rachel Cauley, a spokesperson for OMB, noted that the proposed budget would provide the same amount for 988 services as was provided in previous years.",
      "\u201cIt does not, however, grant taxpayer money to a chat service where children are encouraged to embrace radical gender ideology by \u2018counselors\u2019 without consent or knowledge of their parents,\u201d Cauley said.",
      "\u201cRadical gender ideology\u201d is a political term adopted by conservatives and President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to describe the existence of transgender people and the trans rights movement, which it considers harmful to children.",
      "The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline has existed since 2005, and, in 2020, during his first term, Trump signed legislation designating 988 as the new lifeline number by 2022. That legislation required 988 to provide LGBTQ youth and young adults who call the line with access to \u201cspecially trained staff and partner organizations,\u201d noting that queer and trans youth \u201care more than 4 times more likely to contemplate suicide than their peers, with 1 in 5 LGBTQ youth and more than 1 in 3 transgender youth reporting attempting suicide.\u201d",
      "A senior administration official said the money for services for LGBTQ young people has not been cut, but rather reallocated to the general 988 services so that it doesn\u2019t go to \u201cradical grooming contractors,\u201d using another term adopted by conservatives decades ago to falsely equate being LGBTQ or promoting LGBTQ inclusivity with sexually abusing children. The contractors who provide LGBTQ-specific services through 988 are mental health organizations based across the U.S. Most of them provide mental health care to the general population in addition to LGBTQ people.",
      "The official said only the contract with \u201cradical gender\u201d counselors is being terminated, and not the resources. However, under the proposed budget, when LGBTQ youth and young adults under age 25 call 988, there will not be an option for them to be connected to a counselor who is trained to provide support to LGBTQ youth. Currently, LGBTQ young people can also text \u201cPRIDE\u201d to 988 to reach a counselor with such training.",
      "The official did not respond to additional questions regarding what organization(s) \u201cradical grooming contractors\u201d was referring to specifically.",
      "The Trevor Project, a national suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for LGBTQ youths, is among the contractors that make up a subnetwork of specialists who provide 988 services to LGBTQ young people.",
      "\u201cAttempts to discredit these life-saving services will not change the reality of what this administration is proposing: the elimination of a national suicide prevention program, run by seven leading crisis contact centers, that has supported over 1.3 million LGBTQ+ youth across the U.S. with best-practice crisis care,\u201d Jaymes Black, the project\u2019s CEO, said in a statement to NBC News, referring to the number of contacts who have reached out to 988 for LGBTQ-specific support since the program\u2019s start in 2022.",
      "\u201cLawmakers on both sides of the aisle \u2014 and our President \u2014 came together during the first Trump administration to create this specialized resource,\u201d Black added. \u201cIt\u2019s a shared acknowledgement that every young life is worth saving, and that risk, not identity, drives evidence-based and effective crisis intervention. We strongly urge the administration and Congress to rethink this proposal, and do what is best for ending the public health crisis of suicide among our nation\u2019s youth.\"",
      "The other six contractors who provide 988 services to LGBTQ young people are Centerstone, Volunteers of America Western Washington State, Solari Crisis & Human Services, CommUnity Crisis Services, HopeLink Behavioral Health and La Frontera EMPACT. Centerstone did not answer NBC News\u2019 question about the proposed elimination to 988\u2019s LGBTQ-specific service, and the other organizations did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "In April, The Washington Post reported a leaked HHS budget draft that proposed cutting funding for 988 services for LGBTQ youth. At the time, the White House wouldn\u2019t confirm the veracity of that draft or the information about the funding.",
      "The budget proposal is the latest effort from the Trump administration to rollback services and protections for LGBTQ people, specifically transgender people. In the first few weeks of his second administration, Trump issued several executive orders targeting trans people, including declaring that there are only two unchangeable sexes; prohibiting trans people from enlisting and serving in the military; barring trans girls and women from competing on female sports teams in federally-funded K-12 schools and colleges; and barring federal funding from going to hospitals that provide transition-related care to minors.",
      "Federal officials have also scrubbed agency websites of any mention of transgender or intersex people, including from the website for the Stonewall National Monument commemorating the site of the 1969 Stonewall Uprising, in which historians say trans people were crucial and became a turning point in the modern gay rights movement. At the start of June, which is LGBTQ Pride month, the Navy confirmed to NBC News that it would rename the USNS Harvey Milk, a fleet replenishment oiler named for the LGBTQ rights activist, Navy veteran and first openly gay man elected to public office in California."

    "story": [
      "Amid immigration raids, peaceful protests, attacks on law enforcement officers and the threat of his own arrest by federal agents, California Gov. Gavin Newsom is immersed in what could be the most consequential political fight of his career.",
      "The battle between the president and the governor of the nation\u2019s largest state instantly turned Newsom into the face of resistance to President Donald Trump\u2019s expansive interpretation of the authorities of his office and mass-deportation campaign. It comes at a time when Newsom, who is a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate, has been taking heavy criticism from within his own party over his efforts \u2014 in part through his new podcast \u2014 to cast himself in the role of conciliator.",
      "\u201cFor someone like Newsom, the balance is: Is he able to be tough enough? Will he stand up to Trump? How does he lead at this moment?\u201d said Democratic strategist Karen Finney. \u201cThis is unprecedented. There\u2019s not a right answer. So far, he\u2019s doing the right things, being clear, consistent, clear communication.\u201d",
      "Newsom could try to turn the situation on Trump by pointing to government overreach, but at the same time, there is real risk of an eruption violence from rogue actors, said Matt Bennett, co-founder of Third Way, a center-left think tank.",
      "\u201cThe images of the militarization of this for no reason should be enough for Newsom to win this debate as long as they can keep control of the worst of the violence,\" he said.",
      "\u201cTrump always goes too far,\u201d Bennett added. \u201cLast time, he went too far with the Muslim ban. Then he really went too far with child separation \u2014 those images really hurt Trump. Here, it\u2019s a real question. It\u2019s a much closer call this time. We just don\u2019t know yet.\u201d",
      "As it is, Newsom must balance forces that are both inside and outside of his control. That includes competing with messaging from Trump (who frequently refers to the governor as \"Newscum\") and the president's top lieutenants, who are ever-present on cable news, social media and political podcasts. And it involves attempting to quell violent actors while pointing to Trump's actions \u2014 which have included deploying the U.S. Marines \u2014 as an overreach.",
      "For its part, the White House maintains it is winning the public relations battle, with officials tapping a refrain this week that it was the fight they wanted replete with made-for-TV images. That included images of billowing black smoke and Waymo vehicles that protesters had set on fire.",
      "On Monday, California filed suit against Trump for using emergency powers to deploy National Guard troops to the Los Angeles area over the weekend. Trump, citing a statute that allows the president to activate the guard to repel a foreign invasion or quell a rebellion, accused Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass of failing to protect federal agents and property from demonstrators.",
      "Newsom has slammed the step as escalatory, and said existing law enforcement could have handled any violence or destruction. He argued that the move was \u201cpurposefully inflammatory and will only escalate tensions\u201d and that there was \u201ccurrently no unmet need.\u201d",
      "Newsom has also been mounting his own messaging offensive, including on X, where he posted what appeared to be photos of troops crowded on a floor, apparently attempting to rest.",
      "\"You sent your troops here without fuel, food, water or a place to sleep. Here they are \u2014 being forced to sleep on the floor, piled on top of one another. If anyone is treating our troops disrespectfully, it is you @realDonaldTrump,\" Newsom said on X.",
      "On Sunday, Newsom chided Trump border czar Tom Homan, saying in an MSNBC interview: \"Tom, arrest me. Let\u2019s go.\"",
      "Late Monday, Newsom sat for a \"Pod Save America\" podcast recording in which he cast Trump's actions as unconstitutional and noted some of those assigned to Los Angeles \u2014 in his view, unnecessarily \u2014 were pried away from fentanyl investigations, and potentially from border operations, for \"this theatrical display of toughness by a president of the United States who is unhinged.\"",
      "By Tuesday morning, Newsom accused Trump and his top White House deportation architect Stephen Miller of sheltering insurrectionists.",
      "\"The only people defending insurrectionists are you and @realDonaldTrump. Or, are we pretending like you didn\u2019t pardon 1500 of them?\"",
      "On Tuesday afternoon, the two were locked in another public squabble after Trump told reporters he delivered some tough words to Newsom in a phone call Monday. Newsom said the two hadn't spoken since Friday, then posted an interview with NBC News from over the weekend in which Newsom contended he and Trump had a pleasant conversation and that the president barely talked about the issue at hand.",
      "The White House had a different take.",
      "\u201cThe President called Gavin Newsom to tell him to get his ass in gear,\" White House spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement. \"The only liar here is Newsom who continues to fail his state as he prioritizes doing interviews with leftist media to gaslight the public instead of helping his state.\u201d",
      "At that, Newsom responded on X: \"Donald Trump is a stone cold liar.\"",
      "Since November's presidential election, Newsom seemed content to lay low and get a better measure of Trump's political appeal as he contemplated a run for the Oval Office. He's also taken some heat from his own party for hosting MAGA figures on his podcast and saying he opposes allowing trans athletes on girls' teams in college and youth sports.",
      "Trump's move on the protests, however, has forced Newsom to pick sides on an issue that the president and White House officials believe they have the political edge.",
      "Now, Democratic leaders say their party is galvanizing behind Newsom \u2014 at least for the moment \u2014 and it would be difficult for prospective rivals to do anything but fall in line behind him when he is taking a stand on turf that is popular with Democratic voters.",
      "Friends of Newsom say it would be an unexpected political boon for the governor if Trump and Homan follow through on their threat to arrest him if they decide he has broken the law.",
      "That would be \"a Nelson Mandela moment\" for Newsom, said one longtime ally, referring to the imprisonment of the anti-apartheid leader and recalling that indictments helped Trump win the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.",
      "At the same time, that ally and others are careful to depict the governor as focused on the substance of the battle with Trump, rather than the political risks or rewards.",
      "\"He's not going to stand by idly while President Trump aims to destroy California,\" said California state Rep. Buffy Wicks, a Democrat who often aligns with Newsom. \"I do not think it's a political calculation. It's genuinely how he feels, and he's leading with his heart on it.\"",
      "Another observer had a different take: \u201cThis whole fiasco could make Gavin president,\u201d Anthony Scaramucci, the short-lived White House communications director in Trump\u2019s first term, wrote on X Monday.",
      "The obvious pitfall for Newsom is that Trump could take credit for restoring order or, if violence escalates, continue to pour blame on him. Democrats in the state say that they believe Trump is intentionally sowing discord and that Newsom's best political move is to do his job well.",
      "\"The most important thing he can do is show he can manage a crisis,\" said Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. \"Good governance is always the best politics \u2014 to just show competence contrasting with Trump\u2019s chaos.\"",
      "Trump has deployed 700 Marines to Los Angeles to support the roughly 300 National Guard members already on the ground. The president had already ordered the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops. It remains to be seen how the courts will come down on California's lawsuit.",
      "The relevant law allows the president to activate the National Guard domestically in order to quell a foreign invasion or a rebellion against the U.S. government, and Trump, calling protesters \"insurrectionists,\" declared the demonstrations a \"rebellion.\"",
      "The California attorney general argues in the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Northern California, that Trump has illegally usurped the authority of the state by fabricating a rebellion and that the presence of guard forces\u00a0is exacerbating tension between protesters and law enforcement officers.",
      "The powers to deploy the National Guard are divided between presidents and governors, with state executives generally controlling when they are activated within their own state \u2014 as opposed to being deployed to foreign wars.",
      "Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, said in an interview with NBC News that governors routinely work with the White House, regardless of party, to mobilize National Guard forces for a variety of tasks, including the response to natural disasters. At times, governors have asked presidents to deploy guard forces to restore order in their states during riots. But not since the Civil Rights era has a president called up the National guard to enforce the law over the objection of the state's governor.",
      "Democrats say that it's up to state and local law enforcement to keep the peace and that there was no need for Trump to federalize troops \u2014 especially without the consent of the governor.",
      "\"Gavin's mad as hell and he should be,\" McAuliffe said. \"This is the governor's responsibility, not the president's.\"",
      "Bennett flagged concerns about introducing the U.S. Marines into the situation, saying they are not trained in controlling crowds of Americans.",
      "\u201cThis is a very, very dangerous thing,\" Bennett said. \"God forbid, if they hurt somebody \u2026 that\u2019s real trouble for Trump. But [we\u2019re] not rooting for that.\u201d"

It\u2019s a great way to learn about how people live, the climate and the types of ingredients that they have access to,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd maybe it\u2019ll also make you more open-minded towards the world overall.\u201d"

      "\u201cAt the beginning of wedding planning, I really rejected the concept of being walked down by a man to be handed to another man,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom also walked herself down the aisle, so in a sense, I guess we are creating our own tradition for the women in our family.\u201d",

      "Matt\u2019s vows focused on their smaller, intimate moments: \u201cIt\u2019s the conversations at 3 a.m. when we both can\u2019t sleep, shrouded in darkness of night, and thus able to speak more openly to one another. The whiskey in our yard on Friday nights after a long week. You mean the world to me. Thank you for coming into my life. I love you.\u201d",

      "She told W Magazine after their engagement why Kaplan was able to change her mind about marriage.",
      "\u201cWe had a really great dynamic early on that I didn\u2019t have in previous relationships, which is the amount that we communicate \u2014 even over communicate \u2014 about difficult things. Having that foundation of honesty and trust allowed us to get through things in life that made it so I couldn\u2019t envision anyone else by my side. On top of that, we have this insane chemistry.\u201d",
      "She said he\u2019s also \u201cso supportive\u201d of her career, in contrast to her past partners: \u201cA lot of men in my past were really intimidated by my success. They tried to suppress what I was doing or make me feel bad about it.\u201d",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Jun 2025 19:20:09 GMT",
    "summary": "Mark Hamill talks about his role in \"The Life of Chuck\" and why the Stephen King movie might make you cry \"tears of joy.\"",
    "story": [
      "Mark Hamill's new film is probably going to make you cry, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't see it.",
      "\"It's tears of joy because it reaffirms your belief in mankind,\" Hamill explains in a sit-down interview with TODAY.com.",
      "The movie? \"The Life of Chuck.\" It's the latest project for the \"Star Wars\" actor, who plays Albie Krantz, the wise grandfather of Charles \"Chuck\" Krantz. Chuck is a man whose life is chronicled in reverse by four different actors: Cody Flanagan, Benjamin Pajak, Jacob Tremblay and Tom Hiddleston, who portrays Chuck as an adult.",
      "Based on Stephen King's 2020 novella of the same name, it's a serious departure from the writer's typical horror genre, although  Hamill says it's still got a few of King's signature trademarks, including supernatural and apocalyptic elements.",
      "\"It's certainly nothing like Stephen King has ever written before,\" says Hamill. \"He's done 'Green Mile' and 'The Body,' which became 'Stand By Me,' but even by those standards, this is unlike anything he's done.\"",
      "Also starring Chiwetel Ejiofor, Mia Sara and Karen Gillan, Hamill says \"The Life of Chuck\" is \"indescribable\" but so profound \u2013 and good \u2013 that he asked if he could \"go out on the talk shows\" to encourage viewers to \"please see it. Trust me, you'll thank me later.\"",
      "If audiences at the Toronto International Film Festival are any indication, he doesn't have to worry. After premiering at the festival, the film took home the People's Choice Award and has since garnered rave reviews by many critics, some of whom called the film one of the year's best.",
      "\"It's so positive. It's so optimistic about life,\" Hamill tells TODAY.com. \"It also teaches you there are moments that, in life, you think are trivial that collectively become very important.\"",
      "And if \"The Life of Chuck\" leaves people in tears, Hamill says it's because a movie \"this original\" only \"comes along once in a lifetime.\"",
      "\"I just loved it,\" he says. \"It's wonderful.\"",
      "'The Long Walk'",
      "\"The Life of Chuck\" isn't Hamill's only collaboration with King. The actor also appears in the upcoming film \"The Long Walk,\" a horror movie based on King's 1979 novel of the same name (published under the pseudonym Richard Bachman), starring Ben Wang, Cooper Hoffman, David Jonsson and Judy Greer, among others.",
      "\"The premise is just ghastly,\" he says of the film. \"It is more in the mold of what you associate Stephen King with.\"",
      "Less of a supernatural movie and more straight-up horror, \"The Long Walk\" takes place in a dystopian future and revolves around a group of young men who are chosen, a la \"The Hunger Games,\" to participate in a walk that only ends when everyone dies, except for a single, indomitable winner.",
      "\"The rules are simple: You walk until only one is alive,\" explains Hamill, saying that if walkers lag behind, fall to their knees or deviate from the walk in any way, it's \"a bullet to the head.\"",
      "Based on its grim premise, Hamill says his initial reaction to the role was, \"Not only can I not be in this, I don't think I can see it.\"",
      "But given that Francis Lawrence, the iconic director of \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\" and \"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay\" Parts 1 and 2, along with other notable films including the sci-fi classic \"I Am Legend,\" was at the helm of \"The Long Walk,\" Hamill says he reconsidered.",
      "\"I really admire him as a director,\" he explains, saying that after a call with Lawrence he changed his mind. \"By the end of the Zoom call, I said, 'Well, I've got to do it.' And my boys, of course, read it and said, 'Dad, this is great. You've got to do it.'\"",
      "Hamill plays a military major, or as he puts it, \"a badass guy,\" but says the true stars of the movie are the young actors he worked with, calling them the \"heart and soul\" of the movie.",
      "\"I was so impressed. These are all the young actors you're going to see in the future.\"",
      "'I Owe the World to Mike Flanagan'",
      "As for his own future, Hamill says he's loving \"every minute\" of his career right now and hopes to work on more projects with Mike Flanagan, the director and screenwriter of \"The Life of Chuck.\" Flanagan also created such notable series as \"The Haunting of Hill House,\" \"Midnight Mass\" and \"The Fall of the House of Usher,\" in which Hamill played Arthur Pym, a shadowy figure known as the \"Pym Reaper.\"",
      "\"It's the first time I've ever been asked to play something so far from myself on camera,\" he says of the role. \"Because I was playing a sociopathic, soulless, evil lawyer.\"",
      "Having done voice work for decades, Hamill says it's a role that would have been routine if he had done it as a voice-over, but he is grateful to Flanagan for giving him the opportunity to do such a \"juicy\" role in front of the camera.",
      "\"I owe the world to Mike Flanagan. That's why I'm so loyal to him. That's why I jumped at 'The Life of Chuck,'\" he says, continuing, \"He's just wonderful.\"",
      "As for what's next, Hamill says he's got yet another, undisclosed project in the works with Flanagan, but for the moment remains firmly focused on ensuring that audiences come out to see \"The Life of Chuck.\"",
      "\"You realize that human beings are inherently good,\" he says of the film's takeaway. \"And in this atmosphere of division and anger and uncertainty, it's exactly the right movie at exactly the right time.\""

      "The woman directed them to the home\u2019s primary bedroom, where they raked through drawers, cabinets and the closet, police said. The nanny told police \u201cthey took numerous watches, jewelry items, and shoes that they put into bags,\u201d according to the police report.",
      "She was ordered to keep her hands up and face toward a mirror, police said. At one point the shorter man threw her to the ground and put a boot on her ankle, then on the back of her neck and took her phone, she told police.",
      "The nanny started to scream and was pinned against a wall, with the shorter one holding her mouth shut, the police report said. She tried to kick the shorter one in the groin but was unable to see so she bit onto his hand hard, causing him to let go. The nanny then ran out of the home and knocked on numerous neighbors\u2019 doors before someone opened the door and let her call police, the report said.",
      "The men were gone by the time police searched the home and removed the children, officials said. Family arrived and took the children to a nearby residence.",
      "A passerby told a responding officer that they had seen a man wearing all black running westbound through the yards north of the home.",

And though her stories always featured LGBTQ+ characters, (in a 2018 tweet, Schwab notably said all characters in her \"Shades of Magic\" series \"should be presumed queer unless stated otherwise\"),\u00a0she didn't lead with her own \"queerness,\" she says.",
      "\"I didn't want to do anything that would limit the growth of readership,\" Schwab says.",
      "The result was that \"no one ever thinks I'm gay,\" she reflects now. She thought she didn't mind. If blending behind the pseudonym of her initials meant someone may read her books, not knowing the breadth of identities ahead, and learn something? Better than someone not picking up the book at all, she says.",
      "In 2020, Schwab told her coming out story publicly in an essay for Oprah Daily. But it wasn't until her latest novel, \"Bury Our Bones in the Midnight Soil,\" out June 10, that she felt comfortable living, being, existing in that story.",
      "\"What I didn't predict and what turned out to be true is the catharsis of writing this book as a gay person,\" Schwab says. \"I did not realize how badly I needed to write this in order to take up the space of this story.\"",
      "\u2018I Can't Think of Any Greater Gift\u2019",
      "\"Bury Our Bones in the Midnight Soil\" follows three women across a 500-year period, with alternating perspectives. The book opens with 10-year-old Maria in 1500s Spain. We next meet Alice, a college first-year in 2019 trying to face her anxiety at a party. Within pages, both Maria (who later renames herself Sabine) and Alice describe themselves \u2014 or who they want to be \u2014 as \"feral.\"",
      "Then there's Charlotte, or Lottie, born in 1800s England, who knots their stories all together.",
      "All three start as young women chafing against their circumstances, until another woman arrives. (Sabine encounters a widow passing through her home of Santo Domingo, Charlotte encounters Sabine, and Alice encounters Charlotte.) Their stories are different, but end the same: Each woman leaves dead \u2014 specifically, as a vampire.",
      "Schwab was inspired by the \"classic\" vampiric lore \u2014 \"everything from 'Carmilla' essentially up through Anne Rice,\" she says.",
      "\"If you go back and you look at these classic vampires, they're inherently queer, they're inherently liminal, they represent knowledge and the danger of being exposed to an alternate potential future,\" she says. \"And the idea is that once you're exposed, you can never go back to ignorance.\"",
      "A longtime love of vampires was just one of the \"ingredients\" that went into \"Bury Our Bones.\" (\"I see my stories as a meal,\" Schwab explains.) Other themes include queer love throughout history and collateral damage, first explored through what Schwab had long been taught about one-night stands.",
      "\"I'm an only child, and for some reason, my parents thought the way to keep me safe growing up \u2014 I remember this coming in at like, 13, it was a lesson for my future \u2014\u00a0was to never have a one-night stand,\" Schwab says, explaining she was taught that by definition, the act involves being in close quarters with a complete stranger and \"putting yourself in inherent danger.\"",
      "\"I always thought this was a hysterical take,\" she adds.",
      "For Alice's storyline, Schwab followed this lesson to its most extreme conclusion. In the spirit of taking on the mantle of a \"New Alice\" at university, Alice invites a woman (Charlotte) home to have sex ... and wakes up dead, paying the price of Charlotte's desire.",
      "She's robbed of a choice, but she's granted the metaphorical and literal teeth that ensure ultimate survival.",
      "\"I think we spend so much time with male vampires as the lead, and I'm like, 'They don't need it,'\" she says. \"You know who actually needs teeth, is the person who is made to feel small, told to limit their desire, told never to be insatiable, told never to want, told exactly how little they are supposed to take up in the world.\"",
      "To Schwab, the most important moment in the book occurs when Alice in the present day realizes the she has nothing to be afraid of. No, everyone else fears her.",
      "\"The thing about an immortal is that they endure. That is, by definition, what they do. They endure when you shouldn't be able to, and I can't think of any greater gift to give my lesbian women than the sense that they would get to know they would endure,\" she says.",
      "Writing Herself Into the Story",
      "Speaking with TODAY.com less than two weeks before publication date, Schwab says she's feeling \"deep, deep, crashing out in real time-level neuroses.\" Normally she'd be on deadline for her next project, but she purposefully finished a first draft of her next work (\"Victorious,\" the third and final book in the \"Villains\" series) early to be present for the release of \"Bury Our Bones in the Midnight Soil.\"",
      "\"In many ways, this story is about the three eras of my own queer coming out journey, and going from not knowing who you are, to just wanting to be loved, to being unapologetic,\" Schwab says. \"There's just a lot more nonfiction underpinning the fiction than I'm used to.\"",
      "Sabine represents the version of Schwab that was able to write a book like this, she says. Sabine is unapologetic about her beliefs, actions and behaviors, even as the novel's \"villain.\" She's fully realized and uninterested in \"conforming to anyone else's idea of what a life is,\" Schwab says.",
      "\"I think I had to get to her in my own journey before I could look back at my Alice and Lottie years,\" she says.",
      "Alice, the youngest of the pack, starts the novel open about her sexuality but struggling to define herself out of the shadow of her sister. She stands in for a version of Schwab who was trying to find her identity while dealing with the \"whiplash\" of a major event shaking one's foundation. For Schwab, it was realizing she was gay. For Alice, it was waking up a vampire.",
      "Then there's the \"Lottie years,\" or as Schwab calls them, \"the toxic years.\" Charlotte is defined by \"desperately wanting to be loved,\" even at the expense of others.",
      "When asked for one true \"villain\" of her vampire novel, Schwab gives the potentially hot take of Lottie. (\"We do not stan someone who perceives themselves as a victim when they are an abuser,\" Schwab says.) But all three women make terrible decisions and do awful things. That's, too, a reflection of Schwab's experience coming out and her relationship with publishing.",
      "\"For many, many years, even after I had come out, there was a sense that you could not write a queer villain, lest the readership conflate queerness and villainy,\" she says. \"It's such a harmfully reductive take because it suggests that queer characters, and by extension, queer humans, are not afforded the same level of complexity and nuance as their straight counterparts.\"",
      "By embracing a trio of \"messy b----es\" to lead the novel, every page, sentence and word, Schwab says, hones in on one purpose: hunger.",
      "\"I wanted to write a book about hunger in all of the forms that it takes, specifically for women and femme-presenting people and queer people \u2014 the hunger to be loved, to be seen, to be understood, and the hunger to take up space in a world that tries to make you small,\" she says. \"I think that's what I achieved.\"",
      "Returning to 'the Garden' \u2014 and the Easter Egg You Might Have Missed",
      "Before \"Bury Our Bones,\" Schwab didn't think she'd ever put herself \"so clearly\" into a project again. \"The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue\" featured a character named Henry, whom Schwab describes as a character she \"wrote myself into.\"",
      "In the 2020 novel, the titular character trades being forgotten by everyone she meets for immortality. Henry is the first person who remembers her after her deal with the devil.",
      "If Addie and her sense of hope are an inspiration, the story of Sabine, Charlotte and Alice is more about the messes immortal beings leave behind.",
      "\u201cI wanted something a little bit angrier,\u201d Schwab says. \u201cI think that\u2019s just an indicator of my own growth as a person. I think that\u2019s an indicator of the landscape of the world. I just spend a lot of my time feeling stifled or angry or what have you.\u201d",
      "It's fitting then that \"Bury Our Bones\" is set in the same universe as \"Addie LaRue.\" Both are Schwab's take on \"urban fantasy, but in a literary way,\" she says, a world facsimiled of our own that she refers to as \"the Garden.\"",
      "\"I wouldn't be surprised if I revisit this space, because it's a place that I really enjoy creatively and aesthetically,\" Schwab says. \"I can see the Garden growing together and apart and in multiple directions.\"",
      "There's even a cameo from a character in \"Addie LaRue\" in a blink-and-you-miss-it moment more than halfway through the book, told in Charlotte's perspective. The goal is to establish that in this Garden, \"there are multiple kinds of magic and wonder and monstrosity just intertwined with our time and place and our history.\"",
      "Schwab says only eagle-eyed readers may spot the reference. And though she calls it the \"loosest thread\" she'd likely ever tie between her Garden books, it has consequences for the wider story.",
      "\"It has a repercussion if readers stop and think about it, which is that these characters are occupying the same terrain,\" Schwab says. \"They are coexisting in the same landscape. Addie's history has at some point tangled with one of our vampires.'\""

      "\"The Studio\" star was a proud dad on TODAY on June 10 when asked about his daughter and fellow actor Taylor Dearden. She received a host of accolades earlier this year for her performance as Dr. Melissa King on the inaugural season of Max's acclaimed hospital drama \"The Pitt.\"",
      "\u201cWell, Taylor is a wonderful, hard-working actor,\" Cranston said. \"She grew up in this business with my wife and I being actors. And so, we\u2019re so proud of her.\"",
      "Dearden is the only child of Cranston, 69, and his wife of over 35 years, actor Robin Dearden. The younger Dearden's first television appearance came in a role in a 2010 episode of the legendary show \"Breaking Bad\" starring Cranston.",
      "She also appeared in Netflix's \"American Vandal\" in 2018 and three episodes of the Apple TV+ drama \"For All Mankind\" in 2022.",
      "\"When I hear praise for Taylor\u2019s work on \u2018The Pitt,\u2019 it means more to me than anything anyone could ever say to me about my work,\" Cranston told Craig Melvin, who is a father of two. \"You know, you\u2019re a proud dad. And I\u2019m OK. I could retire after you hear that.\u201d",
      "Dearden plays a young resident with a sister who has autism on \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d which details a chaotic and traumatic day in an emergency room at a Pittsburgh trauma center. It\u2019s the first day on the job for Dearden\u2019s character, who is neurodivergent.",
      "In real life, Dearden is neurodivergent, which she spoke about with NPR in April in connection to her role.",
      "\u201cI told them that I relate to this character because I see a lot of the neurodivergent parts of Mel as something I experience all the time,\u201d she said about the show's creator, R. Scott Gemmill, and executive producer John Wells.",
      "She said Wells asked if she was comfortable sharing that part of herself in the role.",
      "\u201cAnd I realized it\u2019s, like, you know, I can mask only so much, and I\u2019m really ready for people to know,\u201d she told NPR. \u201cI tell everyone I meet because there are certain social behaviors that might seem odd. And so I usually have to tell everyone I meet, like, in case I do this, just so you know, it\u2019s not on purpose. So it was great for them to let it be my decision completely. I feel like it\u2019s the right move.\u201d",
      "Watching his daughter's career blossom and spending time with family is what led Cranston to declare in January 2024 that he\u2019s planning to \u201chit the pause button\u201c on his own career. He clarified previous rumors that he had been planning to retire by saying on TODAY that he more just wants to take a break to spend time with his wife and pursue other interests.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been married to the best person in the world for 35 years,\u201d Cranston said at the time. \u201cBut she has been the \u2018plus one\u2019 in this industry, right, and I want to change that. I want to move that out of that kind of imbalance and go away with her and just kind of \u2026 she\u2019s looking forward to having me back, and not having to follow me around.\u201d"

      "\u201cI loved it,\u201d she said. \u201cI came onboard to play Christy, and I had about three and a half months of training. I started eating. I weight-trained in the morning for an hour, kickboxed midday for about two hours, and then weight-trained again at night for an hour.\u201d",

      "\u201cToday\u2019s opinion is a total victory and a complete vindication for Blake Lively, along with those that Justin Baldoni and the Wayfarer Parties dragged into their retaliatory lawsuit, including Ryan Reynolds, Leslie Sloane and The New York Times,\u201d they told TODAY.com in a statement.",
      "\u201cAs we have said from day one, this \u2018$400 million\u2019 lawsuit was a sham, and the Court saw right through it. We look forward to the next round, which is seeking attorneys\u2019 fees, treble damages and punitive damages against Baldoni, Sarowitz, Nathan, and the other Wayfarer Parties who perpetrated this abusive litigation,\u201d they added.",

      "Lively and Baldoni's legal woes began in December 2024 when Lively filed her sexual harassment complaint against Baldoni for his alleged behavior on the set of \"It Ends with Us,\" which was primarily shot in New Jersey.",
      "Since then, the high-profile case has been filled with legal twists and turns that would be at home in a Hollywood courtroom drama.",
      "After Baldoni sued The New York Times in December 2024 for the newspaper's story about Lively's complaint, Lively initiated litigation against Baldoni the same month in a federal court in New York.",
      "In January 2024, Baldoni sued Lively for defamation. The following month, the actor and director launched a website about his lawsuit with Lively that included text messages between the two stars as well as between Baldoni and Reynolds.",
      "In February, Lively amended her sexual harassment complaint to suggest she wasn't the only one on the \"It Ends with Us\" set to accuse Baldoni of misconduct.",
      "The case is set to go to trial on March 9, 2026."

      "\"Mine was horrible. It was ... sorry, baby,\" Ellis jokingly said to his wife about his proposal. \"But basically, I knew I was proposing. We were on vacation. We were in Bali. I had the ring with me. I took it everywhere with me. I kept it in my backpack, as we were like, adventuring around Bali, and I didn't know what day I was going to do it.\"",
      "Ellis first planned to propose on Dec. 31 in honor of New Year's Eve, but the pair ended up getting sick. So, his plan was nixed while they spent the next two days knocked out and lying around the house, but it led him to another idea.",

I thought we were just going to be here together. I thought it was just going to be me and you,'\" he said.",
      "\"And I reach in my backpack, and I'm like, 'Is this what you want?' And she goes, 'No! You will not propose to me like this!' So I stuffed ... the ring back in the bag, and somehow, we have a beautiful day,\" he continued.",
      "And about 24 hours later, the pair were watching the sun go down on a beach, recommended to him by his castmate Miles Teller.",
      "\"I'm just like panicking, freaking out and she turns and she like looks away to look at the sunset, and as she looks, I reach in my bag and I pull it out and she turns around and I say, 'Can we do this again? Will you marry me?' And that was it,\" he said.",
      "Jenna was delighted by the story: \"See? Even bad proposals end up OK! We all have them.\"",
      "Ellis and Senicar tied the knot in 2022 and share two children together: Nora Grace and Noa Gray."

    "story": [
      "As U.S. and Chinese negotiators meet for trade talks in London this week, a primary concern for Washington will be whether Beijing eases the flow of rare earth materials, which have become key components of modern life.",
      "China dominates the global supply chain for rare earths, mining about 70% and refining 90% of the materials used to produce everything from wind turbines and defense equipment to electric vehicles and car seats. The United States produces virtually none of the world\u2019s rare earths, whose extraction can be devastating for the environment.",
      "That economic vulnerability has come into sharper focus since April, when China imposed export controls on seven strategic rare earth metals and related magnets amid an escalating trade war with President Donald Trump. Companies, especially automakers and business associations in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere have sounded the alarm, warning that China\u2019s rare earth restrictions risk delays that could bring manufacturing to a halt.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told CNBC on Monday that U.S. negotiators in London were seeking a \u201chandshake\u201d from China on rare earths after Trump said last week that Chinese President Xi Jinping had agreed to resume their flow in the first call between the two leaders since Trump returned to office.",
      "\u201cThey were kind of releasing them, but it was going a lot slower than some companies believed was optimal,\u201d Hassett said.",
      "In an editorial Monday, the Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua said the rare earth export controls were not a \u201cshort-term bargaining chip\u201d for trade talks but a responsible policy aimed at preventing rare earths, which have both civilian and military uses, \u201cfrom being used in activities that threaten international peace and security.\u201d",
      "\u201cImposing export controls on strategic resources with clear dual-use characteristics is a common international practice and a legitimate right of sovereign nations to safeguard their own security,\u201d the editorial said.",
      "Signs of hope have appeared in recent days. On Saturday, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it was open to talks on rare earth export controls, and that it \u201cfully considers the legitimate needs and concerns of other countries.\u201d"

      "Austrian Interior Minister Gerhard Karner said at a news conference Tuesday that nine lives were \"taken from us, including six females and three males.\" He added that 12 people were injured. Graz Regional Hospital said a woman who was wounded later died of her injuries.",
      "Police added that they had identified the suspect as a 21-year-old man from Graz, adding that he appeared to have died in the bathroom by suicide.",

      "\u201cSolving conflict through violence should never be a part of our lives,\u201d Stocker said, adding, \u201cOur schools have to remain spaces of peace, where our children can learn and grow without any danger.\u201d",
      "Styrian State Police Director Gerald Ortner said Tuesday that police received emergency calls from the location of the incident around 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. E.T.) and arrived within a few minutes. A special task force and an ambulance were also there, he added.",
      "Earlier in the day, Austrian police confirmed the incident was no longer active in a series of posts on X after they carried out an operation at the school.",

      "The victims were taken to the nearby Helmut List Hall events space for emergency care before they were transferred to a hospital. A meeting point was set up for the students\u2019 parents at the ASK\u00d6 football stadium, police said on X.",
      "While Graz is Austria's second-largest city, it is still relatively small compared with major U.S. cities, with a population of around 300,000.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, police asked the public to \u201cstay away from the area\u201d and to \u201cstrictly follow the instructions of the emergency services.\u201d They added that they had set up a platform for tips or other observations.",
      "In a statement on X, Austrian President Alexander van der Bellen said \u201cthere is nothing that can ease the pain at the moment, which the parents, the grandparents, the siblings, the friends of those killed are feeling.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese were adolescents, who had their whole life ahead of them,\u201d he said. \u201cThis horror cannot be put into words.\u201d"

      "The vessel departed as Israel allowed a trickle of aid into Gaza after lifting a widely condemned blockade that had barred the entry of food, medicine and other vital supplies for more than two months.",

      "The GHF's centers have been intermittently closed over the week after dozens of Palestinians were shot and killed near its operations.",
      "Gaza has a population of around 2.1 million people, so the meals the foreign affairs ministry referenced would, over the course of two weeks, equate to roughly a third of a meal per day for each member of the population.",
      "Before the war, more than 500 trucks had been entering Gaza daily, according to the British Red Cross and other humanitarian groups.",
      "Thunberg, a climate activist, said the mission was essential amid global silence on Israel's actions in Gaza.",

      "The Houthis announced the attack via their al-Masirah satellite news channel. They said the attack targeted docks there, without elaborating.",
      "Late Monday, Israel issued online warnings to Yemenis to evacuate from Ras Isa, Hodeida and al-Salif ports over the Houthis' alleged use of seaports for attacks.",
      "\u201cThe port is used to transfer weapons and is a further example of the Houthi terrorist regime\u2019s cynical exploitation of civilian infrastructure in order to advance terrorist activities,\u201d the Israeli military said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "Hodeida also is the main entry point for food and other humanitarian aid for millions of Yemenis since the war began when the Houthis seized Yemen's capital, Sanaa, in 2014.",
      "The Houthis have been launching persistent missile and drone attacks against commercial and military ships in the region in what the group's leadership has described as an effort to end Israel's offensive in Gaza.",
      "From November 2023 until January 2025, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually.",
      "The Houthis paused attacks in a self-imposed ceasefire until the U.S. launched a broad assault against the rebels in mid-March. President Donald Trump paused those attacks just before his trip to the Mideast, saying the rebels had \"capitulated\" to American demands.",

      "It\u2019s unclear how the Houthis will respond now that an attack has come from the sea, rather than the air, from the Israelis.",

      "A Burmese American woman was eager to bring her siblings over to the U.S. from Myanmar amid a more than 15-year wait for visas. She\u2019d been hoping to reunite with them since the 1990s, during military rule in her home country, so her brother\u2019s family could start a life in the U.S. But a day after she bought the plane tickets, President Donald Trump ordered a travel ban that included Myanmar.",
      "The woman, 51, and her husband, who were granted anonymity due to fear of retaliation, had sponsored her brother and sister-in-law to immigrate to the U.S. The siblings were then were hoping to bring their own adult kids, too, so that they wouldn\u2019t have to fulfill mandatory military service in the country\u2019s active civil war.",
      "With the travel ban in effect Monday, they said the policy has a heightened impact on people from war-torn countries like Myanmar who had hopes of finding sanctuary in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating because we were on the cusp of securing their safety to leave that situation,\u201d said her husband, 57, adding he felt like a \u201crug got pulled out from under us in an instant.\u201d",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Trump\u2019s policy is in the \u201cbest interest of the American people and their safety.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis commonsense, country-specific travel restrictions include places that lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates, or fail to share identity and threat information,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThe restrictions fulfill the President\u2019s day one promise to protect American citizens from dangerous foreign actors who may come to the United States and cause us harm.\u201d",
      "The travel restrictions, announced on Wednesday, completely bar entry to the U.S. for people from Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, in addition to those from Afghanistan, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. Other countries, including Cuba, Laos and Venezuela, are under partial travel restrictions.",
      "According to Trump\u2019s proclamation, several of the countries on the list had declined to accept the repatriation of their nationals while others had visa overstay rates that the administration deemed \u201cunacceptable.\u201d A few countries lacked \u201cthe competence of the central authority\u201d for issuing passports, the proclamation said.",
      "Jackson also pointed out a section in the proclamation that allows for applications for refugee status.",
      "\u201cNothing in this proclamation shall be construed to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, refugee status, withholding of removal, or protection under the [international Convention Against Torture], consistent with the laws of the United States,\u201d the proclamation said.",
      "However, after he took office, Trump limited refugee admissions for almost all countries including Myanmar. And in May, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to revoke the temporary legal status of more than 500,000 immigrants that was granted by the Biden administration. Those immigrants came from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and are now subject to deportation.",
      "Myanmar was among the nine countries in the latest proclamation that Trump also targeted during his first term. In fiscal year 2023, the U.S. issued 13,284 visas to the country, with business and tourism permits making up the most common types of visas. Myanmar recorded 1,384 overstays that fiscal year, equating to an overstay rate of almost 30%.",
      "The new travel ban comes as Myanmar\u2019s violent military regime fights to hold on to power after it seized control from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in a 2021 coup. Since then, violence has escalated across the region as the military clashes with ethnic minority rebel groups and pro-democracy militias.",
      "\u201cJunta forces have slaughtered thousands of civilians, bombed and burned villages, and displaced millions of people,\u201d Tom Andrews, United Nations special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar, said in a press release earlier this year. \u201cMore than 20,000 political prisoners remain behind bars. The economy and public services have collapsed. Famine and starvation loom over large parts of the population.\u201d",
      "Under the new travel ban, anyone who obtained a visa prior to the policy is still able to come to the U.S. But there\u2019s confusion over how the restrictions will be implemented and enforced. The Burmese American woman and her husband are among those with concerns, particularly as there have been several cases of lawful permanent residents and citizens being swept up in the dragnet of Trump\u2019s immigration policies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s terrifying to think that they could be randomly picked up because somebody had a bad day at the office, or somebody didn\u2019t do their job or didn\u2019t believe that their visa was true,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite frankly terrifying.\u201d",
      "For the woman, reunification with her brother has been a long time coming. She became a citizen in the late 1990s and began the process to help bring her sibling over a few years later. At the time, Myanmar had been under the control of a strict military junta that held power from the 1960s until 2011, and for decades had kept the country in a state of extreme isolation and deprivation. She said her brother, whose children were just a few years old then, hoped to come over and root his family in more stability.",
      "\u201cTheir circumstances in Myanmar at that time were very, very bad. That was the system that I grew up in. There was no future for them, no prosperity,\u201d the woman said. \u201cMy brother was concerned for his children\u2019s future and education.\u201d",
      "Amid moves and address changes, the couple said they never received the standard letter notifying them that the woman's brother had been able to progress in his visa process. They assumed the wait was a product of notorious immigration backlogs. It wasn\u2019t until the situation in Myanmar intensified again in recent years that the couple found out that the brother was close to finally being able to immigrate. But by then, the woman said, her brother\u2019s kids had aged out of the system.",
      "According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, those who turn 21 before being approved for legal permanent resident status are no longer considered a child for immigration purposes and need to file an entirely new application, prolonging the green card process.",
      "At this point, the woman said, her brother and sister-in-law said they were willing to risk possible detention to come to the U.S., particularly if it meant easier access to the American immigration system that would enable them to fight to get their children to come over as well. However, with Myanmar\u2019s military draft in effect, the family is particularly concerned for their safety now that the travel ban adds another barrier to leaving.",
      "\u201cThe reason they wanted to come here was for their kids,\u201d the woman said of her brother and sister-in-law. \u201cNow, it\u2019s really hard to bring my nephews here to save their lives.\u201d",
      "Quyen Dinh, executive director of the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, said the bans are ultimately another part of \u201cthe engine of Trump\u2019s mass deportation machine.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s focused on demonizing immigrant families and communities by denying them family reunification, that we all rightfully deserve to be whole \u2014 especially now, when the world is more dangerous than ever,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "Rather than protecting individuals\u2019 safety, Dinh said, she believes Trump\u2019s policy punishes those who need an escape from dangerous conditions.",
      "\u201cIt perpetuates the violence that is happening across the world, as opposed to creating conditions for peace or humanitarian relief, and for these families who\u2019ve been separated,\u201d Dinh said.",
      "She also said she views the ban as evidence that the U.S. is misunderstanding its role as a humanitarian leader.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got people who are legitimately trying to escape a civil war,\u201d the woman's husband said. \u201cNow, because of some arbitrary decision by the Trump administration to pick a certain number of countries \u2026 without consideration of the actual cases, without an exception policy, it hurts them. They\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d"

Some are placed in hospitals in the Dominican Republic and occasionally the Cayman Islands. But there are currently five open surgical slots in the U.S.",
      "\u201cSome of them might be able to wait a few months, and others, if they don\u2019t go now, they\u2019re going to pass away very quickly,\u201d Robinson said.",
      "The president\u2019s executive order adds that the secretary of state can issue exemptions for visas in cases that \u201cserve a United States national interest.\u201d It is unclear if clients of the International Cardiac Alliance with medical needs would fit into that description. Neither the White House nor the State Department responded to a request for comment on the matter.",
      "\u201cWe do have kids die every week waiting because there\u2019s not a lot of international slots for these kids,\u201d Robinson said.",
      "Some of the children in the program travel directly from their home country to the U.S., undergo surgery, and then return to Haiti. But for many Haitians, international travel requires multiple levels of logistical wrangling, Robinson said. Some patients and their parents who can secure surgeries in other countries must apply for a visa to the U.S., travel here, and then head to their eventual destination. The United States\u2019 travel ban now throws a wrench in that process.",
      "Fabienne Rene, 16, was diagnosed with rheumatic heart disease in February. Because of her condition, Fabienne, who lives in Port-au-Prince, cannot even attend school since she experiences shortness of breath, said her father, Fignole Rene. The \u201cbad news\u201d he received about the travel ban causing the postponement or potential cancellation of his daughter\u2019s travel through the U.S. to the Dominican Republic is \u201creally disturbing and breaking my heart,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI was not waiting to hear something like that,\u201d Rene, 53, said in Creole through a translator. \u201cWe know for sure that there is nowhere in Haiti we can have this possibility. The only option that we have was just waiting to have an open door from the Cardiac Alliance.\u201d",
      "He also said the news will be troubling for his family to hear and that they don\u2019t know \u201cwhere they will find another open door that can give her a chance.\u201d",
      "Robinson said the U.S. Embassy in Haiti recently informed him that it most likely wouldn\u2019t be able to issue any visas due to the travel ban. In the past, the embassy has repeatedly issued visas for Haitian children to travel to the U.S. for care. The office of Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., has offered to reach out to the State Department to see if the children can receive exceptions, he added.",
      "Dr. John Clark, a pediatric cardiologist at Akron Children\u2019s Hospital in Ohio who has worked with the ICA, said many children in impoverished countries like Haiti suffer from Fabienne\u2019s condition because they are not seen by a doctor and treated for the common illness strep throat. Untreated, recurring strep infections can lead to rheumatic heart disease.",
      "St. Damien Pediatric Hospital in Port-au-Prince received visiting pediatric surgical teams from 2015 to 2019, Robinson said. Now, dangerous conditions in Haiti prevent doctors from other countries from entering or providing care. Meanwhile, Haiti does not have enough doctors practicing there, and the loss of opportunities for a medical education in Haiti only perpetuates the problem, Clark said.",
      "Clark participated in a surgical mission there in 2019, when visiting U.S. doctors were performing two heart surgeries per day, he said. A drastic rise in gang violence \u2014 including an attack on one of the hospital\u2019s ambulances and a worker being stoned to death \u2014 ended most medical missions to Haiti.",
      "Gang violence has only escalated since then, United Nations figures show, particularly after the assassination of Haiti\u2019s President Jovenel Mo\u00efse in 2021. Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world, and more than half of Haitians live below the poverty line. The country is also plagued with government corruption, gang violence and food insecurity, as well as vulnerability to natural disasters, including a devastating 2010 earthquake that killed at least 220,000 people. Lack of adequate health care also fuels diseases like cholera, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\u201cI hope things can calm down one day enough that we can get back there [to Haiti],\u201d Clark said. \u201cBut right now, there\u2019s no way for us to go back down.\u201d",
      "Andrice Boncoeur of Port-au-Prince received free open-heart surgery at CEDIMAT Cardiovascular Center in the Dominican Republic to repair a valve when he was 9 years old. That procedure, however, was only meant to be a temporary solution. Now, plans for Andrice, 16, to travel through the U.S. for more permanent surgery have been disrupted.",
      "On Thursday, Andrice\u2019s father, Andre Boncoeur, said he had not yet told his son about the travel ban preventing him from passing through the U.S. Boncoeur said he knows \u201csomething can change at any time.\u201d",
      "Still, children like Andrice do not have much time to wait. In April, Andrice was once again hospitalized for three days at Haiti\u2019s Centre Hospitalier Eben-Ezer for heart failure. Boncoeur said his family has spent \u201ceverything that we had\u201d and that their funds are \u201calmost gone.\u201d He said he hopes the situation will change so that his son, who aspires to become a pastor, \u201ccan have a chance to live his life as a normal kid.\u201d",
      "Clark, Robinson and the patient\u2019s parents all agree it comes down to the Trump administration\u2019s willingness to accommodate the sick children.",
      "\u201cThese children are somebody\u2019s child and somebody\u2019s grandchild  and they don\u2019t have access to lifesaving care,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIs there any room for compassion?\u201d"

      "Iran said Monday that it will soon hand a counterproposal for a nuclear deal to the United States in response to a U.S. offer that Tehran deems \u201cunacceptable,\u201d while U.S. President Donald Trump said talks would continue.",
      "Trump made clear that the two sides remained at odds over whether the country would be allowed to continue enriching uranium on Iranian soil.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re just asking for things that you can\u2019t do. They don\u2019t want to give up what they have to give up,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cThey seek enrichment. We can\u2019t have enrichment.\u201d",
      "Earlier, Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said Tehran was preparing a counteroffer to the U.S. proposal that was presented in late May. He said there was no detail about the timing of a sixth round of talks.",
      "While Trump said the next round of talks would take place Thursday, a senior Iranian official and a U.S. official said Thursday was unlikely.",

      "The U.S. official said the talks, led by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, could be Friday or Sunday, possibly in Oman or Oslo.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. proposal is not acceptable to us. It was not the result of previous rounds of negotiations. We will present our own proposal to the other side via Oman after it is finalized. This proposal is reasonable, logical, and balanced,\u201d Baghaei said.",
      "\u201cWe must ensure before the lifting of sanctions that Iran will effectively benefit economically and that its banking and trade relations with other countries will return to normal.\u201d",
      "Reuters previously reported that Tehran was drafting a negative response to the U.S. proposal. An Iranian diplomat said the U.S. offer failed to resolve differences over uranium enrichment on Iranian soil, the shipment abroad of Iran\u2019s entire stockpile of highly enriched uranium and reliable steps to lift U.S. sanctions.",
      "Last week, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dismissed the U.S. proposal as against Iran\u2019s interests, pledging to continue enrichment on Iranian soil, which Western powers view as a potential pathway to building nuclear weapons. Iran says its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes.",
      "Trump said Iran was the main topic of a phone conversation he had Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu\u2019s office said the president had told him talks with Iran would continue at the end of the week.",
      "During his first term in 2018, Trump ditched a 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and six powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran\u2019s economy. Iran responded by escalating enrichment far beyond that pact\u2019s limits.",
      "Iran says the West has turned a blind eye to Israel\u2019s nuclear program even while pushing against Iran\u2019s. Israel neither confirms nor denies that it has nuclear weapons.",
      "Baghaei said sensitive Israeli documents, which Iran has previously promised to unveil, would demonstrate \u201cthat parties constantly questioning Iran\u2019s peaceful nuclear program actively work to strengthen Israel\u2019s military nuclear program.\u201d",

      "\u201cNew York is probably culturally the best testing ground for an international brand to expand into, especially a Chinese one,\u201d said Bernstein Senior Analyst Danilo Gargiulo, citing the city\u2019s diversity and large base of young consumers. \u201cBut it\u2019s also the most saturated, one of the most competitive markets.\u201d",
      "Chinese chains combine budget pricing with unusual flavors that often blur the line between coffee and bubble tea \u2014 jarring to purists but extremely popular at home. Luckin said its alcohol-infused latte, developed with China\u2019s leading Moutai liquor maker, sold more than 5.4 million cups on its first day in 2023, generating over $13.7 million in sales. The company launched 119 different items in 2024 alone.",
      "Luckin has built its business around technology, allowing customers in China to order and get deliveries through the country\u2019s ubiquitous WeChat app, replacing the traditional cafe experience with hyper efficiency. The company also runs large coffee-bean roasting and processing operations in China to help drive down costs.",
      "The question is whether this will work in America.",
      "Luckin and Cotti did not respond to requests for comment from CNBC. On an earnings call in April, Luckin\u2019s co-founder Guo Jinyi said the company plans to \u201cadopt flexible, locally tailored models\u201d to steadily expand overseas. Slowing growth and intense competition in China has pushed companies to seek opportunities beyond its borders.",
      "Coffee price wars",
      "From electric car makers to food delivery platforms, large-scale Chinese companies often follow a familiar strategy: burn cash, grab market share, worry about profit later. This helps them grow fast, but can infuriate global competitors.",
      "In the latest sign of increasing competition in China, Starbucks on Monday said it will lower the prices of dozens of drinks in the country by an average of $0.70 this summer.",
      "In New York, Cotti is selling drinks for 99 cents to first-time customers who download its app. Over time, analysts estimate that Luckin and Cotti will still be cheaper than Starbucks in the U.S., but the gap will be narrower than it is in China.",
      "Manhattan may share major Chinese cities\u2019 love for efficiency, but businesses there face New York wages and may need to accept additional payment options, adding to costs, said Allison Malmsten, China strategy director at Daxue Consulting. Tariffs on Chinese businesses may further erode their supply-chain advantages, she added.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a long list of things that could potentially drive the price up,\u201d Malmsten said.",
      "If Luckin\u2019s New York debut proves successful, the company could venture further afield. HeyTea \u2014 a Chinese chain known for topping its teas with foamy cream cheese \u2014 landed in New York in late 2023 and has since spread to Boston, Seattle and Los Angeles.",
      "Despite tensions between Washington and Beijing, Gen Z and younger Americans tend to perceive China differently than older generations, who may associate Chinese products with lower quality, according to Malmsten. Bargain coffee from Chinese chains could also appeal to New Yorkers facing rising costs on everything from groceries to coffee beans.",
      "Still, coffee shops that run on thinner margins need volume, analysts say. This means appealing to a wider range of customers.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s perceived as being only a touristy or exotic adventure, then it\u2019s not going to become part of your day-to-day consumption, it\u2019s not going to become part of your morning routine,\u201d Bernstein\u2019s Gargiulo said."

      "LONDON \u2014 Washington\u2019s European allies must make a \u201cquantum leap\u201d in military spending to deter Russia, the head of NATO said Monday, calling for a 400% increase in the continent\u2019s air and missile defense budget.",
      "NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte\u2019s comments are among the organization\u2019s strongest yet as it tries to improve Europe\u2019s insufficient defenses against Russia while also avoiding the political ire of President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cThe fact is, we need a quantum leap in our collective defense,\u201d Rutte said at the London-based think tank Chatham House. \u201cThe fact is, we must have more forces and capabilities to implement our defense plans in full. The fact is, danger will not disappear even when the war in Ukraine ends.\u201d",
      "Trump's clear signaling that he would like to at least significantly reduce decades of American military support for Europe has sent its nations scrambling to beef up their own arms industries.",
      "Trump's call for NATO allies to up their minimum defense spending from 2% to 5% of GDP was once seen as outlandish; but last month Rutte too backed this idea and said he expected it to be adopted at NATO's June 24-25 summit.",
      "On Monday he made a similarly ambitious call. He asked for a \u201c400% increase in air and missile defense\u201d and added that \u201cmilitaries also need thousands more armored vehicles and tanks, millions more artillery shells, and we must double our enabling capabilities, such as logistics, supply, transportation, and medical support.\u201d",
      "\u201cWishful thinking will not keep us safe,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot dream away the danger. Hope is not a strategy. So NATO has to become a stronger, fairer and more lethal alliance.\u201d",
      "Rutte's speech comes against the backdrop of European powers vowing to spend more on their military budgets, having relied for decades upon America's protection first against the Soviet Union and now Putin's revanchist Kremlin.",
      "NATO's constituents must also maintain a balancing act when it comes to Ukraine, which is not a member. Kyiv's allies want to support a neighbor it sees as a bulwark against Russian aggression while keeping a White House increasingly sympathetic to Moscow's worldview onside.",
      "Trump has described his \u201cvery, very good relationship\u201d with Putin, a man considered a pariah by former President Joe Biden and other Western leaders.",
      "Many officials and analysts in Europe acknowledge that Trump is right to demand that wealthy nations such as Germany be able to look after themselves without Washington's help.",
      "However, many of these same commentators have expressed their horror at the tactics used by Trump, who has suggested that the United States would not protect underpaying allies and openly invited Russia to \u201cdo whatever the hell\u201d it wants to them.",
      "That risks shattering the central premise of NATO: Article 5 of its founding charter \u2014 an \u201call-for-one and one-for-all\u201d mutual defense promise suggesting that if one ally is attacked, the rest would come to its aid.",
      "The scenario the founders had in mind was that the U.S. would join the fight if Russia decided to launch an act of aggression against a smaller European country. In practice, however, the only time it has been used in the real world was the other way round, when the alliance lent Washington symbolic defensive help after 9/11.",
      "Previous American presidents have always seen this as a good trade off: America underwrites European security, and in return has a huge influence over political, diplomatic and even cultural happenings on the continent and beyond. The soft power return on investment was always seen as a profitable one.",
      "However, Trump has repeatedly questioned this logic, not only undermining the promise behind Article 5 but using hostile language against those historically considered Western brethren.",
      "The realization among European allies that Washington is no longer committed to its mutual defense has sparked a drive to push up defense budgets and revive the long-since dormant arms industry on the continent."

    "story": [
      "The third U.N. Ocean Conference opens Monday, with Britain's Prince William among those raising the pressure on nations to turn decades of promises into real protection for the sea.",
      "The summit comes as just 2.7% of the ocean is effectively protected from destructive extractive activities, according to the nonprofit Marine Conservation Institute. That is far below the target agreed under the \u201c30x30\u201d pledge to conserve 30% of land and sea by 2030.",
      "Atop this year\u2019s agenda is ratification of the High Seas Treaty. Adopted in 2023, the treaty would for the first time allow nations to establish marine protected areas in international waters, which cover nearly two-thirds of the ocean and are largely ungoverned.",
      "Speaking ahead of the conference, Britain's Prince William said Sunday that rising sea temperatures, plastic pollution and overfishing were putting pressure on fragile ecosystems and the people who depend on them.",
      "\u201cWhat once seemed an abundant resource is diminishing before our eyes,\u201d William, heir to the British throne, told the Blue Economy and Finance Forum in Monaco. He described the challenge as being \u201clike none we have faced before\u201d.",
      "\u201cPut simply: the ocean is under enormous threat, but it can revive itself. But, only if together, we act now,\u201d he told the meeting of investors and policymakers.",
      "Mauro Randone, regional projects manager at the World Wildlife Fund\u2019s Mediterranean Marine Initiative, said that \u201cit\u2019s the Wild West out there with countries just fishing anywhere without any sort of regulation, and that needs to change.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe high seas belong to everyone and no one practically at the same time, and countries are finally committing to establish some rules,\u201d he added.",
      "The ocean is critical in stabilizing Earth\u2019s climate and sustaining life. It generates 50% of the oxygen we breathe, absorbs around 30% of carbon dioxide emissions and captures more than 90% of the excess heat caused by those emissions. Without a healthy ocean, experts warn, climate goals will remain out of reach.",
      "The treaty will only come into force once 60 countries ratify it. As of Monday, just 32 countries had. Advocates hope UNOC can build enough momentum to cross the threshold, which would allow for the first official Oceans Conference of Parties.",
      "\u201cTwo-thirds of the ocean is areas beyond national jurisdiction \u2014 that\u2019s half our planet,\u201d said Minna Epps, director of global ocean policy at the International Union for Conservation of Nature. \u201cWe cannot possibly protect 30% of the ocean if it doesn\u2019t include the high seas.\u201d",
      "South Korea, France and the European Union have championed the treaty, but most large ocean nations have yet to ratify it, including the rest of the G20. Thousands of attendees are expected in Nice, from delegates and heads of state to scientists and industry leaders. The United States has yet to confirm a formal delegation.",
      "Beyond new commitments, the conference highlights the growing gap between marine protection declarations and real-world conservation.",
      "France, the conference co-host, claims to have surpassed the 30% target for marine protection. But environmental groups say only 3% of French waters are fully protected from harmful activities such as bottom trawling and industrial fishing.",
      "\u201cThe government declares these as protected areas, but this is a lie,\u201d said Enric Sala, founder of the National Geographic Pristine Seas marine reserve project. \u201cMost of it is political box-ticking. It\u2019s all paper parks.\u201d",
      "That criticism is echoed across the continent. A new World Wildlife Fund report found that although more than 11% of Europe\u2019s marine area is designated for protection, just 2% of E.U. waters have management plans in place.",
      "Fabien Boileau, director of marine protected areas at France\u2019s Office for Biodiversity, acknowledged the presence of bottom trawling in French protected areas, but said it was part of a phased strategy.",
      "\u201cIn France, we made the choice to designate large marine protected areas with relatively low levels of regulation at first, betting that stronger protections would be developed over time through local governance,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, we\u2019re gradually increasing the number of zones with stricter protections within those areas.\u201d",
      "Advocates say industrial fishing lobbies continue to resist stricter protections, despite evidence that well-managed reserves boost long-term fisheries through the \u201cspillover effect,\u201d whereby marine life flourishes in nearby waters.",
      "\u201cProtection is not the problem \u2014 overfishing is the problem,\u201d Sala said. \u201cThe worst enemy of the fishing industry is themselves.\u201d",
      "The conference will feature 10 panels on topics such as blue finance, sustainable fisheries and plastic pollution. Deep sea mining is expected to feature in broader discussions, while small island states are likely to use the platform to advocate for increased climate adaptation funding.",
      "The outcome of these discussions will form the basis of the Nice Ocean Action Plan, a declaration of voluntary commitments to be adopted by consensus and presented at the United Nations in New York this July.",
      "\u201cThere cannot be a healthy planet without a healthy ocean,\u201d said Peter Thomson, U.N. special envoy for the ocean. \u201cIt\u2019s urgent business for us all.\u201d"
